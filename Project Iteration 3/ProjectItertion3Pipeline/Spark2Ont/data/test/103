The sauces are amazing especially the mustard  Pair that with brisket and the best coleslaw I've ever had and I'm a happy camper  Their greens are not my favorite  which is the only reason I'd say 4 stars instead of 5  The owner and his wife are also incredibly nice and make a real effort to know their customers  Their coleslaw and black eyed peas are AMAZING  Been back twice  This place has an awesome name  I think the lady said she was from West Virgina and she lets you try all the sauces and pick a few with your meal  I got the ribs  Eat up  Very cool experience  I wasn't expecting to have to try the sauces before hand but it wasn't bad at all and I also got to choose the sauce I liked  The food was really good but in my opinion a little pricey  The owner was really nice and you could tell he really cared about the product  I would recommend the ribs they were really goodAs far as the cons go  I would prefer the owner not bother us so much  He came out a little more often than I would have preferred  My biggest complaint I had is he kinda made me feel rushed to order  Also he asked me if I want a quarter or half rack of ribs  The half was not nearly enough so I got another quarter  After that he told me most people just get the whole rack because it's the best deal  Well why wasn't that an option at the beginning  That was honestly really frustrating and the main reason for the 3 stars  Don't get any ribs except the whole rack  Don't let the outside of the place fool you  This place has excellent BBQ! It looks like a chain from outside, but they have really nailed authentic southern barbecue  Excellent meat with your sauce on the side  I went with the Carolina Vinegar - the first place outside of eastern North Carolina that I've been able to find someone that does Eastern Carolina style correctly  it doesn't involve mustard in any way  There are some downsides  It's a little pricey, the coleslaw was boring, and there's really no room for seating  That all said, this place will definitely be a regular stop  2 5 stars
I'll start off by saying that this isn't really my style of food. I'm not a big meat eater generally, and coleslaw, mashed potatoes, etc. are not my favorite side dishes. Given my predisposition against such food, I was pleasantly surprised with the quality and taste. I sampled many of the dishes including chicken prepared in two different ways, brisket, pork, coleslaw, cornbread, potatoes, vegetables, and hot sauces. Everything was good!I personally won't be running back, but if you're into this style of food, I would recommend it.
Whenever I sit at a modern communal eating space, I like to pretend that I'm one of the characters in the Matrix movie.  I do this secretly in my mind.  No one else would understand my never ending battle to defend Zion from the horde of soulless machines.**previous sentence was mostly a lie.This place is definitely a bit odd.  It's what I would picture the Beverly Hillbillies would eventually build in terms of layout.  They'd hire some designer named Udo to distill what they love about bbqin', and stick it right next to the cement pond.They have done this amazingly well actually.  Kudos to Udo, as it were.My wife and I took some friends from out of town here after reading about it in an article.  It's the same awesome chef who introduced me to escolar tacos, and has opened Salt of the Earth.  That dude and I are on the EXACT same page when it comes to what I want to stuff in my face.And this place is no different.  Rather than the expansive, ever changing menu of Salt, this place has a sparse menu that focuses on pretty traditional BBQ offerings.  We had the pork shoulder, brisket, fried chicken, and collards, and then...we had fucking Meaty Mac.  I don't know why I never thought to just stick well cooked cuts of pig meat into macaroni and cheese, but I'll assume it's some defense shield that my brain made to make sure that my life's tale would be, "Evan?  What's to tell.  He ate too much Meaty Mac and his heart exploded."Everything comes on a little metal tray with a little gingham placemat. (Rolls Eyes)  It can get to be a little too much.  Kind of like when you're trying to find the bathroom at a Renaissance Festival, and the one dude you asks refuses to understand you until you say whatever some dumb 15th century Florentine would say if THEY had to go to the bathroom.  I peed on that guys doublet FYI.So, yeah.  I really, really loved the food, atmosphere, and it certainly didn't hurt to be there with awesome people.I really don't love sharing my eating space with strangers, but I must say that it does create a pleasant sense of community in this space.I have a feeling that this place is going to get really crazy packed in the summer, so I hope they have a plan to either expand or cycle people through with the utmost efficiency.  Salt of the Earth dude wins again.
I love the atmosphere at Union Pig & Chicken.  Long sturdy picnic tables in lieu of more intimate two- and four-tops.  The food comes on trays as though you just ordered from a backyard grill, cafeteria bbq or food truck on the side of the road.  It's a definite experience.  The prices are up there a bit, not the cheapest place to eat certainly, but the food it pretty good.  With two people we ordered the 2 Meet Combo which comes with, you guessed it!, two meats plus a side, plus cornbread.  The meats we got were ribs and brisket.  The brisket was delightful, fleshy and falling apart with enough seasoning to stand alone but not too much that it didn't benefit from the array of sauces on the table.  A real winner.  The ribs, however, weren't as impressive.  The meat fell off the bone in just the right way, but the outside was tough and hard to bite through and the inside didn't provide the proper texture to make up for that.  They went great with the bbq sauce, but I was expecting more.For our side we got the baked beans and another side of mac & cheese, both top notch.  Devoured them, they were superb.  As was the cornbread.  If you're going to make cornbread a staple of your restaurant, do it right.  Union does it right, moist and compact with excellent sweetness and just the right amount of crumbliness, it crumbles in your mouth, not in your hand or on the plate.Along with our excellent beer, the bill came to a bit much for a simple night out, and the atmosphere isn't quite right for a special date night, so you really have to be in the right mood to go to Union, but if you do, it's not a bad choice at all.
Some of the best BBQ I have had, especially in Pittsburgh. The place offers a very casual dining experience, with very simple decor, long picnic table seating, and food served on cafeteria trays. Don't be deceived by the simplicity of the place, because the food was amazing. The beef brisket sandwich is incredibly tender, and doesn't have an ounce of fat. Their mac n' cheese is incredibly cheesy, and rich, and is some of the best I have had, . To top it all off, the wait staff has been very friendly on ever visit. While the place is by no means cheap, the prices won't burn a whole through your wallet, and the food is definitely worth the cost. I have gone several times for lunch, often getting their lunch special, which includes a sandwich, side and drink all for $10.
Great atmosphere.  The BBQ is delicious.  I have tried all of the items on the menu and I was most impressed with the ribs as they weren't at all fatty, but very tender and not over-sauced.  The brisket is great, but when I was there I thought that the pork shoulder was excessively fatty.  Like I said, great vibe, upscale BBQ joint with some great local drinks available.  The servers were very friendly and helpful with suggestions as it was my first time at the restaurant.  Its not cheap, but in my opinion worth it.
See Rachel C's review which kind of hits the nail on the head.  I came with friends on a Friday night around 7.  Was told 30-45 minutes for a table, which turned out to be more like 15 minutes.  Meanwhile a waitress stopped by and took drink orders while we waited -- nice touch!One thing struck me upon entry:  Why are we in the middle of East Liberty and there are only two...umm....non-White people in the whole establishment?  I'm just sayin, the clientele doesn't at all match the neighborhood.  And this is my neighborhood.  I was skeptical.The potential answer?  The price.  All sides are a la carte at around $3-$5....and that includes a slice of cornbread.   You're gonna pay for your entree ($10-$22) plus a side or two ($5) plus a drink ($9 for a whiskey lemonade).  Not exactly a cheap meal for Pittsburgh.THAT SAID....I wanted to bad mouth this place.  But the food made up for it.  The ribs were PERFECT.  The fried chicken?  The best we've ever had in Pittsburgh.  The brisket was amazing.Bottom line:  We'll be back.  Hell, maybe tomorrow.  Except we left with enough leftovers that lunch is already taken care of.
Wow. There's lots of stuff to like about this place. The only drawback is that you'll probably leave here on a stretcher as the EMTs try to revive you from a heart attack.The ambiance here is not so different from Salt and Cure - it's got that whole rustic industrial thing going on. Again, you have the communal tables from Salt, which isn't a bad thing. However, the acoustics need some work; it can get really loud in here.But who cares, right? Because you came here for the food. First, this is not a cheap BBQ place, so you'd best get over that real quick. That being said, it's totally possible to walk out of here having spent about $20 pp and still have a ton of food leftover for the next night. So, considering that you're really getting two meals out of one, it's not quite as crazy expensive as you might be thinking. However, if you're going to booze it up, which I highly recommend, because their drinks are deelish, you're going to be paying a bit more.No normal human being can eat the three option meal. If you can, well, I hope that you also have an Urban Active or Shadyside X membership. But, it is definitely worth trying; everything here is absolutely delicious. Our group had pretty much every single option: the fried chicken (very good, but I will take Meat and Potatoes fried chicken and waffles over this one), ribs, brisket, pork shoulder. The brisket is by far the best, and is probably just pork belly. The mac and cheese is also a winner, as is the corn bread. We also had the tartare and the pork belly appetizers, and both were delicious (I'd take the tartare over the pork belly). But, it's all almost too much. When I walked out of here, I felt... pretty disgusting. So, I'd recommend that Union Pig and Chicken get something on the menu that is a palate cleanser of some sort. In Chinese cuisine, the tea cuts down on the grease somewhat; you guys are good at drinks, so I'm sure you can figure something out.
Loved the simplicity of it. No frills, just good people and good food. A nice throwback.
I wanted to love Union Pig & Chicken.  I think that I *could* love Union Pig & Chicken.  It's just not quite there yet.  I have been twice: once for dinner on a slow weeknight and once for lunch on a Saturday.  Both experience were good, just not great.The Great:Service - Both visits, our servers were fun and knowledgeable and the food arrived promptly and hot.  No complaints whatsoever here.The ribs - Oh dear, where do I begin?  These racks of shear beauty were tender, juicy, and just fell right of the bone.  No excessive sauce or grease, just pure, meaty heaven.  I especially enjoyed them with a little added vinegary Carolina BBQ sauceThe pork shoulder - A close second to the ribs.  The beautifully seasoned cubes of pig nearly melt in your mouth.The collard greens - Perfectly cooked vinegary, bacony goodness.The drinks - For this lover of savory cocktails, the smoked onion, black pepper, and local maple infused rye on the rocks either alone or with a splash of soda was perfectly executed libational genius.  They also mix up some mean cocktails with Wigle whiskey.The Meh:The fried chicken - Moist meat and good flavor, but the breading came out rather soggy on our first visit.  On the second, there was a bit more crisp going on, but it still was just average.The brisket - Tough and dry with little flavor.  My least favorite thing I tried.  The ambiance - Aesthetically, I love the place.  The picnic tablecloth wall, the rustic, exposed wood walls and beams, the picnic-like long tables.  Because it is so bare, though, it gets really loud.  I am generally not sensitive to noise in restaurants or bars at all, but Union Pig is pretty darn loud when packed.The cornbread - Decent flavor, but quite dense and dry.  The mac and cheese - It had a nice cheese crust on the side, but I found it a bit bland and mushy.  Conclusion:A good start, but there is absolutely room for improvement.  Given the varying reviews for the same dishes (e.g., the brisket being described as very moist by some and tough and dry by others and my experience with very different levels of crispyness with the chicken) makes me think that there is a consistency problem.  It's a new restaurant, though, so I'm hopeful they can work that out.  Overall, a fun place to go with some standouts.  I look forward to my next visit and hope to see it work out some of the kinks.
With all of the great reviews on Yelp and the never-ending self promotion on Twitter, Union Pig & Chicken has been hyped up more than the facebook IPO.  I recently had lunch at Union with a few coworkers and I'll admit, I had pretty high expectations.The first nice thing I noticed about Union is that it has a big metered parking lot in the back.  It's far easier to park here than it's sister restaurant Salt of the Earth.  Stepping out of my car, I was immediately blasted with a glorious aroma of smoked meat coming from the back of the restaurant.As other reviewers have noted, the decor is minimalistic.  Seating options include only two long tables and benches.  The benches are broken up with creates a feeling of separation from other diners. I really liked this arrangement because it creates a finite number of seats that exist at each table (and avoids potential overcrowding).Wanting to get the full Union experience, we had 2 orders of the 3-meat combo (ribs, pork shoulder, brisket), fried chicken, cornbread, mac & cheese, and collard greens.  I also tried one of their signature "Rock & Rye" cocktails.  It was delicious and smokey.Believe the other reviewers that the food here is absolutely phenomenal.  Clearly a great deal of care and time has gone into the food preparation.  The brisket is so tender, you can cut it with your fork.  The rib meat fell right off the bone and had a delicious spicy dry rub.  Everything else was solid.One of the members of our group was a BBQ enthusiast, the kind of guy who reads books on BBQ and has a ton of fancy equipment at home.  He proclaimed Union outstanding.  He pointed out to us that great BBQ cooked long and low temp develops a smoke ring of pink discoloration below the meat surface.  It's supposed to have a great deal of flavor.  Better BBQ has a deeper smoke ring.  He pointed out to us that in our delicious meat at Union, the smoke ring was running deep!My only small criticism of Union is that our waitress undersold us on the amount of food we would be receiving.  Although she told us that the $20 3-meat combo would only satisfy one person, I can assure you that with a couple sides, 2 people can split it and still have some left over to eat for lunch the next day.  Some reviews have criticized Union's price point, feeling it is too expensive for BBQ.  Although it's not cheap, like many things in life, at Union you get what you pay for.  This is not average BBQ.  This is extremely high-end, world-class BBQ. The great deal of time and effort put into the food preparation really shines through.  If you imagine it's like NaCl, but instead of a progressive theme it's a BBQ theme, the price point makes more sense.  I think it's fair and can't wait to go back for another round of delicious BBQ at Union Pig & Chicken.
In my experience, the worse a hole in the wall shack, the better the barbq.  I've never had quality barbq at a nice restaurant before.  Pig and Chicken is the first meal I've ever had (after 27 years of active searching) that bucked that trend like a wild hog!They give you knives with your meal, but they are purely for show, the slow cooked meat they serve is so tender it separates if you so much as look at it.  We ordered the 3 meat combo with Ribs, Brisket and Shoulder, with a very generous portion of each (enough for 2-3 people to share) for $20.   All the different dishes here are so good I highly recommend either getting a sampler, or going with a group of friends so you can try a bite of everything.We really labored, trying to decide which we liked best, but it changed with every bite.  I tend to douse meet in sauce, but this meat was so perfectly seasoned and cooked it didn't need anything!  That said, just for kicks I did try the sauces and they were all homemade and delicious.  Combine the barbq sauce with the habanero sauce for the perfect mix of sweet and spice!  The meat was fatty, but that's just a given with this type of food.  Since the meat was so tender you could just pull the fat off effortlessly.  The cole slaw was great (all vinegar based, no mayo so it wasn't heavy) and the corn bread was perfect for soaking up the leftover sauces and juices from the meat.  The decor, name and food are all simple, straight forward,  and enjoyable.  The inside looks like a clean, trendy manhattan cafe had a love child with a barn in alabama.  They have giant solid wood slab tables for group seating, and multi color distressed wood boards covering all the walls.  The service is extremely friendly and fast (less than 10 minutes from when we ordered until we were served).This place combines the best of both worlds.  The charm and service of a nice bistro with the great food, massive portions and low prices you'd find at a hole in the wall rib shack.  I doubted that any nice restaurant could do BBQ right, but Pig and Chicken has made me a believer!
There are plenty of reviews about Union Pig & Chicken so I wont bore you with more of the same. I will reiterate what some have said though that this is some of the best BBQ around.  I will also reiterate what a few have said that the pick 2 or pick 3's are definitely enough food for two people. We each got our own and nearly finished it all, but were SOOOO full afterwards that we wished  we had shared. We went on a Wednesday night and the place was not crowded, but it was full enough to have others dining on either side of us. Literally everything I tried was good, if not great. My only complaints: the cornbread was a lot drier than I prefer and the beer selection is lacking.
Wow. This one was a treat. Not the best Q I have had in my life (I have family living in Texas), but definitely the best I have had in Pittsburgh. A few weeks ago, my girlfriend and I were going to meet some friends out for dinner and couldn't decide on a place. Our friends suggested Union Pig and Chicken but my wonderful girlfriend, who has the culinary horizon of a picky seven year old, hates BBQ (I know, I know, it's a struggle every day guys). Well now she is gone for the summer on an internship, so our friends and myself tried again tonight. Union has three new fans.When you first walk into Union, the first thing you notice is the family-style seating. The dining room is a relatively small space consisting of four picnic tables with seating for eight at each. I don't mind the seating sitiuation; it lends to the comfortable feel that good Q is supposed to inspire. The walls were a mix of paint (red, pink, and white criss-cross pattern) and reclaimed railroad ties. I love the look of the restaurant. It has that "oooh look! reclaimed wood" effect but because they are largely unfinished railroad ties, they maintain that rough, dirty look and feel of a good Southern Q joint. The decor is kind of a double edged sword however. As cool as the restaurant looks, the hard walls and hard floors creat one hell of an echo, adding to the overall volume of the service.The at Union was what I would best describe as adequate. Our server was nice, attentive enough, and always kept our waters full. Other than that the service was rather unremarkable. She didn't wow me, but she didn't disappoint me either.The only fault I could find with her was that it seemed to take a while for us to get our bill, but to be fair, the restaurant looked a little understaffed and they were busy, so she gets a pass on that. Af far as the food goes, all I can say is "GOOD LAWD DAT"S SOME GOOD FOOD!" to paraphrase my Aunt Mary. We started off with lettuce wraps made of smoked pork belly with peas, cilantro, onions and rare, which I gathered was the highly spicy rust colored dust over the wraps. From bite one I knew I was in  for a good experience. The Pork belly was that succulent melt in your mouth fatty that good pork belly should be. The cilantro, peas, and lettuce worked well with the spicy elements to provide a sweet, herby, spicy, porky bite that I could have eaten all night. For the main course I got the Three Meat Combo, brisket, ribs, and pork shoulder. The three of us also split sides of mac and cheese, greens, coleslaw, corn bread, and potato salad. We couldn't stop ourselves. We fell on it like a pack of ravenous wolves on , well, a dead swine. The perfect porcine goodnesss at Union is unrivaled in Pittsburgh. The pork shoulder was tender and fatty and succulent and basted in a perfectly vinegary saude with hints of mustard in it. Kind of a Carolina Sauce with a little twist.  The ribs were fall apart tender. I pulled the bones out clean and even was able to bend one almost in half. They were rubbed with a wonderfully sweet, smokey and salty crust that mixed so well with the natural fat in the ribs. The final player was the brisket. Sadly, I was introduced to brisket in Texas. The brisket at Union is unrivaled in Pittsburgh, and reminiscent of Texas BBQ, but not quite the same thing.The sides were excellent themselves. The corn bread was a little dry, but it had wonderful flavor and was not so dry that a little butter could't remedy the situation. The greens were maybe my least favorite. The were tasty, vinegary, and had bacon, which makes everything better of course, but they just didn't stack up to the rest of the meal. The coleslaw was great. It was vinegar based, but still sweet with a hint of cherry to it. The potato salad was also fantastic, though a little thin for my tastes. The mac and cheese was my favorite side, it has been since I was a kid. It was cheesey and chreamy with a melty crust on top. So good. If you are like me and you like whiskey, you will not be disappointed with Union's bar menu. They offer a wide selection of whiskeys from around the US as well as a pair of spirits from a local distillery. For those of you who are not into straight rye or bourbon whiskey, Union makes infused whiskeys that are well ballanced between sweet, sour and boozey. For those of you who like no taste of alcohol, the one lady in my group got one of their mason jar concoctions. I tried a sip an I must say were I not such a macho, manly, man with a chisled jawline and a strict diet of red meat, beer and whiskey, I may have ordered one it was that good.The only things that kept me from giving a 5 were the wait for our check and the sauce. The sauce was a little tomatoey and not sweet enough for me.
I'm providing an extra star because I believe, I believe this can be really good.  And, I really like the decor.  So chill and energetic. Lighting is just perfect.However:1. No more drinks in jam jars.2. The BBQ must be very good.BUT, could we blame winter?  Will the hot dry summer bring us delicious BBQ?I'm hopeful.
I ate here last night with my girlfriend and two other dining companions.  I enjoyed the way that the restaurant looked upon entering as it had a communal table set up and a argyle type pattern painted on the wall which resembled a table cloth.  It gave off a feel like you were at a picnic.I started off the evening ordering a Union Manhattan.  When I took my first sip of it I was surprised at how strong the jalapeno flavor was in it as I could hardly taste the bourbon although it eventually came through.  Overall, I enjoyed it, especially the moonshine cherry but my personal preference would be for a little less jalepeno.  For my entree I decided to split the 3 meat combo (pork shoulder, brisket and ribs), meaty mac and greens with my girlfriend.  The meats were all very succulent and tender with the ribs easily falling off of the bones.  I paired everything except the ribs with the variety of BBQ sauces that they had on the table: a traditional sauce, a vinegar based and a habanero based sauce with a combination of the traditional and habanero being my favorite.  The ribs I did not use a sauce on because they already had a BBQ rub on the outside which gave it good flavor.  As for the sides the greens seemed to be cooked a citrusy type of sauce with bacon which gave them a slightly sour and savory flavor.  Finally my favorite part of the meal was the meaty mac and cheese which was a macaroni and cheese with beef brisket cooked into it.  The brisket gave the mac and cheese a hearty smoky flavor and I think it could have been a meal unto itself.  I combined it with the traditional BBQ sauce and loved every minute of it.The bottom line for me is that I would definitely be back here in the future as this was the best BBQ that I have eaten in Pittsburgh.  The food itself deserved 5 stars but as a whole I believe it only deserves 4 stars for a couple of unrelated food reasons.  By the end of our dinner the dining room was so loud that I had a hard time hearing the person across from me talking.  An even bigger issue is that I spent almost the whole time there squinting because the sun was in my eyes.  I was not the only one either and at one point in time I think that most of the restaurant was shielding their eyes from the glaringly bright sun.  The least that they could do is to get some sun shades for their front windows as even the waitress commented on it.
Disappointed. Big time. I'm from Kansas City, Missouri, the HOME and BIRTHPLACE of awesome barbecue. So to hear that Pittsburgh would finally field a good barbecue/Southern foods joint was exciting. And this guy generally does good restaurants. Well perhaps he should have went to KC, Memphis, Richmond, Carolina, and really learned how to do good cue, and good comfort foods. First my wife ordered the fried chicken so she'd have some for the lunch the next day, I ordered the brisket. We both ordered mac and cheese, and I went with cornbread and the mrs. with greens. And we passed the other tables and saw the presentations, to die for. Really amazing stuff. That's where our great impression ended. First the brisket. When it showed up all I could say was "???????" Not only am I a barbecue person by birthright, as a chef I consider myself very good at barbecuing meats. I learned in KC, sure, but lived in DC for 10 years and went to all sorts of amazing shacks in Virginia, NC, SC, MD, and WV. Places that you could smell the hickory from a mile away, paper tablecloths, a pig or two outside, mud parking lots. SO I know good cue.The brisket - cut so thick it wasn't even funny. The brisket was cut almost a half inch thick, I'm not making this up. It was really that thick. Good smoked brisket is very thin, and falling apart from it's tenderness and smokiness. Neither on this one. Not only was it half inch thick, it looked like it had been seared in a skillet. It had been burnt with sauce on it. Sauce was charred to it, and not in a good way. While it was tender enough to eat, that's the only compliment I'll give it. Smokiness was not prevelant. Not at all. Cornbread - cut like a piece of pie, which is fine. It was warm but so hard I could not chew it. I handed it to the server and told her, I can TELL this was microwaved. There is no other way the lower half of slice would be warm and soft, and upper half hot and so hard you couldnt chew. Microwaved cornbread, really? Mac and cheese was cheesy, saucy, and overall good mac. The fried chicken was okay. Not great, not bad. The seasoning they were using made it a touch salty, not sure. Definitely on the soggy side. Not sure I'll go back. Smoking meat can be challenging, no doubt. But cutting it wrong, searing it wrong, ( searing it at all?? It's barbecue brisket!! ) microwaving cornbread, really? I have cornbread on my menu, I don't microwave it. We throw it in the oven for 60 seconds and let it sit near steamtable to keep it warm. NOT HARD GUYS.
Awesome decor, and awesome food! I really enjoyed the different sauces on the table that you could add to your food.  I did the pork shulder, which was so tender and tasty! We went for lunch and were really pleased with our experience!
I LOVE barbecue...or maybe I don't? That's the reality that I was left with when I walked out of Union Pig & Chicken, because If this is the direction that barbecue is headed, then I'm out.First, the atmosphere...awful. Simply awful. The community seating thing might sound somewhat logical...at a picnic...but for a restaurant environment? No thanks. I'll pass on being seated next to strangers and their children while dealing with the difficulty of trying to talk over the people around me. Just because it's a barbecue joint doesn't mean that I don't want at least a little bit of intimacy to enjoy a meal out with my wife. While we were there, the guy next to me spilled his soda all over the table. Luckily, he was the only one who ended up with a wet lap, In reality, I was lucky, considering the giant picnic table we were all sitting at. If his drink spills at a slightly different angle, my jeans would've had nice cola hue to them instead.The industrial interior with nothing but hard surfaces lends to the noise being nearly unbearable. Of course, maybe the noise is meant to distract you from being able to accurately judge the food you're about to eat.I ordered the pork + ribs + brisket meal, while my wife got the half bbq chicken. She added the potato salad as her side and I decided to try the mac & cheese, as well. Now, I love ribs...so much so, that I just couldn't help but dig into them first. Unfortunately, there was so much gristle that no amount of flavor - which there wasn't much of - could distract me from such an obnoxious texture. I ate what I could off of the half rack and moved on to the pork shoulder. Admittedly, this was my first time eating pork shoulder...and I'm pretty sure it's going to be my last. Now, some people might enjoy the fattiness, but this wasn't for me. Most of my pieces of pork were nothing but fat. That foul, blubbery texture on your tongue...if that's the appeal of pork shoulder, the trendy foodies of the world can enjoy it. I'll take the rest of the pig instead. Thanks.The lone highlight of the meal was the brisket. It was the one thing on the tray that had a lot of flavor and actually worked really well with their barbecue sauce on the table, or without. It was tender, juicy, and the only thing that I would recommendThe sides? Well, the dinner bun that comes with your meal looks like it comes from a bag, and I had no interest in it. The mac & cheese was okay, but not good enough to come back for. Overall, we both left feeling incredibly disappointed. While Union gives you a decent amount of food, the quality just wasn't good enough to justify the hit on our wallet, and leaving a lot of uneaten food behind was a huge waste. I give it 2 stars, knowing that some people might like that style of barbecue, but for me, Union has earned itself the status of an afterthought for us.
Pretty sure that the only research behind this place was 1.) watching season one of The Dukes of Hazzard and 2.) reading the label of a bottle of KC Masterpiece.  I've been craving a good barbecue place since I moved to Pittsburgh, and I'm still searching.  Granted, I think my standards are high: I grew up in SC and lived in eastern NC, south Ga., and Kansas City, and my dining partner grew up in eastern NC.  Not easy to please, but I was open.  We both had pork shoulder.  (Go figure - pork shoulder = barbecue in the Carolinas.)  I also had some brisket just to try something else.  The pork comes out in chunks - very good flavor, but the cubes are weird - don't allow it to pick up any grease or sauce.  It's much better if you mash it up into pulled pork and douse it with the vinegar - four stars after you do something that should've been done in the kitchen.  The brisket was, meh.  Both meats were obviously hit with a blowtorch.  Barbecue is about slow cooking - any charring is a side effect - acceptable, but not a key, and too much is, well, too much.  This was too much - some bites tasted like charcoal.  Way too much fat, too.  The fat definitely adds to the flavor, but only when it's rendered and soaked into the rest of the meat - big chunks should be cut away and not served.  (Only the crappy 'cue places down South serve up as much whole fat as this place.)  This seems to be sous-vide, so much of the fat stays whole - not awful, but it gets to be a bit much after 3-4 mouthfuls of straight charred fat.  The sauces need a lot of work, too.  The vinegar needed more spice, more flavor.  The red stuff was pretty flavorless.  The other stuff was just a Caribbean pepper sauce.  Not bad, but the heat overpowered the meat, and it was a bit too fruity.My friend had baked beans on the side.  Bleh - way too sweet and too spicy.  Had a weird flavor that I think I figured out: sweet potatoes.  These tasted like someone mixed beans into a decent sweet potato pie.  (Which wasn't bad until you hit a chunk of hot dog.  Salty meat and sweet potato pie don't mix well.)The high point was the collards - perfectly done.  Most Southern places overcook the hell out of them, and most Yankees leave them leathery.  These were perfect.Sweet tea was about half as strong as it should be.  (A nice mahogany color is close to ideal - this stuff is lighter than cream soda.)  Sweetness was about right for me, but not as sweet as authentic, syrupy sweet tea.  ...And it would be nice to keep a pitcher of unsweetened - every place down South keeps both.  (My friend wanted unsweetened - no dice for her.)The communal seating is just weird.  I only know one barbecue place that does that, and they only do it in one of their several dining rooms.  It's annoying to be dropping $20 on a casual meal and still feel rushed to clear out. For $50 for two, just have some pulled pork FedExed to your door.  (There are a few places in the Carolinas that will happily do that.)*No form of meat stew?  Really?  I mean, if I was a chef, I'd think that would be the area where I could really have some fun.  Giant swathes of Barbecueland have a "barbecue stew": hash in SC, Brunswick stew in Ga., burgoo in KY.  Kinda disappointed that UP&C missed that opportunity - kinda hard to miss if you actually spent any time in barbecue country.**Cornbread was the worst I've ever had, and my partner agreed.  I thought the worst you could do was Jiffy (which isn't bad - the good folks at Jiffy set the floor pretty high).  If you can't get the real stuff right, you pick up a bunch of boxes of Jiffy, at, like $1/box, and follow the recipe - can't go wrong.  Unfortunately, UP&C thinks they know better - tastes like they mixed a bag of cornmeal with some vanilla brownie mix.  I've eaten plenty of cake that wasn't as sweet, but this stuff had a messed-up texture.  The top inch was as dense as a hush puppy, and the bottom inch had the texture of a slab of beef jerky.  The chef should spank his own bare behind for serving this to paying customers.  ...And do it again for charging $3 per clod as a side.
Delicious food! I wasn't crazy about their fried chocked, but the barbecue was good, and the ribs were heavenly.
The food was incredible! The brisket was so tender it was hard to tell you were still eating meat, and the pork shoulder was absolutely awesome.  Both were a little fatty, but nothing you can't work around.The meaty mac definitely took the cake for the evening! So delicious.  Our other side was the greens, which were good.  The cornbread was a little bit lacking (too dry).Their drinks were also excellent.  The coffee & fig infused whiskey was just awesome, and the Yellow Jam-Jar was really tasty combination of curry, Chartreuse, and honey.We split a two-meat plate & two sides, and it we were both full.  We'll definitely be back.
My husband and I consider ourselves BBQ connoisseurs after sampling the best of what Texas has to offer last year, so we were very excited to visit Union Pig and Chicken.  I've read that other reviewers were disappointed in the prices and the portion sizes.  I could not have had a more opposite reaction.  Our friendly waitress suggested the two of us get the choose 2 with a side and cornbread and assured us that it would be enough.  At $20 I have to say this is a steal and DEFINITELY the way to go if you are a party of 2.  We picked the pork shoulder and brisket with a side of greens.  We also ordered an appetizer of pork belly lettuce wraps.  First off, the pork belly lettuce wraps were awesome.  I'll be disappointed if they are not on the menu when we go back.  Our meat came and our waitress explained that the sauces on the table were a spicy habanero sauce, a more traditional BBQ sauce, and a vinegary sauce (she described them MUCH better and gave specific ingredients in each.)  Right off the bat my husband was disappointed that you do not get bread to go with your meat.  That was pretty standard in every BBQ place we've been.  Our brisket was juicy and tender but the fat was very overwhelming.  I understand keeping fat on for flavor and absolutely do not mind a bit of it, but this was A LOT of fat.  The pork shoulder was amazing and my favorite part of the meal.  The sauces were good, but none were "i can't get enough... can I drink this?" good.  My favorite was the spicy habanero which was the perfect level of spice for me but WAY too spicy for my husband (wimp).  It had an awesome burn to it that crept up on me and warmed my whole body up.  A true gem for a heat lover.  The greens were good, but not memorable.  I thought the cornbread was very good but was too sweet for my husband.  I can't wait to go back to try the fried chicken.  The couple next to us got it and it looked delicious.  Also I'd love to try their mac n cheese... well... because I'd like to eat all of the mac n cheese on the planet.  You can definitely find best BBQ in Pittsburgh at Union Pig and Chicken.  We had a high quality meal for a very reasonable price, but it just fell short in a few areas where we had high expectations.
Union Pig and Chicken is okay but not great.  First of all seating is at benches with strangers.  Second, the amount of food served is really for two people, which makes it expensive if you eat there alone.  Of course, one can always take the leftovers home and they do have nice take home containers.  The service was good with friendly waiters, but the meat is fatty.  Even the servers admitted that the meat had a lot of fat.  I ended up ordering fried chicken.  If I were to go back I'd try the BBQ chicken.  Being from the south I'm used to really good fried chicken and P&C has a lot to learn about fried chicken.  The vegetables were very good.  I got freshly grilled corn on the cob and collard greens.  I was surprised to see collard greens in Pittsburgh, but they were cooked like one would get at a good sole food restaurant in North Carolina.
First, an admission: I'm a vegetarian, and this place is all about food that used to be animals. This means every single entre is - for me - off limits.But not to fear, my fellow herbivore friends whose spouses eat meat, a pleasing culinary experience awaits. You can eat solely from the sides menu, and leave a full and happy camper.Check it out: corn bread, potato salad, slaw, mac and cheese. Pick three and enjoy.Someday, perhaps, maybe they'll offer up some seitan options (like my favorite BBQ, Soul Vegetarian in Chicago). But until then, I can deal with one of the best offerings of Southern-inspired side dishes around.
First, a brief rant: Three and a half stars?! What is wrong with you people?!? This place is glorious. Seriously. WHAT DO YOU EXPECT?!? Gah! A brief skimming of the bad reviews leaves me gasping like a guppy out of water - I don't understand the level of expectation that goes into sticking some sustenance down your gullet sometimes. Expensive? Compared to McDonalds, but then I wouldn't have the awesome brisket and pork shoulder omelette the next morning, either. Greasy? Compared to a tossed salad with no dressing, but then I wouldn't have the awesome brisket and pork shoulder omelette the next morning, either, again. Ugly decor? Try "simple" and "fun." Not everything is cloth napkins and candlelight. Loosen up! Not "real BBQ"?!? I'm not going into my "authenticity is an arbitrary measuring-stick" spiel here - I was just there in my review of C. Staples in Youngstown (find it if you really care but the gist: I don't care if it's what you think is "real" BBQ, I only care how it tastes). /end rantBegin review: Came here for a late lunch with some local friends (we were passing through and thus, only temporarily local). The space is made up of two long rows of picnic table-type sittage so, family style. One of us was vegetarian but a good friend, and she survived on the sides offerings and the booze with no complaint. The rest of us feasted on some of the finest smoked meats I've had on either side of the Mississippi: the best smoked chicken I've had outside of my honey's smoker (which isn't a fair comparison I know so: better than High Hat in New Orleans), flavorful ribs (a little dry and not my favorite, but someone else in our party would argue I'm wrong about that), amazing fork-tender pork shoulder, and a good, simple brisket (despite not making the head credits, cow still has a cameo). There are three sauces on the table, but the table could stand a few more for variety and I see no use for the North Carolina-style vinegar sauce but maybe it works for the sandwich options. I have no intention of sullying the pork shoulder with it, though. Actually, none of the meats needed any of the sauces but the other two sauce options were at least thick enough to hang in and add something to the meal. Gluten-free beer, cheerwine, and in-house infused whiskeys (smoked onion, black pepper, and tupelo honey was our vegetarian's choice, I think) are examples of the extensive beverage selection and the sides - asian-style slaw and the baked beans being the standouts - compliment the meats just fine and like I said, our vegetarian had no complaints. And everyone knows that vegetarians are whiners. The locals gave me some backstory about the chef, too, and now I'm eager for our next visit so I can add to my collection of Sousa meals.
If you haven't been since they opened, I'd recommend giving Union another try. Things have changed a lot, it seems.Most notably, they now offer combos: for $20 you can get 2 meats, 1 side, and a piece of cornbread OR all three meats (brisket, pork shoulder, ribs). If you decide to substitute chicken for one of your meats, you can do so for $5. The portion sizes have gotten much bigger (I got an order of brisket just to myself, and it literally would have been enough to feed 3-4 people). And praise Jesus, the Kansas City BBQ sauce no longer tastes like straight ketchup. They also now offer a couple creative appetizer options (things such as pork belly wraps and steak tartare) that are very much in the vein of Salt of the Earth, and the mac & cheese and greens are still insanely good. The cocktail list has been vastly expanded, too. My boozy, peachy Arnold Palmer was pretty delicious.As far as the meats, my favorite is the brisket. Each time I've gotten it, it has been super tender with lots of melty fat, and I love the flavor of the rub. You don't even really need the sauce. The pork shoulder is my second fav, but I was a little let down by the ribs. They have a nice smoky flavor, but were pretty dry and didn't have that fall-off-the-bone quality that makes ribs so great. The ribs are what keeps me from giving Union 5 stars, but otherwise this is a great place for a refined approach to BBQ.
I'm a KSBS BBQ judge, so I'm a BBQ snob.  I really liked the flavor profiles of the food, it was all over cooked.  Mac-n - cheese was bomb.  I think they do better than what I had so I'll go back and try again.
After months of reading the few-star rants about this place, I ended up in Sliberty for a one-woman performance piece at the Kelly Strayhorn (which was shamefully low-attendance for a spectacular performer of her caliber) and needed to have dinner before.  Being on foot with a blind lady meant our walking distance choices were limited. BRGR? I don't think so. So we were flip flopping in deciding between Waffle Shop, Ethiopian, or Pig N Chicken, and we decided to give Pigs and Chickens a try.I have to say...I wasn't expecting to actually be pleased by a restaurant owned by one of the premiere 'foodie' leaders in da burgh. I was expecting a big check for toy food that taste good, but wouldn't fill me up.  I am very happy to report that I was wrong.It is an odd little joint. The atmosphere is a bit strange.  A large open space, with two rows of old style country banquet hall picnic benches, and what looks like barn wood covering the walls. No art to break it up. Just giant walls of brown wood. Felt kind of barn-like, but maybe that's the intent in the theme.  We went at an 'early' time, so there was no crowd, but I would say that the idea of someone sitting on the bench right next to me during a 'busy' time would be a little off-putting, especially considering the girth of many burgh eaters, but then again since no one tends to talk to anyone next to them in the burgh, it might be kind of cool to actually break down that wall, turn to the right or left and say 'Mmmmmm...hi!'The music was 1950's hop music which seemed a little out of place, but it sure was fun, and got my body in an up mood, feet bopping on the floor while I chewed.At first the staff seemed a little typical Pittsburgh uppity bistroid 'disinterested' and aloof. The kind of sloppy wannabeanartist fuzzy captain caveman beard, the sewing spindles in the earlobes...but the waitress who took our order turned that around.  She was helpful, charming, and very polite and made the meal a pleasant experience.And the meal was the MOST pleasant surprise. The menu is limited, and at first seemed a little pricey, with most 'sides' being ala carte, but they offered a couple of combo 'deals', and since my friend tends to (usually) eat like a bird, we decided to split the two-meat combo.  The choices were two of ribs, brisket and pork shoulder, and included one side and a chunk of cornbread. My friend opted for a second side.So we ordered the brisket, pork shoulder, baked beans (and my friend asked the waitress if they were out of a can to which the waitress responded 'Oh GOD no!''), cole slaw, and the cornbread - and two sodas (COKE PEOPLE - HOORAY!).The platter that arrived had bowls individually containing the order, except the brisket which was in a pile on some 'picnic' type paper.  The portions were ample, and every bit of it home made and delicious. Even the baked beans were from scratch, and included fresh herbs to the extent that my tongue couldn't figure out if it was rosemary or sage - which the waitress investigated to find it was thyme. FRESH thyme.  The meats were cooked beautifully, sauced beautifully, tender and juicy. The pork was the fave, as the brisket seemed to lose its spark as the time went by and it cooled off, but I think that's pretty normal for brisket.My friend, the bird, had two helpings of everything, and there were plenty of leftovers to drag with us to the theater until we caught the ride to take them home.That two-meat combo was $20. $2 for the extra side, and the price of the sodas. The bill was just under $30, and we were well fed.Now, bear in mind, it IS called Union PIG and CHICKEN.  It's a barbecue place. I think what perhaps was intended to be another uppity bistroid was leveled off to be an actual pleasant and delicious restaurant experience...for meat eaters.And it was a very smart move, especially for the neighborhood it's in.  Great job.Now, with all of that young wannabeartist air floating around...slap some art on those walls! And keep that food cooking!
Yikes. I spoke too soon. My last review praised the tenderness and smokiness of the ribs. I returned last week, ordered a half rack, and was presented with a hard, charred, clump of inedible carbon and bones.
