I took out the 1/4 slab rib plate with mac and cheese and spicy Kansas City sauce for lunch  The meat fell off the bone but was a little dry and needed something more  I guess why it is accompanied with the sauce to mask this  The mac and cheese was okay though you could tell it was pre-packaged  When I took it out of the container, the mac and cheese was a little cold and held its shape from the container  The sauce definitely made this meal good but if I can enjoy my BBQ without any sauce it is my preferred way  However the woman who was taking my order was incredibly sweet, loved to talk about her business, and was plentiful with sauce samples  The owners are super friendly, and so passionate about their craft that they'll be ladling out samples of their sauces before you've even had a chance to absorb what's going on  The meats are all very good, although the pulled pork can be on the slightly dry side from time to time  Portions are of average size, and they have some interesting local soft drinks  an anomaly in a city where sandwiches are routinely as big as your head and are stuffed with french fries
I don't think it's much of a secret that Salt of the Earth has been serving some of the best cocktails in Pittsburgh for a while now.  Therefore, it's not suprising that if you take one of their outstanding bartenders and put her in another place, there will be great cocktails.I visited Harvard & Highland with a group of friends this past Saturday night.  Arrived on the earlier side, grabbed a table, and ordered cocktails from the very creative list of original creations available.  Overall, the space is small (as big as Union downstairs) but has great floor to ceiling windows that look out on the street corner.  There were about 4 tables on the left, a few stand-up tables, a few wooden beach chairs near the corners, and about 8 seats at the small bar.  Being fairly new, the place still had the nice smell of fresh-cut wood!After our waiter delivered our cocktails, that was the last we saw of him for the evening.  After a long time wondering why he hadn't come back, I saw him in street clothes with a backpack heading out the door.  No other person came by to take our orders.  Getting impatient, for the rest of the evening we had to get our drinks directly from the bar which was challenging because the place was getting more and more crowded.  By around midnight, H&H was jammed packed and there seemed to be only 2 bartenders frantically working.  It was clear they were very understaffed.If Harvard & Highland stays as popular as it was this past Saturday, they're going to need to hire more help.  Their inability to keep up with the crowd almost certainly cost them money (we ourselves would have ordered more had we the opportunity).  I suspect this will change as H&H figure out when they're going to be the most crowded.It's important to note that cocktails are the only thing on the menu.  There's a few non-alcoholic seltzer drinks.  I was surprised there wasn't a selection of high-end bourbon or other hard alcohols if you didn't want one of the speciality cocktails.  There's also no food at all (but Union is downstairs if you want to eat beforehand).  This is a great space with a great bartender and a lot of potential.  I hope that in the future they'll increase their number of servers and offer something to munch on while people enjoy some of the best cocktails in Pittsburgh.
What a tasty little hideaway! It's so secret it doesn't even have signage yet...I was a little confused as to if i was supposed to go into Union Pig & Chicken or if there was another entrance. I went into Union Pig and noticed a brightly lit hallway and made my way upstairs. Thankfully, it wasn't someone's living room I walked into, but a very clean looking bar.It was clean in the sense that it was literally, very clean, but also it had a really clean aesthetic. I think you just expect craft cocktail joints to look like a speakeasy in the sense were it's darkly lite and mysterious.This place is bright with tons of natural light coming through the huge windows, light colored wood and a bunch of fun adirondack chairs lined against the wall. It was like a southern style speakeasy, but without no mint juleps!The bartender was super friendly and definitely knew what he was doing behind the bar. I never claim to be a cocktail expert, but I do enjoy a fancy pants cocktail once in a while! These fancy pants cocktails were divine! In my humble opinion, there are times when I go into these places and I feel like there's just SO MUCH alcohol inside that tiny glass. I want to taste everything equally, I don't need to be falling on my face 20 minutes into happy hour! The cocktails I ordered seemed to be the perfect mix of everything. I tried the Agnatha & Anni, which was bluecoat, yellow chartreuse, lingonberry and grapefruit. It was exactly what I wanted. Totally refreshing and as I said, the perfect ratio of juice to alcohol. I honestly thought it couldn't get any better than that drink. But it did! I also tried the Grandeur & Glory and it may have been better than the first, which I don't even know how that could happen! It was Boyd & Blair vodka, cocchi americano, pear & savory. I have no clue what half those things are but they came together beautifully for another refreshing, not too tart, not too sweet cocktail.Two things to note: They do not serve food from Union Pig upstairs and they don't serve the drinks from Harvard downstairs. They're neighbors that don't play together. I would think you'd want to serve those drinks downstairs or order up some food upstairs, but I'm sure there's a reason behind keeping them seperate. I'll be back... and probably often!
I decided to use a classmate happy hour as an excuse to try this place out. The space is very cool, with the hardwood, large windows, and red chairs. Totally Modern. The cocktail list looked really great, and the ingredients were all of the highest quality. He drinks a whiskey drink, and a cider drink (oh wait, thats a terrible chumbawamba song). I had a whiskey drink (with my new mistress, Rye) "A common plot of land".  It was decent, somewhat reminiscent of a Manhattan. Feel there could have been more of a bouquet of flavors. The gin special was nice. Good times had by all.I love the environment and I am eager to try out all the libations on the menu. I would say its best to stop by for a few cocktails for happy hour or before dinner.
Pittsburgh definitely needs more bars like Harvard & Highland. Sometimes you want to put down the gin and tonic (while delicious) and pick up something with a creative mix of new and interesting flavors.  With the expertise of a REAL bartender (few and far between in the steel city) you can do that here.The ambiance is nice-- a large, open space with huge windows (excellent for people watching too) and a variety of seating options.  I went with a large group and we were able to easily adjust the seating... and the huge red lounge chairs were a definite plus!  The best part about walking into this bar is that to get there you enter through Union Pig & Chicken and therefore get to smell all of the delicious smoking meat as you pass through.  Way to make my mouth water before I even set eyes on a cocktail list!I will be honest, I am no cocktail connoisseur.  At one point while enjoying my first drink and browsing the menu thinking about my second, I actually had to get out my phone and google some of the ingredients just to know what type of liquor was in them!  This place does assume that you know something (or at least more than me, which is not hard) about your spirits. But have no fear- the bartender is super friendly and will answer all your questions-- and I am assuming it doesn't really matter what is in the cocktails anyways because everything was delicious.I started with one of the drinks from the menu (sort of).  A spiced apple cider with option to add liquor = one of my favorite fall drinks.  I asked the bartender what she normally recommends to add other than rum (not a huge fan).  She said they normally do add rum, but instead she could use a butternut squash-infused bourbon. YUM.  For my second drink, I decided to inquire about one of the specials on the board... I honestly do not remember what all was in it but I know it included some kind of brandy and another liquor mixed with earl grey tea and garnished with a sprig of rosemary.  I wish i paid more attention to what was in it because it was AMAZING.  It was a little bit tart and tangy and not too sweet and extremely refreshing.  Will definitely be coming back to try out some more... seems like a great place to hide out during the cold winter months!
Leave your coronas, heinekens, and vodka/cranberries at the door- Harvard and Highland is here to entertain your tastebuds. Harvard and Highland is a bright star in my East Liberty world and is a great bar with wonderful craft cocktails that will match your mood. The menu is diverse and each carry unique tastes. They also get plus points for their creative cocktail names (my fave is S.S. Awesomepants!)I love the space, though it can get pretty loud when the bar's bustling with action (I suspect it's because there are few textile pieces to absorb the sound). The bartenders are attentive and while they have a demanding job description, they have an uncanny talent with keeping tabs on who doesn't need a drink, who is new, and who needs a little patter to decide on a drink.When I walked in for the first time, I had no idea what I wanted to ask for, since the cocktails are deconstructed with ingredients and leave a lot of imagination as to what the final result may look like. Don't be afraid to have a conversation with your bartender to decide on your next drink! I trusted my bartender and let her know what kind of drinks I liked (I usually drink blah blah blah and I'm in the mood for something refreshing/spicy/with a kick please!) She was able to make recommendations based on that  and gave me the High Line (I think that's what it was..but it was on the chalkboard) which I must say was pretty refreshing.I can't wait to come back and taste what else Harvard and Highland has in store for us!
I read about Harvard and Highland in the City Paper and decided to check it out with some friends on a Saturday evening.  We headed up the stairs from Union Pig and Chicken and were greeted by floor to ceiling windows, a bar in the corner, and two eager bartenders.  The drink list changes often, and there are usually 2 special drinks written on the chalkboard next to the bar.  I liked how there was one specialty non-alcoholic drink on the menu (for the non-boozing friends/DDs).  The complexity of the drinks justifies their price and how long it takes to make them.  We all enjoyed our drinks.  I think it's a great place for 1-2 pre/post dinner drinks (unless someone else is buying-then stay all night!).  There is plenty of seating, both at the bars and picnic style tables.  Go check it out!
I went last night and the food was good. We had the 3 meat combo: fried chicken, pork shoulder and ribs.  The latter two weren't fatty at all. For sides, we had the warm potato salad and the mac and cheese. I didn't have much of the mac & cheese, but the potato salad was tasty and had bits of bacon in it. While the food was good, the restaurant was cold, a bit dark, and didn't have much of a vibe. We didn't feel comfortable.
I have been a fan ofthis restaurant, and have recommended it to several people in the past, but had a horrible experience yesterday. I feel strongly enough about my experience that I joined yelp today just to review this restaurant. The food as always was excellent, but the overall experience was horrible. I figured I would avoid the usual long wait that always seems to be the way it is at this restaurant, so I called ahead. I ordered a whole fried chicken and the ribs and pork shoulder. I checked to make sure my order was right before leaving, but didn't think to actually count the chicken pieces. When I got home, I found there was only half a chicken. When I called to explain, I made what I thought were concrete plans to come back at 2 forthem to give me the other half chicken. Well, when I came at 2, no one even aknowledged that I was there for 15 minutes. no joke. I waited 15 minutes for anyone to even aknowledge I was there. When I was finally greeted by the same person who had taken my order initially, who had given me the food the first time, and who fielded my call when I called back, she acted like she didn't know what I was talking about. So after explaining again I was told to wait again. At that point she started bringing out chicken for all trhe seated customers, and other to go orders. I was put at the bottom of the priority list, and literally waited another 10 minutes. I finally went to the back area, and asked for my $ back, and the general attitude was that I was being unreasonable. They handed me my half chicken, no apology, or explanation was given. I felt as if I was bothering them. It was a horrible experience, and it will be a while before I give them another chance. I am very understanding that mistakes hapopen, but feel a little more customer service would be in order especially since I've spent hundreds of dollars there over this past year... very very disappointed!
i was hoping for more from this place based on how it was touted in the city paper. when my uncle and i arrived, the place was packed and based on that i assumed the food was at the least....good. what cant i say? the server was gods second gift to all mankind who was spreading the good news  through his skinny jeans, piercings and smug demeanor  was a shining beacon that reflected all that is wrong with the "new" east liberty. and now the food: if you read this review after eating there dont say i didnt tell you so. it literally is all smoked salt and sugar for 75 dollars. it was so salty that veins popped out of my forehead and i thought i was gonna have a seizure as my 57 year old uncle experienced the same side effects. i informed our server that i couldnt eat the food due to the high sodium content and as opposed to being apologetic and trying to offer something else on the menu, he looked at me as if i had told him about the nude photos of his mother that i have that give me much joy. he walked and came back with the check without as much a thank you. gentrification.....tastes like chicken.
The lack of concept and decor kind of bummed me out as the space felt cavernous and cold.Drinks were good, but not like "omg this is so good you have to try this."The adirondack chair area was... interesting.
The food is marvelous and the atmosphere is very comfortable! Very clean establishment, great service and parking is a breeze.. Harvard and Highland which is just upstairs.. very trendy and don't expect Miller Lite on tap..  this bar is something completely different..  countless specialty drinks..  makes the trip very worth while.. I recommend the "Moscow mule" cocktail..two thumbs up
Had lunch here as part of a work meeting. We had pretty much everything on the menu. Overall I am very impressed. The pork ribs are awesome. The brisket is awesome. The pork shoulder is ridiculously amazing. The fried chicken is great. The price point is very good too, given how awesome the food is.
Can't give it a five-star review as a vegetarian, but this place is pretty awesome.  The husband LOVED his meat combo and we'll definitely be back.  I tried the mac 'n' cheese and the cornbread from his plate, both solid.I had a smoky, lime, soy-flavored butternut squash soup that was really great.  The drinks here are very creative, and quite tasty.  I was kind of bummed that you can't get Harvard & Highland drinks (from the bar upstairs) downstairs until after 10 pm; so I walked up and got myself what I wanted since I couldn't order it from my waitress.Oh well, food is fantastic, atmosphere is fun and the place smells heavenly.  Kinda has me thinking about ending my veggie streak, actually...
I know Kevin Sousa doesn't like food critics. I know a few people on staff here. I really adore one of them and she'll probably strangle me next time I walk in for writing this. She should know I'll come back in spite of all these things. And that she's nice. She's super nice.I think the concept is good. It's all so close to being great. It's great that Pittsburgh is even trying to do this sort of thing. I hear the furniture, sparse and minimalist as it is, was crafted by a local guy who's pretty great at what he does. I don't think the layout works. The benches aren't quite comfortable, you can hear everything everybody else is saying, and it just feels too open and empty. I feel exposed, especially in the Adirondack chairs.I don't feel like I can comfortably chat up the people around me either, my typical tack when sauced or in Pittsburgh and especially when sauced in Pittsburgh. Because the vibe lacks warmth. I don't get a sense they were going for warmth, but I still think there could be a little more warmth. Maybe that'd be resolved by a crowd in the joint. I've never seen more than a handful of people in H&H on any given night of the three I've been there.On the bright side, this openness gives you a stellar bird's-eye view of East Liberty. Above street level, with the Home Depot-facing windows as large as they are, it feels like you're inside a diving bell in the Great Gentrification Sea. You expect to look over and see Jacques Cousteau and Richard Florida toasting artisinal martinis.The cocktails are decent but not quite masterful. I'm used to living in the epicenter of the Brooklynification of America, Brooklyn's Williamsburg neighborhood, and I've some snooty expectations of what a cocktail should be and do. At H&H they're potent though the balances aren't quite right. I'd recommend sticking to the more simple things like straight whiskey or gin and tonics. I'm not a fan of the Wigle whiskey and gin products which seem to be an emphasis on the drinks list. I don't understand why people are going nuts over that stuff. It could be good but tastes like it was rushed to market, sold with the idea of being "un-aged."No complaints about the service. Our waiter has always been on top of his game.
this place was pretty cool! i'd heard of it before and heard good things, but never many details. i went here with my boyfriend on new years day (greasy pork and chicken to cure my hangover? yes please). when we came inside, i was kind of surprised to see how small the place was. we were seated immediately, but i imagine quite the wait on busy days. the seating is just several large tables, so you're right next to your neighbors, which i wasn't a huge fan of, but it does add a cool vibe to the atmosphere.so the server rattled off the special and we were quickly served a big tray of chicken and waffles (a huge breast and leg!) with sides of greens and mac and cheese. i had only recently tried chicken and waffles for the first time, and i really enjoyed it here. the syrup was good, and the gravy was okay, but i couldn't decide which i liked dipping in better. i wasn't a big fan of the greens, and i've had better mac and cheese, but honestly, i'd still get the same meal any day.it was a ton of food and the chicken itself is worth it, cooked well and tasty!
A fantastic BBQ destination.  When I first ate here I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food and the thought which went into the cocktails.  I just went back, about 6 months later I think, and it has grown into one of my favorite spots in PIttsburgh.  Everything we ordered was superb and the new lounge upstairs is really chill.  The brisket is absolutely wild, It's prepared in a big slab fashion I've never eaten before and it was impressive as all get out.  Go to Union Pig & Chicken!
Good ribs, the brisket was fatty. It was hard to trim it because the light was ridiculously low.  Had to poke with a fork to find the edge.  The cornbread was very good. The beans in the baked beans were hard to chew, probably not soaked long enough.  The coleslaw was Ok  not anything special. ( I prefer the McCormick & Schmidt's recipe) The butternut soup was excellent.  The faux checkerboard grease doily ( not really sure what else to call it) failed fairly early in the meal due to the large amount of grease, so I had to be extra careful not to eat paper (UNDER THE RIDICULOUSLY LOW LIGHT).My wife's BBQ chicken was good. It wasn't entirely clear if if it was skinned and the sauce was baked on or if the skin was burnt. In any event it was discarded and the BBQ sauce was used for dipping.  One "OK" vote and one "Meh" vote on the sauce. We're regular Sweet Rays users so perhaps that colors our opinions.A low traffic night so staff service and the kitchen were very quick.Over-priced, to be sure (it's a hip place isn't it ?) but most folks who go here won't need a loan co-signer.As we waited for the payment business, I noticed a chalk board with what appeared to be specials, but I couldn't read it anyway due to the (did I mention) ridiculously low light.We'll probably go again and start with the soup and try some of the other options.
I went here earlier today with my boss - both ordered the pork lunch sandwich. Best lunch I've had in the 'Burgh in a while. The smoke flavor was incredible. Can't wait to go back for lunch. Dinner seems a little steep before the late night menu. Try the brussel sprouts!
It is a small bar above union pig and chicken. The drink menu is small and list of ingredients are strange and difficult to understand. The price per drink is $8-$12. The drinks themselves are good but hardly worth the price. Service is fair.
Food comma!!! We arrived at about 6pm on a Saturday and was told there was about a 30 minute wait so we headed up to the bar. Shortly after ordering some beers, the host came to get us which was a nice surprise. They will transfer the bar tab to your table tab.We were both hungry so we each ordered a two meat combo and a side - my partner ordered pork shoulder and ribs, and I fried chicken and ribs, both mac and cheese. Note, there is a $5 charge if you order chicken with the 2 meat combo so $25, not $20. The ribs had a nice smoke flavor and the meat fell off the bone. I'm not a huge fan of pork shoulder but it was tender and you didn't have to chew the meat. The fried chicken was delicious too - juicy and not dry or bland. The mac and cheese was solid. The corn bread was buttery goodness and moist. We took the waitresses advice and put the available sauces on the table on everything, just to try. The vinegar was okay but their bbq and haberno sauce rocked my palette. We prob should have shared the two meat combo but I'm glad we got our own.The tables are communal and they offer gift cards in any amount. Street parking is only available.
I love BBQ. So I am always eager to try some new q. I was fairly disappointed. This place has the look and feel of a hipster restaurant but unfortunately it tastes like it to. There is no soul.We split the 2 meet combo (shoulder & brisket). The shoulder was a small portion that came in a cast iron skillet. The meat was tender but lacked texture or bark, and it was diced into large clocks. The brisket was a mess. I still can't figure out how they sliced it. No visible smoke ring but you really couldn't tell because the place is dark like a cave.  Again lacking texture, and it was tender but super fatty.  I will say that my wife enjoyed the mac n cheese but the corn bread was overly sweet and greasy. The app menu was great we had fried chicken hearts. My final issue was our service. Our server acted like our table of ten was bothering her although the place was dead that night.  Bottom line is it is Pittsburg, so I should have lower BBQ standards, but this was really lackluster even for Pittsburgh.
I really wanted to like this place, but my experience was really bad. The meat was, no exaggeration, at least 40% fat (brisket). Expensive entrees that come with no sides. My boyfriend got the 3 meat entree. He is a total carnivore, and even he agreed that the brisket was a fatty mess and the ribs were inedible. Whatever rub they put on the ribs tasted like chemicals, and the meat was really tough. Both my boyfriend and I were queasy for the rest of the evening. We shared the mac'n'cheese side - easily the best part of the meal, which is sad for a barbecue place. I don't often post reviews, but I post this one as a caution: over-priced and yucky. Save your stomach and your cash.
Yum.  Hip, unique atmosphere.  Brisket was so flavorful but way too fatty for some people.  Over half of my serving was pure fat, literally no meat.  But that was fine with me actually.  Complaints:  1. someone said this place was good for kids.  I don't know what kids because there is only one high chair in the joint and they do not offer anything but water for children who don't drink soda (which is anyone younger than 10 in my opinion).  Someone with a child who was a little older than ours was using the only highchair and luckily they noticed the situation and gave us the high chair and made their 3 year old sit on the bench seat.  2. Waitress was less than attentive.  I came a little later than he rest of my party (who had went ahead and ordered for me but didn't' get me a drink) she never came to ask what I wanted to drink or if everything was fine.  I flagged her down and while I was trying to order a drink, she did no face me or give me her full attention.
1st visit last evening.... drinks were great!  staff was fun!  Grilled chicken hearts in Pgh?!  They were great too!  Can't wait to return to try all of the BBQ sauces!!!
This was disgusting! Tried the ribs, brisket, fried chicken, mac, and beans. None of it was good most of it was inedible. The ribs were tough and dry, off flavors in the chicken made me question its freshness, the brisket was slimy, and the sides were gross. Do not eat here.
So after a crummy first experience due to the manager altering the late-night hours between us calling and us actually showing up (Grr!), my girlfriend and I gave this place another shot.Short version, this is some delicious food.  I would have appreciated a bit more variety in the sides -- I ordered brisket and a slice of cornbread, my girlfriend ordered meaty mac and cheese, and by God that's what we got.  I would have liked, say, a bit of corn on the cob, or maybe some fries, or maybe even a bit of salad -- something to break things up a big.Still, how hard can I complain?  I got a big damn slice of cornbread and a big damn pile of meat, and my girlfriend got a big damn bowl of mac & cheese with big damn meaty chunks in it; and all of it was delicious.  When we go back (and we most certainly intend to), our game plan will be to order different things and then share a large portion with each other.Recommended.
I was really really torn on whether to give H&H 3 or 4 stars!!  The cocktails are standard quality craft cocktails, but without any frills and nothing particularly spectacular about it.The atmosphere/decor is just ok.  It's very bare and, due to the lack of crowd, empty feeling.  I suppose we did go out for drinks at around 8 on a Sunday evening, but I mean, who doesn't do that? right? :p Service was pretty average as well.  There was only one bartender/staff, but it was sufficient for the small number of people.  He also didn't seem too interested in telling us more about the cocktails and basically told us all the cocktails were great.In the end, we choose the Agnatha & Anni and the August 21st, 1959.  I really liked my Agnatha.  Crisp, tart, strong.  I didn't like all the tiny ice bits in it though, but that's easily remedied as the ice melts.  The August 21st was ok.  I'm not a fan of smoky flavored drinks, but if you are, this one would be a good choice.Overall, I would come back again because it's just too convenient.  Plenty of street parking, closely located, solid cocktails, and no worries about finding a table.
This place is awesome.  If you come here, be prepared to get into a food coma.First, you don't come here to order for yourself.  You come here to order tons of food and have everyone grab what they want.  I had four people at my table and they brought out three trays of food all at once.  We barely ate half of it.  It...was..awesome.  We had pork shoulder, beef brisket, ribs, plain mac and cheese, meaty mac and cheese, chicken, and cornbread.I love everything.  The meaty mac and cheese stood out.  The beef brisket was good.  I just loved it all.  I love the idea of their two store long tables.  if you want privacy, you can eat upstairs where there are smaller tables.  It is weird because upstairs is suppose to be a separate restaurant but I guess they're slowly combining together.I am surprise that there is a restaurant like this in the area.  I live nearby but would have never come to this area.  Some may feel the area is a little sketchy but it is not too bad. I've never seen so many white people gathered in one location in East Liberty.Enjoy.  Eat up.
This was a really chill place to relax, listen to a great DJ and enjoy some really good food. This offers an adult scene with a lounge type atmosphere, exactly what I'm looking for. The music isn't too loud so you are able to enjoy conversation while sitting on the roof and admiring the Phoenix skyline! I've only been once so I'm witholding a 5-star to make sure that it is consistently a good time.
Went to the Lustre this afternoon with a few of my friends and sat at a cabana and it was amazing! Our server Veronika was awesome!   She was super friendly and made sure we were not without a drink the whole day. Great relaxing spot and great service!
