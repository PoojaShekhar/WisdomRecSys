Wallpaper in bathroom was peeling, bathroom was dirty, floors were filthy with spots. I asked the lady about this and she said they put a few new pieces of furniture in the room and called it newly renovated. What?? Who does that? Also, When I checked in the lady was rude and said they were not allowed to put a rollaway in my room even though there was plenty of space AND I had already reserved and paid for it prior to arrival. (As a matter of fact, the reservation required me to reserve it because we had 6 people and it said the max to room was 5 without the rollaway.)  She then proceeded to tell me she called her manager and her manager told her the couch was the \"rollaway\" bed we reserved and argued with me when I explained that a couch and rollaway were not the same. Very rude girl, allowed her kids behind the counter even when she was not there with them. When a customer walks in the door, it is not a very good impression when the first thing they see is a boy approx 10 years old behind the counter. We were very tired when we came in and had to deal with this for 45 min. She finally agreed to bring the bed up, and when we received it, it was tied together with trash bags??  The hall floor was dirty with spots, and we didn't even bother with breakfast. I had to keep socks on my children because the floor was so dirty in the room.  When I received my bill under the door in the morning, they had added another rollaway on to my bill so it had charges for 2 rollaways instead of the 1. When we went to leave in the morning, the same lady was working the front again.I spoke with her about it and she said she fixed it. I asked for another receipt and all she had done was charge $10 less on our bill, and our bill was still showing we had a $10 balance for the other rollaway. At this point, I was done dealing with her and wasting my time. She said her manager would be there soon, so we went to eat and went back in an hour to talk to Que the manager. The front desk lady said Que had come and already left in the hr we were gone but would call me later. This was even more upsetting because we could have been on the road driving. We hung around specifically to speak with her. Overall, this was the worse stay we have ever had at a Choice hotel and we stay at them quite often.

I'm actually going to give D'moes a 5 star rating for a few reasons. Last Friday, me and my 2 brothers left the suns game, and proceed to put a few \"adult\" beverages back. At around 2am, when Haney's shut down, we had an overwhelming craving for crap pizza (its better than our normal Jack in Box at 3am run that usually ends up with someone puking in the drive thru line because the smell of the taco sauce is so amazing). Low and behold, the ONLY spot that was still taking orders (up to 2am!) was D'moes. Now, 1st off - I live at Summitt (by BOB). These guys gladly delivered to me, all the way down there! Major props for that. 2 - They understood me... considering I don't remember ordering the pizza (I woke up to pizza and wings boxes all over my pad, and me saying \"who ordered pizza\" then I burped... wing sauce and vodka is a healthy combo. 3 - apparently, after checking my voice mail, the driver was pounding on our door for about 5 minutes (we were REALLY jamming out to Rock Band, in case you don't know, were pretty awesome. Wikipedia that Ish ladies and Gent's; Kansas City Bullriders). Well, the driver and my door man both called 3 times. I'm assuming the driver eventually came in and grabbed the bass guitar and strummed it out. Maybe he had a slice with us? Who really knows these things. However, I do know that I was insanely impressed with D'moes... from the left overs I ate the next when I could remember. It was pretty darn good.

At each station there is a small illegible at a distance sign of what is available.\n\nMost food is made to order, which is problematic as I had to stand in line for over 10 min with a tray to get my meal, then there was another line to check out.\n\nI ordered the salmon, which is not on the menu but the raw fish was on display. \n\nI ordered the fish and it was slapped on the griddle with a generous amount of clarified butter, there goes the healthy idea. Th fish was over cooked. As a side I selected a grilled vegetable salad that was ok but lacked flavor.

I didn't have much of a problem with drinks, or service until later that night... and that's why I'm taking the time to give this place a 1-star review.\n\nThis is a review about a certain bartender, whose name my friend and I never got, but he said he was Chinese and Colombian. \n\nThe area seems to close down early.... even though there seemed to be a basketball game getting out. The bartender said he was closing up early, directed us to another bar (closed when we got there) hand we found a place nearby. Shortly after, the same bartender showed up at the bar, started drinking with us. I don't remember much about the conversation, except for some lies this guy was telling us, saying that he was running the bar after two weeks of working there, that he didn't live in Phoenix, he lived in New York - later, he forgot that he said that, and told us he lived in the same city in California that we did. \nBy the time the bar closed, I was getting pretty sloshed, and he proceeded to invite himself to our motel room (I thought my friend invited him, and my friend thought I did), and by the time we got to my friend's car, he insisted I sit in the back seat. \nI'll skip some details here, and make a long story short:\n\nI puked on the ride home, so I spent the rest of the night sobering up. The Chinese/Colombian guy kept pushing weed and beer on my friend (who's a lesbian, by the way) and when you're a man, you can tell when a guy is being a sleazeball and trying to get into a girl's pants. It became blatantly obvious that he was waiting for me to pass out so he could do what he wanted, and so I forced myself to stay awake. Again, I'm skipping on a lot of detail here, because Yelp really isn't the place for that.\nAfter he had long overstayed his welcome (which was never offered in the first place), my friend went to the bathroom, and I mustered all the civility I had left to ask him to leave as nicely and non-offensively as possible. To this, he insisted that unless I reimbursed him for the pot and beer he brought (neither of which I personally imbibed) he didn't have to leave. I bit my tongue.\nShortly after, I could hear him talking about me outside when he and my friend were having a cigarette. I snapped, had to get rude with him, pulled my friend inside and slammed the door in his face. \n\nThe point of this whole review is this:\nLadies, watch out for this sleazeball bartender. He'll try to get into your pants by the most disrespectable means.", "type": "review", "business_id": "EmzaQR5hQlF0WIl24NxAZA"},

It is connected to Club Downtown which has two other floors that play latin pop/rock/hip hop and reggaeton. The cover is $10. They are open til at least 3 am (and the other floors stay open even later I think) so that is an advantage over the clubs that close at 2pm. To get to the Palazzo floor, you go in through Club Downtown's main entrance and then go out on the front patio and then back in to Palazzo's dance floor. Ask if you get lost and the security or bartenders will point you there. I like the size of the floor, which is tile. It is not as hot and crowded as other salsa places like Pepins on Saturday. Drinks vary from great to weak (mainly the mixed drinks) depending on the bartender, they do have specials sometimes. As a long time salsa dancer who goes with friends (male and female) but no set partner for the night, it can be hard to find a good salsa dancer here if  you don't already know one. So salseros/salsaholics if you will be going without a partner you might want to try to find at least one good dancer to go with you so you will have fun.  Or if you look on www.azsalsa.net or www.meetup.com (check for Scottsdale or Phoenix salsa groups) there are plenty of socials and lessons where you can meet others if you are new and want to meet other dancers or go out with a group. The music is good but since I go a lot,  I start to hear the same songs over and over. I think they should bring in different djs, rotate them or make sure the music gets mixed up to keep people coming back.  Also note there is a strict dress code - it is posted outside. I know several guys who had to go back home to change cause they couldn't get in. I don't remember all the specifics but I believe some things to note are no hats/sunglasses, tennis shoes, tee shirts, baggy pants, bandanas, etc. I'd say collared shirt (tucked in), nice slacks/pants and shoes and you'd be okay.

The scene is goth and punk, although you won't feel too out of place if you don't fall into either of these categories (I don't).  Think \"The Matrix\" meets \"Blade.\"\n\nThe house DJ here is usually pretty amazing...spinning music like VNV, Wolsheim, and some harder stuff like KMFDM.  The sound system is hot, and the music selections combined with the pulsating, dancing crowd (in more black leather than you've probably seen for awhile in one place) make for a pretty hot environment.\n\nThe vibe isn't always on, as once or twice I've been here fairly disappointed with a predominently poser crowd.  If you happen to get here on an off night, just relax on the stunning back patio with a few drinks and create your own scene.\n\nBut that being said, the club itself is gorgeous, and you're in for a surprise at midnight.  So get here no later than 11 and have a few drinks before the club kicks it up a notch.", "type": "review", "business_id": "SiwN7f0N4bs4ZtPc4yPgiA"},

I wish they would drop the cover charge down or at least offer some drink specials! \n\nThe bar has its own set of problems: I just hate spending $40 on drinks and not even getting a buzz out of it. It's hard enough to tell the bartender what you want over the music, but it's even harder when everything you ask for they don't have (or maybe they think they don't have it because they can't hear me?) Mind you I'm not picky or difficult, I just expect the bartender to know how to make the drink I want or at least stock  2 of the 3 beers I'm asking for.\n\nSolution for the Yelper: If you can, drink before you go.\n\nSeating: Maybe, just maybe, invest in another velvetine sectional or two. Club Pallazzo certainly charges enough for cover to afford a new couch. I like to rest my pretty feet after I'm done dancing and people watch, and maybe I don't feel like going on the patio.\n\nThe Ambiance: The inside is gorgeous. It's definitly the atmosphere that brings all the boot-stomping night owls out en masse. The frescoes on the walls and ceiling sport scantily clad vampiresses looking for a bite, and the velvet curtains that hang from the ceiling to the floor, along with the throne chairs give the club it's regal aire.\n\nThe Music: It's true, they have different DJ's switch off sets. The DJ I like also DJ's at Le Homme on Wed. nights. If I don't like what's playing I head outside for fresh air on the ample patio. But overall the music is good. \n\nI know some people that go every weekend. If I did that, I would be living in the alleyway behind Tranz. I take friends from out of town and occasionally go myself when I want to shake my ass. If I found a place better than Tranz I'd be there.

Quite simply, there's a small bar to the left, a small VIP lounge to the right, and nothing but dance-able space in between. With a high ceiling, liberal use of bright neon blues, mirror'd-shiny surfaces, and sleek furniture, the atmosphere is energetic and cool.\n\nThe DJ, perched in a second floor booth overlooking the dancefloor, played track after track of Hip-Hop, for the most part. [From reading other reviews, I'm not sure Hip-Hop/R&B is part of the regular format. We'd been there the first week of Oct'09.] And so, the girls (Esco, RB, Becca), all talented and passionate dancers, took to the floor, wowing and attracting a perimeter of onlookers.  I danced a bit, broken ankle be darned: it'd take more than crutches to keep me from having a good time with my peeps...\n\nAs I sat for a minute, resting the cast'd ankle, a group of people complimented the girls on their style and dancing; very friendly, flattering gesture.\n\nBy 3AM, it was almost exclusively the 6 of us still on the dance floor being silly, and though we could have danced more, we had liquor at the apartment where the club had made last call around 2am.\n\nFun night and a fun little spot, but I'd suggest going with a group; friendly as people were, I'm not sure how apt this scene is to mingling/meeting/dancing with others. We had smilingly and genuinely asked a group of people watching us (the crew that complimented the girls on their dancing) to join us on the floor, but they didn't.\n\nIf its not your speed, there are two other clubs literally next door.\nAs we left, we noticed Club Downtown next door was *still* poppin'.\n__________________________\nSmoothest \"I got hit on\" moment ever.\nCan't be simply re-told, only re-enacted.", "type": "review", "business_id": "SiwN7f0N4bs4ZtPc4yPgiA"},

When I got back to the shop to pick it up, I was charged $61.34. I questioned the difference between what I was told and what they charged me, and apparently it was $55 for the inspection, plus shop rags, plus tax.  I guess I should have seen this coming?   I have never been charged to look at the car.  And certainly not $62 for a ten minute inspection. \n\nI was in the market for a new mechanic, but this is NOT the one that I will be going with.  They were somewhat surprised that I would fuss at all about the $12 difference.  As if I should have expected a 30% markup from what they told me.  Not a great way to build a relationship.  If they had told me before they took my keys and information about the cost of the inspection, quite honestly, I would have taken my car somewhere else.\n\nBottom line:  I think that if you know you are going to get work done, these guys look really top notch. But be prepared to pay for it.\n\nUPDATE:   I just finished repairing the car myself, and what these guys wanted to charge me $900 for, I was able to do myself for $140.  And that included buying a $20 set of drum brake tools, and a $25 Chilton's manual.  They told me that it would $130 JUST to bleed the brakes, which I did in about ten minutes with nothing but a pair of channel locks.

Because I was not ripped off, everything was explained to me...step by step if needed (and I did need it - ha), nobody in this shop is a douchebag, the other customers are even nice, they don't try to rip off the ladies, they don't try to upsell me crap I don't need unless I ask if there's other crap I might need, and I'm pretty sure if I hadn't been out of town they would've let me seen the damage to my engine and walked me through the process if I'd asked so I could do my nerdy internet search on serpentine belts and motor mounts and all that other crap that was wrong.\n\nI knew they weren't effing with me because when I bought the car a few years ago the creepy dealership supposedly changed the motor mounts. When Virginia Auto Service identified a problem with (and subsequent damage as a result of) the motor mounts, I knew it was true, and I thought about that tug in my stomach I ignored when I bought the car that told me NOT TO BUY THE CAR OR TRUST THIS CREEPY CAR SALESMAN. \n\nSeriously, if you have a problem with something this shop tells you all you have to do is ask and see if they can work with you - find different parts, develop a plan to do repairs in steps...ask your grandpa to come in and hand them wrenches or wipe the sweat from their brow so you can have a discount as they diligently work to repair the vehicle you neglected and ignored for over 2 years knowing full well you were driving a heap. \n\nWhen they quoted me a price over the phone I said \"THERE'S NO WAY I CAN PAY FOR THAT RIGHT NOW. THERE IS NO CHANCE I CAN PAY THAT\" while my head was exploding and my face was melting (at work). I don't know if they want this advertised, but they let me leave my car there for over a month (closer to two months) while I made gradual payments and they did the repairs. My job sent me to BFE Texas and Virginia Auto Service just let me leave it there because it couldn't be driven. That's effing CLASS, folks.\n\nBecause they are so awesome I tell everyone I know about this experience, I write positive reviews whenever I get the opportunity, and I will not be taking my crappy little car anywhere else.", "type": "review", "business_id": "M-MFa0YErVBbFW2IJhGJmw"},

For once, I was ready to go bright and early so that we could make the six-hour drive before the holiday weekend traffic got to be too terrible. My car, unfortunately, had other plans.  The battery, which I had purchased less than a month prior, decided it didn't want to work.  We suspected it was a bad connection to the terminal but couldn't be sure. Instead of driving to Checker Auto, I decided to take the car a couple blocks away to Virginia Auto.  I have a few friends who regularly take their vehicles here for service, so even though I had never utilized their serviced, I felt confident about taking my car in.\n\nAt 8am, their small lot was already packed, and I snagged the only available spot.  We walked in and were helped right away.  The very nice lady at the desk asked if I'd made an appointment ahead of time and I explained our situation.  She said they had quite a few other cars in with appointments but she would see what she could do.  We sat inside the small lobby and chatted for a while before she came back in.  My brand new battery was dead.  It had been completely drained!  She said they could put the battery back in and we could go back to Checker to have it replaced or they could install a new battery for me.  Not wanting to take a chance on another bad battery, I decided to have them take care of it for me.  Not more than 20 minutes later, they had finished!  I wasn't thrilled about having to pay more than I wanted to, but it was worth every penny.  After we got to Texas that afternoon, my very car-savvy Dad looked at the  car and said the battery had been installed very well - it was in securely and everything had been cleaned up really well.\n\nI need some serious maintenance done on the car, and I will absolutely be taking it in to Virginia Auto.  As soon as I do, I have no doubt I'll be coming back to this review to change it from a 4-star to a 5-star review.\n\nThank you, thank you, thank you, Virginia Auto, for taking such great care of me and my car and allowing us to head out of town for a few days without worrying about my car!", "type": "review", "business_id": "M-MFa0YErVBbFW2IJhGJmw"},

They made no attempt to up-sell me on anything, including brakes, which the dealership had coincidentally told me would \"definitely be due\" on the next service visit (my brake pads were on the good side of fine when VAS checked them). Everyone seems very honest, and friendly, and while I don't know about the prices for major repairs, it's good to know that they'll only be charging you when you really need work done (unlike the dealer).

But here's the summary: they're a good, dependable local business that has earned their strong reviews. \n\nOriginal review: \n\"My car died on a Sunday. I had AAA come out and do a diagnostic.  I was hoping it was just a battery problem, and they could fix it and be done with it. The AAA guy worked with my car for almost an hour, but the starter was shot, so I had to have it towed.  I decided to have it towed to this shop because it's around the corner from my house, I like to support local businesses, and all the reviews were so positive.  Robert called me early in the morning and he was initially very friendly.  He told me they would do a diagnostic test for $64.99 and call me back.  I declined the test (because two different AAA guys already told me the problem), and his response was deeply patronizing: \"Wow, well, if you feel confident that *you* know the problem, sure I can give you a quote for the starter.\"  His quote was $500.  I called a couple other shops, including my trusted mechanic in Tempe, who all quoted me around $300.  I called back and asked if $500 was the best they could do.  Robert offered me a different starter (\"it's decent, and it just has a 1 year warranty\") for $414.  I understand that all shops have different prices, but I am disappointed. I won't be giving them my business.\"\n\nUpdate:\nShortly after I posted the review, the owner of the shop (Matt) called to discuss the situation. We chatted, he took down some information, and called me back later in the day.  We talked for a long time about labor costs, parts and vendors, how shops arrive at estimates, etc. He was professional and courteous. I haven't yet decided whether I will ask them to fix my car; I'm updating the review mostly because I agree with Matt's replies to other comments below -- that price quotes alone aren't worthy of bad reviews and that if we have a mechanic we like, we should stick with them.  I left a bad review because I didn't like the way Robert spoke to me *and* because the price quote was dramatically different than other places. I felt exploited because I was vulnerable -- my car was towed there and I was stuck. (I couldn't go to my mechanic because he was too far away and I was running between my two jobs.)  I'm fixing it because Matt has a lot of integrity as a shop owner and I'm grateful he took the time to research the situation and offer me a better solution.  In yelp-speak, everything is A-OK, and I would recommend them to others.", "type": "review", "business_id": "M-MFa0YErVBbFW2IJhGJmw"},

My truck had been shuddering and shaking badly at certain RPMs & speeds. The dealer diagnosed the problem as my catalytic convertor and replaced it. After driving my truck for a day, I could tell the problem was not fixed and even felt worse.\n\nRather than go back to the dealer, I thought it was a good time to sever ties and try some place new. They had to keep my truck a few days to fully diagnose and repair the issue and actually took the time to drive the truck, first to recreate the problem, then to be sure it was fixed. Doesn't seem like a big deal, but the dealer clearly did not do this. They kept me updated throughout the process (what tests they were running, possible causes and next steps), offered me rides to and from the shop and a loaner car when they had to keep my truck a few days. Turned out to be a spark plug issue, adding to my frustration with the dealer, as the technician there had even written, \"probable spark plug issue\" on my receipt/work order, yet failed to fix it. However, their lack of follow through and poor customer service forced me to find these guys, who I feel like I can trust, so all is good in the end.\n\nI went into the situation a little standoffish because I knew my fix would be expensive, but I left feeling good about the service I received. They also warranty their work, I believe it's 2 years/24,000 miles? I've been to other shops that will fix your car for cheap and do a quick-fix repair that will mask or even fix issues for a time.

Of hearing about it, finally, we decided to walk over and pick up some food.\nthen I read some of the yelp reviews and almost changed my mind. The reviews were pretty bad: several reports of poor service and the -the most alarmingly one of all - pointing out how bland and flavorless the food was. also, there were descriptions of it being a cool baby type place with haughty staff and incompetent servers. Did the tempe pita jungle servers moonlight at wild thaiger?\nI was surprised because all the times I drove past it - before realizing how popular it was - I thought it looked typical of a thai/asian place. The name was silly and cheesy, and the giant purple banner that takes up almost the entire front of the unsuspecting cinderblock rest. has just the eyes of a tiger staring at you from their very purple perch. How can this place possibly be too-cool?\nI checked out their web site (which I was surprised to find they had one as this place looks pretty hole-in-the-wall) so we could order ahead and walk to pick it up. the site was pretty slow and I almost gave up, but I was pretty stoked on the options and the prices. Grilled peanut chicken? Sounds great. Spicy chicken curry, I'll take it. tiger prawn salad, ok. All for about $8?? Sounds pretty reasonable. I went with the curry chicken and the spring roll (all lunch items come with either soup of the day or the roll - unless your taking out, as they won't/can't do soup to go.)\nOff we went and when we walked up I was surprised to find that the ramada-like, large patio with high walls and iron bars took up the entire front of the building. We had to search around for the hidden entrance. Once inside it was busy with a downtown business casual crowd, but a scurrying waitress still held the door and asked if we wanted a table (for the record she was not in skinny jeans, flats and sporting tons of eyeliner and a fauxhawk, as I figured she would be).  We walked up to the bar to collect our food and pay, and the lively atmosphere made me sad we were going back to the office and not eating there. the bar area had a flat screen tv, there was lively if a little over-the-top Asian pop music, and the healthy crowd was a nice change of pace. Alas, we were in and out (they were not even put out by our asking to split up the to go order so we could each pay separately, even though they were obviously busy) in under 10 minutes.\nThe food stayed pretty hot for the 15 minute walk back, and they double bagged each Styrofoam box -thank god, as half my curry sauce came out of the box. It smelled great and the veggies looked good, but I braced myself for disappointment. Perhaps because I was expecting it to be bad, I was pleasantly surprised. It was pretty good. Mine was just enough spicy as is (for me, though and I'm a wuss - so If you're into hot-hot-hot, ask to punch it up a notch or three) and the serving was plenty for the price. The veggie spring roll was great - not even soggy from the trip, how did that happen? I think the curry sauce was a little thin, but it wouldn't keep me from ordering it again - my coworker's ginger chicken sauce looked thin as well, but she said it was still great. The tiger prawn salad had green, fresh lettuce (looked like a spring mix) and came with lots of scrimps that were \"fat and juicy.\" However, they listed that the salad came with crispy wontons, but her box was sans any wontons - really the only foil in the entire experience.\nAll in all I would say it was a score. The three of us agreed that it would make a good HH spot.\nIt's no yupha's, but certainly better than thai basil - and not a chain. Plus they were still busy, busy despite being smack in the middle of the light rail cluster fuch on central - they must be doing something right!", "type": "review", "business_id": "KPoTixdjoJxSqRSEApSAGg"},

The prices were not rock-bottom, but I am always willing to pay a little more for good food and larger portions, both of which Wild Thaiger offers. The papaya salad was refreshing and really authentic, although the shrimp were a little fishy for our tastes. The soup we had was also very flavorful and best of all, the chicken in it was actual pieces of chicken breast (often, the chicken in soup is small pieces of dark meat). The Mussaman curry was also a lot better than most places we have had it - often, restaurants use pieces of flank or strip steak, but a more authentic version, like the one we had here, has more stew-like cuts of almost-braised beef. Also a real winner were the spicy clear/glass noodles with vegetables and chicken. And lest I forgot alcohol - the crowning glory of any meal - the specialty drinks offered seemed like they would be too sweet or weak, so my sister and I got Cosmos.

Now that the rail is almost up and running and getting to Wild Thaiger isn't such a chore, I went with a group of 6 to try this place out.\n\nWhen you walk in you immediately notice how dark it is as the lighting given off by candles and the kitchen in the back.  I've been to plenty of restaurants that do this to set the mood of the place so I don't mind candlelight.  However, this place was almost pitch black at times to where I couldn't see my dish so they could improve on the lighting a little bit.  The booths are small and set up very nice if you're just out on a date with your special someone.\n\nThe menu selection isn't vast but has all the usual suspects (curries, noodles, tofu dishes, etc.).  I had the chicken and potato dish with yellow curry with some cucumber and pepper veggies on the side.  While the presentation was very nice, the dish itself was just okay.  Almost everyone in the group I was with also had a currie dish and agreed the presentation was more impressive than the taste itself.  The one gal who got a noodle dish however said hers was terrific.\n\nMost of us got dessert to finish things off.  I got a slice of the mango cheesecake (very tasty).  Another person got the lemon ginger cheesecake and was very happy.  Everyone else got slices of the chocolate cake (which were HUGE by the way).\n\nThey also have drink specials on Monday and Wednesdays.  We went on Wednesday for $4 wine glass night.  I was gung ho to try a sip of the red Thai wine, but strangely the waiter strongly recommended against it.  I has a Shiraz instead which was fine.  Most everyone else got a white wine.\n\nOverall, the service was a little bit slow (especially getting us our check), but it was adequate.  The waiter was knowledgable about the nuances of each dish (which was good because two people in our group never had Thai food before).  Amazingly, when we originally sat down, the restaurant was just about dead.  But after 8:30pm the place was packed!  Not sure if this is normal, but seems like alot of the folks who live in and around the downtown area needed a late Thai fix.\n\nBottomline, good, but I've had better.  I commend Wild Thaiger and their people for surviving the onslaught of light rail construction that no doubt crippled their business.  Based on what we've seen, this place had a pretty solid local following so clearly they've done something right.  This place is okay if you're looking to go out with a group, but I'd probably enjoy this place more if it was just me and my girlfriend.", "type": "review", "business_id": "KPoTixdjoJxSqRSEApSAGg"},

It was a 30 minute drive from Laveen, as all are the Thai places in the area.  I ordered two of my staples (Tom ka Gai soup and Green Curry) and tried a new dish (for me), Holy Basil.  I got everything takeout.\n\nI'll start with the Holy Basil.  It was very good.  A nice balance of Thai flavors, and I thought it was quite similar to an Ayam Basil dish I used to get at a Malaysian place in Mt. View, CA.  My only complaint was that the chicken was big, thick chunks, like a fajita-style.  I expect delicate, tender meats at a high end Thai place.\n\nI opened my green curry and said: \"WHERE'S THE SAUCE\"?  I am VERY upset at the lack of sauce.  There was so little I can't comment on the flavor of the curry.  And, they had 2 different types of green beans in there:  chinese long beans, and American green beans.  The larger Amercian green beans weren't cooked.  That sucked.  The beef was tender enough but the peices were too big.  The one redeeming part of this dish was the fact that they had eggplant in it.  There is something about eggplant in green curry....\n\nThe Tom Ka Gai soup was  fantastic.  My only complaint would be the chicken, which again, was large fajita-style slices.   Doesn't make sense to me.\n\nWhile I was waiting at the bar for my order, I remember looking into the kitchen and wondering how they could possibly prepare everything on the menu in that tiny space.  Now, I think I know:  I suspect they prep all of their meats ahead of time and use the same size/shape/cuts for each dish to save time.  This results in a fajita-style cut of chicken that leaves me less than thrilled.\n\nOverall, the menu is brief and the food is good, but I don't think it's worth a long drive.  I don't expect to return when I could make the same drive to get to Swadee, which was just fabulous.  I gave this place a 3/5 because the Tom Ka Gai soup and Holy Basil were VERY good.  I am however disappointed in the green curry, the  cuts of meat, and by the way they completely ignored my request for Thai spicy; everything was rather mild in my opinion.", "type": "review", "business_id": "KPoTixdjoJxSqRSEApSAGg"},

And sure enough, we arrive and wait in the tiny entry way for at least 10 min before being approached by anyone. In that time, a friend who had arrived early and staked out at the bar informed me that as soon as she sat down, she was told that she couldn't order food because the kitchen was temporarily shut down because they were too busy. At the time we arrived it was maybe 30 percent full, and she assured me that that had happened 30-40 minutes ago, so they should be back on track by now. \nThe host finally showed up and said she could seat us, but it would be a while before the server would take our order bc they were \"recovering.\" Well, that's better than 10 people blocking an entryway, so I'm not sure why she seemed hesitant to seat us, even if we had to wait for a server. She assured us that we could order drinks from our table until the kitchen was \"ready.\"\nIt was only downhill from there. Thankfully, we were a jovial bunch - under any other circumstances this experience would have been disastrous. 15 min to get drink orders, another 15 to get the drinks. Another 20 min later he took our food orders. 30 min later they started coming out, sort of. Seven entrees came out, staggered over a period of five minutes. But three entrees - all pad thai - didn't arrive until at least 10 min later, when everyone else was finished. I understand not everyone can get food at exactly the same time with a party of 10, but they didn't even come close, and at the time we made our food orders it was at least an hour if not more after their alleged huge rush that shut down the kitchen. \nI got the peanut chicken - grilled chicken with peanut sauce, rice and grilled veggies. The sauce was too citrus-y for a peanut sauce and too thick (funny that I complained in my first review that my curry was too thin). Chicken underneath was completely flavorless and was dry and veggies were scant. Good thing it was only $10. Didn't get details from anyone else except the BF, who got the Kao Pad Jay, and kept saying over \"I'm so glad I got this!\"\nAll these issues seemed to be circumstantial (except the chicken dish), but, then again, how long has WT been a restaurant?

The restaurant can be a bit easy to miss, especially for those used to Phoenix' usual parking-in-front cityscape, as it is in an older part of the city with the parking lot through an alley, behind the building. The food is delicious and the drinks are really good.", "type": "review", "business_id": "KPoTixdjoJxSqRSEApSAGg"},

I had beef Kiewan, a delicious green curry that packed solid (American-gauge) heat. The corn fritters are crunchy and good, served with jalapenos and cucumber. The coconut milk-based soup with chicken was a hit around the table. Pork, beef, ribs, vegetarian, salmon - everything got a solid thumbs up. \n\nGood drinks. Our server was first rate and unusually sweet. Maybe it's not cutting edge Scottsdale, but Wild Thaiger serves up tongue tingling food at fair prices in an attractive interior space.

Had the Wild Wrap and Dragon Eggs for appetizers.  Both had a really good bite to them without losing all of the different flavors in the dish.  That is something that gets lost at many Thai places, everything is so hot you lose the flavor.  Two of us had the Beef Panang for dinner and our friend had the Salmon dish.  All were prepared very well.  The beef panang was a little different than I have had at many places here in town.  More curry & creamy coconut milk than the light broth based panang we have settled for at other places.  It was by far the best panang we have in Phoenix to date.  The beef was fork tender and the sauce flavor was over the top.  \n\nThe restaurant is very cozy and energetic.  It was 7:30 on a Thursday night and the inside was full, with only 1 table on the patio brave enough to weather the 100 degree heat.  Server was very friendly and attentive.  NA beverages were always kept full and she was all over refilling our glasses from the bottle of wine that had been ordered.  Big bonus points for the kitchen design.  It will not blow you away with tons of polished stainless steel and creative wall decor, but it is an open exhibition kitchen with about 10-12 seats at the bar that look in on the action.  Extremely rare to find in a Thai concept.  Love knowing who is cooking your food and that the kitchen is well kept.  We will definitely be back as this will be our new home for Thai in the valley.", "type": "review", "business_id": "KPoTixdjoJxSqRSEApSAGg"},

I'm not an expert on anything really.  But I know what I like.  In this instance, I like this place.\n\nWild Thaiger is located a few blocks north of the Heard Museum.  As such, it's wonderfully convenient to go here for a bite then wander down to see some American Indian history and artwork.  This was exactly what brought me there last night.\n\nI was seated immediately upon arrival.  The server cheerily came over and, when my first beer selection was out, suggested a few options that I might also enjoy.  I like getting suggestions on food and drink from people who obviously have some knowledge and care about the subject.  I was not disappointed.  The Thai beer I had was wonderful.  Unsurprisingly, much better than the standard American swill.\n\nBeing that this was my first time here, I had to order something from the house specials section.  I decided on the Jungle Love (insert 70s funk music here).  A dish of primarily \"exotic\" vegetables and thin sliced wild boar in a very spicy red broth.  It was superb.  The boar, which I'd never had before, was not the core of the dish but still quite flavorful.  It added a great contrast to the mass of vegetables in the pot.  I'll be honest, I'm not sure half of what I ate in there, but it was all good.  Good, and spicy.  Not the immediate burn you get from some hot food, but the seething heat that only makes you sweat and your lips burn when you're more than half done.

Deciding on Wild Thaiger, I chose to save Thai Hut for another time. \n\nThey offer ample parking behind the restaurant and patio dining if you so choose. Seeing no one out on the patio (yea it was warm out but not that uncomfortable), I entered the restaurant and was greeting and seated quickly, choosing a spot at the bar. \n\nThai iced tea in hand I reviewed the menu. Hummm, ok pretty standard menu, but being a fan of curries I noted my choices were limited. I guess I could have had them sub the beef for chicken in the dishes but I wasn't feeling up for the hassle. \nAfter a process that seemed like forever, I decided to start off with the Tofu Towers Appetizer and settled on the Green Curry with beef. \n\nThe tofu towers were well presented with a cucumber \"chutney\" / salad that was fresh with a vinegarette that still didn't do much for the tofu. [The same cucumber salad vinegarette at Siam Thai is more clean and crisp.] While green curry's are not generally my favorite (I often find them bland and less flavorful than a red), the beef green curry was tasty. The heat was one that built up slowly as you ate but was never overwhelming to the overall dish. The jasmine rice was cooked perfectly. \n\nWhile overall I can't complain, I can say I have had better but it is a worthy option when seeking a quick Thai fix. Still craving a good curry I guess I know what I will be making at home this weekend. Or maybe I will try Thai Hut.", "type": "review", "business_id": "KPoTixdjoJxSqRSEApSAGg"},

The hostess said it would be 20 minutes for a table. Literally two seconds later, there was a four person table cleared. I asked for the table and she got someone to clean it for us. The place was busy and noisy.  The menu was limited and average priced for most items. I craved noodles so ordered the Pad-Seiw. The noodles were alright. Somehow seems like there should be basil in the dish and not a bunch of cauliflower. The hubby had the bbq chicken with coconut rice.  Later our server later came back to tell us that they were going to charge us 5 dollars for bringing our own cake.

It's an adventure.\n\nWild Thaiger offers some of my favorites that are not to be found at Thai Basil (so mediocre) and Thai Elephant (good but standard) - Dragon's Eggs are a spin on Kanom Jeeb, thai pork and crab dumplings similar to shu mai, graced with a spicy slice of raw jalapeno on top.  Decha Boar celebrates the not often served wild boar in a peppery sauce of basil and telicherry peppercorns.  They understand that pepper can be flavorful in addition to hot, and there's a whole taste profile there just waiting for you to explore.  Best of all, the presentation on the dishes is a work of art - ribbons of carrots and beets as edible garnishes remind you of what a treat it should be to dine out.\n\nIf you are looking for standard Thai, without flair or panache, I could see how this might be seen as too expensive.

Every time I eat it, my scalp tingles and I slip into a blissful happy place. The steamed vegetables are so tender that they fall apart. The little relish on the side is shockingly delicious and refreshing. The duck sauce that comes with the fried rolls makes them worthwhile. I know there's something with peanut sauce (satay?) that makes me happy.\n\nAppetizers and desserts are up to you. If you like cellophane wrapped veggie rolls, they're great here. If you like coconut ice cream, do it. If not, you can probably skip these as they cost as much as the entrees. \n\nAnother note: don't come here thinking this is 100% authentic Thai cuisine.
