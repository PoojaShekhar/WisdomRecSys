Review Text :
Leave it to me to go to Las Vegas - a Foodie Mecca - and order a peanut butter and jelly sandwich for lunch.  Granted, this sandwich was ordered while suffering from a food hangover from a fancy dinner tthe night before AND 6 am nachos earlier that morning, but work with me here and see me for the rough & tough PB&J (not P & BJ) gal that I be.$3.95 for a freaking sandwich.  What a bargain!  At the sandwich place by my office in San Francisco, this pretty little focaccia & peanut buttery goodness would have set me back ten big ones.  Instead, I left with almost six dollars to blow on the wheel-of-fortune slot machines that call my name in their sweet, sweet way.The $3.95 special was off the Kid's Menu, but I batted my eyelashes in an epileptic way that I haven't done since I ran a red light during my driving test and really, really, REALLY needed my license.Two PB&Js later, Lindsey and I headed up to our room to prepare for another chaotic evening. Unpretentious + Inexpensive = 4 peanut butter & jelly-filled starsDon't feel like buffet? Don't feel like paying $$$ for an entree? are you in a hurry to watch a show? clubbing? gambling? or whatever it is...if you're just hungry and you want something simple & quick...then stop by at Earl of Sandwich, just inside of PH..near the Hawaiian Tropic entrance passage way.the sandwich is good, fresh, the bread is toasted crunchy on the outside. It's a good quick meal.Depending on which hotel you stay at in Vegas, you are sure to be bombarded with advertisements of their in house attractions. Most of the time it's their shows, their buffets, they're world class restaurants... That's why when I stayed at Planet Hollywood last week, I had a Laugh Out Loud moment when I kept seeing this 'Earl Of Sandwich' sandwich shop promotion everywhere. I mean seriously, from the moment you walk into Planet Hollywood at check-in... to the elevator rides up... to the adverts in your room... they keep promoting a sandwich shop? LOL.Well guess what, all the adverts worked and I finally gave in to try this place on my last night in Vegas- and i'm very glad i did! The sandwich was actually awesome! I got the 'All American'... thick slices of turkey, visibly fresh lettuce and tomato, melted American and Swiss cheese on toasted bread, all topped off with cranberry sauce... Maybe it's because i was far from home and had been sick of eating buffets all week long- this sandwich just stood out as delicious. Be sure to use the coupon found in your VIP booklet! I think it's buy one get one free? I grabbed another one before i checked out the next morning for the long drive home ;) A 4 star Sandwich Shop.i declare ye ~ delicious.SO GOOD! STILL SO GOOD!i got the chance to take my parents here. My parents aren't the biggest fans of sandwiches... and they have the mentality where they can always make their own sandwiches at home; no need to pay $6 for a sandwich. So i got them to try Earl's... and they LOVED it.  My mom loves the bread and my dad liked it so much he wants to franchise it. hahaI'm going to say that these sandwiches were the best in Las Vegas for two reasons:1) It's one of the only sandwich places among the string of high end buffets and sit-down restaurants2) My veins were coursing with tons of alcohol courtesy of Fat Tuesday/PURE the night before and eating meaty, carb-filled sandwiches just always tastes better under the influence. There was a lot to be happy about at this place, drunken bias aside:+ Large variety of sandwiches and salads+ Only 6 bucks, which is dirt cheap for Vegas!+ I had the Cannonballs and it tasted really good+ Plenty of seating with clean tables+ They're open for most of the day and nightThis place will fuel you with enough carby-goodness to get you through another day of experiencing Sin City. You should definitely consider making a pit stop here if you're around!You remember that Simpsons episode where they had the Springfield power plant vs. Shelbyville power plant baseball game?  Montgomery Burns hired a bunch of ringers to win.  Do you remember that one had an addiction to those energy drinks?  One of them said, "It's like there's a party in my mouth and everyone's invited!"  My reaction was along those lines.  However my lady friend said, "Stop making that face!"  Apparently this place is so good, I made the "Oh" face.  Yeah... it's THAT good.  Things to go for:Full MontagueCaprese (for you vegetarians)Jerk ChickenItalian Cheddar/Broccoli soupI'm drooling as I write this in remembrance of how delicious my Caribbean Jerk chicken sandwich was. Mmmm. With an extra M.Plus this place is open ... 24 hours. A delicious, beyond delicious, cheap sandwich place (came out to be around $7.25 for a sandwich) that's hot and melty any time of the day. Did I die and go to food heaven?Everything here just smells delicious, they use a special kind of bread that's very ... ciabatta meets flaky crust type deal ... delicious and kind of falls apart but compliments your sandwich perfectly. Their meats are extremely juicy and succulent (yes I just used succulent to describe meat ... really this place takes the cake!). Their sauces are awesome and their sandwiches go great with Grey Poupon! I wish I could order some. :( and now I'm hungry.One of the few dining options with reasonable prices in Las Vegas.  Somehow my friends and I always end up here after a fun night out clubbing and we're starving and want some good, simple food fast.  Sandwiches are a great price for the taste (and for being on the Las Vegas Strip) -- $6-8.  There's also a variety of drinks, desserts, snacks, soups and a kid's meal.I tried the caprese sandwich, tasted great.  Ordered an Earl's Frozen Lemonade.  It was very very sweet, way too sweet.  Felt like I was drinking lemon syrup.  It was under $3 and I was dehydrated, so I didn't waste too much money.  I also ordered a soup, which is also at a low price of about $3.This is everything Quizno's  grew up aspiring to be.  Too bad for us, Quizno's suffers from type A retardation.The Full Montagu has turkey, roast beef and is held together very nicely by cheese and it's fantastic toasted bread.  The tomato soup will warm your soul after losing Jr.'s college fund on the Baccarat table. It's like Spaghetti-O's minus the O's, which I am fond of.  They throw croutons in there to sweeten the deal.Luckily, I had not yet began binge drinking and was able to read up on some world history.  This Earl dude (maybe his name was John), invented the sandwich during a card game in jolly old England. I always thought the sandwich was an American invention.  It's Brit.  Damn you, history.  Damn you for opening my eyes to the truth.And now for your sandwich tip (yeah baby, tip) of the day.  Their HP steak sauce would make anything better.  If you douse your TV with it, it might stop you from putting your foot through your LCD when Oprah is on.  By the way, it's Canadian.  Have you noticed how our friend, the sandwich has been hiding behind a wall of deceit?  Perhaps it's all for the best that there aren't many Earl of Sandwiches around.  I wouldn't want Billy Bob's world to implode when he finds out that his fried bologna sandwich on crust-less off brand bread came from overseas.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DkYS3arLOhA8si5uUEmHOw?select=f87flydbA6bnMIEZXqQuwwNow.  Time to get outta bed and onto a chair at the 3 Card Poker table.Any restaurant with 4.5 Stars after hundreds of ratings is going to attract my attention.  Today was the day I went to give this place a shot.I took my son along.  We decided that we were going to order an Original Sandwich & an Italian Sandwich.....that we we could split each of them and give them both a try.When we arrived, the place was packed.  However, this restaurant knows how to handle volume.  The ordering & payment process was smooth.I was surprised to see the selection of Chips, Fruit, Beer & Wine, and Muffins & Pastries that were available.  We found a 2 Top table and waited for our number to be buzzed.After about 10 minutes, our pager buzzed and I went to pick up our order.The Sandwiches are hot & toasted.  I eagerly bit into the Original Sandwich (Roast Beef, Cheddar Cheese, & Creamy Horseradish Sauce).  The Bread was toasted just right and the Roast Beef was tender, it melted in my mouth.  The bite of the Cheddar Cheese & Creamy Horseradish went very well with the meat & bread.....it was like heaven!  I couldn't get enough.....I wish I ordered a full sandwich.So, I couldn't wait to eat my half of the Italian (Salami, Capicola, Roasted Ham, Mortadella, Mozzarella Cheese, Roma Tomato, and Zesty Italian Dressing).....again, it was toasted just right.  This sandwich also burst with flavor on my taste buds......oh man, I think I hit the jackpot!!!This place was off the hook!  For once, a restaurant lived up to the hype!  5 Stars in my book.The only knock for me is that it is very inconvenient for a local to get in/out of Planet Hollywood just to get a sandwich.Will I come back?  Abso-freakin'-lutely!Earl of Sandwich!!! Great prices for GREAT sandwiches! We all know that just about anything in Vegas costs an arm and a leg. Even their McDonald's are a bit more expensive than your typical local mickey Ds. Earl of Sandwich's sandwiches typically costs under $7.00. Like Janice H. mentioned, it is a BARGAIN for LAS VEGAS! I wish there's an Earl of Sandwich in LA!Wow. Talk about overrated !Okay so I only ordered a Tuna salad, because I really wasn't that hungry, but my other gfs ordered sandwiches and according to them it was an overall, 'Mehh.'  'Mehh' as in..you can find a much better bang for your buck at a local sandwich shop in your neck of the woods. Items aren't expensive so I give them that. They have everything you would find: hot sandwiches (duh), wraps, salads, coffee/tea, potato chips, breakfast options, and even dessert ! There's a lot of history behind this franchise..250 years to be exact so they must be doing something right ?! Uhh..right ?? Unfortunately, my experience wasn't quite enticing or memorable.Earl of Sandwich is like Subway - As in, you place a sandwich shop all by its' lonesome away from potential competition and not many food options available and you'll get hoards of people to come in. Smart Earl. Real smart. Due to its' Vegas location (i.e., inside Planet Hollywood), I'm not surprised many people line up here. This is an easy 'grab n go' meal-type setting and when in Viva Las Vegas, sometimes you just want a quick fix while you go around galavanting Sin City.  Okay..so on to my food:How can you mess up Tuna salad right ? Well, you sure can in this case. Waaaay overdressed and it reminded me of 'cafeteria food' where the ladies in aprons and hair nets use those hand scoopers to pile on a ball of coleslaw or mash potato on you cafeteria tray. Ya..I got a tuna ball *insert imagination* ! I should have known better, but I was really craving a salad. Is this premade? I could have sworn I saw some tossing up front. Oh..and I hate when they dress the salad for you. I like it on the side. I should have asked prior, but everyone seemed to be in a rush to order and move out the way. So I grabbed my salad and herbal hot green tea and went on my merry way.Rating Scale from 1-5:Appearance: Ball of Tuna = 1  Taste: Mushy, overdressed, still edible = 2Originality: If cafeteria food is original, then I MUST be from another planet = -1Overall score: 2 stars because I enjoyed my herbal hot green tea and the salad wasn't that expensive (thank goodness !)So maybe I should have gotten a damn sandwich, but I wasn't feelin' it at the time and my gfs weren't that impressed by it either. Would I give this place another shot ? If I had no other choice, maybe. Ok yes. No maybe. Ha !Happy 2011 everyone!  Hope everyone had a terrific NY celebration (nothing crazy and unsafe, yet extremely awesome and entertaining!)  Now the New Year is upon us, let me start off with a 5 star review for ya'll!Earl of Sandwich... I've never really been a sandwich fanatic and this was all the rage prior to my recent last trip to Vegas by everyone I know and all the reviews posted on yelp.  On the day we were going to be leavin' LV I've decided to give it a shot by walking across the street for a quick brunch at Earl's.Oh boy am I glad that I did just that!You know... sandwiches are sandwiches.. nothing spectacular but nothing too horrible either... (a very safe type of food).  However, here at Earl's it's absolutely incredible on how they can possibly make things tastes so good!Again due to my typical curiosity and the irresistible temptation on trying new things,  I've decided to almost but the entire menu for my food tasting lab I've set up in Bellagio.  (I end up getting the Full Montagu, Hawaiian BBQ, Caribbean Jerk Chicken, and the Earl Cobb Salad.)  The sandwiches were $5.99 each with a decent portion (ain't the size of subway but quality is much much better!), and with two drinks the total came out to like $31 and change...(slightly pricey in my mind but gotta give it a try)I did share all this food with 3 other people though,,, so I not really the pig that I say I am.....So here were our thoughts...Full Montagu:  Great roast beef sandwich with turkey and swiss cheese... the roast beef was the real deal and it had the texture of soft arby's roast beef..... So taking that soft morsels that you call beef coupled with high quality you get an awesome sandwich!Hawaiian BBQ:  I didn't get to try this as my friend devoured it down in a quick few minutes... so I'm gonna take that gesture as awesome and leave it as that!  Jamaican Jerk Chicken:  Jerk flavored chicken + roasted bell peppers in a jerk sauce made this sandwich really really delicious!  That's all I can tell you!  Yum!Highlights of these sandwiches, the BREAD!  They toasted in a way where it's just the right moisture, the right texture, the right flavor, the right crispiness, and the right size overall!  It's just a really delicious bread to compliment all the dressings in between!  I've always believed that what makes a sandwich great is simply the bread itself, and Earl of Sandwich really proved that to be the main point!Earl Cobb:  Aside from having slightly too much dressing that I would have liked (I always watch my dressing calorie count as this is the main trick in getting a salad), it was absolutely delicious!  I've have had many salads in various places, I gotta say that this is one of the more tasty salads for a fast food joint.  Definitely worth the price!  (The people I was with weren't even into salads and they really enjoyed that too!)It's sort of weird that if you want ice tea you have to ask for it.... but you got the typical fountain drinks available for you (pepsi products)One final note.... this place has recently updated their operational hours and it is now 24 hrs!!!  WOW!  That's so awesome!  So you're telling me when I'm hungry late at night working on them slots, I can get myself a sandwich to go, sit down at the slot, blackjack machine, or anywhere to be gambling and eating at the same time?  I Love Vegas!!!So there you have it folks!  The first review of 2011 by yours truly and it is definitely a 5 stars in my mind.  So again hope everyone will be having a SUPER DUPER 2011 and if you do visit Vegas, may the money gods follow you to every machine/table you go to, and the sandwich gods guide you to Earl of Sandwich!While in Las Vegas, you walk up to the craps table and you got the pass and the don't pass line. Well for me, Earl of Sandwich was definitely a "pass". I came to the Planet Hollywood location to pick up a Caribbean Jerk Chicken Sandwich ($6) and wasn't impressed with the flavor, breading or amount of chicken. They are suppose to add a spicy jerk sauce but I couldn't taste any additional "bite". When I asked to remove the inside breading, they took a knife and made my roll paper thin compared to pulling out the breading. It's a simple concept; you order and they give you a pager when your sandwich was ready. The staff were young and didn't pay very much attention to customer service. Lots of seating and it can get very busy throughout the day. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing but for $6, you can't beat a quick bite on the strip and head back to the craps tables!huh.... #1 on "Hot on Yelp" on the Yelp homepage for Las Vegas. I was expecting some expensive 5-star restaurant. But when I think about it, Earl of Sandwich is something I always crave on my Vegas trip.Not only is it the best drunk food (opened late), it's also perfect for lunch and dinner. It's located in the casino part (not the mile shops) of Planet Hollywood. Every time I come here, my go-to sandwich is the cannonball. Delicious bread, meatballs, marinara, and gooey cheeeeese. Simple, yet gorgeous.My boyfriend and I shared one as an after-club snack and on the last bite of my boyfriend's sandwich, he dropped the last meatball on the floor. In all honesty, it was the saddest part of our night. So sad that we talked about it the next morning, very true story.It's that good, man.A sandwich place. It's 24 hours.Located in the Miracle Mile next to PBR bar and grill.Delicious sandwiches. Delicious soups. They have Newcastle. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DkYS3arLOhA8si5uUEmHOw?select=YthQGafrgMApLF_XMj_ZkwI had the cannonBALL sandwich. It was tasty! Did I mention it was 24 hours?? 5 stars.A 24 hour cheap hot sandwich place is a vegas jackpot!!!  I always find myself having sandwich cravings and i'd been spending weeks looking at the reviews. I had decided way before i stepped into the store at PH, that i would be ordering the Full Montagu- Roast beef and turkey!!! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DkYS3arLOhA8si5uUEmHOw?select=pqiqUiWVESs9LubdKK2zcwWe were still full from breakfast, so i didn't get to try a second sandwich as i had hoped (i'm definitely getting the canonball meatball sammie next time). I'm sure after i try a few more different sammies here, i would upgrade to a 5, but based on just the one i had, i just needed a little something more. More mayonaisy sauce? Avocado? Not sure. But i am not craving it, as i do with Cooks, Mendo, Caps or Langers. But... I will be back for sure to get the cannonball and get ANOTHER brownie whoopie pie !! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DkYS3arLOhA8si5uUEmHOw?select=DbdvnjAtWRE2Hj0_MbX26QI had to check out what everyone in Las Vegas was babbling about, and the babbles were 100 percent accurate!! I was expecting regular sandwiches, and in one of the previous reviews that I have read, these sandwiches were actually compared to Capriotti's!WHEN: It is open 24 hours so you have no excuse to not get up and try it!!WHERE: Located inside the Miracle Mile Shops in Planet Hollywood, right across from the Sugar Factory.WHAT: Knowing this, I took my first bite into The Earl Club, and the first bite was all I needed to know that this was truly going to be one of my favorite sandwich joints. It hit the spot right away, haha! The flavors all intermingled inside of  artesian bread created a PARTY IN MY MOUTH! I couldn't get enough, so I came back the next day excited to try another sandwich! This time I tried the Tuna Melt. OMG, I felt like I tasted PARADISE! This is the best tuna melt I have ever tasted!! Beautifulness! Its simplicity was all that was needed to be the best on my list!Besides the sandwiches, I liked the Iced Tea Lemonade! It is something different, but different is good sometimes! =DMy newfound goal is to try all of the sandwiches here!! LOL Another thing, incomparable to Capriotti's for sure SON!WHY: IF YOU HAVE NOT TRIED THE SANDWICHES HERE YET, YOU NEED TO TRY IT FOR YOURSELF INSTEAD OF READING MY FLUFFED UP REVIEW. LOL, THE FLUFF WAS SO NECESSARY!! ENJOY. =)My first impression was (after hearing everyone and their moms rave about the sandwiches), "Really, a sandwich? How amazing can a sandwich really be?"The answer is: it was AMAZING.A-ll the rave really exists for a reason. Located in Planet Hollywood, you could easily pass by this place not knowing its grand existence if you weren't aware of their famous sandwiches. But once you try it you might be so impressed you won't know how to react.M-eat meat meat. The roasted beef was a shocker to my mouth. How could something that looks so simple taste so smooth and delicious? Perfectly soft, perfectly chewy, and just enough flavor that only an Earl's can achieve.A-nd after all that I was thrown off by another memorable discovery. The bread. Warm, crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside, and the most perfectly toasted crust gently surrounding the outsides of my sandwich.Z-ero complaints.I-n Vegas, the party goes on...all night long. That's why they're open 24 hours for your eating pleasure.N-ext time I'm in Vegas, I am stocking up! Great to have on the roadtrip back home. Does anyone know how I can preserve these babies so I can have a stash of them to eat until my next trip to Vegas?G-oogle image "Earl of Sandwich" and you will see a man named Earl Montagu who apparently "invented" the sandwich. Fun fact, the 11th Earl of Sandwich still operates this empire!The lasting impression? "First thing to eat when I go to Vegas, last thing to eat before I leave Vegas."I went to Vegas for a weekend in May, and all told I spent less than $300.  I made a little money playing poker, so I only left $170 in Sin City.  That's for food, gas, hotel, everything.One of the reasons I was able to do this was that I got two meals out of Earl of Sandwich for a grand total of $6.48.  My car got to Vegas hours before our friends, so we decided to have a cheap, casual dinner.  I did a quick search on Yelp, and this place came up with its hundreds of reviews.Earl of Sandwich is in Planet Hollywood, a kind of funny theme hotel if you know anything about Los Angeles.  I find it amusing that the mall is billed as the Miracle Mile Shops, as if the Miracle Mile is a glamorous shopping mecca in L.A.  Even Earl of Sandwich is out of place - it's a chain restaurant, but there isn't a single branch in California.Don't be alarmed that it's a chain.  It's a step up from Quizno's (though I like Quizno's, and Subway, too), and I appreciated its impressive efficiency.  There was a short line to order, but once we got our orders in, we sat down with our buzzers.  They started buzzing while we were getting water, and our food was hot and ready within five minutes of arrival.I ordered the Full Montagu with roast beef, turkey, aged swiss, sharp cheddar, lettuce, tomato, and mustard sauce.  I had half for dinner and half for lunch the next day - I never went hungry, and the sandwich reheated great.  It was really tasty, with good ingredients and plenty of them.  I also tried some of my friends' orders - the Italian sandwich and the Earl's Cobb.  The Italian was maybe even better than the Montagu, with a meatfest of salami, capicola, ham, and mortadello, topped with mozzarella, roma tomato, and a zesty Italian dressing.  Peppers were optional and delicious.  Even the salad was pretty good.  It wasn't a deprivation salad - it came with plenty of grilled chicken and bacon, swiss and cheddar cheese, and a buttermilk ranch dressing.  But it also had plenty of greens and tomato, cucumber, and cranberries.If you're in Vegas for the full Vegas experience, go balls out, hit Robuchon, whatever you want.  But it's nice to know that you can eat something good for $5.99 and tax.  I love a good sandwich, and the Earl delivers.yea, i thought this place was going to suck (it's on the strip), so I had my suck face on, but after the first couple of bites, I had my non-suck face on.what more needs to be said after 1K reviewsFor Vegas, Earl's is an absolute gem. Opened 24 hours AND toasty, tasty sammies? Perfect anecdote/joint to end/start? your 4:00 am debaucheries ;)I love Earl's Turkey Club Sandwich -- it's not only a safe sandwich but it's really good and fulfilling. The bread is AMAZING; it's toasted to perfection and it doesn't scratch up your gums.  Earl's bread has the right amount of crispy crunch and soft dough to compliment the contents of the sandwich.  Everything else seems fresh but I wasn't exactly BLOWN away.  Like I said, for Vegas, yes, this is damn good. I've had better sandwiches in the OC and LA in California BUT I'll give it to Earl's for being the best in Sin City.Tried the Full Montagu (beef, turkey, cheddar/swiss cheese, etc.) and it was good, but not my fave. Solid sandwich, though.Also, their Tomato Bisque -- UM, AMAZING.  I felt so sick after my Vegas trip and had to have soup at Earl's. Best decision during my trip, EASY. Their garlic croutons added the perfect kick to the tomato flavor (which tasted so homey, omg). Rich and slightly creamy... perfect for the weak stomach :)**Accepts credit cards**Tucked away in Planet Hollywood, across from The Sugar Factory**Open 24/7!!**Long line but don't be discouraged, it goes by really fast.Earl of Sandwich, you never fail to satisfy my starving tummy after a long night at the club. Forget the steak and eggs, go for Earl of Sandwich's Tuna Melt, Italian, Hawaiian BBQ, Earl's Club, and other amazing sandwiches.My favorite part about the sandwiches: The toasted crispy bread that's always perfectly toasted.after rolling out of bed WELL past breakfast & lunch, earl of sandwich sounds like a great vegas-cheap eatwe shared 2 of their signature hot sammies! which aren't amazing BUT when you're hungry in vegas & on budget... the toasted bread & ingredients do wonders----the full montagu----the carribean jerk chicken!NOTE: everyone's got the same idea..you'll probably run into someone you know here.. soOOo look alive!!!There are a few rules to follow when in Vegas:1) Don't marry a stripper.2) Don't drink & gamble on an empty stomach.3) Don't call the number on those fliers people hand out to you on the strip. You'll just end up marrying a hooker. That's worse than a stripper if you're wondering.So as I wanted to adhere to this rule system, my BF & I paid a visit to the Earl of Sandwich before going out for drinks and gambling. For $5.99 these sandwiches are a crazy good deal! I had the roast beef w/ horseradish and I loved how the bread is nicely toasted. I highly recommend if you're looking to get a quick bite.Oh and when we stepped back out on the strip I told the man handing out fliers to my BF that he already had a naked girl...but thank you!Yelp 365 Challenge: #33/365 (The Rules)Eat It or Beat It?**EAT IT!!**Earl isn't just great for when you're still drunk at 3am with hardcore drunchies... it's actually seriously freekn' good! With prices at $6 a sandwich and 15+ choices to choose from, all of which are priced the same, you can't complain! OK, I get it, Subway has $5 footlongs, but EOS is top notch. First of all, the bread... the bread, bread, bread... it is soooo amazing: soft with a lil crunch and a whole lotta mmm, mmm!If you're a newb, start with the original! In fact, the original IS my favorite! Last time I was in Vegas, I brought home 10 sandwiches back home for friends and family to try, and after sitting in the car for 4 hours... it still tasted amazing! CONCLUSION:Eat it! Whether you're sober, buzzed, drunk, or because you just want to eat, EAT ITTTTTTT!Dear Earl,Oh how I've been longing to meet you.  After multiple Vegas trips, I still couldn't find a good reason to come to your house at the Planet Hollywood Miracle Mile shops until last month.  Not sure if you remember me, but I came with 3 other people and it was their first time meeting you too. I kinda feel bad because I was the one who suggested checking you out. Thank goodness the time I came to see you, there was no line because waiting in line for a sandwich, that shit cray.  But I'm glad my friends enjoyed your company. For me, it was kinda like a going on a date.  Spending money and at the end of the date, I'm left wanting more.  Usually that's a good thing.  But after I left you, I saw some lobster roll place and kinda wish I spent my time and money there.  Which is usually not a good thing.However, $5.99 a sandwich, I wouldn't be totally against coming by to see you again.  Don't call me, I'll call you.Smooches,Bong EPS - I got to try The Original and The Club.  Maybe next time I'll try the Cannonball because I had a friend drop a meatball on the floor and thought about eating it.Best hot sandwiches ever.  Question Mark.With the guys preoccupied with "guy stuff," I was left to roam The Strip all by my lonesome. When my tummy notified me that it was lunchtime, I didn't have to search far to find a quick grub spot; I was standing right in front of an ad for Earl of Sandwich! Well, that was effortless, thank you Universe.My Caprese Salad & a fountain root beer cost less than $9. I so appreciated the very appropriate portion--just enough for one moderately hungry girl--as some portions in Vegas tend to err on the side of REE-diculous. The tomatoes & mozzarella were fresh, but the salad was kind of drowning in its vinaigrette. Overall, it was un-special & really kind of "meh" but I can't knock a place that serves $5.99 salads & sandwiches.Won't be a stop on *my* next trip to Vegas, but if you've just lost your shirt at the blackjack table, *you* may want to stop by this wallet-friendly Planet Hollywood eatery.For the price ($5.99) this was a great sandwich.  The line was long but it moved pretty fast. I split the full montagu and Caribbean jerk chicken with my friend. The montagu was a solid sandwich but it was something I can put together. The one thing that I don't have is the mustard. Earl's mustard was sweet and tangy and delicious. If I based my review just on the montagu I would give it a three star but since I had the jerk chicken I'm giving this place a four star. The jerk chicken was really good. I love food with bold flavors. Loved the spiciness from jerk sauce and the peppers. Would love to go back to try more.Earl of Sandwich. You were underrated to my taste.Don't know what all the rave & hype is about. Their food tastes the same as Subway's, if not worse. Y'all must be all intoxicated while eating this shit cuz this place tastes OK when you're sober.I must admit the bean soup was really good though I was hella drunk while eating it. It was the only "good" taste that stood out. The line is definitely not worth the wait HAHA.Props to them for opening 24 hrs. That's probably how they make so much money...charging drunktards (like me that night) for multiple sandwiches. I came back to the hotel with two bags of 2 sandwiches & 2 soups. Wtf.It's good munchies food but for lunch? Nahhh I'd rather go to In n Out or Chinatown.After a failed attempt to give Earl and Sandwich a shot back in September, I was happy to finally get my hands on one of their sandwiches last week. Preciousssss...(Golem from 'The Lord of The Rings')NO LINE, YES!I've read many Yelpers reviews that talk about having to wait in line. When we got to Earl's, thankfully when we got there, there was NO line. SCORE! I ordered The Earl's Club, and some pasta salad, and some chips, and (THERE'S ALWAYS ROO FOR DESSERT. WARNING WARNING.) a cookie and a fruit  parfait (I WAS HUNGRY!!!). =X NO LOVE AT FIRST BITEEh, there wasn't anything special about this sandwich and how it tasted. In fact I've had better sandwiches elsewhere (Little Lucca's in South San Francisco, CA). I was fairly disappointed because of the rave reviews I've read here on Yelp. Don't get me wrong the sandwich was still good, it was mediocre tasting and nothing to rave about. =X Goodness, I hope I don't get shot for this review!! CONCLUSIONEverything I ordered, that includes sides and desserts were just okay. Not awesome, not horrible BUT okay. So....3 STARS! Would I come back? Eh, maybe if I was desperately craving for a sandwich. =)After seeing so many people review them on Yelp, I was stoked to finally check out Earl of Sandwich.  From the way people hand them five stars and how they've earned about 1,800 reviews, it's like they're sandwich royalty!When a couple of my friends and I stopped by to grab a quick dinner before meeting with everyone else, we fully expected to run into a line.  Given their popularity, we figured it wouldn't be a question of "if" there would be a wait, but "how long", especially since we were going around 7:00.  Much to our surprise, there wasn't a single person ahead of us when we got there.  Score!  Since my friend and I both wanted to try a couple of their sandwiches, we decided to get two different types to share.  While she ordered The Original 1762 (Roast Beef, Sharp Cheddar, and Horseradish Sauce), I ordered the Italian (Salami, Capicola, Roasted Ham, Mortadella, Mozzarella, Roma Tomatoes, and Italian Dressing).  Even though I tried to set aside any expectations I had, it was tough trying to block out the reviews I read.  While the sandwiches were decent, they fell a little short for me.  With all the hype though, it was bound to happen.- The Original 1762 (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DkYS3arLOhA8si5uUEmHOw?select=REJJpOEpwaK0fLvh-bKn0g) - it's essentially a roast beef sandwich, but its simplicity worked.  The roast beef and sharp cheddar were nice, but it was the horseradish sauce that did it for me - potent enough for a kick, but not enough to be harsh.  I wish the meat had been a little more medium rare than medium though.  - Italian (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DkYS3arLOhA8si5uUEmHOw?select=k8Po4fzJS9cgJcYsOdhfrw) - okay, but I think the Hot Italian at JJ Boulangerie at the Paris hotel is better (and bigger).  I liked the blend of flavors from the meat, but it was hard to separate them out.  The Roma tomatoes added some freshness, but I could have used less of them.  Ditto for the Italian Dressing.Regardless of anything else, Earl is an especially budget friendly option given its location on the Strip (sandwiches were about $7.00 each).  Plus points as well for being open 24 hours - way better for late night munchies than the 24 cafe at Paris or the bar at Bally's.  For those reasons, I'm rounding up from THREE AND A HALF to four.  Had we actually gone then (drunk) instead of for dinner (sober), I probably would have loved Earl of Sandwich.  Instead, depending on the sandwich I want, I might lean towards JJ Boulangerie instead and save my Earl trips for post drinking/clubbing adventures.Earl of Sandwich...mmm...so good...We live in a time when most everything is all about the hype and thus marked up several times in Vegas, especially on the strip.  What a wonderful feeling it was to discover this casual sandwich spot located inside Planet Hollywood.   It is quick, easy, delicious, satisfying and cheap!!!  $5.99 for any sandwich, wrap or salad! Yes, true!I love love their BLT.  The Caribbean Jerk Chicken Sandwich and Tuna Melt are also very popular and delicious.  It's their warm, soft bread that really steps their sandwiches a notch above most others. Their salads are not so good so unless you're seriously allergic to bread or something, try a sandwich. Best of all, it's open 24/7 as it should be in this town!Want to know what the best tasting thing in Vegas is at 3:30AM after hours of sinister fun? The Full Montagu http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DkYS3arLOhA8si5uUEmHOw?select=0hAaWj1C6H_DdxKTKrNxvA    As you can see, The Full Montagu is not an adult themed show featuring scantly clad sexy boys shaking their junk for the masses. This Full Montagu is a big, warm, mouthwatering sandwich packed with freshly roasted beef, turkey, aged Swiss, sharp cheddar, lettuce, Roma tomatoes and Earl's Mustard Sauce (I also add banana peppers). This sandwich is perfect. It's salty. It's sweet and because I added peppers, it's also slightly spicy. And the bread it's served on, oh that bread is great too. Lightly toasted on the outside and soft and fluffy on the inside. Besides the FM, Earl also has a good amount of other amazing tasting sandwiches, both hot and cold, like their Caribbean Jerk Chicken and the Cannonballs, both of which I sampled before (at the location in FL).  They also have salads, wraps, chips, tasty desserts and even breakfast Sammie's http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DkYS3arLOhA8si5uUEmHOw?select=bcK75Axd_C6o9qCvSOe-pwThe Vegas location of Earl is conveniently located inside the Planet Hollywood Resort and Casino and is open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Freaking sweet. And last but not least, the prices here are super cheap, which is also a major plus in case you pulled a Clark Griswold and lost your life savings at the blackjack tables and only have a few bucks left to your name. I love Vegas Vacation. It's hilarious. Anyways, to sum it all up ya gotta check out Earl of Sandwich while you're in LV. It rocks! Oh, and Eugine, baby, I thought of your handsome mug every time I walked by Earl.Probably the best deal you can get in Vegas.  For the price of one hand of blackjack you can get a nice hot sandwich and a full belly.  I came back twice just because I liked it so much.I dug the Veggie (lent) and it was pretty awesome!  I also had the full Montague and it was delish as well.  The meat is perfection, nice and rare and juicy, I just wish I could have a huge pile of the meat!The Caprese was okay, I kinda felt like it was an afterthought.  And their was only one piece of basil for the entire sandwich....I'd skip that one next time.Someone should open up a franchise in LA because it would make a killing.I'm not a huge sandwich person... but you wouldn't know it whenever I stay at Planet Hollywood.  I literally want EOS for every meal.  The bread they make and use is so fresh and perfect with every sandwich.  A smaller bun is used for their breakfast sandwiches... but hits the spot, all the same.  I've had the following: - the ultimate grilled cheese- the tuna melt with swiss (I request for them to add lettuce and tomato... no extra charge!)- the earl's club with turkey and bacon- the full montagu - roast beef and turkey- the breakfast blt (i request to add egg on mine... no extra charge!)- the caprese - they definitely don't skimp on the mozzarrella!  - the blt - the tomato soupEverything.  And I mean EVERYTHING above is delicious.  However, the tuna melt is my all time favorite.  $5.99 for a regular sandwich and $3.99 for a breakfast one... can't get a better quality meal for that price on the strip!  Wish I ordered an extra one yesterday to have today while I drool and write this review...Good and Cheap!!!Everyone, I mean EVERYONE tells me great things about this place. Earl is located in Planet Hollywood. You just line up, pick your sandwich, pick up anything else you'd like (e.g. Chips, desserts, yogurt), pay, and wait for your food. I opted for the CAPRESE SANDWICH. So good! Mozzarella, basil, tomatoes, and balsamic vinegar. SOO good! And what, four to five bucks only?! Wait, open 24 hours?! What?!  Can't wait until they open a location in down town Disney!!!I feel like the last kid on the block to finally get a pair of the hottest high-tops (or should I say trying out the much talked about Earl).We were passing back through Vegas on our epic weekend in Utah, and we decided to spend a night in Vegas (believe me it was hard to leave the next day) the only request I had besides hitting up a buffet and laying out at the pool with a drink is to stop at Earl's and have a sandwich.With that in mind, we all planned to hit this place up for lunch the next day! Earl is easy to locate, half in the PH casino/half in the miracle mile mall. We arrived about 1:00ish and there was a small line, it moved fast which was good. Trying to decide on what to order became a picked as fast as possible which is never an option for me since I saw four sandwiches that interested me!Their menu has plenty to pick from along with salads and wraps. Going on the more "healthy" route I picked a wrap, now which one to choose from (oh the choices).A tiny part of me really wished they could have made the jerk chicken sandwich into a wrap, but they pretty much only can make salads into wraps (boo)! The cashiers are fast yet friendly. If you have a question, they are more than happy to answer it for you!It was our turn and I placed my order:The Earl's Cobb Wrap-grilled chicken, smoked bacon, Swiss and sharp cheddar cheese, Roma tomatoes, cucumber, cranberries and Buttermilk Ranch Dressing.I opted not to have the swiss cheese (not a fan). Tossed in some BBQ kettle chips and I was good to go, Minh grabbed our number, and a drink and we were off to find a table. Did not take us too long to find a place for the four of us to sit at. Getting our sandwich and wrap did not take too long either.Before I knew it, I had my much-awaited wrap sitting in front of me bagging to be open. I have to admit that i  had a "Willy Wonka" moment peeling back the golden paper. Sitting inside the golden paper was a delicious wrap filled with all the goodies; I could not take it anymore. I had to take a bite or two. Bite one... wow this is scrumdiddlyumptious! but oh no my chicken and lettuce fell out the back end of my wrap, the bf was super sweet to stop eating to go and get me a fork so I could eat what fell out. Bite two... I loved the cranberries in the wrap; it gave it a subtle sweet kick. The ranch was prefect in the amount they gave you.And yes, there was plenty of chicken, cheese, and bacon with every bite!The chips are good too, not to greasy but more of a lighter taste with a whole lot of flavor and crunch!I left not feeling overly full, but just the right amount of being satisfied! Cannot wait until their new location in Anaheim opens! It will be Earltastic!!!Finally made it over to see what all of the Earl of Sandwich hype is all about. My sweetie and I decided on lunch out today and a sandwich is what popped in my head and someplace new!I ordered the Hawaiian BBQ, grilled chicken, roasted Ham, aged Swiss, pineapple & Hawaiian BBQ Sauce. It was sweet and good, the meat was moist and juicy. I could have eaten two of these mmmm yum!My sweetheart got the The Full Montagu,  roast beef, turkey,  swiss & sharp cheddar, lettuce, roma tomatoes & the Earl's mustard sauce. We each took a bite of each others sandwich and they are both delicious.We also both ordered a side of potato salad, mmm yum made with the red skin potatoes, was good. Unlimited fountain drinks, coffee and iced tea as well as hot tea.We will stop by again if at Planet Hollywood hotel and casino however don't think will make a special trip to dine here like we did today. I am glad my curiosity has finally been fulfilled :)**** 2.5 stars ****I suppose this is technically an edible sandwich and it's cheap, which is the only reason I'm rounding up here, but what the hell is with all this praise? 2,000 reviews+ and still a 4.5 star rating for something less edible than any random Quiznos or Potbelly... I just don't get it. Granted, I was doing everything I could to keep my brain from pounding out of my skull as Brian and I waited patiently in the somewhat quick moving but incredibly long line, but I still think I was functioning enough to know that this was a disappointment of pretty big proportions.A few years ago when Nicole was staying in Vegas for a brief conference I suggested the Earl as one of the places she should definitely hit for a quick meal, based mainly on the overwhelming number of positive reviews. Her response was basically "it's a good sandwich", with little emphasis in either direction. I thought, OK, maybe she just tried the wrong one (although it was definitely the one I would have gone for as well). I happened to see Venu N's review just prior to my trip, and it sort of confirmed what I was fearing, that this was somehow just the average public broadcasting basement show which somehow snowballed itself into primetime relevance. Or perhaps it's some combination of groupthink with the more dangerous drunkthink.I think I only paid about $6 for my "Cannonballs!" sandwich, which is probably fair enough, but it was just so unimpressive. Just look at the photo, it's sad. The bread was warm and toasted on the ends but not so much in the middle, and the meatballs were sparse and cold inside. I felt less awful, physically, after eating it, but I'm not so sure that statement couldn't have applied to virtually anything at that point. There really just isn't anything special here. I was certainly still hungry afterwards, as these sandwiches are pretty small when compared to their competition.I implore you, ignore all the "amazing" and "OMG" nonsense that you'll read here. It really is quite a simple creation that has a different name people aren't familiar with (outside of the Yelp praise), and thus they mistakenly value it higher than any other chain which could easily supplant it. If you, for some reason, happen to be in this dreadful mall and simply cannot make it anywhere else before dying of starvation, then go ahead and eat here. Otherwise, find a better meal elsewhere, because really, who comes to Vegas to go the cheap route?Earl of Sandwich serves $6 sandwiches 24 hours a day. The problem is that the one and only sandwich I tried was extremely disappointing. I asked the lady at the counter for the most popular sandwich and she said, "Get the Earl Club." So, I did.Sadly, the strongest flavor for the Club was Charcoal because the crust of the Bread was burned just enough to make it snap-hard and bitter while the Bacon was 2 strips of even crunchier charcoal crisps. With skimpy toppings, light on the cheese, and not enough flavor to overcome the burnt taste, the Earl Club was a miss. I ate most of the Turkey and Cheese, but let the rest hit the trash can on the way out.The convenience of being connected to the Planet Hollywood Casino and Miracle Mile of Shops was nice, but the Earl of Sandwich was a losing bet in a city full of great eats. Treat it as a late night stomach-stuffer for $6. Nothing more. Nothing less.I had been wanting to try the Earl of Sandwich for a long time.  I had heard good things about it from friends, and had read lots of great Yelp reviews, so I was exciting to give it a try this past weekend when visiting Las Vegas.  My initial impression of the food was not good.  I was let down by the fact that my bread was pretty badly burnt on one side.  I had taken my food to go, and did not make the discovery of my bread being burnt until I got back to my room.  However, even with the sandwich being burnt, it was still decent.  Besides being burnt, the flavor of the other ingredients really stood out.  I had ordered the 'The Original', which is a roast beef sandwich with cheddar cheese and horseradish sauce.  After feeling like I missed out on something good, I decided to go back to the Earl of Sandwich the next day to give it another shot.  I ordered the same sandwich again, and it was so much better with the bread being slightly toasted.  I also got a potato salad, and liked that as well.  Overall, it was a very tasty meal.It is so hard to judge a place based off of one experience, and I am so glad that I went back to give the Earl of Sandwich another try.  My second meal was awesome, and I will definitely go back the next time I am in Las Vegas.In the ever evolving world of sandwiches, many claim to produce the best sandwich in the world.  Among the contenders are the likes of Capriotti's, Mendocino Farms, Which Wich? and many more. Among this iconic list of sandwich makers, there are droves of fans and haters alike.But make no mistake, The Earl of Sandwich makes some of the most addictively good sandwiches i've enjoyed in a very long time! Tack on the competitive prices and it makes it even better! So it's safe to say i'm a fan when it comes to the Earl's cheap & tasty eats!The Original with Roast Beef - The bread was excellent! As soon as I grabbed the warm bag in my hand, I knew I was in for a toasty treat!The bread was perfectly crisp on the outside yet warm and fluffy on the inside. Not thick, bread-y, dry & spongy like most other places. The roast beef was piled high and it was juicy and full of mouthwatering flavor!Jerk Chicken SandwichFilled with generous portions of chunk grilled chicken breast (not sandwich meat), red peppers and of course a good helping of zippy banana peppers, this zesty lil number was quite flavorful and surprisingly juicy (considering it was chicken breast!) but my favorite has to be the original for overall mmmmmm mmmm mm factor!DessertBrownie Cream SandwichImagine two chocalatey rich brownies sandwiching a decadent layer of sweet vanilla frosting...yup it's insanely rich and sweet! I advise you to purchase a glass of milk with this decadent number cuz you'll definitely need it!Service was nifty & quick and they got us in and out in no time flat! Don't forget that all toppings are free with the exclusion of avocado, so pile it high if you so desire! And did I mention the prices? Only 6$ for a delicious hot sammie! That's a steal for a great sandwich on the strip I might add!With that said, it's a no brainer...if you're out after the club looking for some awesome late nite eats or just strolling the strip, give EoS a try, you won't be disappointed!Happy Eats!There are literally thousands of reviews extolling Earl of Sandwich as the finest (and most affordable!) place to have a sandwich on the Strip.While all those reviews are indeed awesome, I'm going to talk about something else entirely: tomato soup.Yes, tomato soup.(I've said it before and I'll say it again... The easiest way to make a snap judgement about a restaurant is by looking at the quality of its soup.)The tomato soup at Earl's is orgasmic.  In fact, it's the best damn tomato soup I've ever had.  It's rich, it's creamy, and it's packed with an incredible depth of tomato flavor.  It's topped with the most perfectly crisped croutons I've ever encountered (not too soft, not too hard).  One spoonful of this tomato soup and I was in foodie heaven ...... at 8:30am.Yeah, I went to Earl's for breakfast.  Weird, I know -- but please don't hate.  It's actually a great place to go for breakfast.  There are no lines in the morning, and there's plenty of seating to go around.  In fact, it was only like 5 minutes between when I placed my order at the counter and when the little electronic plastic thingy started blinking and vibrating to let me know my food was ready.What to have with tomato soup at 8:30am?  Grilled cheese wasn't on the menu, so I had the next-best thing: the tuna melt.  And, oh my God, this tuna melt was just as orgasmic as the tomato soup.  It was a fresh, delicious roll with piping hot tuna and a layer of beautifully melted cheese.  Is there such thing as tuna bliss?  I think there is, and it's served up at Earl's.Did I mention that all this food cost less than 10 bucks?Have I convinced you of Earl's amazingness yet?  If so, get off your butt and walk -- no, RUN -- to the Planet Hollywood hotel as fast as you possibly can and start noshing on some of the best cheap eats in Las Vegas.People have often asked me about late night eats in the City of Sin and usually the first place that comes to mind is Earl of Sandwich. The good ol Earl might just be the best thing that has ever happened to Planet Hollywood and for 24 hours a day, seven days a week it feeds many appetites for non-Strip prices.For those not in the know, Earl of Sandwich is a chain. Not a Nevada only chain like some others were lead to believe, but a national one. It doesn't carry the name of a Quizno's or Subway's, only its way better and until LV gets an place that is local and convenient, it seems the rest will be flocking here and adding to the already silly lines that occur randomly throughout the week.My sandwich of choice is the Full Montagu, a beautiful concoction of turkey, roast beef, lettuce, cheddar and swiss cheeses, tomatoes, and Earl's mustard. It's a classic choice, perhaps their most popular one, and it is delicious any time - whether its hungry and sober or hungover and blacked out. A fun combination is the Turkey Holiday (aka the Thanksgiving dinner), which features turkey, cranberry sauce, stuffing, and gravy. There are a multitude of sandwiches that fit every palate, every craving, and thankfully are between $5-8 each. This is considered a great deal on the Strip.If you can stomach the lines and the sometimes impatient service, Earl of Sandwich is a rite of passage for many late night hungry folks on the strip. This is a way better alternative than shooting for the standard casino diner / cafe and worth the few bucks for a shot at sandwich glory.I've only been here 3 times in a 5 year span and I was drunk 2 out of those 3.  This place isn't on my must-eat list when I'm in Vegas, but it's good, cheap, and convenient since it's open 24 hours.  If you've never been here then it's worth a try.  The food definitely tasted better when I was intoxicated, especially the tomato bisque, for some reason that soup wasn't very tasty when I had a clear mind.  I thought it was too rich and acidic.  As for their sandwiches, I tried the "full montague" and "hawaiian bbq" and liked them both.  I think their bread is definitely the ingredient that makes their sandwiches so tasty.  It has that perfectly toasted crunchy exterior when you bite into the sandwich, then you get a mouthful of fresh ingredients and delicious soft bread.  I was just here two weeks ago but only ordered the tomato bisque, it definitely hit the spot at 3:00 am.  I'll be back!Eating sandwiches in Las Vegas?  This wasn't exactly where I saw myself eating with all the choices on The Strip.  When it came down to a decision, I couldn't refuse the loudly reviewed sandwich shop which now advertises that they OPEN 24 HOURS outside.  *Chicken tortilla soup - Bun and I almost always get a soup and share.  Through experience of sandwich shop soups, the soups usually are menu fillers.  Due to the constant reheating, flavor and freshness disappear over time.  Ranking them atop many franchise soups, the chicken tortilla soup wasn't too shabby.      *Cannonballs! - Yeah, "Cannonballs!" is the name of the sandwich.  Also don't forget that exclamation point when ordering.  Like a good o' cannonball to the face, nothing surprising here, inside they have marina, cheese, and hunky balls of meat.  Boy does my Bun love her meatball sandwiches.  Even at Subway, when in doubt, her choice would be a meatball sandwich.  Chowing down the sandwich, I wrestled it away from her for a bite.  That singular bite almost led to a second.  That is until Bun put a sleeper hold on me and yanked the sandwich out of my hand.  *Earl's Club - What's the difference between Earl's Club and a turkey club?  Not much besides the name.  Turkey, bacon, lettuce, and tomato were what I tasted before gulping it down.  Do I have any comments on the sandwich?  "Good".  My mouth is still full.  Don't bother me.        All sandwiches are about six inches and deceivingly filling.  In view of the fact their label of a franchise, nearly all ingredients tasted very fresh.  Their most underrated attribute are the artisan bread used for buns.  For about the same price, why would anyone on Earth pay for a Subway sandwich?  Budget friendly and open all the time, Earl of Sandwich is a wise choice for the haggard Strip journeyers.  In need for food and a place to rest their feet, Earl of Sandwich is a very useful alternative on The Strip.Inside of Planet Hollywood. This hotel and casino is ehh, not many slots that catches my eye nor table games BUT, I will come here for Earl of sandwich. You order, pick up your chips, pay and wait for your sandwich, the whole decor is just like a sandwich shop. I got the Earl club, since we asked the girl which was the best selling sandwich and what they were known for. My husband got the meatball sandwich. OMGOD my club sandwich was BOMB, I was able to taste everything in my sandwich, turkey, bacon, Dijon sauce, fresh tomato, the lightly toasted bread, best club sandwich ever!! Hands down. Meatball sandwich was delicious too, not overbearing with sauce and the meatball was flavorful! Mmm hmmm...AND I am not a fan of meatball sandwiches, they usually end up grossing me out because of the soggy bread and tasteless meatball. This was our meat at 1030 for our journey walk back to the Luxor, it was well worth it.To me Vegas is all about gambling, glitter, lasers, lights, music, and of course the infamous Earl of Sandwich!  Its cheap, delicious and in my opinion no trip to Vegas is complete unless it includes a couple of these AMAZING sandwiches.  My all time favorite if the Club followed by Tuna Melt and the Full Montague, but for the time being the Holiday Sandwich is my current number one SO. DAMN. GOOD.There are enough places to blow your money in Vegas - go to Earl of Sandwich for one of your meals and get the best bargain in town for seriously one of the best sandwiches I've ever had anywhere!I made sure to rush to write my review after a recent trip to Vegas because I can't rave enough about their holiday special sandwich, which is pretty much the best Thanksgiving sandwich you'll ever have anywhere (and that includes the Bobbie at Capriotti's, which is another one of my faves). The only thing is that they only offer this til January, so make sure to run over and snatch one up!Though the ingredients are what you would expect (turkey, gravy, stuffing, cranberry), i fell in love with the flavor and quality of each of them. I think the thing that makes it is the bread, which is somehow perfectly crispy on the outside and soft and warm on the inside. Believe the hype! Unlike a lot of other places in Vegas, Earl of Sandwich is a sure win!24 hours. You can phone in your order if you don't want to wait in the long lines. But even though the lines are long, the food is worth it twice fold. This is the kind of place you give into the food, throw out your calorie counting habit, and just enjoy all that is in the creations of Earl of Sandwich.You have to try the tuna melt. Seriously. You will love that sandwich more than the smartphone in your hand you're using to read this review. Like my favorite Yelper Natalie M. said: "BEST TUNA MELT....LIKE....EVER!" I'm just waiting for Cali to catch on and bring this bad boy over!Earl of Sandwich was the first place I ate at with my friends when we arrived in Las Vegas. I had the Caribbean Jerk Chicken, which is grille chicken, roasted red peppers, banana peppers, and the jerk sauce. To me it's tasty and not that spicy and I liked it. It's affordable, too, compared to all the places we would eat and go to in the course of our trip! Pretty lively even that early in the morning, but expected in the city that never sleeps.This was the first place that I went to for a meal after arriving in Vegas, even though after checking in to my hotel and walking here it was almost mignight.  With all the reviews I thought that this was a must but I do say that it was a bit disapointing.  The sandwiches were just okay, nicely prepared but the flavor wasn't that special compared to other sandwich shops.OMG this place is beyond the fabulous of the stars!!! Seriously! Words cannot explain the awesome goodness that comes out of this place. Actually, I guess I should say the line speaks for itself. Don't let the line discourage you, it's actually not too bad. But the sandwiches are oh so yummy!!Actually, the first time I had a sandwich from here, I wasn't actually there. I had just landed in Vegas and went and partied up a bit and went back to my room at the Elara. My partner was hungry and told me that they would be back. I was like what is open at this time of night. Are you gonna catch a cab? Wait, they said. No sooner had I removed my makeup and dressed into the comfy clothes, back they were with the sandwiches. It was still warm. I bit into it and was in heaven. Or as close as I could get to heaven while being in Las Vegas! At the time, I attributed the satisfaction to all day travel and some great drank. Boy, was I wrong.Couple of days later, the partner wanted to place some bets at the sports book and asked if I wanted to grab some sandwiches to watch the game. I said sure, so I stood in line and got the sandwiches while they placed the bets. When we got settled back in the room, I took a bite of my sandwich and was so wowed! So they are as good when I'm sober AND drunk! That happens rarely, so I was just awed!!When we finally had to leave Las Vegas for home, we grabbed some sandwiches to eat while we wait for security at the airport. So convenient that this place is in the Planet Hollywood Hotel and Casino. Makes going home a little bit more bearable. Ok, that's a lie, but the sandwiches are very tasty and easy to eat with all your luggage your lugging around.I would like to say I've tried most of the sandwiches. And so far, every time we've stayed at the Elara http://www.yelp.com/biz/elara-a-hilton-grand-vacations-hotel-las-vegas#hrid:NPjBgidFouwIPjezynmpgg we've gotten sandwiches from here and they've all been yummers. I definitely recommend Earl of Sandwich!!If you are drunk and you're in Vegas, heck, even if you're not drunk and in Vegas, this IS the place to be. Just try any sandwich and it will taste like heaven because 1) it's probably the cheapest thing you can get in vegas even cheaper than cheap hookers lol just kidding 2) the best drunk hot sandwich you will ever taste and 3) the best next-day hangover sandwich because you didn't finish it the night before I recommend the club or the chipotle sandwiches. The only downside is that the lines are ridiculous. But you will be with friends so the time in line will go by pretty fast.I'M SO SAD. Earl of Sandwich has definitely downgraded from the glory it used to be!I came here on my last trip to Vegas, only to find out that Earl is now only a shadow of his former self. Let me interject with some background history: I frequented Vegas when I lived in Southern California. When I say frequent, I mean at least once a month. I know Vegas like the back of my hand: I can tell you what hotels are located where, and what time each of the nightclubs' guestlists close. I was very familiar with Earl's menu. Drunkenly slurring out an order for the Earl's Cobb wrap, debating over the potato salad in the fridge, with my heels in hand at 4 am in the morning - that was my THING!So on my most recent trip, I happily approached the cashier at Earl's, announcing that I would like to order the Earl Cobb Wrap. This was what I had been looking forward to all night, post-clubbing. Not squeezing myself into a dress, not enjoying the live DJ performing at a million or billion dollar club or whatever, but shoving Earl's in my face drunkenly after a night of dancing. Then the cashier said the words that absolutely broke my heart: "We don't have the Earl Cobb Wrap".I stared agape at him. The wrap that I had eaten loyally for 4 years straight on my every trip was GONE?! Just like that?! I spent a while in disbelief, drunkenly lamenting my sadness to Mr.Cashier before reluctantly ordering a Chinese Chicken Wrap and making my way down the queue. Walking through the line, I brightened up at the thought of at least getting my potato salad. I peered into the refridgerator. And my spirits plummetted once again. What was once a generous portion of potato salad (think 6 oz) was now 2-3 oz! The same applied for the yogurt parfait - it was half the size it used to be! And surprise surprise, the prices were still the same original prices.By the time I get to the front cashier (where customers pay), I was one sad, drunken lady. I shook the potato salad in Mr. 2nd Cashier,'s face, demanding "WHY! Why did you make this smaller? What happened!!"Mr. 2nd Cashier responded tonelessly (he was probably used to these reactions), "Corporate happened."When I received my wrap, instead of the wheat pita bread Earl's wraps used to use, it was some stupid flour tortilla. Dry and definitely did not soften the loss of my beloved Earl Cobb Wrap. Bleh.And so, I shake my fist as I angrilly write this review. Darn you, Corporate, darn you! How dare you take away what was once magical about Earl of Sandwich!The wife and kids were starving and giving me angry glares as I dragged them around the strip for about an hour looking for somewhere halfway decent to eat...then I realized this place had hot sandwiches and cold beers...done and done.THE FULL MONTAGUhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/earl-of-sandwich-las-vegas?select=himxweK-gPR8lklN_7vXGA#himxweK-gPR8lklN_7vXGARoasted beef, turkey, Swiss, cheddar, lettuce, tomato & mustard sauce.  Delicious.  The wife enjoyed her sandwich...so the angry glare eventually turned into just a partially dirty look.Good enough for me.Was in Vegas for a buddy's bachelor party and after a long night of drinking/strip club hopping ;-) and gambling,  we found ourselves at Planet Hollywood.  It was close to 5am and there was still a long ass line but was glad to see it move along quickly.  Since it was my first visit, I ended up splitting two sandwiches with a friend (original and the hawaiian bbq?   iirc).  Waited for a few mins (seemed like 1/2 hr prolly cuz I was still drunk) before they paged us to pick up the sandwiches (glad there was plenty of eye candy dining in the area!!).  Thought the sandwiches were sooo good that we ended up going back for lunch which was less than 6 hours later.  Wasn't a big fan of the Hawaiian though but it's most likely due to the fact that there was pineapples in the sandwich (it was the one that my buddy ordered).I've only had Earl Of Sandwich a couple of times, but never had the Holiday Sandwich-and it's what I've been missing in my life. Holiday Turkey, stuffing, gravy & cranberry sauce, holy mother of sandwiches! Now I dream about it in my sleep thank you very much Christina Y. It was crowded and a bit messy-hey, it's Vegas. the service was nice and although the Lavender iced tea was dry and empty-someone from the back grabbed our glasses and hooked us up. A great stop on Miracle Mile for a reasonable bite-and oh that holiday sammie, more pleaseThis place is the epitome of quality food at a reasonable price.  For being located in the Planet Hollywood shops you would expect some type of large mark up here but that is not the case.  This is a fantastic deal for a quick bite to eat, quick service and delicious sandwiches.Since I knew that a single sandwich wouldn't be able to curb a Vegas sized appetite I added on the Tomato Soup which of course is the perfect compliment to any delicious sandwich.I went for the Full Montagu and Lauren V. ordered the Caprese sandwich.  If memory serves me correct I don't think we put down our sandwich after the first bite nor did we share with each other.  That leads me to believe that both sandwiches were amazing.Easy solution for anyone thinking about coming here: just do it.  It's a steal for the quality of food.I met friends here for breakfast before a desert excursion.  My friends eat here when they stay at Planet Hollywood and like the taste and cost of their breakfast sandwiches.  Metting at 7 AM, there were only a few people at the restaurant.  I ordered their bacon, egg, and cheddar sandwich and a coffee.  In a few minutes, the buzzer went off and we picked up our sandwiches.  The sandwich was good.  There was a lot of bacon, the egg was good, but I didn't taste cheddar.  The coffee was very good and we each took a refill for the road.  For a quick breakfast sandwich when you're in the PH area, I'd recommend this place.I was just thinking that if I checked in to this business enough I could be the Duke of Earl of Sandwich, which would be probably the best royal title mashup ever. Random musings aside, I have to say that I must be missing whatever the hype is about this place. I visited this place three times while staying at Planet Hollywood, once for breakfast, once for lunch, and once at (ahem) maybe around 2am. At no time, sober or un-sober, was I really in any way impressed by these sandwiches. This is sort of an up-jumped Quiznos with the added bonus that the bread starts out unbaked and bakes as it's going through the conveyor belt. However the ingredients going in to the sandwich seem fairly standard for fast food quality, maybe slightly better, and the flavor coming out the other end simply wasn't there for me. Yeah they're greasy gut bombs and people like that, but coming from the land of Bunk Sandwiches (greasy gut bombs that they be), this is nowhere near what I'd consider to be gourmet or even all that great. Don't get me wrong. I'd take this any day over a McDonald's burger or similar. And compared to the vast array of gross casual food served on the strip, this is a step above. But I simply didn't encounter anything close to the 4- and -star raves people are heaping upon this joint. The highlights include that the prices are totally reasonable for this part of town, and the tortilla soup is actually pretty good. But my caesar salad had some slimy brown lettuce mix in the midst of the rest of the sturdy romaine, and both of the greasy sandos I sampled were simply that. Greasy and salty and just okay. For where it's at, I give it three stars. Anywhere else? I'd probably choose something with more flavor.Disappointed? Yes. Feel like my fellow Yelpers duped me? Yes. Confused? You bet your ass!!Don't get me wrong the Sandwiches here are alright but after seeing all of the rave reviews and 4.5 star overall rating I really do feel let down and expected way better than I got especially when they claim to be home of "The worlds greatest hot Sandwich". If you put that claim out there your Sandwiches better be pretty damn amazing. Sadly, no.The Full Montagu (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/earl-of-sandwich-las-vegas?select=bcK75Axd_C6o9qCvSOe-pw#7NJLUm9T5aCBtyZLQrdO3w) - $6.49. Yeah, it was cheap and hot but also fairly small. The Beef was a little under cooked for my liking but whatever, I know America likes their Beef still Moo'ing. No big deal yet then the Salad was also really sparse too and nothing really had that much flavor. My Husband had the Holiday Turkey (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/earl-of-sandwich-las-vegas?select=bcK75Axd_C6o9qCvSOe-pw#__Es78IE8ZJeG61x_gtvww) - $6.49 Which he said was and I quote ''fairly good''. He then went to on to tell me it was probably the best Turkey and Stuffing Sandwich he's got from a Sandwich shop but then this is only his 3rd so take that how you will.The sad conclusion I came to here is that open a Sandwich shop 24hrs a day in a location where drinking is one of the most popular activities and set your prices low you're guaranteed to get great reviews.3.5 starsThe sandwiches aren't worthy of the overall 4.5-star rating here on Yelp but they are good enough .... as snacks!  The sandwiches are small and there's hardly any meat in them to the point where you might wish you had more... or perhaps ordered two for yourself.  We got:Pastrami Reuben - I really liked this as the flavor was definitely there but was disappointed when there was hardly any pastrami in my sandwich.  If I were to come back, I'd get this one again, though, since I'm a fan of pastrami.The Full Montagu - This had roasted beef, turkey, swiss, cheddar cheese, lettuce and tomatoes.  This wasn't bad but it definitely had more meat than the other sandwich.  Again, the sandwich was the same size as the other -- small! This place is convenient if you are either staying around the strip but I'd rather drive and explore what else Vegas has to offer.  I'm sure they have better sandwiches that have generous portions of meat for about the same price.  As good as the pastrami reuban was (minus the lack of pastrami), I'm most likely to pass these sandwiches up and drive to some place else.  Worth a try, though!Somewhere between a 3 and a 4 depending on how you are getting your "Vegas " on. Nothing earth shattering or groundbreaking  Earl of Sandwich reminds me of Corner Bakery meets Subway or Jersey Mikes or Quizno's ( you get the idea) . They have an ample array of sammie offerings and the somewhat daunting line is a testament to this particular locations popularity. The line rivals In n Out except it's just the humans sans cars.  They offer soups, salads, and of course Sandwiches and  wraps. Count people watching as an entertaining distraction while you are waiting for your order to be filled.  It seems many a hangover victim are either slumped over in their chairs or recounting their past evenings exploits while waiting in line. Once you get past the line and the wait the actual sandwich's are reasonably priced and filling enough to tide you over until your next meal. I have been here a few times and I like the convenience of ordering the food to go, especially if you are staying at Planet Hollywood.   It doesn't hurt they are open 24 hours which is surprisingly hard to find even in Vegas. The sandwiches are filling and satisfying if not a bit heavy on the bread. Here is the  Chipotle Chicken with  Avocado Grilled chicken, bacon, cheddar, avocado, lettuce & chipotle sauce. I have ordered this several times and but for the 1/2 wait this one usually hits the spot. .  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=Fy71pENHo8QeE39MO55ZDw&select=iH-IwkAfh0gtGqFF23fCjw I am not sure if you can call ahead and place a phone order but that might be a way to avoid the longish wait. All in all it is a satisfying if not all that unique place to get a decent sub-style sandwich.  I will eat there avian when I am at PH but doubt I would go out of my way to grab a bite at Earl of Sandwich.Earl is delicious and always a great choice when your looking for sandwich sustenance!I've been to Earl many times mostly the Downtown Disney location in Anaheim every time it's always been quite good and hit the spot!My favorite sandwich they have here is the chipotle chicken avocado it's packed with flavor pieces of avo as well as a thick savory mildly spicy sauce and just all around good!They have a few soups as well of these I chose the broccoli cheddar it was flavorful with a few chunks of broccoli inside.This location is right on the strip and easy access from Planet Hollywood Casino it's open 24 hours and they have breakfast too!The line moved decently fast and our food was super good you know ill hit this up again when I'm in Vegas or the other one that's closer to home!There's always a line at every location...This place is great hangover food aside from soup.  The chipotle chicken sandwich tasted so good, even when eaten later as left overs.  Just wish they put more meat in it.  Those who eat a lot like me need to get 2 sandwiches.Never thought I'd say this, but damn, my feet hurt. After running in comfortable and minimalist running flats for the past 2 months, I have no idea how us wimminz survived on Vegas dance floors for 4+ hours. Oh, right, dancing under the influence, dancing impaired, or whatever you called it? "I can't feel my face when I'm with you" followed by "I can't feel my feet/legs when I'm drinking too".And then we make our walk of shame out from the taxi line to Planet Hollywood (see, no one EVER thinks about the cabbie), and trek to Earl's to finish off the night. Some of us have our shoes still intact, and other are hobbling in sandals or sans shoes (walk of shame, I tell you!) and keeping our fingers crossed that the line won't be like the line for a ride at Disneyland without the coveted fastpass. Well I'll be damned, the line was short and it's a sign that we must eat here. We. Must. MEAT. Here.Toasted Tuna Salad Sandwich on Wheat Bread, best combination evarrrrr. Berry chicken salad is pretty tasty too, especially when substituting the balsamic vinaigrette dressing for the peanut dressing 'cause we ain't basic. The sandwiches are NOT the best sandwiches you will ever MEAT. They're excellent for carbloading after a long night, dipped in the scrumptious tomato bisque soup. Prices are cheap for Vegas, and pretty filling too. Yea, we all know why you're here, and it's NOT for gourmet sandwiches. A bit overrated, but I think the hype lies in availability and consistency.Shoutout to the employees for still helping us with smiles on their faces even at 4am and not judging us. Or maybe they are, because they've all been there. We've all been there. We're still there. And we just can't help ourselves.MEATWICHES.Maybe it's bc I'm an east coast sammie lover or I wasn't toasted when I ate here, but this place is average as can be for me. Sorry, Earl, your hours aren't getting you any extra stars here. So many places in the Vegas are open late, so that's not special. Speaking of not special, the sandwiches here... add them to the list. Are they good? Sure. Are they great? No. Call it a step above Subway (2-stars) and a Step below a Capriotti's (4-stars). I do appreciate the price point (I just payed $19 for an omelet elsewhere), but, to me, Earl isn't really pulling me into PH anytime soon. In the area and need a quick bite? Do it? Taking transpo over here just to get a sammie, you been bamboozled, homeslice.YASSS EARLS! 4,300 reviews! Pick a sandwich...Substitute what you want(ex: cheddar instead of Swiss). Wait for your buzzer to go off.. Get your golden nugget... Enjoy the best Vegas fast food!!!The wait actually kind sucks -hence 4/5- I left to go buy whiskey/vodka/AND rum for our room before my sandwich was ready. But the bread on the sandwich is the best I have ever had...The food is cheap and satisfying! This is a vegas staple that deserves all their good reviews!Hint: order at the counter on the left, pay on the right!I don't know what it is about this place that makes it taste better than the one in downtown Disney.Maybe the yum bread that soaks up the alcohol in your tummy, the craving of something carby and filling after a night of dancing, the big chunks of avocado they put in the sandwiches, or that tummy chipotle sauce they use in the chipotle avocado sandwich... Whatever it is, it can def give MSG a run for its money. It is decently priced, especially being in a casino, and a good stop for a good old sandwich and chips. Don't let the line deter you away... It's open 24/7. Holy moly.Came to this location and couldn't have been more disappointed. We ordered a the register and there was a ton of employees working here. I was so impressed with how efficient things seemed to be running but after ordering we waited, and waited and waited over 25 minutes for a single sandwich. When we asked where our order was, no one knew. We insisted to get a refund since it shouldn't take close to half an hour for a single sandwich. I'm sad we couldn't try Earl of Sandwiches since my extended family spoke so highly of them when they went to Vegas. I guess come here if you have an hour to waste on "fast food".

First time trying and will probably be the last time EVER. I came in and ordered a panini togo. After 5 minutes of ordering they tell me they ran out of turkey so they will give me chicken, how the heck can you run out of something when it was in the morning, not even the afternoon nor was it busy. the restaurant had about two tables, so I was hopeful the kitchen would finish my food under ten minutes. I was wrong it took about 25 minutes to get my sandwich. Not only did it take forever, they just handed me a box when it was done. Do they not have bags? wheres my fork for my salad wheres my napkins? The food, was nothing special, had a box full or arugula and a mediocre sandwich.. Maybe I'm just being picky..  but it was such a horrible experience I really did have high hopes...If you want good sandwiches, FRESH desert, and good drinks; I suggest going to Sugar and Spice down the road they have never failed me.This place is somewhat schizophrenic, but I can't stay away. The decor is Austin Powers meets the Lilliputians. Once you get past the unkempt entry way-gelato bar- espresso station, you are confronted with vibrant orange trim, odd round booths, low slung tables with semicircular chairs all intersected with a long diagonal bench providing high top style seating. A slight hipster feel, interrupted by what some might see as politically incorrect (I find it awesome) throw back military art. Unique doesn't seem a strong enough word. They roast their own coffee which is top notch, make their own gelato, and have the most amazing wine and beer selections in the area. If you want a Bud Light, go somewhere else. But if you want an artisanal wine, or a Quadrupel beer (St. Bernadus) this IS the place for you. Just a fantastic selection of IPA. Weiss, Stout etc...Their motto is "no crap on tap".  Pair a nice brew with their fantastic garlic parmesan fries and just enjoy the eclectic music and environment. The menu is just like the decor, varied and maybe even odd. They have excellent, albeit limited, breakfast selections. The breakfast selections; breakfast burger, paninis, bagels and burritos are wonderful. They also boast crepes, scrambles and skillets which we have not tried as of yet.Lunch: Burgers (Angus, hand made, juicy), salads, roast beef and turkey sandwiches, paninis, including the VIPR panini (Pastrami, havarti chive cheese, brown mustard). Then there is the wood fired pizza oven (Sopresseta pizza is my personal favorite).  I told you...unique. But everything is super tasty.Dinner is really the lunch menu with sometimes nightly specials. Last night's special was pork chops with a berry compote, risotto, and asparagus. Since pork chops are not on their regular menu, this is not the "take a dollar off of our normal menu price, and call it a special" special. It is a no kidding. unique menu item.So, the downside. They regularly run our of things, and occasionally substitute another item without warning (thought you were getting potatoes with your breakfast..ha!...here are some sliced strawberries and cantaloupe instead). The service can run slow, and management does not aggressively keep their staff moving. The place is just what it appears to be; a restaurant/gelato bar/coffee house/pizza joint/wine bar/brewhouse. A bit confused...but what do you expect when a fighter pilot opens a restaurant? I still can't stay away....I'm sorry but the service here is terrible!  And the food is mediocre. Been several times and every single time I am actively ignored for upwards of 10 minutes especially at the bar. The ONLY reason we keep going back is to fill our growlers with beer. In the coffee shop up front they keep all their supplies and back stock where everyone can see it. Very messy. I wouldn't waste my time or money hereI cannot believe that such a great place can spiral to such a bad thing.  I have been coming here for years.  They were at a different location and it seems like their new spot just hasn't had the same appeal. In the West Valley it is near impossible to find a spot with good beers and wines and this place has so much to be desired because they have the beer and wines, but the horrible service and food just leaves you disappointed. The staff just have no attention to the customers and at times they are understaffed.  I understand the constraints of staff but maybe a different approach to leadership can help this place because the clientele is still coming in but even talking with people I know, everyone agrees the service is just bad.After hearing and reading all kinds of reviews, we decided to check G C out.  A Saturday early afternoon.  Sat at bar.  Had The Worst customer service by the bartender.  No smile, no suggestions.  Husband ordered a draught beer.   I ordered a cocktail that had about 3 ice cubes.  Asked for a lime + was told "oh i dont have any cut right now."  What?!!!  So Cut One!  Lazy.  Left after 1 drink.Fourth time going here. 3rd time leaving agitated. Last time I'll try the place. For the life of me, I can't imagine why they'd continue to hire people who just don't care, don't want to help, and seem bothered by a persons patronage.Very disappointed as I live so close and there's so few options out here. But, I give up on this place - service is just too awful!Despite a stellar beer list, and what looks to be a delicious and unique menu, I cannot promote this place. I have wanted this place to be good for so many reasons, but they fall so short in food presentation and taste and fail miserably in service. I have visited Ground Control more than 10 times because it seems so promising, but every single time I've been there, I have had to wait extensively to even be acknowledged after sitting down at a table, and then again to have my order taken and then throughout any meal for any other service like napkins or silverware or a refill on my drink. The food has either been over-priced for what's on the plate or prepared just under mediocre in quality. I've had burned pizza, under-cooked pizza, tiny portions, and soggy salad. At one of their beer event nights, they ran out of glassware and had no resolution or even condolence for the inconvenience or wait. And then, there was no one wait staff assigned to my table and so again, no one took accountability for my experience or my orders. On that same night the bartender was extremely rude when I stopped him on his way back to the bar to ask for one simple request (since I didn't know who my server actually was). He told me he was far too busy to assist me and when I asked for management, he shared some choice words with me and then I was approached by a young lady who was equally as rude. Rather than hear my concerns, she immediately defended the actions of the bartender and wanted nothing to do with resolving my issue of getting some service. Then, I was given fake contact information for the owners of the establishment. To this day, I have not been able to connect with owners to discuss my disappointing experiences there. Great concept for a restaurant, but a huge disappointment. They get praise for their  beer list and if that's all there was to an establishment experience, I'd have more stars to hand out, but there are just too many other glaring defects that no brew (or even several brews) can fix.

Review Text :
It's been a while since I last Yelped.It's not for lack of trying, it's just that .... well, none of the new places that I have tried out have really moved me enough to even bother to click a few buttons to give a mediocre rating to.  Yeah, it's been that kind of a ride for me the past few months.But, like all slumps, this one had to end and boy, what a slump breaker it was!  Creamed spinach in my teeth, BBQ sauce all over my face and my hands smelling like I had been tending a bonfire all night.  It. was.GLORIOUS.Here's the breakdown: (what we ordered tonight)Me - Beef Trio (2 Beef Ribs, Brisket and Tri-Tip)  The brisket and tri-tip were both very tender, very juicy and practically melted in my mouth.  There was even a moment when I had a slice of brisket at the end of my fork and I was trying to pick up some of the dry rub off one of my ribs with it and it practically disintegrated.  It was THAT tender, yet very lean and not fatty at all.  Creamed Spinach - You can tell that it's made fresh, not thawed out from a frozen glob.  My wife hates cooked spinach, but she LOVED the creamed spinach here.  It had a homemade/handmade quality to it along with everything else.  I don't know how to describe it other than "Down-Home Gourmet" Garlic Mashed Potatoes - Very VERY flavorful the whole way through.  You can also tell that it's hand-made, not powdered, with skins and all, just the way I like it.  BONUS!Sweet Potato Fries - With Honey and Cinnamon! it's almost a dessert! This is the only place I have found here in Las Vegas where the sweet potato fries are crispy and not soggy, definitely one of my favorites. BONUS +2Sweet Tea - One of the staples (Brisket is the other) that I HAVE TO try out at every new BBQ joint and weighs very heavily in my final tally of how a restaurant ranks because I down these suckers non-stop and Adam's did not disappoint.  It may be a little too sweet for others, but it's exactly how I like it, with a noticeable taste of brown sugar to it.  Another Bonus, these guys are just hitting me right where I live.Pulled Pork Sandwich - (According to the wife) "It wasn't greasy or fatty, it was just pure tender, juicy meat with a nice soft bun"We actually got a chance to speak with the Owner, Adam (Who also owns the Freakin' Frog on Maryland Pkwy) and he was very friendly and informative.  He introduced us to their various sauces and their incredible dry rub.  The regular sauce was a little too sweet for me, but then again, I never do regular sauces and always go for the hot stuff.  Their hot variant "The Slow Burn" is not an in-your-face kick you in the teeth super-hot insanity sauce.  Think of it more as a fine Sake`, deep subtle flavor (Very flavorful) with a slow burn that gradually builds at the back of your throat and catches you unawares, kind'a like the way good Sake` creeps up on you and then BAM all of a sudden, you're drunk.The Dry Rub though, was definitely the star of the various condiments.  According to Adam, it is salt free (I believe he also said that they try to use as little salt, if any, in all of their dishes) so you can pile it on as much as you want and not feel guilty about your sodium intake.  The flavor just made my mouth water even more  it was so subtle, yet complex.  It was the perfect complement to the Brisket and tri-tip.Look, I can just keep going on and on until my fingers get worn down to nubs, but here's the skinny.  I like me some BBQ and I definitely LOVE me some beef ribs, DRY (No sauce) Since that's the way to really tell how good a restaurant's dry rub is.  Lucille's Smokehouse taught me that and that's how I've been judging my ribs ever since, by how they compare to Lucille's and I'll be brutally honest, I like Adam's ribs better than any other BBQ place that I have tried in town, yes, even Lucille's and CJ's.  Everything we tried just tasted home-made  and not like it came off an assembly line.  These guys put a lot of love into their cooking and it shows.  Just give them one chance, you may just find yourself a new favorite BBQ place like I did.

Restaurant name  Tea Infusion

Review Text :
Every time I go waltzing around The District (ahem, twice) I make sure to stop by this hidden gem for some extreme iced tea action. I use extreme in the sense that there's 100s of options that all end in AWESOME. White peach iced AWESOME, iced pomegran-AWESOME, four AWESOME berry tea, creme brulAWESOME. And those are just the flavors I've sampled. I could be "The Richmeister" from SNL while lavishing praises upon these teas.Going with the white peach-a-rino, iced pomegrana-rama-ding-dong, the creme brulee-ster, four berries? Berry nice. Makin' the copies...But I digress.Tea Infusion has an awesome location in terms of drawing in business, so all you naysayers that are poo pooing its place nestled among chain stores can just shut it. From a business perspective it makes perfect sense. People get thirsty when shopping, especially in the desert, and this place appears like an oasis on the horizon. If it was a dinky little independent establishment it would never receive the exposure that it does at Tempe Marketplace and probably would have a hard time staying solvent, regardless of how much we adoring Yelpers build it up. So I'd rather laud the smarts of a business man who broke through the corporate mold and managed to offer an independent and hip lil tea shop amid the brand name wasteland that is Tempe Marketplace than complain about it. It's so nice to step into this place, breath a sigh of relief and shake off the oppressive crowd of consumers (and anklebiters) waiting just outside that door, especially if it's a weekend evening. And I've got to say that a nice cuppa makes the window shopping, caterwauling live band, and gaggles of giggling adolescents much more enjoyable.Aside from a tea selection that puts China Mist to shame, they offer some munchitos that I've never indulged in like sandwiches, sides and scrumptious looking desserts. One day, Tea Infusion, one day.The only complaint I have is with the staff. I understand you don't make much and sometimes customers are devilish. I've been a barista before. But that's no excuse to neglect your customers or the cleanliness of your establishment. I went on a Saturday night and one chick was very loudly and obnoxiously chatting up a customer, leaving her coworker to fall behind when handling group after group of people by his lonesome. The counter was filthy and cluttered with tea paraphernalia, smoothie stuff, dirty steeping devices, and milk that someone had neglected to put back in the refrigerator. I wanted to jump behind the counter, tidy up that terrible mess and help a dude out, then give that flirty flit at the end of the counter a piece of my mind. I get the disenfranchisement you feel when being paid slightly over minimum wage, but have a little respect for customer service and the integrity of your shop or you won't have one to report to for long.I finally made it to Tea Infusion yesterday for November Yelp Office Hours... We had a nice turnout and it was fun to see all of the different tea selections everyone made.  I started with an iced pumpkin chai tea with soy milk and boba - it was fantastic!  Each sip made my taste buds tingle with delight!  A few people had smoothies, and some different hot tea selections too - there is so much to choose from, it's kind of overwhelming!  A few hours later, Sarah G sold me on an iced green jasmine tea - it was also wonderful!Christine and Brandy took care of our group and they were sweet - 4 stars for the service.  5 stars for the tea and the huge selection!  3 stars because they were not open when I arrived at 10:30; the doors didn't open until 11!  (So if you plan on stopping by Tea Infusion in the morning, you may want to call ahead of time to make sure they are open).  Overall, 4 stars!  Free wifi and food offered too... I'm sure I'll be back to Tea Infusion - check it out next time you're at Tempe Market Place!I swear I NEVER like to leave a bad review based on just the service. I've been to teainfusion several times,  not because their whack fake boba is that good, but to see if every employee was rude or maybe I caught them on a bad day. I understand hemorrhoids, headaches, tummy bubbles, and domestic issues.  I know everyone has a bad day. Well this place has a freakin' black cloud just chillin over it! Everytime I step in this joint, it's clear that the person behind the counter feels inconvenienced by having to actually make my order. Seriously, I'm ordering a chai tea with boba, not baked alaska. The worst part is I'm in a pissy mood when I leave the place. So I gave it a try and the only thing that comes to mind...... treat me like ass once, shame on you. Treat me like ass twice,  shame on me. Treat me like ass three times, and I'm calling you out. Get a grip tea fusion you are not the only spot in Tempe Market Place, your tea is mediocre at best and your boba is not even legit. I sincerely hope the managers take this review into consideration. And, on one last personal note, If I get another pair of eyes rolled at me when I walk by the store I'll personly sit outside and hand out samples from paradise bakery, coffe bean and juice it up smoothies! All of which offer tea.

Review Text :
After a long rainy day stuck inside I had worked up an appetite and it was time for another BBQ run.Being closest to my house Buckingham's made it 1st on my list.This place is in a great location right next door to the movie theater.As you enter you are greeted by a very friendly asian lady and a large dining area with boothes along the walls and western decor on the walls.They have quite a deisplay of trophies & plaques touting their accomplishments & merits.I ordered a pulled pork sandwich w/2 sides for $8- I also got horseradish cole slaw and mustard potato salad.This place is for real. Great smoky taste, the pork was slightly crunchy but very moist & tender. The BBQ sauce was spicy with some real zip to it.The cole slaw was the biggest surprise. Horseradish-very spicy but crunchy and delightful. The potato salad was incredible too.I saw an order of ribs and they looked like some of the best I've seen. I will be back to give them a try.For now I'm off to my next BBQ destination.........

Review Text :
Next to Last place on my list of BBQ places in Las Vegas & some pretty mixed reviews BUT ..... I immediately liked the place the chopper w/smoker sidecar by Orange County Choppers/American Chopper & I liked the modern design with flat screens easily viewable from every seat and large comfy booths along the wall. There were a few large groups already eating and the BBQ looked great BUT... I decided to try a couple sandwiches this time & skip the bbq-the table right next to me ordered a 3 meat sampler with brisket,ribs & pulled pork & it looked fantastic. I ordered the B.L.G.F.T. or Bacon Lettuce Green Fried Tomato and a side of mac & cheese, the wife ordered a pastrami with mayo coleslaw. I tried all 3 of their trademark sauces and I thought they were all good, each had it's own distinct variation. We both ordered sweet tea which was pretty damn good but a little warm. The place was only 1/2 full so service was pretty fast & the waitress was very informative. The only complaint is it is way overpriced.$14 sandwiches...BUT.... Monday-Friday 5-9 they have all-you-can-eat BBQ for $30. I will have to go back & give it a go.So bummed to see that RUB is gone. Got drawn in by the cool bike.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zKC3gRFQ8eRU8oRXENAEaA?select=ed8NbVr26_qtR-MXHyYTUg#ed8NbVr26_qtR-MXHyYTUgRighteous Urban BBQ had the best Burnt Ends I have ever eaten. PERIOD!I came here to the Rio a couple years ago for work and had to stay for several days. Day 1 RUB, server pointed out the Burnt ends. Game on Guinness and a plate full of BE's. I crashed out after that meal.  Line at seafood buffet way too long. Go to RUB and have another delicious meal of BE's and onion strings and more craft beer. Night #3 went back for some more, of those orgasmic ends.RIP RUB!

O'Donoghue's is quite a smooth, chill place. $2 HH beers that even includes things like Blue Moon and Full Sail amber is a pretty smokin deal.  ...and all day HH on Saturday!It seems that if you'd like to stalk or otherwise find and meet BrianS, this is your best bet! After the recent attempts to recruit yelpers after the wine tasting soiree, a scant few of us shared great company and hilarious conversation at Brian's local version of Cheers.  But since it's irish, there was plenty of craic to go along with the beer and whiskey being served.Funny I can get a better (cheaper) happy hour deal by driving from near Ghettrocenter to near Grayhawk!   8^ P

Eat Unique.  The name totally threw me off.  For some reason I had it in my head that this would be sorta like a health food deli.  And you ask...why did you think that Rachel?  Usually because I just make my mind up that that's what it's going to be.  Totally solid reasoning, right!?What I was excited about where the alternative food sub options.  I ordered a Taco Salad and instead of beef chili I ordered turkey chili.  That, in my head, was healthy.  In reality I don't think a heaping portion of gauc, sour cream and cheese added up to zero calories.  Let's also consider the fact that for a moment I thought I had ordered JUST a nacho platter because the ratio of nacho chips vs lettuce was about 20 chips to 1 piece of lettuce.  Don't get me wrong...it was really REALLY good...but it was a nacho platter.  And you know what...I am TOTALLY ok with that!  Eat Unique folks!Anyone that goes to or works at Carnegie Mellon knows that we have the WORST food options ever on campus.  They taste ok, but they're expensive as can be.  One day I forgot to pack my lunch so I wandered down to Craig and Forbes.  I wait for the bus by Eat Unique so I figured I would test it out.I ordered a spicy grilled cheese ($5.99 w tax).  I think it had pepper jack and cheddar cheese, tomato, and banana peppers.  There was supposed to be bacon, but it was either a negligible amount or they forgot it.  Maybe I was starving, but this sandwich was great.  I really loved the combination and the price is so fair.  Panera charges twice that for some of their sandwiches.This place gets crazy at lunch time.  I think I waited about ten minutes, which is ok.  If I ever forget my lunch again, I'll be back!

Restaurant name  Mark Rich's New York Pizza & Pasta

Review Text :
It was a busy day at the office preparing for trial when the boss decided to buy pizza for everyone. YAY! Nothing like ordering pizza to keep up everyone's spirits. It might usually take a while to get everyone together in the office, but not when pizza is involved. We all raced to the pizza as soon as it arrived, lovingly placed on a table by our office manager. But, something was missing. WHERE ARE THE GARLIC KNOTS?My favorite part of eating pizza is enjoying the garlic knots--a love discovered in NYC, made permanent by a bag of knots small enough to be eaten like popcorn on a long subway ride through Manhattan. Delicious, buttery wads of dough covered in minced garlic? YES, PLEASE! Dipped in marinara! Dipped in garlic sauce! On their own! They are just delicious! But, to my disappointment, they were absent.I was put in charge of calling Mark Rich's to inform them of the terrible news. The man who answered seemed to already be aware of the mistake and asked if I wanted the delivery person to run them back to the office. Well, yes, sir, that is why I called. He told us the knots would be delivered right away (we already paid for them anyways.)As I slowly ate my pizza, trying to save space for knots, the phone rang. Someone from the pizza place called back and offered to give us a credit for the knots. How kind! ...Wait. Are the knots still on their way? No? Oh.Is this a refund?A credit for a future order.Oh.I don't enjoy ordering knots, not getting them, being promised knots, and being told I can have them later. Why would we order from them again if they didn't get our first order right? It's one thing if you get compensation for a mistake, but this wasn't the case. I almost gave them two stars because the pizza was pretty good, but poor service drives me up the wall. I understand that mistakes do happen, but to make a promise and renege due to laziness or any other reason is inexcusable.Nastiest, soggiest pizza ever. Was like Wonder bread with sauce on it. Crust was completely soaked. Could barely separate pieces, it oozed grossness. Watery sauce all over the place. Was like a culinary school, epic fail, mistake. Would love to eat any chain's pizza over this. Made better pizza with kids at home with a 99¢ roll of pillsbury dough. NEVER EAT THE PIZZA, unless you are on a diet, its too gross to swallow.Our family dined here this past weekend for an early dinner.  When we arrived, the restaurant only had a few patrons, so we were seated almost immediately of walking in their doors.  The waiter who greeted us and took our orders was friendly enough.I decided to order a cheeseburger and french fries along with a root beer.  I know what you're all thinking!  Here I come to an Italian pizza and pasta restaurant and I order the most American item on their menu.  To my defense, my husband chose the restaurant as we were looking for some place quick to eat before our show.  I wasn't in the mood for pizza, the pasta seemed too heavy as I wasn't very hungry and the salads didn't sound too amazing.  They all came with raw onions, (Yuck!) and their descriptions sounded as if they were all made with filler iceberg lettuce, as I like to call it.Of course I was given a Sierra Mist in place of my root beer.  The waiter quickly dashed off, and I was too tired to say anything.  A half an hour later my cheeseburger arrived very dried and sad with no cheese.  Maybe I should have ordered one of their salads, and requested no onions.The only saving grace for this restaurant is that they brought out some wonderfully soft dough on a cute pizza plate to keep my daughter occupied while we waited for our meals.#90 / 100Yelp 100 Review Challenge 2014The stuffed pizza slices are the bomb- it's basically a thinner version of a deep dish style pizza, with cheese and meat stuffed between two crisp layers of crust. They're around $5 each and easily make a lunch, served with a cup of marinara for dipping. The salads and pastas here are not their forte- maybe it's just the dressing, but the antipasto salad had ample toppings but nothing interesting going on flavor-wise. Meat quality seemed just so-so, and the "house italian" looked like it was packed with herbs but tasted more like plain oil. Fellow diners who opted for pasta specials mentioned that they were overcooked and mushy rather than al dente as expected.They have a limited list of lunch specials ($7, five options) and outdoor dining tables with umbrellas. Though it's set up as though you walk in and order, then wait for your food to be brought out, they only do takeout orders at the counter and if you are dining in, you have a server. Beer and wine are available.

Whataburger...how I love the name and I don't know why. Open 24-7, which is usually a scarey thing, they totally hammer out a fresh, yummy, fast food experience every freakin time. Whataburger? I say Whatabusiness! U guys deliver a fresh In N Out experience with the hours of a local taco stand. Bully for u Whataburger people. Of course the burgers are great....no need for me for a double, a plain ole single with cheese and bacon makes me mouth water. Whata Size it and you get a super size situation. Not my thing acutally. When I'm cheating and doing fast food, I stick to the basic small order. But I can't resist the side salad. For $3.50, u get a HUGE side salad, always fresh and always eaten after the burger to help push through the grease and carbs I've just ingested into my temple. Ok, so it's not quite a temple. Geez, give me a break. Rickie introduced to the Whataburger experience and I can't thank him enough. Well, I can, and believe I do my best if u know what I mean...wink wink. Ok, ok, enough rambling...fresh fast food u actually wait 10 minutes for is so worth it. TIP: Enjoy Amy Winehouse, I Don't Want To Go To Rehab  while ur waiting at the drive thru. God...ok, don't judge me...so I had a few shots of Patron and a Corona or two....Over and Out Yelpers!

Review Text :
I guess having lunch here was a fitting way to end my latest Vegas get away: fitting because even this place has a bar.Does every eatery in Vegas serve alcohol?But no big complaints.Out of all the menu items, I settled on a simply cheeseburger and fries.With all the buffets and Asian eats, I've forgotten how good a burger could taste: seasoned ground beef cooked to perfection with a thick slab of cheddar on a toasted ciabatta bread.Good stuff.There were a couple other things that did surprise me:1) the service was attentive without hovering.  For some reason, I assumed lunch was going to be uncomfortable.  I was pleasantly mistaken.and2) they serve a popover at the start of the meal and was accompanied with a small plate of strawberry jam and cream cheese.  It was warm and tasty but I wished it was given at the end of the meal because it felt more like a dessert item than starter.Overall, I liked the NM Cafe.  I don't know if I'll return since my loyalties lie more with my trusty Nordies Cafe.

Well, what did we expect. After all, we are in an airport. But wait, now days airports are offering some pretty tastey food. Not in Terminal 3. Not at Sky Harbor. Not on this day. I'd say maybe we picked the wrong things, but as I looked around, not only did things not look so appealing, the guests were definitely not members of the clean plate club. My turkey club came with a lemon garlic mayo (yuck I say) and was served on a thick ass hoagie roll with 2 thin pieces of microwaved bacon, 2 thin pieces of processed turkey (think Lunchables) and a disc of american cheese. More bun than stuff easily. Rickie ordered the Philly Cheese and we quickly renamed it the Silly Cheese. Again, way more bread than the good stuff. The fries were so so but the pickle, well thank God for that pickle, cuz it sustained me through the first screaming child on our flight (see review below...if you're brave enough). I settled for 1800 as they didn't have Patron. Rickie settled for a Dos XX as they didn't have any vanilla vodka nor Franjelico (some of the fixins you need for his fave drink - updide down pineapple!). Our server, a bit stand offish at first quickly warmed up to us as she realized we were fun gay guys at the beginning of a trip with vacation money burning a whole in our Diesel jeans. A couple of rounds later we were singing a medly of American Bandstand hits and heading out the door for our flight. Buzzed but still hungry.

Definitely love the feel of the place and that they have free wi-fi and ample outdoor seating. Always a fan of independent coffee shops. The iecd chai-latte was delish but way overpriced as I got about 5 sips out of it due to all the ice. It's as pricey, if not a bit more, than Starbucks, and refills on just coffee was overpriced in my mind. I'm used to independent coffee shops that charge hardly anything for just coffee refills while you're sitting in the shop. They have sandwiches and other foods for lunch, too.Cool place though. Check it out if you get a chance.

TEN DOLLARS!TEEEEEEEEEEEN DOLLARRRRRRRS!Next time you have ten bucks in your wallet, aim for Bunky's STAT and pick up any one of the several lunch options that adorns their two sided menu. This place not only has delicious offerings in a cozy settings, but it's consistent, the sign of a well run kitchen/front of house. I made the mistake of breezing past the dessert case today, all of which are handmade in house. Holy tiramisu batman! Seriously, I don't know why more people aren't pulling up a chair at this joint. Great stuff on Madison's east side where we're overrun with burgers and Asian.

Review Text :
So my Son comes to me the other day and says....."Dad, I have to go to Del Taco and buy 34 Tacos for a school project"....I said "What are you trying to pull?!  What class is this for?"....he says "Health".....I laugh my ass off and ask him if he's serious.  Apparently, he was.  They were studying the nutritional contents of Fast Food and if he brought in 34 Tacos for the entire class he'd get extra credit on his project.Of course, this was too funny to pass up so of course I agreed to do it.  So we left for school a little early this morning and I called ahead to ask the employees how long it would take to make the Tacos.  They said they'd start working on it and that they would be close to having it ready when we arrived.  10 minutes later we arrived and they were 1/2 way done with the order.  We waited another 5 minutes or so and we were on our way.34 Tacos ($14.33).....extra credit for kiddo, priceless.Will I return?  This Del Taco has their act together....of course!This is a great location. Inside the store is clean and the staff is very friendly. They are very fast and the food is correct and hot and tasty! I love the Cheddar Quesadillas and Buritto Deluxe. AND they have Cherry Coke!!!

I went there couple times already. Personally I think it's a very good good place to hang out with co-workers and also close to where I work (as my part time job)!They have one security guard check ID before enter the bar area; then you will see a full bar in front of you with 2-3 TVs on each side. If you want avoid smoke or group of ppl, maybe you should turn left, they have couple sofa down there; or turn right if you want quiet and eat something here (because they provide 1/2 off on pizza after midnight and 1/2 on all the drinks, very very value).I love their nachos, especially steak!!!!!! Highly recommend!!!!!Easy parking + open 24 hrs + looking for DANNY ( I like his service very much)...... = enjoy a night!

Decent but not even close to 5 stars.They do well with their sandwiches (chicken parm sammich was pretty darned good) and okay with the pasta dishes, although their price exceeds their quality.DO NOT bother with the pizza -- at least not the slices at lunch time.  They're precooked and reheated poorly, creating a crust that is hard and that you *wish* was flavorless, and congealing the cheese grease up quite nastily.I will credit that even during busy lunch time, they've been able to accomodate a dozen or so people in a single party fairly efficiently.  On one occaision they put up quite a fight on the splitting of checks, but had no choice when most people had to pay by card; but on another occaision they split checks with nary a gripe.

Review Text :
There are those places that I review after one visit = mind blowing food and service which I am convinced is no fluke or so abysmal that the dogs of hell could not drag me back. There are those places that I review after a handful of visits = consistent service and food or locations I would return to and not be embarrassed to admit.Then there are those places that I have selfishly kept for my own, even after having eaten every item on their menu (multiple times) for fear that the next time I visit, I will have to fight for a table or parking spot. Bertha's Café falls in to this last group.Bertha's is a small, yet comfortable space that has clean lines and simple décor. There is a large cart that always has a sampling of the most current gossip rags, architectural periodicals, and newspapers for your enjoyment. Soft tunes play in the background and simple prints of farmers' markets from around the world adorn the walls.The food is the real focus and soul of this establishment. Breakfast is served daily until 11:00 a.m. and I would highly recommend the Waffles (served with honey butter and blueberry/maple syrup), the Roasted Tomato, Pesto Egg Sandwich (with arugula and havarti on an English muffin), or the Brioche Egg Sandwich (bacon, arugula, pesto, eggs, and parmesan). I also enjoy the Fruit Parfait which they make with seasonal organic fruit and home-made granola.The only problem with lunch is that every time I go, I really want to have multiple items. My top three sandwiches are the Asparagus & Havarti Panini (oven roasted asparagus, pesto mayo, arugula, roasted red peppers and Havarti - grilled to perfection), Roast Beef and Blue Cheese (with mayo, tomato, arugula, and caramelized onions), and the Salami Pesto and Goat Cheese (with sundried tomatoes, pesto, and mixed greens). The wraps and soups are all wonderful, but I will be honest and say the sandwiches generally win out. And finally there are the salads... there are several, but some of my current favorites include: The chopped salad - chocked full of blue cheese, applewood smoked bacon, bell peppers, avocado, chicken and green onions. The Harvest Salad which is the perfect blend of candies walnuts, apples, blue cheese, and dried cranberries. Or the Curried Chicken Salad that is mixed with pinenuts, and dried cranberries.Most of the salads can also be ordered in a wrap version. And thankfully, Bertha's offers "Lunch" specials which allow you to choose one of their daily soups and  1/2 of any salad, or  1/2 of any sandwich and either soup or  1/2 of any salad.So other than unique menu offerings, what makes Bertha's so special??  The staff is unbelievably friendly and helpful. Servings are large. The sandwiches or salads can easily be shared or make two meals. All items that are listed in a vegetarian fashion can have chicken or ham added. A special kids menu provides options for those with less developed palates. In addition to their standard menu offerings, they have daily special sides and soups. Literally everything is freshly made (no pre-packaged garbage). And finally there is the desert counter. Bertha's offers a rather large selection of freshly made pastries, muffins, cupcakes, desert bars, and some of the most incredible cheese cake I've ever put in my mouth. Some items are seasonal, which somehow makes them even more desirable, as you know you will have to wait an entire 12 months to have such goodness again.I have taken a number of people to Bertha's since first being introduced myself and have never heard anything but raves.  I really don't know how I will make it through the remodel... I'm quite sure I will go in to withdrawals!Quite simply, the food is a spiritual combination of flavors and textures. And so it is with a fearful heart and the desire to support local businesses in this time of economic insecurity that I encourage you all to try Bertha's Café. Just remember, if you see me there and the place is full, I may force my way in to your table.  : )Having just returned from another extraordinary lunch at Bertha's I realized that I neglected to mention one of my favorite things... the cupcakes! Anyone that knows me well, is aware of my long search for the perfect little cake. Well, let me just say, forget Sprinkles, forget Tammy Coe, and just head straight to Bertha's! They have two sizes. Small tasters for $0.75 and full size beauties for $2.25. They generally have three regular rotating selections and an additional seasonal offering. Personal favorites are the Pumpkin (seasonal), the Carrot Cake, and the Chocolate. Red Velvet is almost always available, but I try to avoid anything with that much dye. These little cakes are moist (can you believe it?!! a cupcake that actually has the texture of a full size cake, instead of compressed sawdust!), taste like the real thing and not just a fancified white cake dolled up on a Saturday night, and are topped with the perfect accompanying frosting pillow. The minis are perfect for parties. They are just the right size to be considered "finger food" and will allow your guests to sample a variety of flavors. Call ahead if you have a specific request and they will generally accommodate your request. If you are a fellow cupcake-o-file, make sure you stop in and give them a try. Trust me, you won't be disappointed!  ...now I have to go wipe the cream cheese frosting off my satisfied lips!!!I'm hoping that my visit to Bertha's was just on an off day... I really wanted to like it - and maybe I had high expectations but shouldn't I since Bertha's has a 4.5 star average on Yelp?  I've been waiting for this new location to be open for awhile now, and I finally made it in for lunch yesterday.  After studying the menu, I chose the Harvest Salad... $6 for mixed greens with candied walnuts, apples, Blue cheese, and dried cranberries - I modified and replaced the blue cheese with goat cheese and I added chicken for an extra $1.  I do not recommend the Harvest Salad.  It was mediocre at best.  The chicken was nasty... I pushed that to the side and ate the rest although the apples had little flavor.  I definitely had order envy upon seeing my friend's turkey sandwich.  That is the way to go - next time I'll for sure go with a sandwich or a soup/sandwich combo.  The cashier was extremely slow... I think it must've been her first day on the job.  We were patient though.  Hopefully she will get better with practice and the next time I visit, the process will be smoother... and I know what NOT to order now, so I'm hopeful Bertha's will live gain an additional star in my book upon my next visit.  Perhaps Berthas for breakfast is the way to go?!Wow, what a disappointment Bertha's turned out to be.First off, they need to take the sign down from their old location, which I went to, and drove around like a chicken with its head cut off looking for the place.Second, their online menu is not current. I went here because of the tasty-sounding Buffalo Chicken wrap which they no longer have. (The menu picture that someone posted on Yelp is way too tiny to read)Third, they forgot my fruit salad ($3) which I didn't realize until I had drive all the way home. I called to inform them of their mishap and the woman on the phone was confused as to what they forgot. She kept asking me what I ordered and didn't understand that THEY FORGOT MY FRUIT SALAD. Ugh. Annoyed.Fourth, my salami was served on a stale ciabatta, It was overloaded with goat cheese on one half and skimped on the other.  The amount of salami was skimpy as well.Fifth, the sandwiches don't come with chips.  I am a firm believer that all sandwiches should come with a side, and I am grateful to places that include them in the price.Sixth, the red velvet cupcakes were dry and the frosting was mediocre.  Not cream cheesy at all.6 mishaps and Bertha's gets one star. On a good note, their cookie that came with the sandwich was delicious, as was their passion tea.Don't waste your time.I don't know why I do this to myself...How long does it take to make a bowl of delicious and nutritious oatmeal, complete with cinnamon, nutmeg, maple, raisin's...you know something good for me?I'll tell you how long...exactly 180 seconds...from scratch:)But, I got busy this morning and forgot...again!So I ran all morning long on nothing but coffee (which would be enough, some days...but not today:)By the time I got done with power yoga (on an empty stomach), I was feeling decidedly in need of some serious retox...but I didn't go that way:)I decided to try to eat something a little bit healthy...for a change:)And, since I hadn't been to Bertha's in a couple of years, and they have their new location opened up, I dropped by Bertha's to grab a sandwich re-fortify me:)I liked Bertha's prior incarnation, over behind the post office at 40th and Thomas, and I was pretty regular customer there for a couple of years.This location, this version (Bertha's - version 1.5...it can't possibly be what they intended, and must therefore be a mid-release version), is lacking in few areas:* Service - I used to appreciate that I was greeted with smile and a  "hi" when I walked in:)...not at Bertha's - v1.5...no "hello"...no "how can I help you"...no response to my "hi"...just a vacant stare until I decided what I was going to have, then writing followed by the total...that was it, followed by a shouted "ORDER" to the kitchen:(* Quality - I appreciated that they always paid attention to details, and that my sandwiches, soup, baked treats, whatever, were always well prepared and tasty...When I got my Ham and Cheese Panini (to go...I was a little busy), no bag check and no napkins when I looked in the bag:(...I asked for them and was handed a wad of napkins with little more than a grunt...I headed down the road and opened up the sandwich...took one bite and found ice crystals in the middle of the ham:(...semi-warm on the outside and still frozen inside (or did the definition of "Panini" change while I wasn't looking?)* Atmosphere - I liked the old space...I realize that Bertha's - v1.0 was small, but it was nice:)...the new release, Bertha's - v1.5 space looks and feels like the "remodeled on a budget" second hand clothing store that this space probably was...not a great room and not well done on the remodel...I was waiting for my sandwich and thinking "why were they closed for 5 months?...I could have done this remodel all by myself over a long weekend, for about $200, including the apartment white paint for the walls"I made a completely legal U-Turn (as far as you know) and went back to Bertha's - v1.5, and asked them, about the ice in my Panini:(No "oh, I'm sorry", no "can we make you another?"...just the blank stare from counter girl...I suggested another attempt at Panini-ing my panini...she took it back to the kitchen, where I heard "It's still cold" and returned a couple of minutes later with my Panini (easily identifiable by my bite marks on the corner of the panini...They microwaved the friggin' thing!!! :-(I headed back to my car, and tried to eat my Panini...do you know what microwaving does to thick crusted Italian rolls?...It turns the crust to concrete, is what it does.I was starving and I still only managed to get through about  1/4 of the Panini.I think I am going to wait until the next release of Bertha's, to reload.It could be that both Bertha's - v2.0 and Windows 7 will surprise and delight me...but I have my doubts.This little place is great!  I just tried it today with friends of mine at lunch...it's a cute little cafe and they bake all their baked goods...I only had the little red velvet cupcake but the frosting was delicious and the cake was so moist...the bread pudding looked awesome too but I didn't get to try it,,,I had this amazing fresh salad with chicken, blue cheese, avocado with a balsamic vinaigrette...it was awesome!  I wanted to try the thai chicken wrap because it looked yummy...I cannot say anything negative it was great!  I will be back!If you talk to any real estate agent they always give the same three words of advice, location, location, location. Another dial-a-realtor-cliche is getting the worst property in the best neighborhood. Usually if you don't follow these guidelines you may have a long hard road ahead. Well So I thought, Bertha's Cafe moved from their location at 40th Street and Thomas to a hidden corner at 32nd Street and Indian School, boy was I wrong.First step through the door you will be surprised that the carpet doesn't match the drapes, so to speak. The small space is filled with charming farm and bistro tables and a large case filled with delectable baked treats beckons you for serious consideration. It seems that even at a perceived bad location, Bertha's is one of the best sandwich places that you've never heard of. Aside from the baked goods, Bertha's offers generously stuffed sandwiches, ample sized salads and a rotating soup menu.The Asparagus and Havarti Panini is Bertha's signature sandwich and for good reason, its killer. Stacked onto fresh baked MJ Bakery bread is a composition of oven roasted asparagus, roasted red peppers, pesto mayo and havarti cheese. I opted to upgrade my sandwich with slices of roasted chicken breast which took something great and made it better. The crispy edges of the grilled bread combined with the salty-sweet flavors of meat, veggies and cheese made for sandwich perfection.I am still thinking about the Club Sandwich with its roasted turkey, ham, bacon, lettuce, tomato, mayonnaise and cheddar cheese. It's a classic that has only been improved with plenty of quality ingredients.All sandwiches are simply served with a sinful chocolate cookie, so you might want to add a small side salad to your meal. I ordered the Pesto Pasta and Peas as well as the Dill Potato Salad. Both salads smelled great from the fragrance of fresh basil to the sharp earthy dill, but were a let down when the lack of salt and pepper left these both fairly bland. The problem was easily fixed with a few shakes of each.Salads are fresh and crisp starting with the Goat Cheese and Roasted Red Pepper Salad. A pile of mixed greens is topped with pungent goat cheese, sweet roasted red peppers, tart sun-dried tomatoes and savory pesto was a hit. Thai Chicken Salad was another favorite loaded with crunchy bits of carrots, cabbage, cucumbers, peanuts, green onions and bell peppers. On top was sliced chicken breast, tomatoes and served with a side of spicy peanut dressing.While I loved the chocolate cookie that came with my sandwich, I nearly had a food-gasm when I took my first taste of Bertha's Caramel Toffee Bar. The chewy madness starts with chocolate chip cookie dough then it's spiked with loads of Heath bar pieces, caramel and white chocolate chips, so wrong yet so right.I wonder how busy Bertha's would have been opened in a prime location? With a lunch line nearly out the door on my last visit, one can only imagine.If you have a name like Bertha, you better know good food. And Bertha, well, she makes a mean sandwich. All you need to know is this: pesto chicken sandwich. Ok, I lied. You can also do a half sandwich with ANY of their salads. Most places make you get one of those pathetic "garden" salads with a cherry tomato and some carrot slices. Not Bertha. She lets you get anything from the Thai Chicken Salad to the one that comes with little grilled cheeses. It's ridiculous and I love it! Now, if she would only open on Sunday.

Review Text :
My friends and I took a short trip to vegas for the food and entertainment.  We visited several restaurants with either famous chefs or great reviews, and for some reason (cannot remember who recommended it) we also went to Zeffirino one night for dinner.I arrived slightly early than everyone else and was ignored by the maitre'd as I stood in front of her, instead she walked to a small group of people eyeing the restaurant as they walk through the grand canal shops and started talking to them.  Eventually (after maybe 10-15 mins) I decided to enter on my own and sat down at the bar for a drink.  The maitre'd did not become more effective after my friend arrived and our group of 7 (or 8, i can't remember) was sat at a 5 men booth while there being only two other occupied table in the whole restaurant.  We mentioned the seat being "too cozy" and was not acknowledged.After most of our drinks were served it took another 8 requests for my friend's "hot water" to reach the table for her tea bag.  Meanwhile, we realized that the menu was rather limited with plain pasta+marinara sauce being around $20.  The disaster is just about to begin...  as a group, we ordered 6 appetizers, 3 salads, and 6 entrees to share, but it was obvious that the staff at the restaurant felt that we were cheap for not ordering enough and their attitude was absolutely horrible.  First it was the over-cooked duck that the manager insist is done medium rare,Manager,  "We DO NOT, and WILL NOT EVER serve duck cooked more than medium rare."Us, "So how would you call this? (showing him the meat)"Manager, "That is definitely more than well-done!"Us, "and we asked for MEDIUM RARE"Manager, "But We DO NOT, and WILL NOT EVER serve duck cooked more than medium rare"Us, "Er..............."Aside from the tea/hot-water problem, and the duck-problem, we seem unable to get the wait staff to provide us with the correct number of utensils throughout the whole meal.  Although they were not busy at all, with only two other tables being occupied in the restaurant, they had extreme difficulties being us 7 but not 4 forks and 7 but not 5 knifes.  The service was simply offensive.All in all, it was a horrible experience, not a single dish was memorable.  The steak was average, all the pastas were at diner level (even Olive Garden makes better stuff), the salads were nothing more than what you can get at a college dinning hall and the appetizers were so not interesting I can't recall a single thing about them.Don't go!!!!!

A couple years ago, my mom was a given a gift card to @applebees. We never got to use it however because there really is no nearby Applebee's where we live in California. Applebees seems to be abundant in Vegas however and so it seemed like the perfect thing to do to bring the gift card on a recent Vegas trip. I ate lunch at this Applebee's location with my mom and we got the 2 for $20 deal. This actually turned out to be quite a good deal because it's plenty of food. You get your pick of an appetizer to share an two full sized entrees. We got the spinach and artichoke dip for our appetizer and for our entrees we got the Oriental Chicken Salad and the Three Cheese Chicken Penne. The appetizer came out first and was actually best eaten right away. The tortilla chips were fresh, hot and crispy and matched perfectly with the piping hot spinach and artichoke dip. I was happy to see some big chunks of artichoke in there. It was good but after awhile, I could taste that the dip was a bit on the salty side and this could probably be attributed to the cheese. My mom and I split our entrees. The Oriental Chicken Salad turned out to be a lot of food. It was very good. The dressing was nice and sweet. Fresh Asian greens tossed in a their Oriental vinaigrette and topped with crispy noodles, almonds and chicken, it was a great salad. You can choose to get crispy chicken or grilled and we chose grilled. The three cheese chicken penne turned out to be my least favorite of all the entrees. It was all pasta and barely any chicken. The chicken was just on top and there really wasn't a lot of cheese. It's supposed to have mozzarella, provolone and Parmesan, along with bruschetta, fresh basil and Alfredo sauce. I don't think the ratio of the toppings and the chicken with the pasta was too well done. The whole pasta seemed dry. Anyways it was an OK experience here! I'm glad we finally got to use the gift card and it was plenty of food. It lasted us for both lunch and dinner!

Review Text :
I've sampled a lot of late night food in Vegas. And, in my opinion, Planet Dailies is BY FAR the very best. I was so happy and comforted when staying at Planet Hollywood because I knew I had the great food here to come home to late-night. And then I'd feel better in the morning too...There were 8 of us girls staying at the Planet Hollywood hotel and, a couple nights, the 8 of us dined together at Planet Dailies at around 4 AM. The other night, I still ate here but with only one other friend who'd stayed out late with me... I could miss my fourth meal of each Vegas day at Planet Dailies!The menu is extensive and yummy (especially late-night!) and we tried everything from fries, to omelets, to burgers, to steak. The Bellagio's late-night food has nothing on Planet Hollywood's!It's a step above Denny's, for sure. Bonus points for being open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week because clearly, you'll need food after that long night of debauchery.I had the the Buffalo chicken sammich fashioned after an order of what else but buffalo wings, duh. Pulling an all-nighter and being in desperate need of refueling, of COURSE that's the item that stood out to me. I wasn't really expecting much as the place even resembles a Denny's, but all in all, I was surprisingly pleased. No small piece of rubbery chicken doused in some ranch-like goo made it's way to the table. Instead, I received a hefty patty of crisp, hot sauced chix, sprinkled with a good amount of blue cheese crumbles. Not fine dining by any means, but it certainly hit the spot. It was a decent size too. I only finished half and took the rest back to the hotel before heading straight back out for more trouble-brewing.... but that's another conversation entirely.A few cons:- $15 is on the pricey side for a meal that probably shouldn't cost more than 10 bucks elsewhere. It *IS* Vegas, though. I suppose that's to be expected.- SERVICE. Damn. The guy was nice when he was around, but we barely saw him outside of taking our orders and when he brought the check. I understand we're eating at 4am, but this place is supposed to be fully operational 24 hours a day. Why oh WHY did it take 30+ minutes to get our food? And if we didn't ask another server to check on our orders, I wonder how much longer we would have waited.Anyway, I'd eat here again if it was a convenience issue (which it was), but probably not by choice because of the whole when-in-Vegas-eat-GREAT-not-good thing... Actually, on second thought, I take that back. I'll probably be back out of necessity. Thems dining options are slim to none at the crack of dawn. Mmmmk, I'll stop rambling now.This was one of the restaurants inside the Planet Hollywood Hotel in Las Vegas.  It's a nice option since they have such a vast menu.  They also offer a couple of specials including all you can eat pancakes in the mornings and a prime rib special in the evening.  Unfortunately I missed out on both!Anyway, the food itself was ok.  Nothing to write home about.  Although, as I mentioned before, the choices are pretty good.  Open early and late is a big plus being in Vegas.  Costwise, I suppose it could have been a little less expensive being in Vegas for a diner, but not too bad.  Service was just ok as well.  Although our server came out right away when we sat down, after the food came out, it took a while to track him down when we needed something.  Overall, pretty ok though.Keep on Yelp'n!

Review Text :
To be honest, the worst part about this buffet was the price. $22 for lunch is just ridiculous.I dont care for champagne or Mimosas so the fact that they were included was irrelevant.On the other hand, I was impressed with the variety of foods they actually did have.I was feeling queasy (shocking, Vegas?) so I couldnt mentally enjoy most of what I was seeing.My red skin mashed potatoes with turkey gravy were bomb. The actual turkey was incredible and usually turkey sucks.The egg drop soup had the best texture but way too many peas.I couldnt think of eating a salad but the salad station was incredible. I liked that a person assembled your salads for you so no ones dripping elbow skin on top of the bacon bits.As far as entree foods, I thought an improvement they could make is not have as large quantities sitting out because the texture changes and then its no fun. The desserts were RIDICULOUS! We were seated right by them and it was torture. So many miniature desserts. It was so cool. I had a little cheesecake, a chocolate covered strawberry and a bite of mini donuts which only could have been better if they were hot.The dudes loved the ice cream and cookies which I also couldnt stomach too much of. I did taste the ice cream and it was so super smooth and creamy. Tasted like Blue Bell.Overall it wasnt bad. I would have been able to enjoy it a lot more if I hadnt been feeling like death. (:LET'S BE TRUTHFUL... Last week I decided to treat my wife to an evening of pretending to be a tourist on the Strip. I booked a room at the TI and after check-in, took my hungry bride to the buffet to graze on a strip buffet offering. I stepped up enthusiastically feeling fortunate there was no line and paid the $23 per person to get in. As we walked through the dining area I noticed about 18 diners in the restaurant (odd for a 7:30pm dinner I thought) who were not really eating much. Must be a convention of health nuts as most plates were fruit and snacks... no real food. We arrived to the line and my wife looked at me and said... "Is it just me, or does this entire place look tired?" I thought to myself and replied, "Sweetie, I don't understand why all the hot food has a dried skin on top, the cold food is shriveled, and the employees are all frowning... but that doesn't effect how much fun we'll have tonight, right? After seeing her expression, I immediately stated that we were leaving and requested a refund from the overly understanding lady at the register. Notwithstanding the terrible looking food, the strain on the faces of the line cooks resembling a Hollywood production of someone pointing a gun in their backs to work there or else... I found the saddest part to be how unfazed and prepared the smiling lady at the register was when I asked for a refund. We left, walked across the street to the Palazzo and enjoyed a great Italian dinner. PERSONAL NOTE TO PHIL RUFFIN, OWNER OF THE TII was born and raised in Las Vegas, and this was my first experience staying in a strip hotel/casino. I'm proud of our city and welcome every visitor with open arms to enjoy all the entertainment and great dining Las Vegas has to offer. This buffet, the air quality in the casino, the poor cleanliness of the room, (our room had burnt out light bulbs, yuck on the dresser, broken dresser drawer hanging out, and empty alcohol bottles under the bed and chair) and the lack of smiles on the employees faces is not what I envisioned any tourist should experience. When this property opened it was fantastic, enjoyable, and affordable, and most important the air was breathable. When we arrived in our room, my wife had to do a breathing treatment because the horrible air inflamed her Asthma. Perhaps you'll take these recommendations to heart?If you have a similar experience at this or any other Las Vegas property, please write a truthful review so the hotel owners get the message and step up their game. I would be happy to stay at the TI again and perhaps encounter an experience deserving of a glowing review, which I would be proud to post. Until then...Me and my friend were staying at the Wynn and wanted to try some buffets around the strip besides eating at the Wynn Buffet. This Buffet doesn't have a lot to offer compared to buffet at the Mirage, Caesars, Wynn, Bellagio and Cosmopolitan. It's about the size of a 2nd rate buffet located off the strip but more modern. Food is meh and service is okay. I wouldn't eat here again and would rather walk a few feet more to the Cravings Buffet at the Mirage or the Fashion Show Mall Food Court.Only went here because the hotel gave two FREE buffet coupons as part of the stay.  Please don't go here unless it's free, wouldn't recommend it even if it's a BOGO deal.  Most of the dishes were bad, would even bother going over them one by one.  Instead, here are the ones that are decent:Shrimp and chow mein noodles - the shrimp were bay shrimp and puny but the soup was actually decent and the noodles were the classic Hong Kong style.  Chow mein was not bad either, noodles are thin.Pho - not bad broth, comes with beef balls which was decent too.  They have the standard ingredients (lemon, parsley, green onions, but no basil) for toppings.Pasta station - sauces were decent, rich tomato tasteFruits station - fresh fruits, nothing frozenDesserts - they offer Dreyer's in the standard favors but also includes kona coffee and mint chocolate chip.  Crème brulee was good, nothing wrong here.

I feel like you have to be drunk to properly appreciate 3-pound burritos and $16 multi-meat and cheese tortas with silly names. I consider myself a fairly adventurous eater but chose to stick to their basic tacos and tortas and was underwhelmed. Lamb meat is dry, sauced tortas are drowned in sauce that was a bit too spicy for my liking. The un-sauced tortas made the dryness of the meat more pronounced. If they can't do the basics well, I'm not about to spring for their deluxe Frankenstein concoctions.

Well all I can say is the chicken wings we ordered were still half frozen when served to us. We told the server, he reaches onto our plate and grabs a wing off of it, then says "yea, you're right, let me tell the cook" He comes back out and takes another wing off the plate to "check if they're all cold" at this point I don't want any of the food on the plate after his hands have been in it. The nachos were very, um, creative? They had canned stewed tomatoes. Stewed tomatoes. Gross.  I asked for a greyhound with kettle one, which was basically ocean spray white grapefruit juice, no kettle one. So in closing, I'd say avoid this place. Go next door to Roberto's. You have a better chance of getting decent nachos.

Review Text :
I hate to say this, but after my experience at Eddie V's last night, I think they've gone down hill...  There was a lot of miscommunication - here's why:Upon walking in, we were pleased to see that they still offer all night happy hour on Sundays and Mondays.  (Their happy hour = 1/2 off most appetizers and I believe drink specials too).  The hostess asked us for our name and we responded that we didn't have a  reservation; that we were just going to eat and drink in the bar area. She was not the friendliest, and just nodded.  Side note - no reservation was needed as the restaurant was not busy!So, we sat in the bar area and when the waiter came to take our order (we were a group of 4), we placed several appetizer orders right off the bat and said that would be good to start and we'd add more to the order in a bit.  We also ordered drinks.  I specifically ordered my new favorite 'black cherry effen vodka with soda.'So when the waiter came back with the news that they were out of black cherry effen and didn't carry it anymore, I was a little disappointed.  No big deal though, I went with the 3 Olives Cherry Vodka instead WITH SODA.  Waiter comes back with the drinks and mine  looks like cherry coke.  I taste it and sure enough. he's given me a cherry vodka with diet coke - no clue where that came from, but he took it back and brought me (finally) what I ordered.  In the meantime. he came over and asked if we were ready to order... When we asked if the first round would be out soon, he said he didn't put it in yet as he did not think we were serious when we put the first round in.  Ugh - not funny when you're with 2 very hungry men :)We ended up ordering more and were all hungry for the first round of scallops, ahi tuna, mixed green/pear/goat cheese salad, corn and crab chowder. and crab cake.  In the meantime, we were given bread and butter, but alas, no silverware, app plates, or napkins... no big deal - we got those within a couple of minutes.  We were so happy with the first round. (except for the soup which we all agreed tasted like water and potatoes so we sent it back) that we decided to order more... another scallops. another ahi tuna, a tuna tartare, broiled oysters with a spinach and artichoke fondue, and a steak.  This time, it took an extremely long time for our food to arrive and when it did, the scallops were presented totally different and the ahi was overcooked.  Also, the waiter thought we ordered raw oysters and not the broiled ones...At that point, we were done - no need to attempt to correct the order.  The soup and ahi were removed from the bill (as they should've been - we did send them back).  I have to say, aside from the company, this meal was just mediocre.  I've had great meals at Eddie V's in the past, and hopefully this was just an 'off' evening, but I will not be running back anytime in the near future!Sorry, Eddie V - only 3 stars this time...our meal was a comedy of errors and even with happy hour all night, not worth the $$!Eddie V's recently began offering 'All Night Happy Hour'.  This is a beautiful thing for someone like me who typically doesn't leave the office in time to get anywhere before most HHs end.  Hey, the desk-bound want happy discounted stuff too!!I started the week off right on Monday by meeting a friend at the end of the day for HH.  Great decision!  The bar/lounge area is nicely appointed and even had live music from a jazz trio.  Over glasses of Pinot Noir we enjoyed items from both the HH and regular menus:Wedge salad - a nice portion of cool lettuce, topped with decadent bleu cheese crumbles and heirloom tomatoes.  Our waiter even split it for us, just to keep things fair.Crab cake - this is fantastic.  It is easily the circumference of a softball and bursting with crab.  Just crab - no chintzy filler to affect the flavor or texture.  Priced nicely for HH and delightful when paired with the remoulade sauce.I save the best for last...Truffled mac n cheese.  Let me say this one more time - Truffled Mac N Cheese.  Best. Thing. Ever.  This is really beyond description, but I will try.  A perfectly-executed combination of pasta, zesty cheeses, truffle oil and truffles too!  Don't forget the all-important 'crust' of cheese on top.  AAAAAAAGH!  Under my facade as a Responsible Grownup, there lies a 5-year-old who counts mac n cheese as one of my favorite things.  If this is the last one I ever taste, I will be happy.OK, I will admit it.  We went back on Friday, too...   Primarily for the mac n cheese.  Really.

I miss Japanese food.  I grew up in Southern California, with Japanese-American family and I'm jonesing here in the midwest for a good chicken katsu, or a decent Udon.  Kame's the closest I've come here to being satisfied.  I like it a bit better than Kamakura, and the servers are both friendly and on point.The miso's pretty good, the udon is a trifle underwhelming, but the katsu's quite lovely.  Although---you can get cheese on it?  WHAT THE HELL?  Is that a terrifyingly midwest thing?  Cuz I've never heard of this.  ICK.That aside, i'm bummed that they only have chicken katsu curry (one of my favourite things in life ever) one day a week.  I want it now ;)

This is an ok Port of Subs location.  My hubby loves Port of Subs, so we eat at them regularly all over town, whenever he gets the craving.  Some are yucky, some fantastic, but this location is right down the middle.  The staff at this location are very hit and miss.  Some are friendly and welcoming and some seem bothered you are making them work.  The store is clean and usually very well kept.  I am boring and always get the #1. I call it the Italian meat buffet because it is loaded with pepperoni, salami, capicolla, ham, and provolone on bread and it is fantastic.  I am drooling just thinking about it!  I am kind of anti-veggie, so I go with just the meat, cheese, pickles, extra mustard/mayo spread, and all of the seasonings.  It is tasty!My hubby always get the #2, which is the turkey, ham, and cheese.  He loves it and is always a happy camper afterwards.  I guess we just know what we like!I like how everything is sliced fresh for your order.  The veggies, even though I don't eat them, all look fresh and much nicer than the veggies at that other chain sub shop.  The bread is always flaky and fresh and tastes great.  They always have a huge selection of sides as well with about 10 chip types, cookies, and brownies.  I am just happy with my jalapeño chips though and really haven't tried the other items.  My hubby likes their cookies and brownies though and he gets at least 1 every time we are there.Overall if you want a sandwich quick, this is a great location to grab one and go.

In the past two weeks, my wife and I have been to this location twice. Both times, we ordered the exact same thing...because it was absolutely delicious!For our appetizer, we opted for the Caprese Bruschetta. It's topped with mozzarella cheese, and it's perfect for sharing. If I'm not mistaken, it comes in a serving of either 2.5 or 3 pieces.For our pizza, we decided we would split the Portobello & Artichoke Pizza. It's a thin crust style of pizza topped with...nevermind. You know what's on it.  Again, this pizza was perfect for us to split.Sauce has a great modern vibe going on inside. It's kind of trendy, mixed with a little hipster. So, it should appeal to many different groups. On our first trip, we sat inside. It was nice to see how the staff were so involved in the entire process. Even though it's not a "wait service" type of place, the staff didn't seem to know that. They were constantly policing the dining room, making sure every table was spic and span for the next group that would inevitably be coming in. While doing so, they were also very diligent in making sure that the clientele were being cared for.On our second outing, we managed to find space on the patio. Each table outside of the natural shadow created by the building's overhang has an umbrella. Though, there are no misters that I saw. Thankfully, we managed to find a couple of tables under the overhang. Therefore it was nice and shaded. As for the rest of the seats, they might be better suited for the cooler months, or in the evening. For both of us to share an appetizer and a pizza, plus two refillable fountain drinks, we managed to pay around $20. Not bad for such good food and service!

Review Text :
if vegas over memorial day was simonster's version of hell, and getting home was heaven, then pho at TI was purgatory.i'm not usually a fan of pho or ramen.  why?  because it's not filling enough as a meal and it's too much work as an appetizer.  literally every time i've had pho or ramen as a meal, i was still so hungry i had to go eat a proper meal within minutes or my stomach threatened to implode.after driving out to vegas and eating greasy diner food on the way, all of us were ready for something a bit lighter and healthier before what we knew would be another super rich and heavy dinner at daniel baloud, so pho beckoned us like an oasis.how ironic that the best, most filling pho i've ever had would be in a casino in vegas!  there were seriously double if not triple the amount of noodles in the bowl as i've usually gotten, and my gal at the time generously donated half of hers as well.the cooked beef in my soup was super tender and amazingly plentiful too, so i actually got...dare i say it...FULL on pho!!!  usually i just see a couple forlorn pieces floating on the top and that's it.we all enjoyed our meals so much that first day, we actually came to pho again before we hit the road to brave the mother of all traffic jams on the way back to LA!now that i'm back, i dunno if i'm going to run out and order pho again, but i'll always treasure (no pun intended) my meals at pho in TI!When you come to Pho, you have to remember this: it's all relative.I can say with much confidence that this is probably the cleanest pho restaurant you'll ever venture into.  Obviously, being located in a glorified Las Vegas casino means superb cleanliness and inflated prices.  But surprisingly, Pho still holds true to some of its typical Vietnamese restaurant roots, those being:* Sriracha, hoisin sauce, and fish sauce were found at every table * Chopsticks, spoons, and sauce platters were well-stocked at each table* Despite having only 20 items on their menu, our white lady server looked at me weird when I called out the dish name, and proceeded to ask for the item number instead -- just like in Vietnamese restaurants!Prices are definitely atypical of Vietnamese restaurants though.  $10 bowls of pho, $4.50 Vietnamese coffee, and get this, $9 banh mi!  The beef pho was not bad at all.  The broth was light and had a good clean taste.  My beef stew pho kho was tasty, but too thick and gravy-like.  The soups weren't scalding hot like I prefer, but we made do.  It's a fairly decent meal for Strip standards.There is no other casual Vietnamese restaurant on the Strip.  Pho is all you've got.  It's all about convenience.  Time is money in Vegas, and that money should be used to gamble...not spent driving to Chinatown, wasting gas and your precious time in Strip traffic to get the same average-quality Vietnamese food.  Like I said, it's all relative.Dear god! I rather have noodles with drinking water than eating here again. The service was horrible and the food was 110% crap. The pho was taste-less, the rice plates was not tasty, and everything else was dull. There was nothing asian or american about this place, for a restaurant in treasure island I expected way better. Let me start off with their service. The host was a very good one, she act like the placed was packed and took her precious seating us down(which took 10 minutes). After we sat down the waiter didn't come by for another 10 or so minutes but there clean-up boy took our drinks order.. what the heck? Let me tell you they only had 3 waitresses and they weren't the quickest ones out there. Of course they were probably ages 50 and over but that's okay I like them old. After we ordered our food, it took them over 20 minutes to get a bowl of not so great looking pho and a disturbing put together rice plate to my table. Not only the food took forever to come out, they got my pho ordered all wrong. I seriously didn't think it could get any worst but it did. The waitress took forever to just get our bills. I mean seriously what was she doing? Or what were THEY doing? where are all the little old waitresses? I'm not giving them a hard time, I smiled when they came, I asked nicely when I needed things but this is just too much. My 20 minutes lunch time meal turned out to be an hour or so. A total waste of time and money if you are planning to go eat here. This place should get more fast pace moving waiters and a better chef. I had a horrible experience

Review Text :
Ah, Bricktop's...so conveniently located near the mall but not AT the mall. This is pretty clutch, IMO, as I don't like to fight the crowds to score a salad. I've been to Bricktop's many a time - for a casual lunch to a late dinner. Every time I've visited I've been happy with my meal and the service - seriously, ever server has been oh so friendly and accommodating. Their patio is pretty great for a leisurely meal alfresco and even their bar is fairly roomy. While I've sampled a few different items here, I have a few absolute favorites:Ahi Tuna Salad: A super generous and light salad with avocado, mixed greens, mango and a hearty portion of delicious seared tuna. I ask for the dressing on the side and sometimes the greens can be a little overdressed. Guacamole: Ok, you won't believe me until you try it, but Bricktop's guac rivals Cantina's. No joke. It's really, really flavorful!Griddle cookie sundae: It's magical. It's a cookie baked in a small cast iron skillet, topped with a large scoop of vanilla ice cream and doused in chocolate sauce. It's warm, gooey perfection. I dream about this dessert. Note that it take 10-15 minutes to bake the cookie, so be patient for your dessert! It's a wee bit on the expensive side for a casual dinner, but it's tasty nonetheless. Yay for Bricktop's!For the longest time, I was under the impression that Bricktops was a pizza joint, albeit one of those "upscale" ones where they smother your wood-fired pizza with food stuffs that simply don't belong on a pizza. Salmon? Are you kidding me? But I was mistaken, and gladly so. I was pleasantly surprised with Bricktops upon my first visit, and I've been there 3 times since. And each time I've eaten at Bricktops, my dining experience has been better than the previous time. My first time, I popped my cherry there with a cheeseburger. I figure if you can't screw up a cheeseburger, then you're likely to know what you're doing in the kitchen. Bricktops passed this test with flying colors. One of the best cheeseburgers in town, no joke, and complimented pleasantly with a very generous serving of shoestring fries. First visit, color me impressed.Second time around, my family and I dined there on New Year's Eve. A bit of trepidation surrounded my dining experience at first; I've been to several NYE dine-ins that have been nothing short of awful because of the importance of the holiday and a stunning lack of planning on a restaurant's management's part. But not at Bricktops. Reservations were honored without fail, our meal prepared with the utmost attention to detail and taste, and our waiter was very friendly and attentive, despite the buzz and the clamor in the air. I opted for the Parmesan Crusted Chicken, which was wonderful. Nothing beats chicken so tender you can fork it. My wife chose a New York Strip, Pittsburgh style, which she thought was very delicious. I sampled a couple of bites. Unbelievably tasty. My daughter loved her salmon and noodles, and for eating her plate clean, she was rewarded with a bowl of vanilla ice cream. Not just frozen, store-bought ice cream, but fresh-churned ice cream, the vanilla tasting of real vanilla bean. I can't say who enjoyed this more, my daughter or me.Last visit there, I chose the veggie burger. Pardon my french, but HOLY SHIT, that is one spectacular veggie burger! Listen, just run there right now and try it. I guarantee you will not be disappointed.A word about the Deviled Eggs & Sugared Bacon: what you've heard about this sinful delicacy is true. You can't just eat them. You find yourself DEVOURING them. Order a plate for you and your sweetie, and a fight for the last strip of bacon and the last sliced egg may break out, and it's gonna get ugly. So order two plates, one for you and one for him/her. Your relationship will be the better for it.After 3 visits - and possibly a fourth coming this weekend - I can easily make the claim that Bricktops has become my favorite, go-to eatery in the Queen City, replacing my one-beloved 131 Main.Fancy restaurant that fits right in to the very spendy Southpark neighborhood. Starting with two hostesses to greet, a large and well decorated dining area, white table linen and three staffers to take care of our table (one who did nothing but refill water glasses). If you're looking to impress, this will get 'er done.We started with the goat cheese bruschetta which was more like a small goat cheese and veggie pizza as you'll see from the picture. Which isn't to say that it's not really really tasty and quite filling. You could easily have this as your main course.But we didn't. Today was a "salad" day. I went with the Cobb, my wife had their "Florida". Both were good portions of protein and were very flavorful. Interesting plating for the two salads. They must put them into a cylinder of some sort where they build the layers and then "flip" it onto the plate. It looks pretty.My only complaint is that while there was blue cheese in the salad, the dressing on the side was a balsamic and oil rather than a blue cheese dressing itself.$14 for the pizza... I mean bruschetta and $18 or so for each of the two salads. A little expensive for a late lunch but it was quite good and I'd recommend it.

I have tried this location twice now and will for sure be back. You can place your order online and it is very user friendly. I wanted to make changes to what I was ordering and there was a option to customize it so I didn't have to worry about phoning it in or ordering in person I was just able to easily and accurately place my order online. I started with a "Pork Egg Roll". These were addicting like candy. Great flavor and decent size for $2.00. I had the "Chicken Lettuce Wraps" for my meal. The chicken has such good flavor. The lettuce is fresh and crisp. This is one I might have a hard time not ordering each time. My man had the "Lo Mein With Spicy Beef". I sampled some of the noodles and was hooked. I had to steal a few more bites. The noodles weren't dry and had so much flavor. They have a gluten free menu.If you don't want to get your food to go they have a dining area.They cater.Since signing up on the website to order online they have sent me a couple good coupons good on my next visit.With all the mediocore to scathing reviews, I've always said No Way to Pei Wei. I ordered for pick up and had a very friendly, helpful, if not Jeff Spicoli sounding, employee help me with my first ever Pei Wei experience. At 9pm on a Thursday night there was plenty of parking and I found the little Pei Wei place to be 1/4 full and actually a nice looking room. The surly person (manager type) who rung up my order, must have had to much MSG as he was irritable and I must say a bit puffy. But most importantly, after devouring our take out, Rickie and I voted four thumbs up (that's two thumbs for each of us, times two, carry the one...well you get the idea) for three of the four items. So spring rolls, potstickers and Korean beef....you'll soon be hanging with us again soon. Pad Thai? Yea. You're not invited. Unless you can sauce it up a bit and find it in your heart to bring along more tofu and veggies. But I'm not counting on it. Pei Wei? Yes way for this gay! OK!?My brief review in haiku form:Cheap PF Chang's fix.Better than Panda ExpressYou can get beer here.Thank you.

Restaurant name  Hot N Juicy Crawfish
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Since returning from Houston a couple of months ago, I found myself craving crawfish any chance I get.  After experiencing the crawfish craze in the Westminster area of Southern California, imagine my delight when I saw the sign for "Hot N Juicy Crawfish" in Las Vegas.The BF and I anxiously awaited the opening of this first of its kind restaurant in Sin City and finally got to sit down to dinner the past Sunday.  Inviting a couple of newbies made the dining experience that much more enjoyable.We started off with a pound each of the crawfish in every flavor - Juicy Cajun, Garlic Butter, Lemon Pepper, and Hot n Juicy Combo.  At $8.99/lb, it was a dollar more than SoCal prices but we were okay with it.  For every two pounds you order, you get one corn and one potato.  So, we made sure we got our corn pieces and potatoes and were able to choose what flavor we wanted it in.  (In the end, we ordered additional corn and potato on the side, corn runs about 50 cents each.)  We also threw an order of sausage ($2.50 for half a dozen or $4.00 for a dozen).  Depending on the season, they should be offering Dungeness crab, Blue crab, and shrimp.  You can also order oysters, fried shrimp or oyster baskets, Catfish Po-Boy Sandwich, or a Basket of fries.They didn't ask us how spicy we wanted our crawfish, later on telling us they automatically make it spicy unless otherwise stated.  The heat was a good amount, not too hot that it was unbearable and enough where we reached for our beverages.  Of the four, I would say the Juicy Cajun had the least flavor while the Hot n Juicy Combo had the most.  We ordered four more pounds of the Hot n Juicy Combo in this sitting.  The sausage was actually spicier than the crawfish!  We also found the crawfish to be pretty clean overall.  We're ones to suck up all the juices from the heads too, so they gotta be clean.  And I gotta admit, the last two pounds we had were especially good.  They do a good job on having cleaner crawfish than other places I've experienced.Be sure to get the salt and pepper mixture too.  You get a bowl of cut up limes and you squeeze all the lime juice into the little plastic cup and mix it all together.  This is usually meant for you to dip your crawfish in, but I found myself not needing it that much.Service was better too.  Upon entering, they line your table up with the white plastic covering and lay out a roll of paper towels.  They also provide bibs too.  You can ask for plastic gloves, but they just get in the way.  They asked us often if we needed refills on our beverages and how we were doing overall.  (I would say this is probably because they are a new restaurant, I only hope they continue with this service in the future.)They had a steady flow of customers this holiday weekend night.  It didn't get too busy, but they were never empty either.In conclusion, the four of us were pleased with our experience at Hot N Juicy Crawfish.  It looks like we'll be coming back here a lot!  Yay!Side note: There's a 17% gratuity added for parties of six or more.(You can check out my food photos up above!)Fun place to go.  Service was good and you just eat everything like a viking.  I found the crawfish to be unsatisfying....too much work for such a little amount of meat but good flavor.  We had to order a pound of shrimp after we ordered 2 pounds of crawfish and a pound of blue crab because neither of us felt remotely full.  Everything tasted great though.  But I will only order the shrimp the next time we come here.  As soon as we were leaving, a bunch of poker players (JC Tran, Nam Le, Amnon Fillipi etc) came through the door to eat.  I thought it was interesting that these guys could eat at Picasso every night yet they chose to come here of all the places on a Wednesday night.So, me, my bf, and our friend roll up on Hot n Juicy. When I invited my friend, she says, "Oh, crawfish. I haven't had crawfish since Miami. We used to go to crawfish parties all they time and they'd have BUCKETS of crawfish." So I'm getting all riled up. I've never had crawfish. So we get there and each of the tables are covered with a plastic table cloth and there's a roll of paper towels. I'm like, "Aw, shet. Things are gonna get messy." So I order a pound of crawfish ($9), hot n juicy special seasoning, mild. Because I'm a pussy like that, I have spice issues. What. Bf ordered the same thing, but spicy. The waiter gives each of us a bib that says "Let's get crackin'" and has a lobster on it. Let's get crackin' indeed. I thought I was gonna be the only asshole with a bib on, but apparently everyone does it. So it must be alright. Like unprotected, premarital sex. And crack. I was looking forward to this all day long. I had a three-hour long, GRUELING work out, and all I could think about was some hot n juicy craw daddies. The waiter dropped our crawfish in plastic bags. Little crawfish in a puddle of awesome spices. When we started to dig in, we realized we didn't know what we were doing. And our friend that went to crawfish parties in Miami? Didn't actually eat the crawfish there. She just drank beer. So we asked the waiter for help and he obliged. Once we got the hang of it, it was all cherry. It just seemed like a lot of work for a small meat yield. In the beginning, I couldn't bring myself to suck the juices out of the head. But then I removed myself from the idea that they were once living animals. With eyes. That stare at you. There are places that are good for drinking beer with food. Not only is Hot n Juicy good for beers with food, its not only perfect, its down right necessary. I almost didn't oder a beer, but halfway through my hot n juicy and spicy meal, I had to get a beer. I ordered fries, too. Which came in handy in soaking up the extra juices.  The seasoning was so good. I was licking off the excess from my fingers and pulled away a stub. For the two dozen crawfish, four beers, and fries, we paid $46 before tip; average $15 per person. I would not recommend going here hoping to feast on a budget. (I hit this place up, because of Famous Teri's review http://www.yelp.com/biz/hot-n-juicy-crawfish-las-vegas#hrid:1Kovc8dDQe3xUhdKabbpFw) * off the strip, non-casinoAfter a long day of walking and shopping, we were hungry for some crawfish.  And thanks to yelp, we found a winner in Vegas!This place truly lives up to their name.  We ordered two pounds of shrimp and two pounds of crawfish...all medium spiciness with garlic butter seasoning.  We should've ordered a pound with different seasoning and heat....to test our taste buds.  I'm eyeing the Hot n Juicy Special and Lemon Pepper seasonings for my next visit.  I think the garlic butter had more garlic than butter....extremely potent!  The crawfish was very spicy at medium...but we loved it.  Some of these crustaceans were larger in size than at most places I've gone to.  The shrimp was my favorite though.  Same spices as the crawfish, but more juicy and meaty.  We also ordered sausage, corn, and Cajun fries...which were all just okay for me.  Customer service was top notch here...I just wish they were open later than 10 pm.  We learned that the Man vs. Food show will be taping at this restaurant.  With their hot n juicy menu, it's evident why this place will be premiered.Great shrimp, sausage, and corn! They serve it up to you in a plastic baggy with their spicy sauce. Be sure to wear those bibs they provide. It's gonna get a little messy...You can order your sauce mild to extra spicy. Us "wimps" ordered a bag of mild and a bag of medium (sorry, I like to enjoy my food while not having my mouth numb with fire).  Actually, compared to other places I've been to, their mild was like medium  and medium was HOT HOT HOT! but it was all good. I was still able to enjoy the taste because the spicyness didn't really bite, it just built up as I came close to finishing the bag.I prefer shrimp over the crawfish because the shrimp is meatier and well worth peeling over the crawfish. The calamari rings and fries we ordered was a nice filler to absorb some of that spice!IF you like FISH BAIT this is your place.I found several things that were really bad.1st service is slow2nd they weigh there crawfish w the sauce in the bag. so you really dont get what u are supposed to get.3rd. the shrimp are very tough and super dirty4th the crawfish a very  very dirty5th what ever spicy level you order they just give you whatever they feel like6th CASH DISCOUNT? wtf is this. you mean if i decide to pay in cash, you will give me a discount? does this mean you are doing something wrong. Im pretty sure if you stay at bally's and when you check out. The front desk says. hey if you pay with cash i will give u a discount? no way. this is called tax fraud.Rule# 1 about eating seafood in the nevada. ONLY in a hotel! there stuff is so rubbery and nasty. i really could not eat it. and i eat pretty much everything. but this was the 1 that was impossible. I dont think any real foody would disagree.my score: 1-10staff- 3menu- 2price- 2bathrooms- cant even be rated is was that bad "0"over all- Total Scam!I almost threw up the minute I walked in this dive.  What a pit.  the smell of "fish gone wrong" was too overwhelming for me.  And the place was DIRTY.  Seafood and dirt DO NOT mix.The service was awful if you are not Asia....seriously....all the Asian folks were taken care of immediately.We ordered, then I made the mistake of going to the bathroom to wash my hands before I ate.  OMG.  I'm sure I picked up masses of germs just walking in that hole.Food came, and I swear we didn't eat it.  The shrimp were so tough it was impossible to really eat.  The crawfish?  It's like someone said below...it was like fish bait!  SO dirty and what really pissed me off was that I asked for medium and instead got the spiciest hottest juice ever.  When I asked if it was correct, she just shrugged her shoulders.  Wow.Disgusting, will never eat here again and will never suggest it to anyone who doesn't want to get sick.I've been to this place about three times and I'm still not tired of it! I have also been to the boiling crab in san jose, california but it does not compare to our louisiana style crawfish! If you do not like breaking the shells of the crawfish, shrimps are the way to go! There are also various seasoned flavors that the shrimps or crawfish are cooked in, but be prepared to taste a little spice! Oh! Another tip, be prepared to wait. Sometimes the waiting list is about an hour!! But you'll enjoy it overall. It is one thing everyone must experience! You get hot n juicy bibs and you also can get down and dirty with your hands, so you can choose to wear gloves. If you also like rice with your seafood, a bowl of rice is $2.Las Vegas is Sin City for a reason; it celebrates the seven deadly sins. In Vegas, your greatest weakness or vice becomes the source of all your pleasures. We were ready to give into our carnal desires and get down and dirty, indulging our voracious, gluttonous appetites. We wanted to get stuffed with something Hot N Juicy. Hot N Juicy is known for their seafood: crab (Dungeness, blue, snow), shrimp, and of course, crawfish. You pick the type of seasoning (Juicy Cajun, garlic butter, lemon pepper or the Hot n Juicy Special) and the level of spiciness (mild, medium, spicy or extra spicy). We ordered 2 lbs of snow crab legs and 2 lbs of crawfish with Juicy Cajun at medium, 2 pieces of corn, 2 red potatoes, etouffee (a Cajun seafood stew, similar to gumbo), and a side of sweet potato fries. Eating at Hot N Juicy is not an elegant refine affair. It's messy work because they dump a plastic bag of whatever seafood you ordered and you're only protection is the plastic table covering and a plastic bib. You open the bag and dig in.The crab meat was very sweet and juicy. It was perfectly cooked. I found that the spiciness of the food depended on the type of seafood because the seasoning is on the outside of the shell. The meat isn't spicy unless you soak it in the sauce first. I found the level of spiciness in the crawfish much higher because the tail meat was much smaller and there was more shell around it, unlike the crab meat where I could pull out large pieces of meat out of the shell. Also I got more spicy sauce from the crawfish because I sucked crawfish heads. After a while my lips got tingly and numb from the Cajun spices. I've never had crawfish whole before. I only had them de-shelled. While I love crawfish and the meat was great, I'll never have them whole like that again. The tail meat is rather tiny (I like 'em big -- size matters when it comes to these things). At the end, we looked at the mountain of shell and agreed that it was more work than it was worth. Crawfish is mostly shell and I'd rather pay someone to shell them for me.Etouffee was a spicy rice seafood stew. I liked the flavor and the level of spice was just perfect for me. I thought the rice was a tad overcooked and mushy from just sitting in a pot all day, but in general it was enjoyable.The boiled red potatoes were much needed as a break from the relentless Cajun spice. They were nice and sweet. The corn is out of season, so not as sweet and juicy as in the summer, but still tasty. The sweet potato fries were crispy and tasty.The final price for all of us was $30/person for three people. We gorged ourselves on great seafood and left utterly satiated. Happy ending for us indeed.What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas. But this is one of the few times where you wish you could get crabs and bring them home with you.I can honestly admit I'm a lazy person when it comes to eating. Cutting a piece of meat with a knife and/or fork/spoon (when I'm even lazier) is probably the most strenuous work I'll tolerate. Using my fork or spoon is enough, isn't it?The ONLY, I repeat ONLY, food I'll take time to carefully work at and eat is shellfish...specifically crab, lobster and crawfish. Unfortunately, being located in the Tri State area, there is a lack of crawfish which saddens me. Since I was in town for work I jumped at the opportunity to eat one of my favorite shellfish friends...crawfish!After leaving the CES convention center, my colleagues and I hailed a taxi* and requested to go to Hot N Juicy located in Chinatown. A split second later, we realized Hot N Juicy sounded like a strip club so we joked around with the taxi driver and insisted it wasn't a peep show. We were going to that AFTER we ate.My colleagues didn't know it but I was giggling like a little school girl when we arrived. Unfortunately for them, they aren't as adventurous when it comes to food so they ordered calamari, chicken wings and fries which they enjoyed.Our waiter was extremely informative, briefly describing to us (mostly me) how to order the seafood (per pound), by seasoning and spiciness. Since I've been to Boiling Crab I already knew what I wanted...2 lbs of garlic butter crawfish with medium heat. The garlic butter seasoning is SO mouth wateringly good that I could drink it as a side (not recommended though). They serve the seafood in plastic bags with bibs and paper towels. This is the messiest meal you will ever eat but so worth it. I was in business attire but was able to leave without any stains!As I twisted and separated the head and tail, sucked the head and pushed out the meat from the tail...my colleagues looked at me in complete disgust like I was a monster. Did I feel bad? Not at all. I easily finished the 2 lbs of crawfish like a true fatty. I ordered medium heat but my mouth was on fire pretty much the entire time I was eating so to counteract the heat, I took big swigs of beer which helped. The seafood pricing on the menu says market price so be sure to ask the waiter beforehand. The crawfish was about $10 per pound. Currently, they're having a BOGO shrimp special because they opened up another Hot N Juicy location in Washington, DC. Do I hear a road trip?My next visit will showcase their blue crab legs. If you're ever in Vegas or DC, I would highly recommend coming here if you're a seafood lover and don't mind getting messy. It's a freakin' dream.A fun tip, Hot N Juicy was on Man vs. Food.------------------------------------*In Las Vegas, taxis aren't allowed to pick up passengers on streets like NYC. They have to pull into a parking lot, hotel, restaurant, etc.If I were to rate this place based on the food alone, I would give it a 4.5.. The shrimp was really good with the signature hot and juicy sauce, even better than what I've had at boiling crab *gasp!! My friends and I shared deep fried soft shell crab, catfish, and fries, which were all really yummy.What brought it waaaay down for me was the HORRIBLE service! We went to eat there on a Saturday evening, so we were expecting it to be really busy, but it wasn't. Thought that would be a good thing because our server would probably have more time to be attentive, but NO! My friend's mouth was on fire from the spicy sauce and had to ask for a coke refill 4 times before a different server finally came and refilled her cup, I had to ask for water 3 times, my other friend's plastic bib broke and she had to repeatedly ask for another before someone finally brought her a new one.When I received my bag of shrimp, there was a hole in it and juices were leaking everywhere. I politely asked the server if I could have another bag just to place the one I already had inside because I didn't want to lose all the sauce to my table, and he replied with a horrible attitude, telling me I wouldn't need one because it would be messy anyway. I then replied with, "Can you just get me a bag like I asked for please?" And he proceeded to throw his hands in the air, say "Fine," in a very sarcastic tone, and just threw the bag on the table. Um, excuse me?? First of all, I wanted to save my delicious sauce for my rice, not for licking off the f*cking table, DICK. I wish I ordered crab instead of shrimp so I could use the claws to attack him.Overheard the tables next to ours complaining about the bad service and the unnecessary attitudes as well. I hope the management at this establishment figures out a way to properly train their employees to be helpful, attentive, and polite. Until that happens, I won't be returning to Hot and Juicy.Wow! I can't believe that it took me this long to finally try this place.  It has been a long time dream of mine to get down and dirty! Hot n Juicy and lemon pepper shrimp at one pound each with a side of white rice. In addition to skin peeling, eating with my hands, sucking the juice out of the shrimp heads, licking the juice from running down your fingers, and drinking the juice from the bag after devouring the shrimps; while all were sitting in my tummy and with a side of beer was EPIC!!!!I have finally had the chance to check this place out and what a disappointment.Let me start by saying... our waiter, Nick... DAMN. It was almost like he was fed up in being there and just didn't give a fck. Once we sat down, he came and yes... threw out menus in our face, threw sugar bags down on the table, and asked us you guys want anything to drink?! Daaaamn serious?!?!! Why Boo??!! WHY??! Wow okay... . Came back with our teas and took our orders.. that's the last time we saw his face. It took numerous attempts to get a runner, server, whoever worked there to ask for refills, which finally was able to be refilled, but with regular tea when I had Raspberry. Nasty... The whole time we were there... our throats were like a desert and our drinks were empty.. so damn empty,  the melted ice made a few gulps of replenishment to get us through our meals. We had to ask for gloves, we had to ask again for our pepper and  limes on the side, which our server never brought, and we even had to ask the next table to please get their server's attention for us after she was done giving them their food orders, just so we could... Ask. Even our tools to crack open our crabs were not the right tools, but after trying to get a server's attention. It was more tiring to wave down a server than tear apart our meals. From the frustration on the service here, I tore the crab legs with my own bare hands and ate like an animal. Tearing it with my own straight teeth!!! Grrr!!! I ended up doing the.. break the shell with my fingers and gently wiggle wiggle the meat out. Several times I showed my great company that I conquered a looooong piece of crab meat Ha haaaa! But then she shows off her piece, which was thicker and longer than mine!!! Oh yeah?!??!!!! I had that Ooo impressed face and nodded my head. We entertained each other... But never once were we checked back upon to see how we were doing or we needed anything. It was literally the worst service for a fun-filled environment. I heard their other new location has better service, but this experience makes me think twice to even want to give them my business.The food was the only thing that made me want to give Any stars to this establishment. The sweet potato fries was excellent in texture and taste. The shrimp, crab, and side of sausage we ordered were full of spice and with the combination of asking limes on the side to make your own sauce.. it tasted refreshing, sweet, spicy, peppery, bitter, and ended with a great bite from the acidity of the limes. Don't forget to ask for those pepper and limes on the side.. makes a great impact with the flavors of the spices that were cooked in with the crab and shrimp. Even if you have to hunt someone down that worked there to get it! I will note that the food deserves high remarks. However, due to the lack of service we received here, it's unfortunate to give it such a low rating. But I must speak the truth and the service here was... non-existence. Damn, DAMN shame if you ask me. It ruined a good meal experience and for us to constantly try to get a server's attention is just bad news. We couldn't enjoy our food and it shouldn't be that way.And for that reason alone... first and last time dining here. Wasn't so "hot" after all and that's the juicy part.ABSOLUTELY AMAZING.I came to Vegas, with the saying "what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas"Well I cant express how much I love this place and how yummy the crawfish, shrimp, mussels, and sweet potato fries were. Great service, they were very quick and attentive. The food was amazing packed with flavors, definitely better than boiling crab. Their sauce comes with chopped potatoes that absorbs all of the flavor from the sauce, yummy...The shrimp: big, hot, and juicy. haha the shrimp tasted fresh and did I mention juicy?Crawfish: I am not a big fan of these little critters because it takes so much effort just to eat the little meat they have. But these guys here are pretty big. mussels: my favorite! you guys gotta order these! sweet potato fries: crispy on the outside soft and sweet in the inside (:Definitely have to come back here again while I am in Vegas!I don't want to lower my rating here, but something must be addressed:Prices. This is an eatery with fluctuating prices based on market sales, so what a pound of shrimp costs today might not be what it costs tomorrow. And their entire menu lists "Market Price" where you'd normally find actual numbers. So, where do they display this crucial information?On the back of my waitress' order book. They used to have a BIG SIGN advertising the day's prices. You know what's there now? A couple fucking TVs. How ingenious! Why let your customers know your prices when they could instead zone out on some fucking game and ignore the people they're dining with, all while annoying a waitress by making her hold up her "price guide" while I decide if I want king crab or clams. Best part: there isn't even a fucking bar in front of the fucking TVs. Not that this place even needs one, but the lack of seating around these TVs proves their lack of worth even more so. If you own this place/are a manager: lose the fucking boob tubes and try to look like a real eatery, not another jerk-off spot with 26 TVs. I go out to eat (novel concept, eh?), not space out on crap. Get with it, guys.Get ready to get messy and sloppy (in a sober way).Went here with a friend cause he was drunk and hungry. Yeah, I had to babysit.Ordered 2 pounds of crawfish (so I can get corn and potato), mild spicy-ness and hot and juicy flavoring. Mmmm-mmmm-mmm! Delish.Do expect to get your hands dirty. Use a spoon to scoop out some of that deliciousness of juice onto your crawfish (after peeled). But expect the service to be just okay. They forgot to get me my bucket of calamari.For the price, it's aight. Kinda expensive but hey, it's still good. Why 3 stars? 1. they need to expand and 2. service needs to be good or better.This review is long overdue. Hot N Juicy is a staple among myself and my girlfriends! It is the ultimate, messy, satisfying meal.We usually order:-Crab legs (spicy medium)-Shrimp (spicy medium)-Add sausage and corn-Seasoned fries-Bud LightI generally don't drink beer (the occasional Amstel Light when boating) but for whatever reason when eating at Hot N Juicy I just have to have a Bud Light to wash down all the flavorful, salty goodness.Three tips: 1. YES wear the plastic gloves, if they don't give them to you, ask for them. Otherwise you will wreck your manicure with all the juice and sauce. 2. Bring a hair clip (if you have long hair) 3. Wear clothes that you don't mind absorbing garlic and HNJ sauce aromas. You will smell like a HNJ shellfish when you leave this restaurant.Mmm just writing about this makes me crave HNJ now!OMG. This place was excellent. The food was sooooo good. However, I reeked of garlic the next 2 days. REEKED! I could smell it on my fingers for crying out loud!No bueno.That was one of only 2 things I didn't like. The other....no cocktails, just beer.But moving on........The food was delicious. I mean, my crab legs were outstanding. I tasted my friends shrimp and WOW. I have really been put off by shrimp lately and it was just like my crablegs.....outstanding!!!!!I will absolutely be back.....just when I know I wont see people for at least 2 days!Me and the hubbs decided to  go here for an afternoon date. Place wasn't so busy and the waitress Danielle, was very nice. We ordered a lobster, a whole Dungeness crab, calamari for an appetizer and a couple of bowls of rice. It seemed like a lot at the time of ordering, but the food just wasn't filling.  I should of ordered shrimp or something else.The calamari was The only thing I really enjoyed. It was ALL squid, no peppers, and it was light and crispy. The flavor we requested in the lobster and crab was plain, and the waitress explained that the water used to boil it is flavored with seasoning. The flavor was fine, with a hint of old bay seasoning-esque. The crab was a bit overcooked and the lobster was not as tender as I wanted. For $90, I think this place is overpriced and not that great when it comes to the quality of the seafood. The waitress should of checked up on us more and they should consider hiring a cleaning crew for their bathrooms.

Review Text :
Dear Macayo's, I would like to thank you for renewing my hatred for your bland, artery busting Meximerican food. I hadn't experienced your brand of deep fried crap since I came of majority and stopped dined out with the family at restaurants that specialized in satisfying even the blandest of palettes. I must say, you continue to exceed my wildest expectations in that respect! I had to continue looking down at my plate just to make sure the 3,000+ calories I was consuming were more than just a mirage of Mexican food.I will admit that I have a long standing, simmering hatred for you, Macayo's. So maybe this biases my opinion a bit. I can't in my right mind fathom why I thought you deserved a second chance last night. I think it's testament to the fact that sometimes I make super stupid decisions on an empty stomach, especially when I'm hungry enough to eat the ass end out of week dead burro. I suppose I was expecting something a bit more appetizing than that stretch of hyperbole. How wrong I was.Your patio was the highlight of the evening. It's backed up against a lake and there was a duck that watched me eat. He had a shiny green head. It was nice. I made him my zen when all I wanted to do was lash out in frustration over the meal. If I could offer a suggestion to benefit both the duck and myself, perhaps you could pipe some music out onto the patio, because listening to Suzie and Sally Suburb bitch about their waistlines while committing refried sin was pretty grating.The food however, far outshone those cackling soccer moms in terms of annoyance. I don't know who you think you are, Macayo's, but charging 10-15 bucks an entree at your establishment just about gave me a heart attack long before the lard had a chance to bully up on my arteries. Maybe it's because I think you have the street value of a gum job from a run down whore, but I have to say that those prices were shocking. I could travel the valley over and find better Mexican food for much cheaper. For that price, I expect outstanding quality and taste, or at least a hip see and be seen environment. All you have is a duck working in your favor. I do have a serious question for you though, what's with smothering your entrees in cream cheese and trying to pass it off as Baja sauce? It was the same jalapeno spread I get on my bagel in the morning, but with even less heat and flavor. I suggest renaming it Manhattan sauce in honor of the bagel and schmear capital of the nation, and I think it would be a touching homage to the Pace Picante "New York City?!" commercials. I also can't understand why the majority of your entrees offer either rice or beans, but few have these in conjunction. Those are universal standards at a Mexican food joint, and the ultimate test of quality since they're comparable the valley over. Do they bring you shame? Is that why you don't want to offer them both? Or are you just a cheap nickel and diming motherfucker, Macayo's? I'm more apt to believe the latter, because you charged me two bucks for guacamole without informing me that it cost extra. Then you delivered a pile of gelatinous green goop of questionable origin that had absolutely zero flavor. By this point in the meal I really shouldn't have been surprised at how bland everything was, because I was on to your ploy of substituting flavor for gobs of cream cheese and a heavy hand with the salt shaker. But despite stiff competition from the bland pico de gallo and the puzzling "Baja sauce", it was the shitamole took the grad prize of suckdom for the evening. I have never tasted weaker guac. You must have used some terrible avocados and whipped them with corn syrup or some other food-like filler. There wasn't a zing of cilantro or lemon juice, no hint of Serrano spiciness, not even the tang of some onion, although I did see a couple soggy tomatoes bits added for color. I don't think I will ever be coming back, Macayo's. It's not you, it's... I can't lie; even to spare your feelings. It's you. It's all you. I'm breaking up in a public setting because I'm scared that you'll key my car while by back is turned, or at the least smother it in cream cheese. I know you're into that freaky shit.Wishing you deep fried broken dreams,EricaIs has been a very long since I have visited this Macayo's.  Parking is shared with a few other business's but, still amble parking.Very colorful inside, but, some places here are a bit worn out and could use a bit of sparkle.   We came about 5:20 and had about a 15 min wait. They were quite busy for a Tuesday night.We checked it out upstairs, but it was freezing a cold up there. So we were glad we ate downstairs. We got a nice booth. we had a sweet server. She was very busy, but did her best to keep checking on us.She refilled our salsa and drinks several times. The food was just so so. Not the kind of Macayos we know and love.I had a steak Quesadilla which was a little light on the steak.  Lots of Onions though.T got shrimp enchililadas. She said they were good but, both of us the rice and beans were a little flavorless.All in all good food though, service was great! Thank you Nora!HH is fantastic! $3 Margaritas are what Happy Hour should be about after all! They also offer select appetizers for $3 & $5. A few of my favorites include: tamale bites, red corn chicken taquitos, baja pizza, and large cheese crisp. I've heard the queso dips are pretty fabulous as well. You can get 1/2 pint of Baja sauce for $2.99 now! If you have ever had the pleasure of eating a Baja Chimi, you know that this is a marvelous announcement. I would swim in that stuff if I could. Though, that is probably highly unrecommended for numerous reasons and I bet it would take A LOT of sauce to fill up a whole pool. That being said, definitely make sure to try the Baja sauce if you have not already had the opportunity to do so. In my opinion, the best tables in the place are the booths by the windows. Don't forget to watch your step as you are walking up or down the stairs. This has become a bit of a joke between my friends but surely you'll receive the same warning. Just one more example of the great Macayo's customer service. Making sure I do not face plant in a crowded restaurant is rather high on my list so thank you. No matter when you dine you will receive unlimited chips and salsa and you will get plenty of drink refills. Typically, the food is out fast and pipping hot. On my last visit, food was out in under 10 mins! (We weren't even on our second bowl of chips yet). In the past few years, the menu has been adapting to various dietary needs so they offer gluten free items and (to my delight) calabacitas (their version has corn, zucchini, poblano pepper) have been added to the menu options as well. (Yay!)

Honestly, I live right around the corner from this place. I have been eating here since high school and now I'm graduating college. This is the breakfast spot, I get the omelets or the breakfast burrito and they usually come with pancakes!! The place IS always packed but it's never a long wait for a table. You get a great deal for your money, the portion size is definitely worth it and usually turns into two meals. This was a 4-5 star review up until this point, and now they only get 3 from me. The rude waitress thing is a problem for me. These high school girls with their ratted up hair and overdone makeup at 6 AM need an attitude check. More often than not I get a snooty, curt waitress who resents bringing me a clean fork or a fresh pot of coffee. I don't care if there is gum under the table, that the food is greasy or that the blueberry pancake syrup is really colored sugar water; all I want is a polite waitstaff that doesn't roll their eyes at me. Mike and Rhonda, I love you and it's nothing personal, but give me a better waitress and I'll give you a better review.I'm sad to say that The Place has gone very much downhill since their move to a bigger location. I've given them a few chances hoping it was just growing pains, but it's taken way too long to get back on their game.I am part of a regular group that used to go here every Friday morning. We always sat on the patio of the old place and always got the best service. Super friendly, fast coffee refills--they were just ON.After they moved across the street, they began to make it clear that they would not be accommodating our group. They wouldn't set up a table for us and tried to shove us into individual booths, even when there were only 5 or 6 of us. They have a "back room" with larger tables that they wouldn't open at the time we got there (~6:00am) claiming staffing issues. They finally and begrudgingly let us back there along with several other larger groups facing a similar circumstance; we were basically ignored. They might has well just told us to our faces that they would not be serving us as a group and saved us all the trouble.Don't read between the lines here--we are not a loud, annoying, or demanding group. We are just some guys that like to get together at breakfast.Sadly, our concerns were not heard or passed on to anyone who cared, so I doubt we will ever be back. We've since moved on to places that will gladly accept our business.Quick fast and good. I had the standard 2 eggs, toast and hash browns with a slab of Ham. Eggs = Cooked perfectlyToast = buttered wellHash Browns = Not cooked as much as i prefer (and asked for) but were goodSlab of Ham = nice huge hunk, cooked until caramelized a little on the slab nice!Staff was quick and service was on point.

Review Text :
Brasserie V - what does the V stand for? My most recent vice.My criteria for a good restaurant (in order of importance):1. Beer2. Food3. ServiceWARNING: This place is hopping, so be ready for a wait, but it's well worth it!The beer selection is phenomenal.  Belgian beers are infinitely complex and notoriously delicious.  Add to that an entire book of beer choices and you have an impossible decision to make. Luckily, Brasserie V's staff is knowledgeable and friendly, ready to help you make such a critical decision.The food is SOOOO GOOOOOOD. I have never had anything I didn't love here.  Moules, frites, burgers, chicken or tuna salad sandwiches at lunch - variety with quality. I'm actually on their wifi right now, writing this review, and eating tonight's special: a burger with egg, crimini and oyster mushrooms, and rosemary and truffle bernaise sauce on sourdough. Only $13! Oh shit. The guy next to me just got the duck breast with door county cherries and red wine sauce. I guess I have to come back tomorrow.The service: this is why I'm a regular. I live nearby and the staff is so much fun that I'm content to hang out at the bar and chat them up for a few hours while they endow me with sample upon sample of whatever 4 new beers they have on tap this week.I feel like I sent my teenager to college.Like I walked my oldest daughter down the aisle. She's all grown up......and I'm thrilled I can say, "I knew her when." Back when she was a few tables and a neighborhood bar. Back when servers were speedy and bartenders had stellar beer recs. Back when the only thing to stave my hunger was pretty much the best burger in town. Back when frites were fierce and sauces to dip them in were stupendous. Here's the thing though, that's still the case even after the expansion! Bring on the burgers, the frites, those incredible mussels swimming in a butter connection I'm afraid to know too much about. Bring on the friendly staff that make you feel like family and Andrea and Matt that always greet me with a smile. Bring on a crazy amount of Belgians in bottles (I'm talking 200 at any given time). And bring on what I think has the coolest atmosphere for grabbing grub with friends on Monroe Street.Sometimes when a restaurant gets too big for its own good by knocking down walls, polishing up original tile flooring and installing a beautiful wood bar that frames the stunning beer coolers nicely it can flop. But not here. Brasserie V was ready, and I'm not certain how they did it so seamlessly, but the transition to a world with additional seating was smooth. I want to say it has something to do with the folks in black (the ones that work there) that jump, no dive in head first, willing to do whatever it takes to make experiences memorable for folks like me that knew her when.Um, first of all, let me say this--$21.00 for unlimited mussels and frites. Are you kidding me?!We tried all three broths--the awesome classic, the St. Bernardus wit, and the final one made with Jordanal farms sausage. All three were delicious, and excellent.The frites were fresh, crispy, and delightful. NEVERENDING EVERYTHING.I'm stuffed. Near the end, we noticed that a lot more of the mussels were closed, rather than open--it's a sign that they were probably cooking them too quickly. That's where the star comes off.Everything was great, though. I have less than a week left in Madtown, and I'm thrilled Brasserie V was one of the stops.Pleasantly surprised.  The whole family went to try Brasserie V on Friday night.  There was a 20 minute wait, but there was enough room for the kids to sit down and for the parents to have a beer.Once seated, our waitress was very attentive and friendly.  They have kids meals for $4.95. Well done Brasserie V!  Parents still get to order a special meal and their kids are happy as well.  We ordered V Burgers and a giant bowl of mussels.  Kids meal choices were simple but all good stuff; grilled cheese, spaghetti, etc. with sides.  Even came with a toy too!V Burgers were just as yummy as the menu exclaimed them to be.  The onions put it over the top for me.  They really hit the mark.  Burger cooked perfectly.  The artichoke side salad was a little bland but we poured some of the mussel broth over it.  Now we're talking.The mussels were perfect.  My 8 year old mussel connoisseur said they were the best he's had.  There were plenty of the little bivalves in there to keep a person busy for a while.  The waitress kept the drinks coming, talked to our kids and helped make this first visit a great one.  Everyone wants to come back.  Bravo!My advice : Stop whatever you're doing and go to Brasserie V, right now. This place is my ULTIMATE Madison fav, my never-fail go-to, and where I always, always bring visiting friends. Seriously, since moving to the area a little over a year ago, I've probably consumed 100 Caprese sandwiches from this place (shameless, I know.) Their beer selection is out of this world, not just in volume but it quality (I stick with a couple favorites but my boyfriend orders something new every time) and their burgers/sandwiches are the perfect combo of pub-chic + gourmet. ALSO, the service is really fantastic. The bar staff spend the right amount of time with you and are super helpful in their beer recommendations.

This restaurant is located at the NW corner of Horizon Ridge and Stephanie. It's behind the 7 Eleven and Metro Pizza. Visited 9/2/12Was on the mood for some kinda nese like Japanese or Chinese . Ta Ta Bistro fit the bill nicely. Especially because I just walked out of another  restaurant close by because there were kids sitting on the floor coloring in the middle of the restaurant ( just wasn't the dining experience I was thinking of tonight ).Ordered some sushi eel rolls, spicy tuna wrap and salmon wrap.Also went in for the chicken teriyaki meal. This included salad, miso soup and large plate of juicy teriyaki chicken breast topped with great tasting sauce and sesame seeds. Plus rice of course white or brown. For the record I love Japanese style rice and I went with brown rice cuz I'm eating right. ( yeah right  :p )Service was a little disorganized. But food all came with good presentation and good taste.They have sushi bar, teppanyaki grill table, and not cramped table space. All good. but the decor is tired and needs a fresh look and vibe.The restaurant has alot of food options and each time I come they deliver the goods. Timely, tasty, close by and really reasonable prices. Definitely not over the top but consistently good.I'll be back.Generally places that try to do too much (fusion) fail or come up short at any one thing. Here we have regular Japanese menu, hibachi, extensive sushi menu, and extensive Chinese food menu yet from what we have sampled everything was delicious. We tried two sushi rolls (sushi rolls are named and almost identical to those at Sushi Bay... odd) Paradise roll and Valley of Fire roll... both delicious and what we expected. The calamari tempura appetizer was just okay...compared to Sushi Mon's it failed miserably. We also shared an entree of General Tso's Chicken and that was fresh and delicious... pretty standard higher quality Americanized Chinese food. The service was okay...we had three different servers and one of them annoyed me briefly. I asked for a Sapporo and she said "Let me see your ID" ...so basically demanded it instead of asking to see my ID. What the hell? But, everyone else was nice, the food reasonably priced for the quality and portion and it was a cute little place. I would come back to try more of their dishes.From the name and Yelp listing (Asian fusion, Chinese, thai?), I wouldn't have been able to tell that they serve sushi- but it's actually a hibachi/sushi joint in the style of Bennihana or Ohjah. Front windows advertise 50% off regular rolls and teppanyaki.This place is a steal, for sushi: $40 got us two regular rolls, two special rolls, and a gigantic salmon skin hand roll, plus tax and tip for two. The pricing can't really be beat. Their discounted regular rolls are decent (if a bit heavy handed on the rice), but the garlic ponzu sauce had an odd chemical after taste that I did not care for at all. The WHATS WRONG and MUMMY special rolls were both artistically presented and tasty, with ample amounts of fresh fish. And that hand roll was gigantic! Good value for the sushi found here. Service was decent, attentive without being overbearing. Check the specials board behind the sushi bar for featured rolls: the Lady Gaga Roll sounded good, and the What's Wrong was a hit. Note that they have a large dining area: they were able to accommodate a 10 person graduation dinner group without reservations without a problem.

Review Text :
I've wondered about this place for a while now but have been reluctant to go since it looks another boring chain place.  I then realized chain places are prevalent in Las Vegas' restaurant make-up.Therefore, I had to set aside my innate SF disdain for commercial eateries or otherwise I'd starve or be forced to cook at home.And we can't have either happen. So I braved my fears and finally tried this cozy looking place in the middle of nowhere that serves pizza, panini, and pasta.I'm saddened to say my initial trepidation was well founded: our food turned out to be very average.The mozzarella in our Caprese Salad wasn't fresh, the cheese tortellini tasted like it came from Costco, and the pizza sauce was bland.Maybe I should've cooked at home.Overall, I won't be returning.

Dodging drunks coming in and out of Stool Pigeons, I decided to stop in on this small place. I did not see one person. The sign on the outside promised Caribbean (Jamaican) food. From the time I opened the door, I could smell nothing but the flavors from the island, the jerks, curries, and many other island favorites.      Looking at the menu, I see the prices are extremely low, and still , not one person (I realized why, they just opened). So I ordered the Jerk Chicken of course, that had a rich dark sauce. My wife had the Ox Tail, the sauce also was so good, you would want to drink it from a straw.      Do not let this little place in a strip mall fool you. They have very good and authentic foods, that will tantalize every taste bud that you have or wish you had. CAUTION! , if you have no idea what Jamaican food is or want a piece of square fish or chicken McNugget's do not go here. This is the real deal. Do not take my word for it. Try it for yourself. And... Do not drool on the keyboard while you are looking at the pictures.

Five star venue. Reminds me of big city digs in L.A. or NYC. The runway. Oh, I so wanted to strut my butt. But I decided to nibble on the delicious appetizers like corn cakes with avocado salsa and the yummy mini croque monseurs. The Strawberry martini, although a bit too minty, was fruity and dry. Like my "funny" cousin Jim, who's 47 single, likes wicker and has an "I HEART cats and books t'shirt. Well, what do ya do? Service at our yelp event was great I thought. Kristy had quite a few folks to sling drinks at and she was polite and professional. The menu seemed slightly inventive, with a $30 lobster sandwich, a spin on a cobb salad and the now obligatory sliders. I will be back for a visit and will definitely talk it up. Next time, however, I will be ready with stilletos and my Victoria Secret angel wings!

Review Text :
Jackpot.  I was soooo nervous about finding good pizza in AZ.  In Boston the choices were pretty atrocious and I was expecting to have to go on a hunt for a good slice out here.Pulling up to Redendo's was reassuring.  The Yankees logo on the front window was a promising sign.  Walking in and seeing the poster on the wall of the guy flipping a pizza was even more reassuring- that dude was on every box of pizza I ate growing up.  I ordered a slice (and I didn't get asked "what kind?"!) and my husband went with a calzone.  As we waited for our lunch we took in the surroundings and immediately felt at home.  The Whitestone Bridge sign.  The 7 train icon.  The oldies playing on the loud speaker.  Yes, this was looking promising indeed.The pizza was nearly perfect.  I chalk the difference up to the water.  It was everything a NY slice should be...thin, cheesy and yummy.  My husband's calzone was not only huge but amazing.  The marinara sauce was fantastico.  I have found that it's very hard to find good marinara sauce  (too sweet, too tomato-y, etc) and we were very happy to find it here.  I can't wait to try the parms and pasta dishes!10/21/10My first visit to Redendo's!  Dark wood tables everywhere, a plethora of old photographs adorned the walls, and old crooner songs played loudly overhead- I asked nicely if the volume could be turned down, and thank goodness they obliged!  Too bad a quarter of the FOH was occupied by empty pizza boxes ready to be used- what an eyesore!  The women's restroom was spacious, comfortably decorated, and, most importantly, very clean.  (I accidentally entered the men's room, and while still decorated, it wasn't as elegant as the women's, and it didn't feel as clean and fresh in there, sorry to say.)I was craving for fettucine alfredo, but I asked server Nicole what her favorite dish was on the entire menu, and she pointed to the eggplant parmigiana and said that she and her beau split this dish all the time.  I told her I'd get one of those, but hadn't realized it was a sandwich until later, but no biggie.  I like hot Italian... heroes.  ;)  I then said I wanted pasta alfredo, and she said that was her favorite pasta dish, too [what a coincidence! ;)].  For my next visit, I already decided i was going to try the Popeye's, but I didn't tell her.  When she later revealed that it was her family's fave, I thought either we go for the same flavor combos; this young woman is reading me like a book; or agreeing w/ everything I say.The fettucine alfredo was a beautiful sight to behold, and its garlic parmesan cream sauce was one of the best-looking AND best-tasting parmesan cream sauces (for the price) I've ever had!  Loved the two garlic mini-breadsticks that flanked the noodles, but I wish they were a little crispier.  The eggplant parm was tasty, but it's sliced VERY thin.  I would've preferred it a little bit thicker.  Enjoyed the bread, which I was told was homemade (I've got to find out for sure).  Unfortunately for me, the bread is lined w/ a cornmeal crust underneath.  This makes for a wonderful crunch, but not for a happy and feeling-good Aileen :(  Perhaps I can order their heroes w/ two sandwich tops?  Hmm...Do you like crusty pizzas?  Do you like goat cheese and ricotta?  How about some spinach and lots of roasted garlic??  If you like white pizzas (no tomato sauce), then you HAFTA try the Popeye!  I've ordered this pie almost every week since first trying it in late Oct./early Nov. of last year.  Mom couldn't get enough of it; she was the one who'd ask me to order one for takeout at the end of every work week!  :)  She finally asked me to stop getting them late Dec./early Jan., but I never tired of it.  She recently started asking if we could go have some more pizza about three weeks ago; I just bought one last night!  The Popeye is the only variety I've tried here (it's the only white pizza they've got), but with such great flavors on a perfectly crispy crust, I don't want anything else!p.s.  Tried the tiramisu, as well-- Ordered it to-go, but had to try a few bites at the resto.  LOL  Very nice, and not too sweet.  My two complaints were that it needed more espresso and that the slice was a bit small for the price.  (Or maybe it just didn't look so pretty when served in an aluminum bowl.)  Would I order it again?  Hmm... I'll have to get back to you on that!I am always on the lookout for new-to-me places to try pizza, on the hunt for that elusive perfect crust/sauce/topping combo. Tucked away in a strip mall and not clearly visible from the street, Redendo's probably has the best you have never tasted (but should!). On our initial visit we went with a pie that had mushrooms, 1/2 pepperoni and 1/2 sausage. It was good... very good! Doughy yet crisp crust, with ample topping coverage and a flavorful sauce. Even Mr. "I Grew Up In NY" approved, which is high praise. We also tried the linguine with clams - tasty and a generous portion. However, the pizza was clearly the highlight. You know a restaurant has earned a spot in the rotation when halfway through the meal the discussion involves what will be ordered on the next visit. We already knew what we wanted... the Popeye - a pizza highly recommended by fellow Yelper Aileen B... We ventured back a week later and started with the pepperoni pinwheel appetizer - a small stromboli-like roll of cheese and pepperoni, encased in the fantastic crust. A nice start to the meal, especially when paired with ranch dressing (I know, weird but good - try it!). On to the main attraction... the Popeye!  A wonderful pizza with the same fantastic crust we enjoyed previously now topped with spinach, goat cheese, ricotta and thin, slightly crisp slices of roasted garlic. Delicious! It is now the standard by which every other white pizza is measured.  While Redendo's is clearly a favorite, I do have to point out a couple of small details that for me are a bit annoying - they charge the price of two full toppings if you go half and half on a pizza. I never understand this - it is not a full serving of topping for half a pizza, why charge full price? Also, while it was recommended to try ranch dressing with the pinwheel (yum!) it was not discolsed that there is a charge for it.  These small things definitely will not keep me away - the food is great and the service friendly. A perfect combo! Listen to Popeye and eat your spinach... on a pizza!Wow. I'm seriously impressed! Redendo's had been popping up in my Yelp nearby Feed for a few weeks now and I kept meaning to stop by. I'm so glad I did.I ordered a small Caesar salad, an order of garlic knots and a calzone to go. About 15 minutes later I walked out the door with a package of food that smelled like an Italian heaven. The "small" salad was huge and fresh. The garlic knots were delicious, as was the side of marinara that came with it. The real star is the calzone. I don't know what I was expecting, but this far exceeded any ideas I could have had. The thing is huge. It's basically a pizza folded in half. Mine had ricotta, fresh tomatoes, sausage and roasted garlic. Ridiculous. So good. I'm still enjoying it and I had the thing like three days ago!All that was $16 and it lasted me about three days. Highly, highly, highly recommended!

Review Text :
I met a business associate at Wally's for lunch today.It might have been the wrong day to go to Wally's. Today is Cinco de Mayo and at Wally's, they were celebrating "Cinco de Wally's" (Wally's Five?!?!?...five what?) with a "special" menu.Boy, can I just state for the record that it is seldom a good idea for a restaurant to screw around by replacing their menu with ethnic food to celebrate holiday's.This goes certainly for "pubs" trying to get their Mexican fiesta on...it goes for Mexican restaurants trying to add corned beef on St. Patrick's Day...it goes for fine dining restaurants trying to add hot dogs and burgers on July 4th and it goes for Applebee's and their ilk trying to serve "turkey with all the trimmin's" on Thanksgiving.The results are at the very best uneven and at the worst, Cinco de Wally's.I sensed a problem at the start...they gave us a "special" menu with all Mexican food "especial's" and the only regular Wally's food available was the Wally burger and wings. Oh well, a Wally burger it will have to be. My associate decide to risk it and ordered the chicken tacos, but offset it by having a margarita, which is, as we all know, a powerful flavor enhancer and pain reliever!The service was slow, but not really problematically slow...just not very attentive, at first. It took 10 minutes or so for our server to take our drink orders and another 5-10 minutes to get our drinks, but the pace picked up after that.We got our food and that's when the fun really started:)I ordered my burger medium with cheese...it arrived a delightful shade of un-medium gray in the middle, with no cheese. My associates meal arrived and it was...a plate of lettuce! The taco platter was supposed to be 6 small tacos (taco sliders?), but all we could see was a platter of shredded lettuce. Substantial digging produced the tiny tacos (and they were tiny...2 bites, at best), but no salsa, no cheese...just meat, tiny tortilla's and a hay mound of lettuce.We called the server over and I sent back my burger (you can't uncook a burger and I am reluctant to send food back to the kitchen, but this just wasn't correct) and my associate asked for cheese, salsa and sour cream, two of which he received (no sour cream at Wally's?...really?).I got my replacement burger and cut it in half...still no cheese, but by now, I was over my desire for a cheese burger and just wanted a little sustenance (5 mile run this morning...I was hungry:).I took a bite and the burger was essentially room temperature. That will rob you of your appetite pretty quickly. I flagged down our server again and asked him to try again, which he did. But when he got back, I was essentially done with Wally's Five for today, so I didn't eat much of the burger...sorry he had to warm it up for me when I ended up leaving it on the plate..oh well...we paid for it, so:)I like the Wally's at 44th and Camelback, just fine. I was prepared to like this one, too. I was thinking about passing on the review it because of the Cinco de Wally's thing, but...I was there, it wasn't good and I feel like Yelping!

Tried this place out after reading an article on Thrillist about the 10 best Chinatown restaurants:http://www.thrillist.com/eat/las-vegas/best-chinatown-restaurants-in-vegas I ordered their bestselling sautéed spiced lamb, and it was just average good. It was very spicy, so they definitely got their Szechuan on, but I was a little disappointed with the portion. It felt like a lunch-sized portion, but I paid the full dinner price. Oh, and the rice was extra - really?I would have to say that I agreed with most of the articles picks for best Chinatown eateries, at least the ones I have been to. J&Js was my first attempt at the ones I have not tried, and I am already disappointed. Not only do I think J&Js is not the best Szechuan in Chinatown, but its bestselling sautéed spiced lamb is not even the best Szechuan spiced lamb dish in Chinatown (that honor has to go to Yunnan Garden).I sure hope the rest of the list is not as far off.So I wasn't hungry when I dropped in to visit my friend at his storein Chinatown.  But it was lunch time, and they were craving this lamb hotpot that they said was really big and good from this Chinese restaurant I don't know about by their Chinese name.The restaurant turned out to be J & J Szechuan Cuisine, which I had bookmarked to try their lunch specials earlier this year.  The interior of the restaurant looks and feels really vintage (not in a good way). But from experience, I know some of the best Chinese food are served at this hole-in-the-wall type restaurants.  After we were seated and handed our menu, my friends proceed to order the Lamb Hot Pot (which they said was off the menu).  Sounds good.  I love the whole secret menu concept.After a fair amount of time has passed and we have completely demolished the appetizers and the Cold Noodle we ordered, the waitress finally brought out the hot pot.  The reaction from my friends was that this was not what they were served on their previous visit. The portion is a lot smaller (as in about half of what they were served the last time).  So instead of it being a hearty large portion that could be split with 3 people, it was just enough to accommodate 2 people at the most.  It was a good thing that I was not hungry to begin with.  The noodle was also cooked so much that you can't even pick it out with a chopstick, as it has pretty much been cooked to mush.  They spoke to the waitress and asked why this did not look like what they ordered previously, but the waitress just argues back saying we do not remember what we ordered the last time.  Considering the portion is less than half of what my friends ordered the last time. And he took pictures of what he ordered from his previous visit. I highly doubt that. Smh.When they asked if it can be returned, since it was so different from what was served before, the waitress just said no!To add insult to injury (or is it injury to insult? I wonder which is worst) one of my friend found a random string from who knows what in the Lamb Hot Pot.  We should have taken a picture of it first.  Because when we showed it to the waitress, she dismissed it as just a piece of noodle (It is right there on our table. Try eating it!). Then she said it was the string from the noodle package and just picked it up without offering an apology. Yeah, that was about the only smart thing she did. Get rid of the evidence!So inconsistency in what is served, even if it is a secret off the menu item, is already a big red flag for me to never return here again. But the fact that a foreign object was found in the food and the customer received the "No F Given" attitude when confronted about it, is just the final nail in the coffin.So yeah, even by Asian/Chinese restaurant standards, this place has crap service and subpar food.  Thus probability of return is less than 0.1%.  But in the event of a zombie apocalypse, I will bookmark this place since it will still be low on other people's list of places to scavenge for food. 1 star, because half stars are not supported on Yelp.

Review Text :
On an errand to pick up a Halloween costume, I called in an order to pick up some Thai food from Archi's. The nice lady on the phone told me my order would be ready in 15 minutes, although she did ask me twice to make sure I was aware I was calling the Rainbow Blvd location. I arrive about 12 minutes later and I see the waiter bringing my order to the counter. Perfect timing. Paid the bill and was on my way. Note: I was there on a Sunday around 12:15pm and only about 2-3 tables were being used. Kinda empty for prime time lunch.After going to Archi's, I ran another errand and then finally headed home. When I opened the boxes, the yummy goodies were staring at me wondering what took so long. I ordered:1. Pad See Ew - Stir fried wide rice noodles with Chinese broccoli and Thai soy sauce. Choice of meat included chicken, pork, or beef.WOW. This dish was really tasteful. The noodles were perfect. Soft yet with a crisp of crunchiness. I chose the pork and it was sliced and tender. I got it with a 5 on the spicy scale and it had a nice kick without being overbearing. I would definitely order this again. For sure.2. Fried Rice - Stir fried rice with tomatoes, onion, green onion, and egg. Comes with a choice of meats (chicken, pork, or beef)This dish was also good. I wouldn't say its the best dish ever, but I would probably order this again after trying a few other dishes. The rice had good texture and it wasn't dry or oily. Good portions of meat as well.I definitely preferred the Pad See Ew over the Fried Rice, but I'm not against ordering the Fried Rice again. I recommend trying this place. Maybe next time I will dine in and check out the atmosphere.Pictures are included as well!This is Thai Perfection! Archi's gets my 5-star rating because it leaves nothing at all to be desired and always keeps me coming back for more. The Panang Curry Sauce is what sweet (and spicy) dreams are made of. The depth of the flavor is INSANE. I can taste the perfect balance of sweet coconut and kick of curry and cilantro. This sauce is consistantly a crowd pleaser at my table. I also always order the Garlic and Pepper Beef which is served with broccoli and cabbage. The meat is always tender and served hot. You can order your dishes at any spice level. I must not forget to mention the coconut ice cream for dessert. DELICIOUS. Secretly I am tempted to order seconds or take some home for later. We all know it would be devoured in the car by the first stop light! Archi's is clean, the service is quick and the quality of the food is on point every time and cheap, too! If you have not been there I highly recommend it to get your grub on:)So far this is one of my favorite Thai food place in Las Vegas. Coming from the Bay Area where I had amazing choices I was originally reluctant to try and would just wait for trips home. We ventured out, discovered some NO WAY places, some EH and a few greats. This is a great. We've never had a bad meal at Archi's. The dishes are consistent, full of flavor, fresh ingredients cooked to perfection. At times the service can be a little slow, but the place is always packed and it appears they keep the number of servers pretty low. Worth the wait I say!Pad ThaiFried TofuNum Tok Beef SaladPad Prik Pow or KingPanangPineapple Fried RiceBasil Fried RicePak Kea Mowomg, I'm totally salivating as I write this list. redic.I am ridiculously addicted to the Ginger Ginger Ginger Beef lunch special at Archi's Thai Bistro. STUPID addicted..  It is the only thing I have ever had there, and I doubt I will change it up any time soon. My first visit to Archi's was with the lovely Jaime W. for lunch. Every other time, I have gotten my meal to go. This place gets jam-packed at noon, if you are planning on having lunch here it would be a smart move to show up closer to 11.  Sometimes the wait just to pick up to go food is 5-10 minutes, with the wait to get a table just as long if not longer.The lunch specials are $7.95 (unless you want shrimp) and you get the entree, a generous portion of steamed rice, a fried wonton and an eggroll (if you eat in I believe you also get soup). I have had better eggrolls and I throw away the wonton. The delicious ginger beef dish keeps me coming back week after week... It has baby corn, mushrooms, bell peppers, onions and a ton of delicious ginger.Every other dish at Archi's may suck, and I may never know... but based on how busy they are day after day, I doubt it. If you like Thai, you should give Archi's Bistro a try.The atmosphere is a whole lot better than the Flamingo location so this is the place to go if you're not doing take out.  Our waitress was forgetful though.  My wife ordered white wine and she brought out red.  I wanted Chang's beer and she brought Singha.  We wanted 2 glasses of water (one with no ice) and she brought just one glass of water with ice.  That took my rating down a star.   We split a papaya salad at level 7 out of 10 spice.  It was refreshing and spicy as heck for me.  My wife ordered the green curry with tofu.  She always, always gets green curry.  The tofu was deep fried which complemented the curry very well and frying it makes sense so the tofu stays together in the hot broth.    I got the country curry with shrimp only because it had the most ingredients listed on the menu.  That had eggplant, mushroom, bamboo shoots, green beans, baby corn, basil, zucchini and a few other things in a red curry base.  I had that at spice level 5 which was a quality burn for me.  Definitely a quality Thai meal at a reasonable price.I came here for lunch right as they opened at 11 am after hearing that this place fills up quick during lunch time -- and it does!I was not impressed with their lunch special selection. The price of $7.95 was decent for the amount of food you get, but they charge extra $1 for brown rice substitution. Really? Around thirty percent of the lunch menu was chinese food, and I don't come to a Thai restaurant to eat the goopy concoction that is sweet and sour chicken. They did not have Pad Kea Mow (drunken noodles) as part of their lunch menu. Bummer. I opted to skip the lunch menu and order my drunken noodles with chicken ($9.95) anyway. The portion was large and the taste and quality of ingredients used were superior to many other Thai restaurants. The chicken was cooked perfectly and was not dry -- a feat only few have been able to accomplish.The service was a bare minimum. There was no personal interaction; it was drop off your food/drink and quickly run off. I get it, it's busy... but you're doing well so stop being stingy and hire more wait staff. They never brought out Jessie B.'s hot tea, but it was on the final check. She did take it off, but that is carelessness and lack of service at its best.I'd come back for the food if in the area again, but I wouldn't rush off to drag people here from the other side of town.Finally made it to an Archi Thai location!We started off with the Thai Iced Tea ($3.95). Good flavor tea here...a bit stronger than most. Large portion...not sure about refills, since I did not need one personally.  Yum!Thai Beef Salad ($10.95): Grilled Top Sirloin, Tomatoes, Red Onion, Green Onion, Cucumber, Cilantro, Romaine Lettuce, & Spicy Lime Dressing. The citrus flavor was not very strong in this dish...the beef was tender and flavorful though.  As far as Thai Beef Salads go, it was a bit disappointing.Pad Kea Mow ($9.95): Rice Noodles with Egg, Garlic, Chili, Bell Peppers, Onion, Bamboo, Mushroom, Green Beans, Basil & Thai Soy. This was very good, with a good heat behind my request. The pork was tender and delicious as well...recommended!With so many Thai choices in town, I can't say I will be back again anytime soon...but it is a solid choice for good thai food if you are in the area.I've been to all the Archi Thai location's. The food is consistently the same great quality regardless of location. He had the Po Tak soup and Chicken Pad Thai, and I had the Chicken Panang Curry sauce with extra veggies, which comes with white rice. These are choices I was very familiar with. We both enjoyed our meal.They add spices according to your liking and tolerance level. I like my food a little spicy - but not hot. A three is perfect for me in the summer and a four in the winter. I enjoy their Jasmine hot tea, the excellent service, clean restaurant, and atmosphere.

Review Text :
Yummy, yum, yum for my tummy, tum, tum!My hubby surprised me with a nice dinner out at the Carmel Room as an "I Love You" present.  Ahhhh, so sweet!  It was especially nice because this was the first dinner at a non-family friendly joint we have been to since my daughter was born over 2 years ago!  Oh how I have missed steakhouse steaks!We popped into the Carmel Room because it is close to grandma's (aka the babysitter) house.  It was also a good choice for us because it is off of the Strip.  Restaurants off of the Strip are so much easier because of the parking, shorter walking distance, less crowds, and better prices.  The Carmel Room is a steak house and we racked up quite a bill, but it was still less than it would have been at one of the trendy places on the Strip.  I like the Strip places too, but it is so much easier to not go down there these days.We walked up to the maitre 'd and were greeted so warmly.  He was so funny and just started us off on the right foot.  We were seated at a super comfy table and were automatically welcomed by our servers.  All of those guys were so friendly and had us laughing and enjoying ourselves right away.  All through the meal we had fun and happy people around us, as well as crazy good service.  It is so nice to have nice people and amazing service when you are out.  It really makes the meal, in my opinion!The interior was very pretty and comfortable.  They had regular dining areas, as well as private areas all around.  It wasn't too crowded, which was nice because who wants to listen to other people when you are on a romantic date?  It was a very nice restaurant to sit back and enjoy a great dinner.  My only thing I would rate on the negative side was the sound level.  It was nice and quiet for the most part until the lounge act went on at a neighboring bar.  When they got on, it got really loud with bar band music.  It wasn't horrible, but I could have done without it in a steakhouse setting. For dinner, we had crab cakes for an appetizer, 16oz boneless rib eyes with sautéed wild mushrooms and herb butter, truffle mac n' cheese, garlic mashed potatoes, and we finished it off with a Grand Marnier soufflé. Everything was fantastic!  The crab cakes were full of big hunks of crab and served with a very tasty sauce.   Both of the steaks (we are boring and ordered the same thing) were super tender, and melt in your mouth tasty.  The mushrooms were cooked perfectly and really added to the steak.  The herb butter bumped up the flavor another notch or 2 as well.  These were some great steaks!  The truffle mac n' cheese was good.  Not the best I have had, but pretty yummy.  The garlic mashed potatoes were very smooth and creamy.  I do wish the serving size was bigger though because I love mashed potatoes almost as much as love my kid!  I also ordered a side of Béarnaise because it is AWESOME.  The Béarnaise here has to be one of the better sauces I have had at any steakhouse in recent memory.   Oh, and the soufflé! The soufflé was absolutely delectable!  The soufflé was so light and fluffy!  Then the sauces made it even more fabulous.  The sauces were a milk chocolate sauce and a vanilla Grand Marnier sauce with some fresh whipped cream thrown in for good measure.  Everything was super flavorful but I was in love with the vanilla Grand Marnier sauce.  I could have drank the whole container of it because it was THAT GOOD!  Drool!The place does skew a little on the more mature side of things.  I know we were the youngest people in there, but we didn't mind.  Being a more mature crowd, it made us more relaxed and comfortable.  If you want a nice steak dinner without the hassle of going to the Strip, I would recommend the Carmel Room in a heart beat!

What to do when you get to the airport WAY early AND your flight out of Vegas is delayed at least another thirty minutes?  Duh!  Drink, silly!Since this was on my way OUT of Sin City instead of on my way IN, I was no naive sap:Me: "How much is the Mangorita?" (drink prices are ODDLY not listed on the menu)Waiter: "One Mangorita."Me: "No.  How MUCH DOES IT COST?"Waiter: "$12"Me:  "That's what I thought.  I'll have a Mangorita, please."Hey, you expected me NOT to get it? Actually, for Vegas prices, this was quite reasonable (who would have imagined that food and drinks would be CHEAPER at the airport than in the city you're visiting?).  The Mangorita surprisingly tasted like REAL and FRESH mango instead of some artificial "mango" syrup.  It was blended and slightly sweet but not syrupy and served in a pint glass. Also, the waiter claimed it had a double shot of tequila and while I couldn't taste it, I sure as hell felt it.  Woo!  Drunk plane ride!  Yay!I also ordered the chicken chimichanga.  As someone who used to fry chimis professionally in high school (yay crappy part time job!), I wanted to go back to the kitchen and give the cook a little tutorial.  The size was good, but it was undercooked on the outside (although nice and hot inside) so while the ends were crispy, the middle of the outside was kind of doughy (bleh).  I slathered on the generous portion of guacamole to hide the icky texture because, as mentioned above, the Mangorita was starting to take over my body.  It was filled with plenty of shredded chicken but also with shredded lettuce.  Um, WILTED shredded lettuce.  Bleh again.The chips tasted like they came from a bag opened yesterday instead of being made on site. The salsa tasted like it may have been made last week by my mother who considers black pepper to be "too spicy" to add to her food. Triple bleh!One last bit of super USEFUL info: this is ONLY a good option if you've got PLENTY of time before your flight.  Our meal took over an HOUR.  The waiter came over, took our drink order, disappeared for 10 minutes, came back, took our food order, disappeared for 10 minutes, came back with our drinks, disappeared for 10 minutes, came back with our water, disappeared for 10 minutes, came back with our food, said "right away" when I asked him to bring the check, disappeared for 10 minutes, brought the check, disappeared for 10 minutes, came back for the check, disappeared for 10 minutes, came back with the receipt to sign.  I have no idea if he came back to pick up the signed receipt because we didn't wait around another 10 minutes.  I found this really weird for a restaurant in an airport. We were inside the "secure area" so it's not like we just stopped by for a nice lunch.  We had a plane to catch!Server Michelle rocked it out for our group. A great way to end our Vegas seminar weekend.Good food and zesty Margaritas . . . Lovin' this.No bueno!  Unfortunately bad decisions are sometimes made when I only have 35 minutes between switching planes while tempting margaritas are staring me in the face.  Banana Margarita - There's no price on the drink menu, so my server said it was $14-$15, glad it only ended being $13.49.  The drink was good but came in a very small cup for the price.  Chips and Guacamole - At almost $11 I figured, what the hey, it's going on the company expense report and it'll be my dinner.  It's the only thing I ordered and she brought out the wrong dish.  There was a delay in getting my receipt because she put in the right order but had to make a correction.  Instead she brought me Chips and Salsa, which was $6.49.  I said, "I actually ordered Chips and Guacamole."  She says she either take that back or she can add on a small side of guacamole for $1.89.  I don't have time for all this mess so I say, "Just bring me a small side of guacamole."  Well, the guacamole on the bill showed up as $2.89.  It was tiny!  Not to mention, it wasn't fresh made, nor was it packed a few days before at some local distributor, it was the canned stuff that was like a thick soup with no chunks of avocado.  The tortilla chips were like Mission Tortilla Chips, except triangular.  I hate Mission Tortilla Chips.  If you want to stop here and get a drink, that's fine, but the food (not just my dish) seems to be lacking.  If you want to walk around with your drink, order it in a to go cup.  Las Vegas McCarran Airport is rad like that.Great food and service. Nice cold beer and tequila selection. I think its the best food to eat here at the airport :)You can't beat the location of this place in Terminal C in Las Vegas airport.  We all know that the food is barely edible, but who cares?!  It's a nice spot to have a drink or something (simple) to eat while waiting for your flight.   The waitresses/bartender  work their you-know-what's off and are so pleasant.  Yes, they get slammed and you might have to rush them along a bit, but it's fine.  It's the airport and everyone they encounter is probably hungover, tired and crabby!!! Lol Hats off to them!

Review Text :
This was a tough review for me.  I wanted to give them higher marks, really I did.I went in with low expectations.  I've had Jewish food on the east coast, OK?  Things were looking good right off the bat.  We were seated and water and a tray of pickles appeared as our tushes hit the cushions.  My lovely wife picked up a pickle, crunched off a bite, gave a surprised expression and said, "Not bad.  I'll be the Jew-judge."  She is Jewish, after all.  Fair enough.  I thought the pickle was pretty good, comparable to some I've had on the east coast.That's where things started to go awry.  It took between 5-10 minutes before anyone came over to get a drink order.  We ordered several items to share.  My wife and I shared a corned beef sandwich and fries with gravy.  The kids shared matzo ball soup, blintzes and a latka.  I ordered coffee.The soup came first and it was very good and authentic.  Coffee?  "Oh, right."  My water has been sitting empty for a bit.  The rest of the food arrived pretty quickly, and my coffee arrived.  Water?  "Oh, right."The blintzes were very good, especially the cheese.  The corned beef was good, it passed muster as authentic.  Fries?  Good.  Brown gravy?  Fine, but it had an odd flavor.  Latka?  Very good.  Water?  "Oh, right.""Can I get a refill on the coffee?"  "Oh, right."The prices are high.  The sandwiches are available whole or 1/2.  $13.xx for a whole corned beef is a bit high, but it is big enough to share so that's a plus.  One sandwich and one order of fries was enough for 2 adults.   The fries were $4.xx  Coffee?  "Oh, right."  I don't appreciate having to ask for every refill 3 times.  I would probably write it off to just one server having an off day or something. In summary:  Good kosher-style food, a bit pricey.  It will hit the spot when I'm craving a corned beef sandwich.  The service was spotty.  So what may have been a 4 star review has been knocked all the way down to 3 stars.  Coffee?Not great compared to a good deli, not good when you factor in the price.It was soon after moving here from Los Angeles that I found Chompies.... being a regular patron of West Coast heavyweights such as Langers, and even Canters, I was hungry for good deli food and thrilled... at first.  Their food is "meh" at BEST and WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY overpriced for the quality.  If they charged 1/2 the price they do currently, this place would be 4-stars.. but don't come up in here trying to charge Langer's prices and serve up Schlotzsky's quality. Next.Oh Chompie's... one of my favorite Tempe finds! Chompie's is home to my favorite soup! Chicken Matzoball Soup! Delicious and onxious with awesome flavors. I have had a great time sittig outside yapping with my sister about who knows what while munching on the biggest pastrami and saurkraut sandwich EVER! This thing was HUGE! I was scared, I was elated, I was determined. I went again for dinner and had my same matzoball soup but this time I had the Chicken Schnitzel. Warm. crunchy and full of flavor I was elated. The sides were eh, I make better carrots and the potatos were okay but the gravy had an odd flavor I wasn't too fond of. I have YET to try a dessert, but someday I am going to damnit!! Oh and the pickles are yummy! :D Jussayin' The service leave MUCH to be desired for. We had to ask for everything about twice and the staff likes to play handsie in a closed section behind frosted glass. I had craptastic service both times I went. But I still hope ya'll give chomp down on some Chompie's and fall in love with it like I did!!What's the matter with Chompie's in Tempe?That's always my question and I just don't have any answer. We've eaten at this Chompie's three times and we're always disappointed. However we've eaten at other Chompie's, most often the one in Chandler, and we're stuffed and happy. I don't get it.We went with a group of Yelpers to this Chompie's because it's close to Gammage and we were all attending the opening night production of Fiddler on the Roof. So I suggested JewFood. Now, being an east coast Jew, I have certain standards which, frankly, aren't easily met in the desert. But they're not met at this Chompie's at all.I phoned at 3:00 that afternoon to give them a heads up since we were expecting twelve people (we wound up with eight - you know how Yelpers are). I gave them the count, the time and made clear that we had a time crunch, needing to be out of there by 6:00 - 6:15 at the latest. When we got there the table wasn't ready.We were seated fitteen minutes later and I told both the host and the server that we were attending the theatre and needed to eat and get going. Our food arrived at 5:45 or 5:50. I can't say for sure which it was. Had a hard time getting more pickles, I never got the lemons I asked for, sauces had to be requested repeatedly. And the food was nothing to write home to Bubbeh about. My extra lean corned beef was fatty and chewy and my daughter's patty melt, requested with extra onions came with a mere four pieces of onion. She asked for more but they didn't arrive until she was nearly done eating. I would have contested the extra charge for those onions but I had to get going or risk losing the opportunity to park in the Gammage lot. From the rumblings I heard around the table, we weren't the only disappointed diners in our party.Now I've reviewed the Chompie's in Chandler http://www.yelp.com/biz/chompies-restaurant-and-bakery-chandler and gave it five stars. So the problems clearly aren't pervasive, in my opinion. If we'd had time we would have gone to the Chompie's in Chandler or the one in Scottsdale but the Tempe location was five minutes from Gammage. Oh, well. I'll consider this my farewell address. I won't be back to the Tempe Chompie's again.If you have ever been to Katz's in NYC, Kaufman's in Chicago or Cantor's in LA you need to know right away , you will be disappointed ..this isn't that kind of Jewish Deli. Now if you haven't, this might be just fine for you. Located close to ASU I wonder if they just have given up trying to really show off how good it could be. maybe feeding the students and their out of town parents is just enough for the Chompies Family. But if they do want to attract locals to come in here are some ideas: Refill water glasses at least every 15 minutes, this is salty food; pickles, pastrami , chopped liver etc...give us some water...and if you see customers sucking on ice with an empty glass take the hint... give us a nice big bowl of pickles 4 pickles in an a 10 inch dish just looks silly...show us you care like a Jewish grandma and give us a decent amount .... When you say LEAN it means no big flabby pieces of loose fat dripping off the meat on every side. Lean would be the no visible trails of flabbiness. Do something about the fries...when the person next to you says , "they taste okay when you put gravy on them" you know they are just meh... If you are giving me fries ,make them decent ..it's not that difficult. Check on your table occasionally , taking the order and bringing the food and little else makes me wonder why we even need the waitress...I will go take the order and get the food and no need to tip me.... and I refill water glasses. Chompies has the potential to be more but who am I to tell them what to do?Chompies has the best bagels in AZ. Period.Most places under cook their bagels, and they are too doughy- like Einstein's. Chompies bagels are unmatched and very tasty, along with their cream cheese, which comes in a ton of different flavor options.Way overpriced. The pastrami sandwich was good though. It had a good flavor, but I can't justify $12.99 for a sandwich and a little cup of potato salad. Now I'm not just talking about this sandwich. The rest of the menu was overpriced as well. Even the kids menu. Items on there were up to 8 or 9 dollars.Service was ok. Seems that there are better places to spend your money than here. Like fancier places...

Holy canolli this place is fantastic! How have I never been here before? The set up of the restaurant is very open and they piped in old school tunes, Frank Sinatra, Harry James and Tommy Dorsey. It really reminded me of Artie Bucco's sister restaurant.   The service was excellent and the staff was friendly and hospitable.  We even heard the owner/chef yelling at the staff from the kitchen "wize this fettuccine sitting owt heaar!" it was classic. He really showed a passion for both the guests and the food.  I had read a few yelp reviews before I chose this place and I can only mirror what everyone else said. The Italian bread and focaccia with red pepper olive oil and garlic butter are amazing. The spaghetti and meatballs were to die for. The meatballs LITERALLY melt in your mouth. I want to go back and try everything on the menu.  Spoiler Alert  - After the meal the owner came to our table and asked us to guess a number between 1 and 99, you get the number and dinner is free. We didn't win but it was a fun game and a nice way to end the meal. I will be back - I am anxious to try lunch and the pizzas they are selling out the back!

I'm always really hesitant to review places that are literally across the street from ASU West (where I take classes and work) because I worry that my opinion of the business is skewed by its convenience, but to hell with parliamentary procedure, I've got to russle up some FUC's!At the computer lab at West we have a whole drawer of our office dedicated to take out menus. It is as expansive as it is useless, because the answer is always "something Asian". The only times we've ever used one of the many pizza menus we have is when our bosses offer to buy us lunch, because we fear letting them know what food we really like will give them some sort of power over us. So yesterday John S (who is Clarice's boyfriend but was my +1 for the yelp event, what's with that?) and I were doing our usual lunchtime shuffle, passing around menus for Chen Wok and Fu-Sing Garden. We came across a menu for Pho Avina. We initially saw the word "pho" and collectively agreed that Pholicious sounded like a brilliant idea, but we were looking for takeout and the staff at Pholicious is so awesome to me on a regular basis that I'd hate to dis them by walking in, giving them an order, and then loitering outside while they made it for me. Thankfully, John solved my culinary quandary by mentioning that he really liked the boba at Pho Avina. The last time I had boba I liked was at a Quickly! in the bay almost two years ago. The Lollicup near my house, which was promoting itself as if it's shit didn't stink but had weird, unpredictable hours and always managed to be "out" of boba whenever I was really craving it. So Pho Avina it was.Ordering was only a minor travesty. The restaurant is so tiny and compact that the only place to put their register/takeout counter is right next to the path of the servers, so in the couple of minutes it took us to place our order we managed to obstruct every other employee working there. Thankfully, despite the complaints of my fellow yelper girls, I wear heels about 90 percent of the time, which makes me I'm easy to spot and never surprise someone turning a corner. If they run into me it's because they're jerks and want to see if I'll say "excuse me" and give away my gender. Puny non-yelpers. The mighty Jetta is not fooled by your nonsense.We spent the fifteen minute waiting period out and about the strip mall, reading The New Times and visiting the nearby gaming store which I'm going to yelp anyway despite not buying anything. 15 minutes isn't a bad waiting time for egg noodle soup and boba. I've waited longer for a cheezburger and shake. Oh jesus, did I just spell "cheeseburger" with a z? I know I should correct it, but I feel compelled to leave it there. the internet has permanently fucked my cognitive language skills. I ordered the #41 (egg noodle, shrimp, crab, calamari) and a coconut boba. John ordered the old school "beef and rice noodle" pho and a taro boba which he could not describe the flavor of and whenever asked how it was or how it tasted kept thrusting it in my face and telling me to try some. The sense of urgency in his voice didn't compel me to want to take that leap.The takeout arrangement was both clever, convenient, and troublesome. In our bag were two styrofoam cups of soup, little baggies of warm noodles, and a ziploc of cilantro, sprouts, peppers, and limes. While this made taking our lunch back to the office quick and easy, it did cause some problems in unloading its contents. The noodles, while still warm, were beginning to stick to each other and solidify, which made stuffing it in the cup of broth rather difficult, especially when the noodles didn't separate once submerged. The portions of noodles were relatively small, and I ended up having to put in handfuls of sprouts just to adequately fill the cup, which itself was modest at best. I know I would've gotten more if we had ordered dine-in. I don't mean to sound like another one of those portion-obsessed Americans, but with work and school and Aramark's price-gouging at our cafeteria, my lunch has to hold me over for the whole day. And this didn't work out for me.The food (what little of it was there), was actually quite tasty. The squid was chewy, the crab meat tasted real, and the two shrimp that were in there were pretty massive. The broth was hands down the best part. I could drink a whole bowl of that shit. But won't. Because too much sodium is never fun.I realized waaaaaay after the fact that what we had ordered was not in fact boba milk tea but in fact "snow bubble milk tea" (i.e. frozen boba). The pearls were frozen solid and hard to chew and more than one my straw did the "McDonald's Choke" where the contents became so cold they would not submit to the vacuum I was creating. Eventually I just let it sit on my desk for a half hour where it melted and was then delicious.[Joke about how lesbians aren't as good at sucking things as other people has been omitted. Yay self-censoring!]Ok so Its time to light Pho Avina's facking ass on fire.  I remember going here when just the old lady ran the joint.  She was top notch, the food was good, she cranked out one hell of an avocado boba.  Those were the days party people, those were the days.Now let me compound things a bit.  I am talking tons of shit to my co workers about how I love vietnamese food and that you just cant get a good nuoc mia ninh kieu in Phoenix (obviously trying to be a food badass, cuz I am) and Pho Avina goes and sucker kicks my shit in the ballz.For the record I ordered easy.  I went ZERO pho as it was 142 outside.  I went BBQ Pork bahn mi, spring rolls, bobas.I GOT SOME MOTHERFACKINGSHITTASTICAMERICANIZEDBOOLSHEEET.I say again, BOOOOOOOLSHEEEEEEET.Bahn MiRotten brown HALLOPEENOHS, check.Funky ass pork, chiggitty check y'all.MotherFACKINGCHUNKS of veggies, microphone check y'all.  How do you fuck up a bahn mi?Spring Rollsrotten lettuce, uhhh huhhhhcrispy rice wrapper, you bet your assBobaGot FACKING syrup?Let me tell you this vietnamese food experience went over like a turd in a punch bowl with my co workers.  Who now have undisputed proof that I am a dip shit and to not listen to me.  Based on this one Pho Avina experience.  My co workers have shunned me.Pho Avina just got put on notice.  I used to eat there because I thought it was a cool little AUTHENTIC vietnamese joint.  I dont go in for mass consumption shit.The only good thing about Pho Avina is the fact that it's clean. Besides that everything falls a bit short; in terms of service and food.Came in looking for a new Vietnamese spot to try and to curb our Vietnamese cuisine and boba/snow craving.The restaurant is clean and spacious, not too many people were dining at the time of arrival but quickly filled up. I ordered the Clear Rice Noodles with soup on the side (Hu Tieu Saigon). It's a noodle dish that comes with bean sprouts, onions, clear rice noodles, slices of bbq pork, pieces of imitation crab, shrimp and chives. The noodles are tossed in a sweet soy and comes with a side of broth (chicken). The dish was lacking in flavor and portion. Even with chili sauce and a spritz of lemon, the dish was lackluster and just had a sweetness to it. It was 35% onion and bean sprouts. Totally not a satisfying nor did it taste close to what Hu Tieu Saigon should taste like. We were given a plate of veggies and the cilantro was wilted and the plate looked limp as if sitting out for past it's prime.The service was a bit spotty, it was good at first and kind of awkward. A few customers ended up leaving because they weren't being helped though there was a good amount of staff available. At this point I didn't order boba/snow dessert because I didn't think the food or service was good.Price is decent if you're looking for a mediocre bowl of noodles and slow service, but you can get better quality Vietnamese food elsewhere. The only thing going for this place is it's clean atmosphere.This place is my best friend favorite place.. I was kind of ehhhh about it because I know where good vietnamese food is at. Haha. Anyways good vegetarian options for me. Yes. Score. Very helpful and very accommodating. Their vegetarian vermicelli was wonderful but next time I have to tell them easy on the garlic. Overall everything went smoothly :)

This place just isn't the same. I've been eating here for a while and keep noticing the decline with each visit. When I walked in it took forever to get seated and the smell was really bad inside. It smelled like rotten eggs so they might have some pipes that need a checking. I did have 6 people at my table but there were no other customers so waiting just over a hour for our food was beyond ridiculous! The egg drop soup was a gloppy mess and my beef dish was tough with a terrible flavor. I have ordered this dish many times and just isn't what it once was. hen the bill came our server assumed we needed split checks after I specifically told her that I was paying for our party and she made it very confusing and awkward for the myself and the others at my table. I questioned coming back since the experience here wasn't what it once was ans then I saw a ROACH running across the floor and knew I'd never be back again.My family and friends have been getting together for a few years here to grub. That will be happening no longer. The last 3 visits were terrible and the last visit specifically was not good. I'm sad about this because I really loved the food before, but now it's just not consistent. On this last visit we were the only customers in the restaurant yet it still took over an hour to receive our food and the food came out staggered. My niece only wanted Egg Drop Soup and they totally forgot to bring it to her and only did so after asking a 3rd time about it. When she finally got her soup it was like a bowl of gloppy gel. I loved the soup here before, so I have no idea what has happened, but it wasn't even edible. What I loved ordering here most, Strawberry Chicken, tasted awful. One thing that wasn't easy to ignore was the nasty smell inside. It smelled so badly of like sewage or something. Then at the end of the meal we noticed roaches on the floor! OMG I was so ready to leave. Drinks come in cans and refills aren't free. After loving this place for so long it's a major disappointment to see New China Cuisine go so downhill.

Review Text :
I found a good one!Thanks to the reviews from Josh and Megan, I remembered Sala Thai Restaurant when I was craving thai food for dinner last night.  I wanted to try something new and it worked out well because Sala is located not too far from REI where I was headed to do some holiday shopping.  Sala provided me with a pleasantly full belly and fueled me for my shopping.When I pulled into the parking lot, Sala was easy to see thanks to the fact that their lighting inside is extremely bright.  They are located next door to a martial arts studio and I could hear the people over there doing their thing a couple of times during my dinner... not necessarily distracting, but enough to make other yelpers aware of!A friendly thai woman welcomed me when I walked in and told me to sit down where ever I wanted... I took note of her authentic fuschia thai outfit and was pleased with the fact that she followed me over to clean the table thoroughly before I sat down.  As I waited, I took note of some of the thai artwork on the walls and some letters from children - thanking the people at Sala for a 'cultural experience.'  I assumed from this that Sala had hosted some kind of dinner for elementary students and their families; very cool.The menu is extensive and I had a hard time deciding what to order... everything looked really good!  There were several items that I had never seen on a thai menu before such as several entrees with pumpkin and a thai omelet.  That is the problem with dining solo at a thai restaurant - you don't get to share and try different dishes.  I enjoyed looking at the menu and the pictures of select dishes as well.  Please note - Sala Thai does not serve alcohol.  They do offer fresh fruit thai mocktails and thai iced coffee and tea.  After much debate, I went with #10 to start - Thai Salad with Peanut Sauce and #84 - Spicy Eggplant with Shrimp.  I was really happy with the salad; It tasted fresh and included lettuce, tomato, cucumber, carrots, onions, and red peppers.  The peanut Sauce was served on the side and it was sweet, creamy, and the perfect sauce to compliment the salad.  I ordered the Eggplant with 'medium' spice.  This was plenty!  I tend to like spice, but next time I may even order mild-medium.  I was happy they served me plenty of white rice to balance the spice of the dish...Serving sizes were generous and I had leftovers to take home.  I cannot wait to return and try some of the other menu items as well.  This is the perfect place to go on a weeknight if you're in the mood for a casual thai dinner.  Next time, however, I'm bringing friends!A great neighborhood restaurant with quality food, nice atmosphere, and no attitude.  I love to support independent, non-chain restaurants and when Sala Thai opened up in my neighborhood, I was very excited.  I've eaten there over 10 times so far.It's a great place to introduce Thai food "newbies" because the food is great and the menu has lots of photos of the entrees.No complaints about the food.  And reasonably priced too.Appetizers worth sampling:  spring rolls, chicken satay, and tofuEntrees worth trying:  pad thai, pad see-u, curry dishesI saw a complaint here about the time it took to receive their food.  The restaurant features a glass wall looking into the kitchen.  They make all of their entrees to order; that's why it takes longer.  I will gladly wait another 10 minutes knowing I'm getting freshly prepared food.One final note:  the restaurant is getting popular so watch out for a full restaurant during on-peak hours.  Dinner service starts at 5pm and I've seen it fill up by 5:30pm on weekends.If you're going to Sala Thai on a Sunday and meeting other people you would do well to remember that there is light traffic on Sunday and you will get here early.  If you get here early, there is a Big Lots down the street where you can spend a few minutes soaking up an almost permeable seedy feeling.  Or not.  I would opt for not.  Or you can do what our dinner partners did and visit a dive bar for a drink.  It's just as well because Sala Thai does not serve alcohol.  I'm looking forward to the review on that one, Christine.  No pressure.I was excited to try Sala Thai after seeing numerous strong reviews.  Overall, they did not disappoint.We started with pork satay.  We had not seen satay offered in pork.  This was the least satisfying of the selections we had.  The pork was a little chewy and the yellow curry just didn't seem to go well with the pork.We all shared four entrees.  We had spicy basil fried rice which was delightful and probably my favorite item overall.  I am hoping to have that again soon.  It had a nice balance of spice and fresh basil that was refreshing.  The catfish with panang curry was very nice.  It was the largest catfish fillet I have seen, cooked quickly so as to sear it lightly and some crispiness on the outside while remaining moist and tender inside.  It was heavily sauced and we ordered 4 out of 5 on the spiciness scale.  I think everyone at the table fought off a reflexive sneeze with the first bite of that one.  I would like to see how hot the 5 is, but keep in mind the 4 is pretty hot.We also had pad thai which for me is a bit of a benchmark dish.  Sala Thai's was unique and very good.  Not overly sweet and with just the faintest hint of smokiness in the pepper flavor, rather complex for pad thai.  Rounding out the tour de Sala Thai was a duck curry with coconut milk, red chili paste, pineapple, basil, tomato and onion.  I'm not a fan of duck but this was very good.  I had several pieces of the duck and plenty of the sauce ladled over my steamed rice.I recommend Sala Thai.  The sauces were so flavorful that Myles M and I mortified Christine O and Audrey W by licking clean every serving dish on the table.  Not really, but it was close.Another 3.5-er.  I'll make this quick since football's on:~ Basil fried rice - great~ Spring rolls - average~ Papaya salad - great~ Red curry chicken - good~ Chicken tom yum soup - good ~ Drunken noodles with beef - great~ Mocktails: we had one of each - mango, banana and pineapple banana.  The mango was the best.  There's no alcohol at this establishment, btw.  What good is a restaurant w/o alcohol?!

I bet you suburbanites of "America's most boring city" love paying top dollar to get just decent Mexican food. When it comes to my search for great Mexican food, I just can't catch a break outside of the barrio. I ordered the Killer Burrito. Beef, beans, guac, and sour cream. Possibly a bit of cheese. The tortillas are made fresh from scratch, and taste amazing. Their beef tastes exactly like it would from someone's home. The salsa was nothing to get excited over, but the fresh, hot chips were great.So you're probably wondering why I gave this two stars?The prices are a joke! If you don't believe me, laugh at this:Any plain burrito (carne asada, chicken, etc.) is $6, but if you don't like yours plain, it'll cost ya.The horchata costs $2.75, and it's the fountain drink horchata, NOT the real stuff.A quesadilla with carne asada, sour cream, and guac comes out to $11.00. Yeah, I made that face, too.My burrito was $7.50. No, portions are NOT huge, they're the same as every other place. So in reality you're paying up to *double* the price for your meal (just think of that quesadilla!), and you're certainly not getting the quality to match. But does Mesa really have an alternative?

When Rickie mentioned going to the Thai Hut, I thought, that's funny, I'm really not in the market for neckwear. Then we drove by and it looked so cute. Like a Thai diner with lots of booths lining the windows which overlook McDowell around 3rd Ave. Obviously not a lot of money or design when into the reincarnation, but the energy of the room and the super friendly staff warmed me instantly. I swear the server telepathically took our app order as the spring rolls arrived to the table, hot and crispy, before I had even squeezed the lemon in my water. Along with the chicken satay, they were both good, not out of this world however. Rickie's "chicken noodle" soup was flavorful, yet the chicken was hella funky. Oddly shaped bland, poached peices of poultry particularly unpleasant. The sizzling beef was Thairiffic. Really. Thairiffic. My obligatory phad thai, although missing the tofu, was very dee lish. Prices were affordable. No beer however and that made me sad. I mean I was just costume shopping at Easley's and really could have used a large Thai cerveza. Rickie loved his Thai iced tea (me? not a fan of that beverage...sort of tastes like lawn clippings and cream). The service is outstanding...attentive, friendly and efficient. That pushes them from 3 to 4 stars easily. Great energy, good food, smiling staff. I'll be back.OMG - another great Thai find in Phoenix!Thanks to the other Yelp reviews, I've been wanting to try 'Thai Hut' for the last few weeks.  So, when Liz M. and I were deciding where to meet for dinner, I suggested it... I think we were both pretty impressed!It's centrally located right at 1st street and McDowell and the cutest little diner with amazing service and delicious food... The menu has a variety of options to choose from with lighter fare (fresh rolls, soups, and salads) to more traditional Thai fare (curry dishes, noodle dishes, fried rice, and more) and of course desserts that sound oh so good!Liz and I started with the fresh rolls (cold hand wrapped and filled with vermicelli noodles, shrimp, tofu, bean sprouts, cucumbers and green onions).  They were served with both a creamy peanut and a tangy sweet sauce for dipping.  I mixed the sauces together and savored every bite... Then we shared the pad thai and the stir fry eggplant.  Instead of adding chicken, pork, beef, shrimp, or tofu to the eggplant dish, we had them add more veggies and it was perfect!  Service was great... our waitress checked on us several times and kept my water glass full at all times.We were too full for dessert this time.  I guess that's reason enough to return... as if I needed a reason ;)****One more thing - Thai Hut offers take out - it even says on the menu that 'phone orders are welcome.'  I'm sure I'll take advantage of that sometime as well!Have you ever gotten an orgasm from peanuts?  No?  Well, I just did.Number 27.  Medium hot.  Went with Robert M & Bacon for dinner tonight and we each got a dish to share.  Started with the fried tofu.  Bland.  the sauces were watery.  Also got shrimp rolls.  Yummy.In all, we had a red curry (#26) which was good, but it seemed as if the green beans had been frozen then cooked.  Also, the #34, medium spicy.  Had a peanut taste, a little sweet.  And then: #27.  (angels singing) Now, I don't know the names of any dishes.  I always order by number.  When it came to the table, I drooled all over my white shirt.  And, well, something else in my white panties.  Amazing!Service was quick and friendly.  I love that it's RIGHT ON McDowell.  Tables face the street, which you don't get very often here in the PHX.My leftovers are in the fridge.  Since I'm single and need the *ahem* effects of #27, I'll be having it before bed.  As a snack.  To get ready for bed.  #27.  Marry me.  I'll be the first person to marry a number.I have to be honest; I found Thai Hut average at BEST. I may not be an expert, but Thai is my favorite food (I eat it at least once a week) and I recently spent 10 days in Thailand, so I have had my fair share and I certainly know a good meal when one is put in front of me... and no such thing happened here at Thai Hut. My food and my hot tea were lukewarm-bordering-on-cold, the flavor in the Tom Kah soup was minimal and completely overpowered by the chili flakes they put on the top (fist time I have ever seen that) and the yellow curry, while traditional, left a lot to be desired in both the taste and the consistency (very soupy).The service was okay, but certainly not friendly. I actually even felt uncomfortable at times.With all the other Thai places in the area (Thai Elephant, Wild Thaiger, Thai Basil) I have no reason to make it back to Thai Hut. Sowwweeee!

8/25Thin-crusted Whitestone Bridge pizza (garlic, ricotta, mozz, spinach, tomatoes, and olive oil) was good!  Could've been a little bit crispier, but I was happy.  Spotted their thick-sliced Sicilian pizza and mentioned to Paul that I was not a fan of thick-crusts, bec. I found them too soggy and too doughy, and he graciously offered me samples.  Thank you Paul, but I'm still not a fan of (approx. two-inch) thick pizza.Bensenhurst baked ziti was very delicious!  Penne, ricotta, house marinara, parm, and mozz.  This must-try dish came w/ garlic knots, a popular appetizer.  Perhaps these knots are better when they're fresh- I tried them re-heated (toaster oven), and they didn't do anything for me.  Will have to visit with a few friends in tow to try this dish and app fresh from the oven!Also tried a gyro sandwich.  Not bad, but for the price, I'd rather swing by Tempe's Haji-Baba's and spend a buck more (plus gas money) and get TWO wonderful gyro sandwiches.  Five tables present, but the space didn't feel inviting enough to stay and dine in.  This venue screams "take-out" loud and clear.To the owner:  Last Thursday you had a young man waiting tables who I had never seen before.  He was a bit pushy and overbearing, but I wanted to give him a chance thinking that perhaps the young man needs more to time to adapt to his new job.  This was my thinking until.........1.  He brought us our dishes and we sat there without cutlery and napkins until we got our own by taking them off other tables.  I refused to do what my husband did and brought it to the attention of one of the waitresses.  She apologized and promptly gave me my cutlery and napkins. 2.  My waiter was stroking the back of his hair, rubbing his neck.... doing this with the hands that were soon to touch my food.3.  My waiter was playing with his mouth and chin with his hands..... doing this with the hands that were soon to touch my food.  Do we see a pattern here???4.  When I asked for a take out container for my leftovers, he brought an aluminum pan and cover but made sure that his fingers were all inside the aluminum pan when he handed it to me.  I had to wipe it down with water and the scarce napkins.  Here is a clue waiters and waitress everywhere in YelpLand... DO NOT play with your body parts while you are on the job serving food to people who go out to eat for pleasure not to witness a science experiment on bacterial growth.  I was not going to Yelp about this, but the owner of Yo Pauly is a decent sort who runs a place with very good food and he needs to know what his wait staff is doing.  The food on this particular night was excellent as usual.  The service left much to be desired and the habits of this particular waiter touching himself before he served our food was disconcerting not to mention, a bit "nasty."HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!My husband and I decided to come here tonight, as he has had this pizza before at work. Big mistake.We walk in and the guy greets us and is very nice. He tells is we can sit anywhere we want, so we do. We look at the menu and wait for someone to come by to get our drink order.  Doesn't happen right away, as the guy and girl that seem to be the only 2 working, continue their conversation.A group of people come in and the girl comes out to their table and jokes about how she's the manager (I sincerely hope not!). Then she asks them what they would like to drink.Apparently, serving your regulars/friends takes priority over guests that were there first. That was our cue to leave. Not spending time and money at an establishment with such rude service.

Review Text :
This restaurant was opened in 2007, in the height of the Vegas boom times and housing bubble, when pricesof everything was going up and up, and money was flowing easily. Million dollar condos going up everywhere, speculators betting on housing prices getting lucky more than rolling the dice at the craps table. IThe time was like rolling 11's consecutively and parlaying your bet....the odds were long (18 - 1, but pays 15 - 1) but it just kept coming in to pay. So a great Pho restaurant owning family from the Portland area, (they own several popular ones in the Pacific northwest) decided to roll the dice in Vegas, They spared no expense in the decor. It is decorated with all high end materials, with marble-like tables, 2 large flat screens, and a lot of quality to make a very clean and pleasant restaurant. The problem is, it is too far from the Strip, out on Spring Mountain a mile from the strip at Decatur in the A&M strip mall. And that long odds 11 crapped out, the housing bubble burst, and Vegas is hurting. One of the owners was the cashier the night I went, and she was very friendly and accomodating, asking what I wanted to watch on the flat screens.  We had a nice long talk after my meal about Vietnam, Saigon back then, where her family is from, now Ho Chi Minh city under the communists now. They own a restaurant back there, called Pho 99, at 139 Duong Nguyn Trai, Phuong Ben, Thanh Quan 1, T/P Ho Chi MInh, Viet Nam. There is one in Portland called Pho Hung.I ordered my standard over the past year, Pho Tai Nam. The beef was good and the broth was, too. Plenty of fresh greens to go with it.The price was more like glitzy Vegas, not the grungy pacific northwest.Bonus: they accept credit cards, which most grungy dives do not.My friend decided to try this place out since we've been to most of the Pho places on Spring Mountain.  Pho Hung is a little bit farther away from all of the hustle and bustle.  We were here in the morning around 10ish.  The restaurant was practically empty which was not a good sign.  We should have ran out of this place right away but fools that we were, we sucked up and sat down.  Our waitress was friendly and helpful.  But that's about it.  I ordered beef stew with baguette, but they didnt have any baguette.  They didn't have time to drive to Lee's Sandwiches.  So I ordered their spicy beef noodles, our waitress said they didn't have it today.  I ended up with crab meat noodle soup per the waitress' recommendation.  We also ordered rice with grilled pork chop and eggrolls, beef noodle (pho bo), crab meat noodle (bun rieu), chicken noodle (pho ga).  The pork chop was burned and dry.  It looked like it's been around for a few days.  The eggrolls were very funky looking and orange.  My crab meat made it into little patties and deep fried.  I've never had it deep fried before and it just did not taste good.  Their beef noodle was ok.  However, it didn't make up for the rest of the order.  I have to give it 1.5 star.  This review was written per my hubby's request because I wasn't planning to write one, hence, no photos.  Maybe I should go back next time just for the photos.... yeah right!

Review Text :
I really like this place. I am kind of weird. If I want Chinese I normally go to the buffet. This place is the only exception to that rule.Lets commence with the actual store. The location is very clean and organized. I am surprised that they have so many staff members being that is it kind of small. (maybe they have the whole family)My favorite dish here is egg fu yung! I tried it for the first time ever, and was shocked at what I had been missing out on. The use actual gravy at China A GoGo. (other places use what looks like Teriyaki sauce)Over all the fried rice was really good as well. Other places offer free egg rolls when you order so much food. In which case I do!  This particular locations doesn't. (which is whatever you know)I can't see my self giving them 5 stars yet that lack in the fried wonton area. They are very diminutive. The taste is on point, just need to work on size and crispness.2.5 STARS  In the future, this China Go Go location looks like it will be a China No Go. I left extremely disappointed.   First, I felt they overcharged me. If the pepper steak lunch special is $6.89 and a Coke is $1.50, how did it end up $9.70? But, why sweat over the small stuff? You live once. However, the big stuff was that the food wasn't good. In all honesty, the Chinese food I eat in a Feast Buffet is better.  A red flag that the quality was lacking here was when the egg drop soup was placed on my table a couple of minutes after sitting down, with the pepper steak immediately after. Please give me time to enjoy the soup. Yeah, the food came fast. But it was lacking in quality and reminded me more of fast food than a good Chinese restaurant.   In recent times I have been to several Chinese restaurants in Las Vegas. I can tell the difference in quality just from the pepper steak. The peppersteak here was lacking in the flavor and ingredients that I have been accustomed to lately in the Chinese restaurants that I have dined in. For example XO Chinese Restaurant down the road and China Wan Wan on Boulder Highway, served me pepper steak that would make me drive out of my way to have it. Here, the pepper steak was lacking flavor and pieces of it had a rubbery taste. Here, the fried rice lacked flavor where down the road XO served some of the finest fried rice that I have had in Las Vegas. And the chow mein noodles that seemed to take up over a third of the styrophone bowl was filler that lacked flavor. It was nothing like the lo mein noodles side that Chop Stix on Mark's Street in Henderson recently served me with far superior pepper steak. Even the chow mein noodles at Panda Express is far better. Finally, the Coke tasted funky and I would pour it out and complement the food with Mr Pibb.  Customer service is also lacking here. I remember the people working in the Locosee Road China Go Go being personable. And the people working in the Alicante Parkway and the Windmill Parkway China Go Go's were nicer workers serving better food.  In the future this China Go Go is a China No Go for at least a year.  There are far better Chinese restaurants and better China Go Go's for me to spend my hard earned money.ROACH IN FOOD....If I could, I would give this place negative stars. My fiancée was craving Chinese food so we decided to go here since it is close.. We ordered in the store and got it to go. When we got home we were serving the food on plates and saw a roach in the fried rice. My daughter was already eating it, so I made sure she spit it out. We packed the food, and went back to the restaurant. When we got there we told the manager and they offered to make the food again, but as you may understand, we didn't want to eat there. They told us that has never happened before, unfortunately we won't be going back. Heads up!

Review Text :
We enjoyed Christmas dinner here this year.  Not many restaurants are open, so we were excited to be able to dine here.  First off, McCormick & Schmick is not at all what I thought it was.  I thought it was an uber cool, high end fine dining experience.  In reality, it's merely a 1/2 step above Red Lobster.  When we arrived, the lobby was jammed packed.  We were seated approximately 30 minutes after our reservation time.We were lead to a table smack dab in the middle of a high traffic area.  We protested.  BJ always requests a romantic booth for two.  So after standing in the middle of the restaurant ackwardly for 5 or so minutes, we were finally taken to such a table.    Service was friendly from Val.  BJ got a Sierra Nevade brew and I ordered a festive beverage from the cocktail menu.  My Poinsettia was sweet beyond belief and tasted sort of like perfume.  We shared a chopped salad which was fairly good.  We also shared a crab tower, which was nice.  But we have had a similiar type appetizer at Bahama Breeze that is SO much better.BJ wanted to be different, so he had mussels and the clam steamer for his meal.  He liked his choice and said it was okay.  I wanted to be different, too.  So, I had the lump crab cake with southewest jicama slaw and poblano cream.  I was quite put off with the appearance of my dish.  I didn't care much for the brightly color cream slopped on my plate and the slaw was down right nasty.  The crab cake was alright.For dessert, we pondered our choices.  Nothing sounded very special, but our server was all about the carrot cake.  Surprisingly, it was the best part of our meal.

Oh bejesus, I have some stories from this place! This place is strange, crazy, oh so many things...I confess I have never eaten here except beer cheese which I think was good(too drunk to remember). Most of the time I get drunken blitzed crazy here, dance my a$$ off, and leave my credit card at the bar...This place has changed pretty dramatically since when I first started going. They used to have some good live funk cover band on Saturdays, then they switched to a not so good funk cover band, and now its some crazy techno raver freaky shi...Hmm I just don't think I like it as much anymore, I can't get down like that til 4 am anymore. The bartenders I used to love are gone and now there is Scottsdale snob boob job chick, dumb-as-rocks frat bro, and weird ambiguous raver boytoy behind the bar. Last time, Raver boytoy had jeans torn all the way up his a$$ and then changed after an hour to black patent booty shorts, freAKY-DI bondage shirt, and heavy black eyeliner. To say the least I was beside myself with laughter, but I knew I had to get out of there, everyone started morphing into Fear and Loathing-type creatures.....Ok but here's the rundown: great German beers served up in awesomely large glasses if you prefer and decent alcohol selection, large dance floor, good music occasionally, really great owner and wife team....PS if you take someone special back in the pitch-black mysterious tables of the restaurant area, there is this red exit light shining like a beacon, pull the curtains around your table, lay back into each other, savor this moment of absolute zen and completely let go....you just might just discover who you really are...Saturday night and I was going to turn in early (well, early for me), but this was on the way home and I'd never been so my friends easily convinced me.  I never realized this place was so hoppin' at night.  Actually, I never really noticed this place at all.  There were a lot of hipster types and people with great personal style.  It was very hard to differentiate between the gay guys and the straight guys.  Usually, the straight guys don't know how to dress so it's easy to tell them apart, no offense straight guys.  Can you tell that I really enjoy it when people express themselves through their clothes?  Plus, it made for a fun game with my two gay companions.  There was a cute guy at the end of the bar and I just couldn't figure out who he'd be into more.  I decided to go find out, but as I approached him I notice he had one of those rings in his nose like a bull would have.  Maybe this is wrong, but that freaked me out and my internal voice screamed abort, abort!  It's sad how something so trivial can be a deal breaker.  I'm just not into anything that hangs out with snot.    Anyway, the place is split into sections with a bar on one side and a dance floor on the other.  The bar is against one wall and there is a flat screen streaming live video of the dance floor.  The bartenders were really great, and might I add partially naked.  I like a little eye candy with my vodka.  It was also pretty cheap compared to what I'm used to paying for Kettle One.  It was about $6 instead of $10.  It was a weird combination of neighborhood bar meets Scottsdale dance club.  I spent most of the night in the bar, but did find myself dancing to a few songs.  While surrounded by gyrating green laser beams, I spotted Mr. Nose Ring and decided that he would probably not be into me based on the way he was dancing.  I really need to stop making assumptions about people.  There could be a straight man out there who both knows how to dress and how to dance.  I hear they also have live bands.  I'm not sure what vibe this place gave me, but it was different than my usual scene and I liked that.  It had sort of an underground, Euro hip, 1960's parent's basement, sneakers with dresses, member's only jacket, ambiguous looking males, 90's rave, and Cheers feel all combined into one.  Does that help paint a picture?  Did that even make sense?

Restaurant name  Claddagh Irish Pub
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
I  recently visited Claddagh Irish Pub in Middleton's Greenway Station for a happy hour-munchies thing after work with a pal. We had beer, shared an order of the corned beef and cabbage rolls, and split a "Paddy Mac" sandwich, which is essentially a Reuben. The food was quite good. I especially enjoyed the corned beef and cabbage rolls, which when I went, were similar to a fried wonton that had the fixings of St. Patrick's Day dinner inside. Sort of like an Irish egg roll. Yum. The Reuben was average, but the fries were pretty tasty as well. Service was unremarkable in either a good or a bad way. All said and done, I would usually rank that sort of experience as four stars. Normally, I would definitely return to a restaurant that showed me a good time and had good food. Why then, you ask, is this a one star review? Let me explain.I take major (MAJOR) issue with Claddagh's use of the words "gluten friendly" to describe certain menu items. (Menu items that are often served with bread.)  I presume this was done in an effort to appeal to the now-popular dietary trend of avoiding gluten. The problem with this, Claddagh, is that "gluten friendly" is not a thing. If someone can't eat gluten, then they can't eat gluten. Period. Full stop. Claddagh's use of the term "gluten friendly"  to describe foods that still contain gluten, would be like if JIF Peanut Butter made a new type of peanut butter that was 50% peanuts and 50% almonds...and then tried to market the new product as "Peanut Allergy Friendly". Does that make sense? Although I personally find  vague claims of "gluten intolerance" dubious, especially when the person has never had a problem eating gluten before, there are definitely people with a **medical diagnosis** of Celiac's disease who absolutely, under no circumstances, can consume gluten. I feel that Claddagh's attempt at marketing its menu to appeal to the "gluten-free" dietary trend could harm people who actually need to avoid gluten for important medical reasons. Even if it's not a life or death situation, people who wish to avoid gluten should be allowed to do so without having to jump through hoops and worry about being tricked by menus. It's majorly unethical to twist words to imply that a thing is something that it's not. This is especially true when the item in question (food) has the potential to directly impact a person's health. Claddagh: fix your menu. If you want to offer gluten-free options, then please do so. However, referring to a spinach-artichoke dip appetizer served with crostini or to a hamburger served on a wheat bun , or even to your fish fry, which is battered in flour as "gluten friendly", is unethical. People have a right to know what's in their food, and this feels like a deliberate attempt to mislead people in the name of making more money.

I ate here as part of a work function.  They have amazing chips and salsa.  That was probably the best part of my meal.  I love Mexican food and could eat it literally every day - but I found this to be a very very Americanized version of Mexican food.  It was "Eh" - not bad, not great...just "Eh".The best part of the meal were the chips, they were delicious and the salsa was amazing.  I like spicy food and the salsa delivered - but everything else was so mild and just forgetable. There were a lot of us in the group and our food kept coming out in waves.  The first batch of people served started eating and were more than half way done their meal by the time the third wave was served.  I believe our large group plus the large number of diners that were already there very likely overwhelmed the kitchen staff.  We had a reservation, perhaps they could have scheduled a few more people.  The server herself was good, she was on the spot with drinks, refills and more chips.  I don't know how much the bill was because the check was picked up by my boss, but if I were paying for dinner, I don't know that I would come back here if other options were available.

Review Text :
Came in before catching a plane back home. I got the impression this is family run BC there's pictures of the kids at the front counter - it's always great to support local small businesses.I sat at a table and the waitress/ owner took my order. I selected the Kalbi combo at $10.95 The meal included steam rice, banchan and salad. Plenty of food to fill up and was totally satisfied with the quality of the beef ribs, sides and banchan. Jun's house reminds me of a fast food joint but offers authentic Korean food at reasonable prices. I'll be returning here again for sure..I never thought of Bulgogi until one of my dinner guest said my beef skewers reminded her of Bulgogi. I vaguely heard of it, but never actually tried it. I don't know why I've never experienced Korean food and I'm not saying one visit to this fast food Korean joint qualifies me as any kind of authority on it, but I do know what tastes good and what I like.I liked the Bulgogi at Juns. Despite a gentle snub from an actual Korean about Jun's being "fast food", we decided to give it a try anyways. I attribute that to Mel C's review (thanks, Mel!)The Bulgogi plate was generous with rice, a fresh salad with a light asian love-you-long-time type of dressing, and thinly sliced, tender, flavorful, marinated beef stir fried with onions. I ate all the meat and enjoyed it. My only wish was that it could have had more of a carmelized sear to it. That would have made it perfect.The other dish ordered was the Bi Bim Bop...fun to say, but another dish that was new to us. Rice topped with veges, like shredded napa cabbage tossed in sesame oil, stir fried meat with mushrooms, and topped with a sunny side egg, the yolk begging to be broken. We enjoyed that as well.I know this may seem like going to Panda Express for Chinese food, but when it's good, it's good. My new quest will now be to find the best Bulgogi. Thank you Jun's for opening my Asian eyes (lol) to Korean food, and thank you for the wonderful service. The whitey I was with...aka my wife, is a bit high maintenance and knew even less about Korean food than I did. Our very nice server took the time to explain everything to her. This will be a nice weeknight quickie spot for us.

08/18 and 08/19Came to check out Benihana's happy hour and sat at the bar.  One bartender was more eager than the other to answer my questions regarding my food issues, but both were gracious and friendly.  I wondered if they split the tips evenly?Tried a few plates...  Some were 50% off, and some were slightly reduced.  The menu pricing was a little confusing, and I hope that this is corrected in the near future.The seaweed salad was OK.  Don't know if I would pay the full price of $3.75, though.  (And for 50%, or was it $3?, I don't think it was worth that, either.)  The gyoza was also just OK- a bit on the bland side and a bit lacking on the mouth-feel aspect.  The asparagus tempura plate was a nice surprise; However, the greasiness got to me, and in the end, I was stripping the batter off of the spears more due to necessity, and not w/ the sadness I normally would be feeling from having to trim off delightful cruchiness, bec. otherwise I couldn't enjoy the meal knowing I'd ingested all of that excess oil!  The tuna sashimi was very good and substantial, compared to all of the "light" apps that I tasted before it.  The spicy yellowtail was also very nice, although the jalapenos were a bit too much, so I just scooped them off to the side.  Really liked the acidic component of this dish!  With all the HH reductions, I wasn't thrilled w/ this meal, but at least I know which to revisit and which to pass next time.Lunch was also a bit disappointing.  Both lunch boat and duet came w/ many components, but Mom and I only truly enjoyed the salad, the chicken (it was good, although I couldn't eat much of it), the salmon sashimi, and the runaway hit, beef julienne (both off of the boat).  Since these came, for the most part, in two-bite portions, we didn't feel like we received our money's worth.  Looking back, I know we won't be returning any time soon.

Restaurant name  Iron Rail Café

Review Text :
When I dine in the Iron Rail, I am on the right track to value. The Iron Rail is the Railroad Pass' s draw to get motorists off US 93/95 into the casino. Flashing signs advertise too good to believe restaurant specials. There is a $7.95 prime rib special and $1 strawberry short cakes. That is the tip of the iceberg of restaurant specials.  In my case, Railroad Pass lured me into the Iron Rail from the River Mountains Loop Trail. I try to support business parking lots that I use as trailheads. After three post-hike dinners here, I am a fan. My meal of choice has been the $6.95 spaghetti with meatballs (not meat sauce). The portion is generous. Unlike the Grand Cafe,  filler garlic bread is nonexistent. Also unlike many of the cafes, the meal includes soup or salad. The chicken noodle soup has been delicious. The cola is not flat. After the end of the meal, I usually drink a cup of coffee.  The coffee may not be Starbucks, but it is good. All this food and beverage comes to approximately $11 before the tip. The Iron Rail reminds me of a small diner staffed by friendly people. On all my visits here, they made me feel welcome. With a smile, they give me a choice of a booth, table, or counter. I choose a booth. Service is with a smile, but could be slow. After a day of hiking, I prefer not to be rushed. The ironic thing about this is that I am supporting MGM International Resorts instead of a small business. When I exit the Iron Rail, I leave with the feeling that I was on the right track for a good meal at the right price. The Iron Rail will be a cafe that I will return to.The Yelp Challenge.  Review 43 of 100.

Review Text :
If you are a fan of the Bikini, this is probably the best thing that has ever happened to you. They will deliver. Right to Bikini. You can drink your $4 pitcher of hooch whilst scarfing down some deliciousness!I happened to cruise by here on my bitchin bike on my way to Bikini this Saturday to support the Grand Avenue Festival. I was litterally brought to tears at the convenience of this location.After imbibing for a while I walked back over to find the coolest, sweetest group of people. The owner was the order taker, and it is obvious how passionate she is about her business.We ended up with the garlic bread, a cheese pizza, a Philly Cheese steak and a veggie sub for $23. How this is possible, I do not know.UN  FREAKING  BELIEVABLEMan was this food good! Seriously! The cheese on the veggie sub was so tasty and the crust was scrumptious. I was also stoked to hear that they were considering putting in an extra oven to make gluten free pizza and were also considering vegan cheese! They even asked what a good brand was!A+ Customer ServiceA+ LocationA+ PricesA+ FoodHellllssss yeah! #NewFavoritePlace(PS - the review from Michael S was from the previous pizza place. This was closed, someone new bought it, redid everything and this is a brand new place)Ok, first off, I'm sure Michael S is a perfectly reasonable and accurate Yelper but the one star review he wrote below/above is from a different owner before it closed down and reopened with new ownership/management. So please don't judge them by that review. First: the location. It's located near my home where no other pizza shops dare open shop. Yes!It's just across the street from the Bikini. Can you hear the angels singing? Second: been there twice now. First time had pizza crust (for vegan-ness) and fries and a bite of the veggie sub. All superb. Today my boy Richard Z had the Monsoon, which they're soon to be famous for (it looked amazing) and I had the vegan version of their veggie sub, which was outstanding. Really, really good.  They're super nice people. Charming little place. Place to sit outside and watch the culture. They'll walk your food over to the bikini. Open til 9 on weeknights and 11 on weekends. LOVE THIS PLACE! So happy it's in my hood.So, this is my first review, and I've already got writer's block.  Im sitting here trying to think of witty and insightful things to say, but all I can come up with is "This place is super freakin good."  I live right around the corner, so my favorite part is the short drunk stumble I can embark on from my crib or Bikini Lounge, which I also spend an unreasonable amount of time at. (Bikini review almost certain to follow).  Since proximity is crucial to my lazy ass, no points deducted yet.  The second obstacle became apparent the first time I walked in, rockin a Cleveland Cavs shirt, which the owner who's from Detroit immediately began to hate on.  You see Cleveland and Detroit are in a constant heated battle for America's most ridiculed city, and we take it very seriously.  After a quick shit talking show, I realized how nice of a guy he actually was, and decided that I liked a little civic-pride in my food-obtaining.  It's a small joint, so there's usually two-max-three people in there and they make you feel like you walked in to their own homes for a nice meal.  Friendly, personable, and happy to see you.  Still at 5 stars.  Food: Pizza, sandwiches, salads, very basic.Delicious.  All of it.  I've had pretty much everything available, and it's all tasted outstanding.  Not often do you walk in to a small pizza/sandwich shop in a random neighborhood and get a quality Fish n Chips for like 6 bucks.  The pizzas are unique and interesting, and almost all have toppings you wouldn't immediately think to combine on a pie.  You'll learn that I'm extremely easy to please when it comes to basic foods, but the taste and portions at Valley Pizza always make me walk back over there and give them a high five (or low five or fist bump or whatever you're currently into).  All in all, I've been to Valley Pizza about 15 times now, and I've never been dissatisfied.  I know giving something 5 stars on your first review sets a difficult precedent, but this is truly a hidden gem in a neighborhood known mostly for Bikini Lounge and the Grand Ave galleries.  (Also for the occasional bum fight in the parking lot across from Bikini which if I could review I would give ten stars).  Do yourself a favor and the next time youre in the mood for a pizza or a big-ass sandwich, give this place a shot.  And if you dont agree, I'm right around the corner and you can come tell me why.  I might jack you in the face, but my door's always open.Don't let this ghettofied hole in the wall scare you. This pizza joint may look run down, cheap and sketchy, but looks are deceiving. This place serves up some good  food realness. They have tons of Vegetarian options that are full of flavor. I always order the Queen Elizabeth which is made with white cheese, tomatoes and Italian spices. Scrumptious, Delicious, Divalicious. Definitely a pizza fit for a Queen! Hahahaha. Okay, that's out of control and a bit much. In seriousness, delivery here is fast and the salads are decent, but what made the salad  good was their Chipotle Ranch dressing. It's very hot and spicy. It has a kick to it and that's why I love it. My mouth went up in flames when I took a bite and that's a good thing!  I was on fire!

Restaurant name  Sneakers Sports Grill

Review Text :
The word that most aptly describes the Sneaker's experience:Eww.This exclamation should be accompanied by a scrunched up nose, sneer or depressed sigh depending on the intonation.Does the smell of open sewage wafting from the bathrooms entice your tastebuds? Eww! *scrunchy nose*Do shriveled potato skins, overcooked fried zucchini sticks, or soggy hot wings float your boat? Eww. *disdainful sneer*Does the fact that they constantly change their specials and scheduled events without notice, luring you into this depressing hole under false pretenses sound dandy? Eww... *depressed sigh*I live dangerously close to this place, so more often than not I'll end up here when there's a dispute along the veins of: "Whatta you wanna do tonight? I dunno. How bout you?"Most frequently this is the end decision on a Friday night, when they hold live trivia with a host and the opportunity to win 20 to 30 bucks if you come in first or second place. But it's difficult to enjoy some live trivia when it's canceled every other week without any prior notice. That kind of business ethic doesn't instill any loyalty in your customer base. It's also kind of trashy how our winning credits are always hand written in near illegible chicken scratch on a piece of register tape, only redeemable for food, and only on a day other than trivia time. I get it. You want to lure us back on a weekday so we'll spend money in the bar. Klassy.I wouldn't have such a problem with the place if it the food was at least worth it. The nachos are huge and covered in lots of toppings but it's primarily cheap-o nacho cheese sauce or sour cream, which add little flavor and just make the whole thing a sloppy mess. The wings are soggy and generic (the hot isn't spicy in the least-- maybe they were referring to the temperature?), and there's an absolutely terrible Island Jerk flavor. The zucchini sticks are always overcooked and soggy. The cheese sticks are hard and chewy, not stringy mozzarella. The potato skins look like shriveled little potato abortions adorned by three bacon bits and some nacho sauce. The pizza is pretty decent and probably your best bet. I wouldn't recommend anything else on the menu. They use cheap, bargain basement product and it shows in the quality of the food.That leaves the bar to make up for the abysmal food. Too bad that's pretty hit or miss, with an emphasis on the miss. For about a two month stretch Sneakers seemed to change their daily specials week by week if not day by day. One day it would be two dollar ladies mixed drinks all day, next week just 9pm to close. Then it would be two dollar drafts all day, changed to half priced wings during happy hour. I don't like the bait and switch. I understand that a new or struggling place needs to cut costs and redefine its specials but when it's changing that often (too quickly for even the signage on the tables or menus to keep up) there's a serious issue with management that needs to be addressed. It seems like they've finally settled things to 75 cent domestic draft beers during happy hour (Coors and Bud) and half priced appetizers. Solid. Then from 9pm to close the daily drink specials start. Good. Keep it simple, stupid.The service at least tries to make up for the crappy food and ever changing drink specials. They're always more than patient when it comes to explaining the changes and always apologetic when they get the brunt of our disappointment when we've been victims of the ole bait and switch. The decor looks like a tacky college sports fan decorated it with all the tables sporting different teams and mascots, and paraphernalia splashed all over the walls willy nilly. There's also a weird identity problem going on, with some cheap wine prints on display in the bar and a gigantic statue of Uncle Lester from the Addams Family dressed in a referee suit. They offer Rock Band but I've never seen anyone playing it. They offer the Buzztime Trivia but hardly any televisions are ever tuned to it. There's a couple pool tables, darts, a basketball game, Buck Hunter and a couple other video games in the back. It just seems to be having an extreme identity crisis, trying to be something different to everyone, but half assing it so no one ends up satisfied.They've taken to serving beer in plastic cups and giving out paper plates for food during happy hour which is a bit on the depressing side. The general vibe makes it seem like it's on the brink of closing any given week, which is too bad because they easily have one of the best patios in Tempe. If you're going to go, sit on the patio and enjoy the greenery, cool water, friendly ducks and turtles sunning themselves. It will make you forget just how much of a downer it is inside the place.

okay. wow.so, after reading reviews of Sabuddy here on yelp, we decided to make the long drive out to Scottsdale and have some middle-eastern fare...definitely an adventure worth having and gas money well spent!it was quite empty in there(an hour before closing time), and the service was very attentive and friendly, the music pleasant and conducive to eating...we started out with the labne(sweet cream cheese with spices and olive oil, served with warm pita)...it was okay; just normal cream cheese...I aimed for the olive oil when dipping my bread...Jamie ordered the Israeli meatballs(covered in red sauce, perfectly seasoned and tender and served over savory rice, with tender, well-cooked green beans, carrots, and chickpeas--delicious)I had the tabouleh(THE BEST tabouleh I've ever had--and I've had a lot!)...it was marinated in the perfect mix of lemon juice and olive oil..the bulgur was almost crispy, not soggy, mixed in with the chunks of tomato and parsley leaves.I'm partial to adding hummus to my tabouleh, so we ordered a small hummus plate(creamy, a bit garlicky, but not overly so, and with a nice sprinkling of paprika on top, served with 2 more warm pitas)...along with my salad, I had 2 falafel balls(only 50cents apiece); the best falafel I've ever had--a crispy, spiced shell surrounding a moist, tender, mushy center...kind of like middle-eastern hushpuppies, seriously and utterly incredible!for dessert, we were convinced to buy the baklava and lemme tell you--I don't know what one of the other reviewers on here was talking about--it was moist, crispy, and drizzled in what seemed to be a cinnamon/honey/coffee sauce...we also ordered a pot of Turkish coffee--rich and hot with definite chocolate undertones...absolutely perfect and in barely any need of sugar after the supersweet, supersavory dessert.we're already planning our next trip--he wants to try the shawarma, and I'm dying for the schnitzel and many, many more falafel balls!

Review Text :
I'm very torn about Bagel Factory, as living in New York made me a bagel snob.  It's not fair to compare Bagel Factory to a NYC bagel so I won't.  But if that is what you are craving, this will not fill that void.  I think the best bagel in Pittsburgh is a fair claim to fame, but Pittsburgh has some really bad bagels.  Just a thought.I ordered a rye bagel with bacon, egg, and cheese ($3.99).  There was a ton of good, thick bacon on the sandwich, and that was AMAZING.  Plenty of cheese and the perfect amount of egg as well.  But the bagel was pretty much flavorless.  Rye bagels should have flavor.  If this place wasn't called the bagel factory, it would be different.  But the bagel was so whatever.  The bagels are also really small for a fresh bagel.I would definitely come back to the Bagel Factory, but I think they really should work on creating a more memorable bagel.They accept credit cards.

When we stumbled into Dick's we did not know that it is their intent to be rude and insulting.  I caught on pretty quick as I looked around and read the hats of fellow patrons some of which said:"daddy says I'm more flexible than mommy"" I swallow on the first date"  "moses popped my cherry"We caught on quick when a rude ass server came up and said "i'm hungover"  and thru down a bunch of napkins and silverware on our table.I said "perfect, so are we!"We all got along just fine!the servers point uninterested at the menus on the wall and drag their feet while they move from table to table. We had a great time listening to the heavy guy on the mic insult folks and do lap dances.  And yes - my daughter got one.I could not resist when he said "anyone having a birthday???"  I pointed to my girl.  She shook her head back and forth like she was possessed but I didnt care - i kept on hollering!The lap dance is a funny mockery of a very not cute guy in a very small red thong that is pulled out high on his waist so you can see it when he removes his shirt (all while dancing) to expose a big old belly.It was comedic to those of us that did not have big man ass in our faces.  Keep in mind my daughter is probaby 5'7" and maybe weighs 115 pounds and here is this big ass dude bumping and grinding in her face.  She was a good sport in the end and laughed with us as we watched the video.Her best friend got a hat that read "easier to get into than a community college" The food was actually pretty good for dive grill food and the drinks could use more booze in them but does not matter - we had a blast and left stuffed.It turns into a nightclub of sorts in the evening - we skipped that part of it.Are you kidding me? The first thing I wanted to do when arriving in Vegas was to get a drink. We saw Dick's and headed over while our room was finished being cleaned. The whole thing is that they treat you like sh*t. I guess some people are into that, and usually you can tell by who they date. Me, not so much. Basically the people refuse to answer questions like where the bathroom is, yell at you, throw food at you, and complain that there tip wont be enough when you leave. People also where stupid hats made out of paper that the waiter writes rude remarks on. Again, people like to look like idiots. There is a difference between being funny about it and being a complete jerk, dick is a jerk. The food is obviously frozen and heated up, just normal chicken strips and that sort of thing, nothing better than the school cafeteria.Awful service.  Terrible manners and treatment of customers.  My fellow doctors and priests were outraged at the language and waiting at this establishment.  Hopefully you can tell by my star rating and utter facetiousness that in reality, this place is fantastic.  As they warn you as you enter, you best know what you are getting into before you enter.  This themed restaurant is extremely fun to visit and dine at as they treat you miserably, with the upside that you get to do the same in return.  The service itself was actually quick and accurate, but you always get lip no matter what you order, compliment, or complain about.  The food is completely appetizing, especially good as an all-nighter/hangover recover food.  Good beef, chicken, and pork based sandwiches and burgers to choose from.  They have a full bar, of course, and serve all Pepsi products from the fountain.The Las Vegas Dick's do a great job achieving the desired effect and theme of the restaurant chain, better than the San Diego franchise, sorry to say, and their unique approach to customer service should be applauded.If you don't easily get offended by profanity or mockery towards you, then I think you will enjoy this restaurant.  It is located inside the Excalibur Hotel Casino in the Las Vegas Strip.Supposedly but not sure, this place is suppose to resemble an east coast attitude type of restaurant.  The satire is to act like rude waiters and waitresses without giving a sh*t about how the patrons feel about the service.  When you first walk in, the hostess asks you if you have ever been here or know what this place is all about. You could say yes or no while you are being seated. But ultimately you will see a sign that tells you as you kind of and can't help but check the restaurant decoratives around the walls.  Or you'll hear profanity being shouted by the servers... of course in the name of fun.  Believe it or not,  the food and drinks here are quite good.  We ordered a bacon burger, a local moco, and a rib eye steak along with a hurricane and a strawberry daiquiri slush, an iced tea, and a brownie in a cup topped with whipped cream and jarred cherries. The bacon burger was huge. It's prepared with generous proportions of a beef patty and bacon strips with lettuce and tomatoes served with french fries.  It was good.  The local moco was also delicious. The beef patty was also a good size topped with an egg with gravy and some hot sauce with white rice underneath.  It was tasty and I devoured it and wanted to order a second.   The rib eye steak was probably the biggest surprise of our meal.  I really did not expect anything special. I actually tried to persuade my friend to order something else. Oh boy, I was wrong! The rib eye was cooked medium, and the steak was quite big at 14 ounces. It was served with steamed vegetables, but the meat was delicious with flavor.  The iced tea is just iced tea,  but their spiked slushies are awesome.  It's sweet and is fruity... very refreshing but with liquor mixed in it.  However,  the liquor seems more camaflouged in the strawberry daiquiri though... haha.Fyi, all the food and drinks ordered is for three people. In case you thought I was a big eater, which i am. Haha. Dick's is a very fun place to hang out.  Good food and drinks makes a difference. The ambiance is very east coast like indeed along with its attitude.  But you must be able to not get offended easily from what's said, and be cool.  Our waitress was actually really nice even with her wise cracks.Enjoy your time there and cheers!

The only thing I will ever remember about this place is the icy customer service and the inflexible menu. I ordered a bean and cheese burrito since I'm a substitute kind of person and on the menu is said "absolutely NO substitutes!" - yikes! So instead of getting $9 out of me they only got $6. But lets talk about this bean and cheese burrito...I was under the impression that a bean and cheese burrito was basically - bean and cheese wrapped up in a warm tortilla and maybe some graded cheese on top. Well, this was not the case! Half way through my burrito I came across shredded beef pieces! I'm not a vegetarian, but if I was I would have had a heart attack! The first thing that came to my mind was "absolutely NO substitutes!" - but does that mean only they can substitute? Or is the cook just going senile? Either way, I didn't like that. Not one bit. I didn't really even want the bean and cheese burrito, I really wanted the taco salad, but I couldn't ask for substitutes so I was forced to pick the plainest thing on the menu and they go and add stuff to it! I did like that they left the water pitcher with us at the table...however, the table they gave us was the smallest table in the room. We barely had room for our plates and utensils, let-alone this big water jug. I felt cramped; and this was emphasized by the guy sitting behind me, because when he scooted his chair back a little bit - it nearly knocked me face first into my plate! Oh, and by the way, large groups: they "absolutely will NOT split checks" so this is not the best place to go Dutch. I will end on a positive note: ....did I mention already that they left water for us to refill our glasses? Oh...I did. Well, I guess I ran out of positives - Sorry.I've seen this place from the bus and now the light rail when coming into work for a while now.  Friday, I got stuck working very late, and my boss took me to dinner when we were done with our project as a thank you.She wanted something mexican, and close to the office.  She said that she loved this place, so she took me here.  Walking in, I liked the decore of this place.  Authentic looking, and seemed cute!  Thats where the niceities stop.We walked in and were seated.  The service was absolutely HORRIFIC.  I was blatently ignored, but my boss was waited on as if she were the queen.  I have a theory about why, but I dare not write it down here, for fear of backlash.  I had to scream at the server halfway across the resturant when he refused to take my drink order.  I was astounded!  When he took my order, it was as if he were doing me a favor...horrible.Food was HOT.  So spicy that I was unable to eat it.  Why cant they state that in thier menu?  My  boss thought it was hysterical because I turned 7 shades of red from the spicy-ness.  lol.  Anyways, the next day the food was better from my fridge, I just wasn't expecting a mouth full of spicy hot food.  lol.Anyways, I will not be returning to this craptastic shithole.  Never again.  Service was aweful, and the food was just WAY to spicy for me.  I can get Mexican food just as decent with substantially better service at a spice level I can handle at about a zillion different places in this town.Stay away from this place! Its horrible!It was March 17th, St. Patrick's Day. And like every good Irish guy, I decided to wear my pride and do what comes naturally: eat. Only, rather than walk the 3 blocks to Seamus, I instead called in an enchilada order to Los Dos Molinos. And this was after I read some of these reviews. I'm quite daring. You'd think I worked for the IRS.After hearing horror stories about the crazy hot and spicy red chile, I settled on ordering that for my lunch. Apparently, LDM has either tamed down the flame, because I was able to eat the entire meal without incident. Even the following day I wasn't getting afterburners ignited. So much for heat. But, the flavors were good, the price was great, and the adventure of jaywalking across Washington tied the whole experience nicely together. I'm looking forward to actually getting to eat inside this location, and not just rail it to a fro.A solid three stars.

Furry watch 2013 happened here. Seems to be a trend to come here during furry week for me. I think next time I'll go to Sonoma Grille and spend the extra $$ for friendly service and good food. This was actually the first time I had eaten here. I had heard the rumors of great sweet potato fries. Those rumors proved to be true. They were really great. Sweet with a touch of spicy. And whatever that honey sauce they served with it... I practically liked it clean. And stole my friends container of it too. But the rest of the experience, not so great. I ordered a veggie wrap as well and it was pitiful. Pretty much spinach with a few red peppers tossed in the mix and a dollop of hummus. It was very bland and really in sad shape. Our server was also not very happy with us towards the end. I will tell you exactly what happened so as not to confuse the situation. Was it busy? Yes. Was she friendly up until the check issue? Yes. Do I understand how things work because I've been a server before? Yes!So the problem... there were 5 of us ladies who, of course, did not have much cash with us. She told us at first the system "couldn't process" more than 3 cards and cash payment split between us. She left us to figure things out. She comes back and we asked her if we could pay with 2 cards and cash, and she said no, their policy is that during conventions or busy times, they just don't split bills or payment. A little bit conflicting? Yes. She also told us the policy is on the menu. Now I cannot attest to whether it is or not, but I would be curious to know. Now I understand that in some instances places prefer you to pay in cash in a larger group, but usually they will tell you that at the beginning of the meal. This did not happen. I guess what I'm trying to say was that there were holes to the story. Whether it is restaurant policy or not, I just don't think it was communicated properly. She was clearly frustrated with us and it was a bit of a frustrating situation. I could be persuaded to come back for the sweet potato fries, but I'm coming with cash next time, lesson learned!

Review Text :
I love In-N-Out, but this is the first time I've got to give them only 3 Stars.  I recently came to this location and ordered:Cheeseburger Animal Style, $2.25http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/in-n-out-burger-tempe?select=K7mA8k4ZMqZ0ga-DN0-wdQ#K7mA8k4ZMqZ0ga-DN0-wdQhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/in-n-out-burger-tempe?select=EUJfvJBibUcaWvjeggno5w#EUJfvJBibUcaWvjeggno5wFrench Fries Animal Style, $3.50http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/in-n-out-burger-tempe?select=MocfGFJGvCqJYX4_rR_7VQ#MocfGFJGvCqJYX4_rR_7VQSmall Soda, $1.40The Cheeseburger was perfect....had all of the flavor that I've come to love about In-N-Out.  The Animal Fries on the other hand were terrible....they were cold and chewy.  Unbelievable, because they cook it fresh....they must've left this order on the counter while they finished by Burger instead of giving me a fresh order of Animal Fries.  It was a little disappointing because I normally have a 4 or 5 Star experience at an In-N-Out.Oh well, maybe I caught them on a bad day?  Return Factor - 60%Of fast food burger joints few places are as well known in areas where they have absolutely no store presence as the chain "In-N-Out Burger". While visiting Arizona on a business trip I was aware In-N-Out Burger was a fixture in the area, and it had been well over a decade since the last time I had stopped at one. Since my first pair of visits to In-N-Out Burgers in California in the early 2000s, I've seen people wearing In-N-Out Burger shirts, read countless articles about the chain, and decided the next time I'm near one I'll give it another shot. My feeling in previous visits to In-N-Out was that while good, and inexpensive there was nothing exceptional about the food there. Would I notice something I didn't before?When I arrived at my hotel in Tempe Arizona I was immediately able to spot an In-N-Out location and visited several times during my two week stay. On my initial visit I ordered a 3x3 which is three beef patties and three slices of cheese served "Animal style" which is with lettuce, tomato, the beef patties being mustard cooked; pickle, extra Thousand Island style sauce known as "spread" with grilled onions. I also got Lemonade and animal style fries which added spread and onions to the top of my fries. Overall, I thought the burger was very good, especially for the price, but that even with the spread the fries were a bit lacking. My next visit I went in a slightly different direction, passed on getting any fries and just got a regular 3x3 burger without the animal style additions and a chocolate shake. I noticed that besides the lettuce, tomato and onions it didn't taste as different as I thought it would. I also obtained this through the drive-thru and was given a box rather than a bag, making it somewhat difficult to transport without spilling. The shake I had was excellent, and while I was in the area I tried vanilla,chocolate and strawberry shakes and all were good.My overall opinion of In-N-Out is this, if you've never visited one it isn't the legendary once in a lifetime experience you may have heard about. However, it is very good for fast food and is quite inexpensive. The most unique characteristic of getting an animal style In-N-Out burger is that it is unique tasting. Nothing exactly tastes quite like an In-N-Out burger, the sharp onions and more sour than big mac sauce thousand island spread give the burger its character. It might not be the best tasting fast food burger ever, but it has its own identity. I am going to give In-N-Out four stars.

Restaurant name  SakeBomber Sushi & Grill

Review Text :
I got a call from a friend the other night that a new sushi bar had opened across from her  local laundromat. Not knowing exactly what to expect from a sushi bar called "SakeBomber" I diligently made my way down to Tempe to check this place out, hoping to find another great sushi happy hour (which runs Monday through Friday 5-7 p.m. as I write this review).I definitely got the nightclub vibe from SakeBomber. It was low lit with colored lights lighting the bar, there were flat screen TV showing sports and hip-hop music playing just slightly too loud (perhaps they're taking a page from the Ra play book).There was no wait for a table during the Wednesday night happy hour. I ordered edamame, a crispy california roll and a spicy salmon roll. My friend got a spicy tuna roll and a crispy eel roll. While we didn't do any SakeBombs (hey, you wanted a legible coherent review right?) we did enjoy some $1 warm sake.I'd love to write you something more descriptive here... but all I can really come up with is that "the sushi was pretty good." I enjoyed it, but it didn't knock me off my feet (although the spicy salmon was actually spicy, a nice change from most other places I've tried in the valley). The rolls were slightly larger than what gets served at Sushi 101 (what I would classify as SakeBomber's most direct competition). The only problem I have with this is that it gets difficult to get the entire roll in your mouth in one try.After reading everything above, you might be thinking to yourself, "Why the heck did he give this place four stars?" Price. Although this wasn't the best sushi in the world and I personally didn't care for the atmosphere, as I write this, the happy hour menu is probably the most reasonably priced I've found. Edamame and two rolls during happy hour  was only $11.I'm definitely going back to SakeBomber... not only do I want to try some things on the non-happy hour menu that looked enticing, continuing to go at happy hour will hopefully keep the sushi monkey on my back from continuing to eat a hole in my pocket.S has been on Yelp searching cool places for me to try during my visit here to the Phoenix area.Being away from home and wanting some comfort food, S suggested that I try Sake Bomber to get my sushi fix. The location was in close proximity to my hotel so I made arrangements for transportation to the restaurant. The staff at the front desk mentioned that the food there was pretty good.So, let's put that into perspective...I'm sure that there are many fine restaurants in the Phoenix area. When I'm visiting I love to experience restaurants (not chain) to get a taste of the local flavor. I'll have to say that SakeBomber is not the best representative of what Japanese food should be...I arrived during happy hour and the wait staff was very friendly and accommodating. I had imagined that I might be able to catch up on some reading while dining - but this was not the case. A patron of the restaurant, who thought he was being funny, was loud and demanding more drinks from the server. The dark interior, dim lighting and thumping music wasn't conducive to a serene dining experience. Oh well, I was here to get my sushi fix. I'm thinking that I shouldn't judge on appearances and maybe, just maybe, the sushi would redeem the thoughts that were going through my head.First came the gyoza and agedashi tofu. The gyoza was ok, but was very disappointed with the agedashi. I'm used to the agedashi dishes from Gombei or Hoshi's - piping hot chunks of creamy deep friend tofu, swimming in that wonderful sauce, covered with bonito flakes, grated ginger and radish. Instead I got chunks of barely warm firm tofu arranged on a platter with tempura sauce and sprinkled with a few green onions. I was hungry so, I ate it. I must admit that the salmon skin roll was the best deal of it all - 8 pieces of salmon skin nigiri with grilled asparagus and carrots. It was filling as well as yummy. I also had smoke salmon and hamachi maki. The fish was not the best I ever had, but I think that the sake I had during dinner helped the experience along with watching the snow boarding competition on the big screen TV behind the bar. I called the hotel shuttle to pick me up after dinner. I had to chuckle when the driver asked, "How in the world did you end up at SakeBombers?""You see," I told him. "It was like this..."Ah yes, American sushi.    White, frat boy sushi chefs.   The server was under 21 so her friend had to drop off the drinks as she followed here to the table.It's an alright place, not bad for ASU but that's where the buck stops. The asparagus app. was good. The rolls were good.  We didn't get sick, good.Smoking hot Asian hostess..... arrrrrrrr...............Fuck it - I'm giving this place 5 stars. It's far too easy to be a sushi snob I guess - which is funny since we're in Arizona - but I meet them all the time. It's also kinda funny to me how sushi-lovers love to hate sushi restaurants. It's like you ask a sushi fanatic where to go and they snidely scoff and mumble something about an exotic little place off the coast of wherever that they've probably only been to once if at all and suggest you might as well pick up a steamy dog shit off the lawn and eat that if you're going to eat at whatever place you were asking about. I think it's meant to make the rest of us feel stupid for not being an expert. Well I'm a novice - I've only been to about a dozen different sushi places probably less than 50 times. I like the stuff, but I'm not from Japan or anything... I don't have it in my blood. I just know what I like and I tend to get the same or similar things wherever I go. So given my experiences with sushi places and restaurants in general, I have to say this place is great. The servers were friendly and attentive, the decor was nice and kinda swanky without being overdone, the music sucked but wasn't too loud, and the food was quite good. If that doesn't make a 5 star joint, I don't know what does.We had a roll and a teriyaki chicken dish from the menu along with a small bottle of sake that we bombed. Everything was crazy good. Oh, and we had edemame as well. The roll was pretty huge compared to most places and the chicken dish was ridiculously huge. For all the food we had, the prices were pretty reasonable. To be honest, I expected this place to suck. The location, the outside, the name, etc... it all kinda gave the impression this wasn't going to be any good. Well, it was... so I guess... don't judge a book by its cover? This isn't a chain, it doesn't smell fishy inside (at least it didn't when I was there), and it's clean. Compared to places like zen32 or stingray, this place holds its own. I think it kicks Ra in the ass - and I kinda like Ra okay. I ventured into the bathroom and it was clean and nice, but a little hodge-podgey (2 different styles of sink)... nice though... and clean. I was actually a little shocked to see so many negative reviews after enjoying it so much... I guess that's the beauty of this site - it's all opinions, so nobody gets to be "right" and nobody has to be "wrong." If you're like me and you enjoy your Americanized sushi restaurant grills, you may really enjoy this. If you're a sushi genius, your mileage may vary.This place is awesome!My wife and I stopped in on a Friday night before heading off to the Tempe Improv. At first blush, it seemed a little dark. The decor is very black and red...almost like you'd find at some after hours club..only with more windows...or any windows, for that matter. But, it wasn't anything that was going to deter us from coming in.We were greeted by the hostess who was pleasant enough. She was certain to point out the current specials drawn on the dry-erase board located by the hostess' stand. On this night, the Baja Roll was the flavor of choice. We obviously weren't ready to make such a snap decision before being seated, but we did let the idea simmer while were shown to our table.Once seated, we took a look over the actual menu. There are several pages offering up varying concoctions, including dinner plates, sushi rolls, and even delicious cocktails available at the full bar. We knew we were about to run into a two-drink minimum in the very near future, so we opted to forego the drinks this time.After a few times through the menu, and after deeply considering the current special, we had made our decision. For both of us to share, we decided to get two different rolls, as well as an appetizer: The Playgirl Roll and the Baja Roll, plus an order of Mussels. The Mussels were the first to arrive. Perfect for sharing, and very nicely seasoned. The only downside to the mussels was that we didn't have forks...we had chopsticks. I am absolutely TERRIBLE with chopsticks, so I had to do a little work. Sure, I could have asked for a fork. But what would have been the fun in that, right? Plus, it made my wife laugh, and that's always an added bonus.After our appetizer, we found ourselves face to face with two beautiful creations. The Baja Roll came on a plate with a surprisingly spicy sauce in the middle of the plate. As the manager explained during one of her many trips to our table, the Baja Roll was kind of like a fish taco, but with a Japanese twist. She was absolutely right. Delicious! Couple that with our salmon, cream cheese and avocado Playgirl Roll, and our dinner was amazing!I'm honored to be the 100th review for this awesome Sushi spot. It turned out to be a fantastic date night dinner. Hopefully, we'll be back sometime in the near future, if only to improve my chopstick skills. I mean, I'm REALLY bad with chopsticks...comically bad.

Review Text :
Any place that rewards my check-in with a tasty on-the-house Sangria is A-OK with me!  Especially since I would have checked-in regardless.  We had 8:30 reservations on a Saturday.  When we got there, there were a few tables open in this hip Cuban style restaurant.  Our waitress greeted us quickly and supplied our Sangrias within 5 minutes.  She inquired if we were ready and I said I needed a minute.  She left to attend to a much bigger party, and we were quickly greeted by another server who explained he would be helping because she was taking care of a bachelorette party.  He described the menu, how ceviche is made and was very informative.  However, when he left our original waitress appeared as the party table was wrapping up, I am guessing to go party a little more hardy... I decided I wanted to try the Fire and Ice Seviche with salmon.  She kind of shuttered, and said most people don't choose that with the F&I... Ok I love getting suggestions from the servers... She said most like crab or Ahi Tuna... Well then I will go with the crab... It was fabulous... I loved the balance of heat and citrus and herbs to cool it down.  Definitely a winner.   The drink I decided on next was a Manhattan featuring Wigle Whisky, holy snikes, it was almost as much as my main meal!  It was good, had a punch, but I couldn't blow the whole budget on cocktails!  Or could I??Next we both got a trio of taco's.  My husband went with BBQ Short ribs tacos, were as I played mix and match and got one BBQ Short rib, on Baja Fish, and one BLT.  We both really enjoyed the BBQ Short Rib taco but it was such a small amount of fillings in the shell.  The shell stood a good inch above where the filling ended.  Kind of disappointing there.  My Baja Fish was really tasty but it was a little dry.  It needed an aioli or slaw something.  Good flavor, just needed a boost.  The last taco, the BLT was by far my favorite.  Filled to the top with the pickled veg and romaine, and the pork belly boats sat on top.  I call them boats because they were big strips not bite sized cuts which I thought was way better than cutting them up.  The prices on our tacos were not bad but since the short rib one was so skimpy my husband was still quite hungry, so I talked him into getting dessert... HA!  Yea like someone really needs to talk him into dessert; ) He ordered the flourless chocolate cake.  It was good and he enjoyed it but it was a bit pricey for the size.  And unfortunately he left hungry.  I on the other hand was satisfied so I can't complain and I am sure we will be back to sample some other dishes.Never have I ever felt so uncomfortable that I walked out of a restaurant without ordering...until I came here.I showed up with a friend last Fri. night around 10pm after a Cultural District gallery crawl.  I suggested this place since it seemed interesting and different, it had strong ratings on Yelp, and they offered a free glass of sangria for a check in.  When we walked in, it was fairly busy and seemed understaffed, and there was no hostess to seat us.  Since we were planning to order a few drinks and some tapas, my friend suggested we sit at the bar, and I agreed, so we walked over and seated ourselves.  A guy who looked like the manager or owner walked over pretty promptly and handed us some food and drink menus, which we perused for about 10 min.Once we'd decided what to order, we set our menus down, and the guy who'd handed them to us came over to take our order.  The weirdness started when I said, "Well, I'd like to claim my free sangria since I checked in on Yelp," only to realize that the guy purportedly taking my order had disappeared!  I gave my friend a confused look, and he told me that the guy had walked off right after I said "Well," and joked that perhaps starting an order with "Well," was unacceptable in this establishment.  It was at this point that I realized that we weren't sitting at the bar--we were actually sitting at the chef's table (which is structured similarly to the bar)!  My friend hadn't known this when he led us over there to sit, and I only happened to know that this was the chef's table b/c I'd read that they had one.  Nobody, including the guy who "waited" on us, had bothered to tell us this simple fact, or to suggest that we may want to move elsewhere if we weren't planning on ordering entrees--instead, they just ignored us!  At this point, we both felt weird enough that we got up and decided to leave, and did so without further ado.I'm not sure if we were profiled as peons who didn't look wealthy enough to be sitting at the chef's table, or if this place was so understaffed that they decided to blow off anyone showing the slightest degree of indecisiveness.  Either way, the treatment we received was, quite frankly, unacceptable.  If the management thinks it's okay to ignore customers and make them feel uncomfortable, they won't have many of them left before long--not to mention any revenue.P.S. We left and headed over to the Harris Grill in Shadyside, where we spent a cool $50 + tip on drinks and food.I just want to clone and date me. Is that too much to ask?Solo date night: dinner and drinks at Seviche... So happy!! hehe (~o~)Seviche is a Latin American dish of raw fish marinated in citrus juice... onions...tomatoes and chilies and sometimes flavored with cilantro....delicious!!you have to order their tacos.!!!one of my favorite entrees was just munching on their specialty tacos...was very filling too!  pair with their signature mojitos perfect!Drinks is one of the most important part of my meals....i ordered champagne... mojitos and a sangria..WOW..everything was strong and tasteful!

This is right around the corner from me, and I go there often. The only reason why I would give this place 3 stars is because of the service. Otherwise, the food is good. It's my #1 choice over any other fast Mexican food around here. Their meat spices are good, everything is always fresh and I LOVE their queso here. A lot of people don't like this type of queso, but I love white cheese queso.The nachos are always my #1 favorite. Other than that, I usually get the rice bowls. The reason I have a distaste for the customer service - There is a couple of ladies there that are almost always rude. They give you a look like you're inconveniencing them and they act like they hate their job. It's cool, I understand. I hate my job too. But, I don't treat my customers like shit because it's my fault I hate my job, not theirs. There is one in particular that always is hateful. She never says hello, never asks what she can help me with and she has always screwed up my order. I tell her what I want, and she always puts something else. I hate to be a bother, so I never complain and I finally told her last time that that's what not what I had said. She seemed annoyed and I told her it was okay and that I didn't want her to change it. I don't like being rude to people, even if they're rude to me first. It sucks because I really don't like the other places around here, so I keep going back. I just mentally prepare myself before going in knowing my experience won't be the best. Maybe it's just me...

Review Text :
Búzios has been on my to try list for quite some time.  When I saw a Groupon for it, I bought one and planned to have dinner here on the night I was going to see Penn & Teller at the Rio.I had a reservation for 6:30 and I was promptly seated in an almost empty restaurant.  There was one table occupied and one person eating at the seafood bar.  I had looked at the menu online, but I took some time looking there, changing my mind, and then ordering.  I was brought a bread basket, served water, and brought an iced tea quickly.I ordered a jumbo lump crabmeat cocktail, the miso Chilean sea bass, and the 7 layer chocolate cake for dessert.  The lump crabmeat was the best part of the meal.  The crab was tasty and the cocktail sauce they brought had extra horseradish to mix in.  I really enjoyed this appetizer.The sea bass was disappointing.  It was on the menu under their "House Signatures" section of the menu.  It's described as sea bass with a house made miso glaze.  What I got was more of a miso gravy than glaze and it wasn't appealing.  When I tasted it, I wished I had ordered the plain sea bass.  The sea bass was moist and very hot (temperature).  The entrée comes with two sides and I chose cole slaw and garlic fries.  The fires were good but they had absolutely no taste of garlic.  The cole slaw was OK.When it came to dessert, I had asked my server if the cobbler was warmed.  He said yes.  I asked him if it was already warm and he said no.  I ordered the cobbler and asked that it not be warmed.  About 3 minutes later, he came back and said they ran out of cobbler.  I opted for the 7 layer chocolate cake.  I wonder if they really were out or if the cobbler was indeed kept warm and he didn't want to tell me that.Service was spotty during the night.  Empty Sweet 'n Low packets were not removed from the table until I put them in the empty crab cocktail glass.  Iced tea wasn't refilled as quickly as many restaurants of lesser cost, and the table was not properly bussed.  The waiter didn't remove the bread basket and bread plate before he brought the dessert.  After I had taken a few bites of the cake, a bus person came by and removed those items.And then there's the Groupon.  The fine print says not valid with any other..... including Total Rewards.  That means, they don't give you the TR pricing.  It's not that much of a loss to the customer and it shouldn't be that big of a deal for Búzios either.  $1 more for the appetizer, $3 more for the sea bass, and $1 more for dessert.  You got $5 more out of me for using a Groupon.  Was it worth it to you?  Also, the Groupon states that an 18% service fee (note they can't say gratuity anymore because of IRS rules) will be applied to the bill prior to discount.  I somewhat understand this, but my server got cheated a bit because I normally do 20%.  Not that much difference but hey, I'm getting back part of the TR pricing I couldn't have.  Finally, reservations were made through Open Table.  At any other restaurant, as soon as I check in, Open Table says I have 100 points.  As of this afternoon, my Open Table points are "pending".This apparently is the way Búzios operates.  Don't be business friendly with the customer.  Instead, challenge them and nickel and dime them every step of the way.  Groupons normally are sold by new companies to drive traffic and make a name.  The other reason is to help failing places.  Since the Búzios Groupon is an ongoing seller, I can only imagine that they're struggling to stay alive.What a mistake it was to come here!

Review Text :
"Wait till you try some of MY sauce?" says the chef to two ladies while standing over a pile of rice shaped like a dude's junk (The balls are even sprinkled with black sesame seeds).  Welcome to Musashi.Great spot to unwind with good teppanyaki prepared by talented, sometimes lewd, chefs in an unpretentious, fun atmosphere.The classic teppanyaki "show" is almost flawless in execution from years of experience.  Chefs effortlessly carry on a fun conversation while creating very consistently flavored and accurately cooked food.  Something very difficult to find in teppanyaki joints.Steaks are cooked to temperature and served with eight dipping sauces, many made on the teppan cook top.  Prawns and lobster tails are sweet and cooked right.  Well cooked veg.  Tasty fried rice (no comment about the chef's sauce).Dinner sets offer the best selection and value with most sets below $35.Other menu items?  Who knows.  This is a TEPPANYAKI restaurant.  Get your sushi fix elsewhere.Open till 4am.Note:  The Travel Channel's "Steak Paradise II" featured Musashi for their use of "imported from Japan Kobe beef".  Since the import ban of 2010 it's  no longer available.Musashi Japanese SteakhouseWhen in Vegas....some of the better restaurants are located just off the strip...that Musashi Japanese Steakhouse was just that.So, after dropping $400 on a Black Jack table (losing 7 out of  8 hands) in less than 10 minutes it was decided that it was time for dinner.  At least the room was comp.  Whisked away in a large black vehicle our party arrived at Musashi Japanese Steakhouse.  We were hungry, we were ecstatic....no wait, no line....what a way to go.  We were seated, drinks ordered and menus were served.Here is what we decided on:My Ex-Girlfriendhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/BcW7Z9lPmOB_8eS2lEuOqQ?select=O4JtnWgrryVq3aLDTTFYnQ#O4JtnWgrryVq3aLDTTFYnQ99% Rollhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/BcW7Z9lPmOB_8eS2lEuOqQ?select=O4JtnWgrryVq3aLDTTFYnQ#mfMYDmaLojuTHenrx-1BbANY Steakhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/BcW7Z9lPmOB_8eS2lEuOqQ?select=O4JtnWgrryVq3aLDTTFYnQ#wcfYoMtMWEiJctnRK8dpPgIka-Yaki (Baked Squid)http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/BcW7Z9lPmOB_8eS2lEuOqQ?select=O4JtnWgrryVq3aLDTTFYnQ#kMmweG5KHbbIklQFy0KWiABroiled Salmonhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/BcW7Z9lPmOB_8eS2lEuOqQ?select=O4JtnWgrryVq3aLDTTFYnQ#zPyvxdok-7JyeWyqJKUGmgIt didn't take too long before our food had arrived, but we were running behind schedule as we were....there was another table waiting for us at another event....so we still asked our server to please hurry up....sure enough our food began to arrive.First the Ika-Yaki.....for those of you who like Baked Squid, this was not a bad dish.  Next was the Broiled Salmon....the Salmon was very fresh and not over cooked.  Very moist and tasty as it was covered in Teriyaki sauce.  The sauce was just about right, not an over dominating flavor.This was followed by the NY Steak and Rib-Eye.  I have no idea what a NY Steak is doing in a Japanese Restaurant....but that was what we had ordered.  The Rib-Eye was a much better cut, soft and tender, juicy and topped off with some Teriyaki Sauce.  The NY Steak was done the same way, not too bad...I can't complain much about the NY Steak...just that my preference would be the Rib-Eye.As we were half way through our meal...the rolls began to come.The 99% roll came first and was all too good to not eat one piece but you just had to eat 2 pieces or more.We had one more roll coming.....and our server had just informed me that our Ex-Girlfriend will be a little late.  DARN!!  I picked up my phone and called my Ex....she's late as usual....Ok....I need to settle down a little....I should have gone for the Porn Star instead.....would have been rolling in style.  So finally our Ex-Girlfriend shows up and we just devour her as quickly as we can.   To my surprise it was very good.  Crab, avocado, spicy tuna with halibut tempura and spicy mayo.Next time I'm going for the Porn Star, she'll be at the table before the Ex-Girl Friend.  I'm also looking forward to their Kama Sutra roll next time.Overall, the meal was exotic, climatic with loads of orgasmic flavors.  Such an explosive meal....off to the next event.  Will be back for the Porn Star for sure!!Place was clean, bathrooms clean, not too loud and a nice atmosphere.  A restaurant to try when in Vegas!!  4 StarsMusashi Japanese Steakhouse was definitely my absolute favorite and best teppanyaki experience, ever. The Samurai Special II with NY steak and scallops was perfect for me! My food was cooked and played with at our teppan station by our beloved chef! Each moresel of food was exquisite! And even better with the sauces that were presented to us.There were a plethora of sauces and I had a hard time keeping track. Each one was delicious and unique, so I can't really give you tips on which one to go for. All Teppan entrees served with miso soup, salad, rice, shrimp appetizer, and assorted vegetables. We had a lot of fun with the shrimp appetizer! Chef Tsutomu made shrimp bunnies!We also tried the lobster fried rice, which was also very tasty!As for dessert, I highly recommend the tempura ice cream. Yes, tempura battered and fried vanilla ice cream! And it is just as great as it sounds. :)..and it's not just the food that makes this place great!Chef Tsutomu is such a ham. He's hilarious and good at what he does. He is both an expert cook AND an exciting entertainer. If you're thinking about dining at Musashi, request Chef Tsutomu! You definitely won't regret it!!!One of the better if not best Japanese Teppanyaki places I've been too anywhere (Including Japan itself) For those of you unfamiliar of what Teppanyaki is, it's the melding of technique and style with Japanese cuisine pan fried on a Teppan (huge) grill. The chef always puts on an elaborate show with acrobatic shrimp and flying vegetables to entertain and wow the guests.  You will always leave this place  fully stuffed and drunk (well at least me lol)!If you come to Teppanyaki restaurants often, you will often get tired of the same routine they pull, so it's best to go once in a while or bring friends who never experienced it themselves. But the food is always delicious so I don't mind some of the acts getting old really.My favorite is the Musashi Special, it comes with Filet mignon, prawns, scallops, lobster tail,fried rice and choice of ice cream all for $58. It's a lot of food so be prepared. Here is the list of the main Teppanyaki entrees.Musashi Special 58.00Filet mignon, prawns, scallops, lobster tail,fried rice and choice of ice creamSteak Lovers Special 90.00Kobe beef, New York steak and filet mignonKimono Special 22.50Sukiyaki steak and chicken breastGeisha Special 26.75New York Steak and chicken breastKatana Special 24.00Chicken breast and prawnsRonin Special 32.00Prawns and scallopsNinja Special 29.00Salmon filet and prawnsThey also have sushi and sushi rolls. I've tried a lot of them and all of them are very good comparable to actual specialized sushi restaurants. This place is also open late (4.a.m.) If you never tried Japanese Teppanyaki, this is a good first place to try!Teppanyaki is ALWAYS a fun time.  Can't beat food, drinks, entertainment and FIRE!  We made an 8:30pm reservation less than an hour before and were seated at a full table.  My wife got the filet mignon/shrimp combo.  I got the NY strip/salmon combo.  The fried rice is $3.50 and well worth it.  We were also served a bevy of vegetables including zucchini, onions, mushrooms and bean sprouts all cooked to perfection.  I actually preferred the sirloin over filet here since they chop it up and put a lot of sauce on it.  We were also able to try a portion of the scallops due to a wrong order and those were really good too.  I get Misti Y's "shabby" comment regarding the interior.  The teppanyaki area felt kind of basementy but you kind of forget about it once the chef starts.  The bar area seemed pretty makeshift too.  It wasn't exactly an area you'd spend an hour at.  On a side note, maybe it's me being a snob but I scoff at people that order well done steaks.  I know it's a personal choice that I should respect but why would you want to do that to a steak?  No less than 4 people at our table ordered well done!  Their raw cuts of filet looked quite different than the others that ordered rare or medium rare.  Lower quality perhaps?  3 people also straight up didn't want any vegetables even in their fried rice.  Grown people!  More for the rest of us!!I came here twice in one week for teppanyaki , but I will never come back after the second time. The first time I came here, my experience was so awesome! The chef wasn't that good at doing his little tricks, but he was still entertaining. It was during normal hours, and I fell in love with their fried rice and mushrooms. Three days later, I came really late at night during their happy hour. We ordered about the same amount food like last time. The server told us it's 50% off so we get half the portions, but it's the same exact food as the normal menu. So we ordered twice as much. Here comes the chef who looked at us like, "great some of my customers are 12 year olds." Just because we look young, doesn't mean you start downgrading your service (I despise servers like that, and yes, we do look like 12 year olds). I told him twice before he started that no onions on any of our food (my bf is allergic), and he said, "I'm going to put lots of onions." He said it in a joking way, but I said it again after just to be sure. He started doing his thing, and he cooked fried rice for the other customers first WITH onions and then he used to same grill to cook our fried rice without cleaning it. The previous chef we had was not like that. He acknowledged our request, and he put us first. Our fried rice had onions...good thing we're smart enough to check. He got even worse when it came to the veggies. He cooked the veggies all at once for everybody, and gave us veggies with onions. Then he goes, "It might have a little onion." After that I was so done. I wasn't going to complain anymore because to me this restaurant doesn't exist. I was planning on taking my family here for my graduation dinner, but no thanks. He didn't even give us any mushrooms...he gave all the mushrooms to everybody else. I love mushrooms. I thought we were supposed to get the exact same thing as regular menu. We paid the same amount we did for the regular menu. I hate this place with a burning passion. Please, train your chefs what "No onions!" mean, and how to provide service.WHERE: Paradise between Sands & Flamingo.WHEN: They open at 5pm and close at 4am I believe. My friend and I attempted to go there around lunchtime, and should have researched beforehand... lolWHY: If you are a Teppanyaki first timer like I was, it is definitely a must! Muahaha!WHAT: My friend and I randomly decided to redeem ourselves and try out Musashi when they were actually open, so we headed here at 6pm! We made reservations just incase (better to be safe than sorry), and it wasn't as busy as I thought it would be. Hallelujah! The decor was quite nice and intimate, we were seated, and ordered.The staff were all so sweet! From our server to our Chef (we had Chef Octavio) - phenomenal! =DWe were first asked the occasion of us being there, we replied "For Fun." I did not think my "for fun" answer would lead to such surprising consequence, but it really was FUN! I don't want to ruin it for you first-timers, so just get on in there and have fun! Lol. THERE IS DEFINITELY A SURPRISE WAITING FOR YOU... MUAHAHA!On the food-end of the spectrum, it was delicious! My friend and I decided to get the filet mignon/shrimp/lobster combo. It was accompanied with several sauces (I am a saucy type of girl. Lol), veggies to start with, and tasty fried rice to pair with the seafood and meat. While Chef Octavio was cooking our food in front of us, I was like a child embracing every cool moment1 Who would have ever known cooking could be such entertainment!!Overall, this experience definitely goes in the books!! From the workers, people, and food... FIYAHHHHH!!!Lost my daughters 12th birthday dinner reservation. Made no attempt to fix it, or attend to us anyway. Ignored us, laughed at us when we insisted they made a mistake. Lost my business forever, and that saddens me because the food is decent. Nothing makes up for messing up a kids birthday. She was truly disappointed, as were the other 7 people in our party. You really screwed us Musashi and I will never return. Nor will I refer you to anyone ever again.This has to be my favorite teppan yaki spot in Vegas! Every time I come here, service is always on point and food is always delicious! The last time I came here, the group I came with did the happy hour special. Definitely a must-try late night food place!I did the seafood combo that comes with miso soup, fried rice, shrimp, scallops and fish! It also comes with many different sauces made to order from the chef all for only $20! (Happy hour special) Because I went with a big group of early to mid 20's age, the teppan yaki chef made funny after-hour remarks! The chef was so funny and very accommodating. I went here for my mom's birthday as well a few months ago and I went with my family. The chef was so nice and funny.. he was not going to do some "adult" jokes. Instead, he cooked the fried rice in a heart-shaped form and was trying to make my grandma laugh! My family enjoyed it and they loved the food!I love this off-the-strip spot! A local hot spot, a tourist favorite, and you might spot a celebrity here or there! If you're in Vegas, you should try place!Musashi came highly recommended, after two visits, I can only say this place deserves NO stars.First visit. We asked for the "adult" show for a visiting friend.  Got two bowls of rice turned upside down with some round veggie on top and they called it boobs... great... I paid 20% more over Benihana for rice boobs?  The food was okay, so I'll give it another shot.Second and final visit.- 6 weeks out:  Made reservations for adult show for 7 at 10pm.- 3 weeks out:  Called to confirm reservation for adult show for 7 at 10pm. Confirmed.- Reservation:  Showed up 15 minutes before and checked in with the hostess, confirmed that we had reservation for 7 and for adult show.  She tells us to tell the server you want adult show.  She then proceeds to sit a party of 3 at our table... they had a 9 year old with them.  While most 9 year old nowadays have probably seen more internet porn than most adults my age, I did the adult thing and let the hostess know that she just sat a kid at the adult show table.  Apparently, according to the hostess, a 9 year old seeing a 2 foot long big black dildo with simulated jiz is, to her, perfectly fine.  I continued to ask for an kid free adult show.  After asking for the manager, I was told that she was not at the restaurant.  After further pressing, we asked to speak with the owner Tsutomu (AKA Tiger)... we explained our situation, about making reservations and blah blah blah... he couldn't give two shits.  Taking the high road, we decided to leave and not scar the poor kid.This is what I get from wanting to see a big black dildo at a Japanese restaurant.It is now my mission in life to divert any and all tourist away from this shitty place.We were looking to dine near the Hard Rock and my friend suggested Musashi. She had been here before and raved about how great the teppanyaki was.When we walked in there was no hostess, we walked up to the bartender and asked if we had to seat ourselves, he ended up calling a waiter over. My friend asked if we could do the teppanyaki, we were told we could but not until 9:30 p.m. because we didn't have reservations. We didn't know it was mandatory to make one. We had a show to go to so we sat down to dine in the main dining area instead. I ended up ordering the following items: Pork Gyoza- $4.50Shrimp Dragoons- $6.00NY Steak (Hot Iron)- $18.00The NY steak entree included miso soup, salad, fried vegetables (they no longer offer mashed potatoes), and steamed white rice. When ordering the steak it could either be served teriyaki style or just plain salt and pepper with a side of oroshi ponzu sauce. I opted to go with the salt and pepper. I ordered my steak well done and it was still very juicy and tender, I didn't end up touching the vegetables because they consisted of onions, zucchini (my arch nemesis), and carrots.The miso soup came with mushrooms, scallions, and little pieces of meat, it had a little kick, it was very flavorful. The salad was just iceberg lettuce topped with ginger dressing which was really good, it was sweet but not overpowering. The shrimp dragoons were a-okay, they're just like crab rangoons except they have shrimp instead of crab. I'll most likely skip ordering them next time. I ordered the pork gyoza steamed, but you can also order it fried, it was good, the pork had a nice salty taste. I really wanted to try the cream balls but they are no longer part of the menu. Our waiter said they were changing a lot of the things on the menu because I noticed some parts of the menu were blacked out. Our waiter was very attentive throughout the whole meal, we never even had to ask him for any refills because as soon as we were done with 3/4 of our drink, he'd bring more out. I was really happy with our service and meal. I will be back because I really want to try the teppanyaki but I'll make sure to set a reservation next time.

Restaurant name  BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse

Review Text :
Located in one of the many shopping complexes ringing the north side of Phoenix, BJ's is a brewpub/sports bar serving up casual fare at bargain prices.Blame it on the lunch rush: service was at a crawl, though the waiter was friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. And the food was fine.I went with the Parmesan-crusted chicken sandwich, a chicken breast coated with Parmesan bread crumbs and served between a soft roll with lettuce, tomato, and a garlic dressing. A little heavy on the lettuce and tomato and light on the coating, but a good sandwich with particularly good thin-cut fries.I didn't get the chance to sample any of their dozen or so brews, but it looked like a solid selection. They brew their own sodas, as well.Although previously unknown to me, BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse is a part of a large, multistate chain.  Their standards of food and service easily identify this realization, in spite of the fact that it is stated on their menu.Not to be misunderstood, the turkey club sandwich that I ordered wasn't bad, and the requisite flavors were all there.  Sloppy assembly and plating, however, illustrated the plight of a kitchen slammed at lunchtime and simply trying to move to the next order.  To say that there was no "love" put into this sandwich would be an understatement.Our server (I believe that his name was Johnny) was apologetic- even funny- about how backed-up the kitchen was.  Yes, service was slower-than-slow, but a personable and attentive server made the extended wait somewhat bearable.Their desserts looked great, and I'm not a dessert eater.  Unfortunately, we wouldn't have had the rest of the afternoon to wait for them.So yet another restaurant chain is added to the list of those that I will try to avoid in my frequent business travel.

Review Text :
While I actually find this place depressing, I give it 3 stars for 2 reasons. One, my parents LOVE to take me here when I'm hangin' with them in Sun City. Or as I call it, God's Waiting Room. Two, the best cheesy hash browns. Ever. In the world. While they serve all day and all meals, I've only had breakfast. Eggs, sausage, biscuit. All just fine. But it's the cheesy hash browns y'all. Mom loves the pancakes. And dad. "Best damn cup of coffee I ever had." Ok, pops. Better than Folgers. Really? And there's kitchy like crates and wicker baskets hanging all over the place. Yikes, who dusts that crap? Before you even step foot in the restaurant you are forced to navigate "the store". Oh Jesus Mary. The store. Full of like, Holly Hobbie meets John Deere stuff. Creepy weird. But oh, the cheesy hash browns.When I lived in Phoenix, I used to frequent CB quite often as the food was reasonably priced, breakfast or lunch was always good and service was stellar. I also liked the store in front of the restaurant and would often find things to buy from seasonal items to collectibles (long ago it was Boyd's Bears) and they had good candy.Well, I have lived in the Bay Area for well over 8 years again and this was the first time I have been back to a Cracker Barrel. This time was for breakfast with my Mom and daughter. The service, as I remembered was fantastic, the menu huge but with things from reasonably sized to giant portions and all that in between. This was the first restaurant I can remember that asked me if I wanted my poached eggs soft, medium or hard (soft please) and the cheesy hashbrown casserole was still as good as I remembered. I will be back when I come back to town next and I can't wait!Well shoot... I can't believe I haven't written a review of the Cracker Barrel yet!I was in AZ a few mos back with family and boy is it different from Seattle. Not in a bad way - Who doesn't enjoy warm, sunny weather? But I did notice that there are an awful lot of strip malls and chains here in AZ. Driving around looking for a place to eat we passed PF Changs, Chilli's, The Cheescake Factory, etc. All kinds of run-of-the-mill, not so special/memorable places to eat that you can find anywhere else in the US.But... the Cracker Barrel? I had to go again. The first (and only other time) I'd been to a Cracker Barrel was when I was 8 years old and visiting Orlando. That whole trip was so memorable for me because I spent it with my grandfather who took me to Disney World. One night we had dinner at a Cracker Barrel and I'd never experienced anything like it before. Rocking chairs on a big porch out front while you wait for a table, a gift shop full of stuff that you want - but maybe don't need - and classic, All-American fare. For cheap, too!As we pulled up to the one here in Peoria I spotted the rocking chairs and smiled broadly. It was just like I'd remembered! Through the gift shop you could reserve a table and shop while you wait. I found a cute AZ souvenir for my sister and within a few mins we were seated at a big table in a room that resembled a massive country-home family room. It was cozy, it was interesting, and the menu kicked ass. I got the Cracker Barrel dinner special that included a variety of small plates so I could try a lot of different items. There was pickled okra, chicken and dumplings, ham cooked two ways, corn, mashed potatoes, and more. Even though the food was just slightly above microwave meal quality, there was something comforting and awesome about it. Nothing blew me away but I just loved it anyway. Maybe it was the memories of being small and having never seen a Cracker Barrel before, maybe it was just the name Cracker Barrel... who knows! But I'd still pass up all those other chains for a Cracker Barrel no matter where I am.

We should have gone to Le Burger Bistro, but by the time we sat down and peeked at the menu, we were too tired to change our minds.  The blue cheese & mushroom burger I had was good (and huge), but the onion rings were kind of icky and the restaurant felt like a throwback to Vegas in the 70's...as if time had stood still.  Plus, we showed up to dinner at around 7pm and it was like eating during the Early Bird Special at Denny's.  There are plenty of better restaurants within walking distance...I recommend you go elsewhere.Used to be a 24 hour cafe.  Now it's limited hours.  Food is okay but it's on the strip and cheap.Yelp's 365 Review Challenge 2015 #9 - #365 A classic Vegas favorite that's soon to close because Caesar's Palace has filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy. It's a pity that Caesar's Entertainment has nothing but bad news for their deteriorating resorts and layoffs to come. I'm glad to have had my last breakfast here as it will be the last of the classic affordable Vegas eats on the strip.My Dad was a Platinum Casino Rewards member so fortunately we didn't have to wait in the long line. Service was speedy and our waitress was very attentive with refilling our drinks. You had an option to eat on the buffet or order on their menu. Food was just average as well as the prices. It didn't break the bank at all. From the buffet I had scrambled eggs, bacon and some toast. Nothing over the top just the basic breakfast eats. The rest of my family just ordered from the menu and I wish I had done the same thing because their buffet had really limited selection. It was just like eating at your typical Denny's American Diner with some keno on the side. But unfortunately it will all be demolished for a new eatery with increase prices.

Review Text :
I went to the Shanghai Club for dinner recently with my BF... it was a weeknight and we chose it based on location and the fact that I felt like Chinese Food.  (It's conveniently located right off of the 101 and Shea in the Pima Crossing shopping center).  I'd been once before and it was decent so I was open to going again.  Since my last visit (which I realize now was over a year ago), they remodeled the place... it's actually a step up from what I remembered in terms of decor.  The service was attentive although the atmosphere was pretty quiet.  It was perfect for what were in the mood for: a quick, casual dinner.  We started with a bowl of Wor Wonton Soup for 2... I liked it because it had a generous amount of shrimp, chicken, veggies, and wontons inside a light broth.  I ordered the Spicy Eggplant and J went with the Thai Curry Chicken (and we shared both).  Portions were pretty big but we managed to eat almost everything... We both agreed that the Spicy Eggplant was much better than the Thai Curry Chicken; I'd suggest going to a Thai Restaurant for Thai Food and going with a more traditional Chinese entree if you visit Shanghai Club.Overall, Shanghai Club is just above average... I will return eventually... but it's never going to be a regular in our restaurant rotation!****For healthy eaters, Shanghai Club offers steamed dishes served with sauce on the side and brown rice too - you gotta love that!

Review Text :
I've been performing here for a couple of years.  There's a comedy show every Wednesday and it's free.  But enough of the shameless self-promotion...Bongo's is a bar and grill.  There's a huge TV for whatever popular game is on that night.  (I rarely watch because there are COMEDIANS onstage!)The service is ultra-friendly, especially Kara.  It's typical bar food, but they have a huge menu.  There's something for everyone.  Me?  I'm quite partial to the cheese fries.  Yup.  Fries with cheese-in-a-can.  It's my guilty pleasure every time I perform there.There are regulars, like this one lady who feeds her kids then stumbles over to drink.  If you want a friendly, down-to-earth sports bar to hang out in, go to Bongo's.  If you're hungry, go to Bongo's.  If you want to laugh and eat and drink, go to Bongo's.  On Wednesday nights.  :}

I just had a wonderful conversation during lunch with the friendly owners, Mr and Mrs Dosanjh.I commented that I always see them eat their own food right from the buffet table (unlike the staff at many chinese boofays), and he was happy to proclaim that he and she eat lunch there everyday -- his son two meals a day!And why not?  It is delicious, wholesome home cooking, after-all. When the people who created -- or inherited -- all of the recipes tell you that everything in the restaurant is made *from scratch*, while literally breaking bread with you, it really has a special meaning.I got to share my story about my grade school buddy, and let them know about Yelp.  Their friendly interaction is something I've already come to expect from the rest of the staff, so it was nothing shocking.Today's assortment of dishes was excellent, with all of my favorites, a spicy bean sprout dish I'd never seen before, and also more fresh veggies now than in my original review.  Veggie-potato fritters (can't remember the indian name) were zesty and not greasy at all.  Chicken curry had so much savory flavor without being spicy at all, it literally made my mouth water just sniffing it.  The Tandoori chicken aroma grabbed ahold of me in the parking lot where I first smelled it as I stepped out of my car, and had me floating through the air like a cartoon riding on the scent vapors, all the way into the front doors.  When the people who created -- or inherited -- all of the recipes tell you that everything in the restaurant is made *from scratch*, while literally breaking bread with you, it really has a special meaning.Fellow Yelpian Ryan C. organized a little luncheon at India Palace yesterday (see, it's not only ladies who lunch, sometimes it's us manly men, too:)I made the pilgrimage from OTowSco to the near reaches of NW PHX and met up with Ryan, Rand, Norm, Daren and Wes and we talked and laughed and we hit the boofay at India Palace pretty hard:)Pretty good boofay...not terribly extensive as far as the food selections go...but the available items were all well prepared, well seasoned and my lunch ended up on the happy end of the "Crap to Quality Ratio":)As we dug into our first plate of boofay, Ryan said "I hope everybody filled up on bananas and cheese"...a humorous comment about lubricative effects of the food at India Palace:)In a happy coincidence, he almost exactly described my breakfast yesterday morning...4 bananas and a  1/2 pound of Tillamook Sharp Cheddar:)When you get to be my age, the adage "never trust a fart after 50" isn't just a funny thing to say...it becomes one of the guiding principles in your life...so, bananas and cheese...all the curry's and tandoori's  and vegetarian squash/potato stuff and vindaloo's with basmati rice and naan in the joint aren't going to break through this particular firewall:-)Oatmeal would have just been throwing gas (no...gasoline, not GI tract methane) on the fire (oh wait...that would work too:)Although I'm not generally a fan of boofays (I really do think the "sneeze guards" seem to be just a suggestion to many of the people that I see rooting around in the boofay) this was a pretty clean and well maintained boofay...I had 2 plates of pretty decent Indian food and got a chance to relax for few minutes with friends and have a little light conversation:)Things stayed sealed up tight and I sailed through the rest of my day with the confidence, dignity and demeanor of a man who knows that everything is safely locked down:)Lunch boofay the other day with my brother and his coworker was one of the best tasting lunches I've had here.My recommendations: ask for Garlic Naan instead of plain, but be ready for fresh garlic breath all afternoon.Go several times, since the about half of dishes they have out vary from day to day.  I've discovered that sometimes I'm not a fan of the items, but have been glad to try new things, since I've also found some unexpected gems. (don't expect me to remember the indian name, though)Don't worry about crazy gimmicky coupon sites that just want to spam you all day.  This food is superb at the fair price they charge normally.  The owners are great, and staff is friendly and eager to serve.

Restaurant name  Pamplemousse Le Restaurant
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
My absolute favorite restaurant! Pamplemousse is for lovers, it's classic romantic ambiance is unlike anywhere else. It is small, cozy, dimly lit, intimate, and the food and service is pristine without being stuffy. No paper menus-- the menu is recited by the staff tableside. The crudite, perfectly done duck confit, and profiteroles are all amazing, and the classic hard boiled eggs served in giant French country baskets in the shape of roosters are slightly paradoxical (as is the eclectic gay icon decor), which all add to its whimsical vibe. Substantial wine selection and knowledgeable sommeliers. Veg or fish option available (usually pasta or halibut). Parking is limited for Vegas, but there is abundant street parking. Ditch the strip and take someone you love here immediately!The French really is for lovers...and Pamplemousse is exactly the kind of place you bring two lovebirds together.  Seated very cozy in a corner booth, lights are dimmed perfectly to only enhance the lovelier features of one's face.Not only is a printed menu presented to us, the waiter recites the specials of the day.  Do pay attention because there are quite a few and you do want to hear the details of each.We love to sample and taste a variety of foods, so what better way than a few appetizers to indulge our French desires?A complimentary bucket of fresh vegetables and a dipping sauce satisfy the lack of greens in decadent dining.* Scallops appetizer - one of their specials.  Two giant scallops in butter and lemon that just melts in your mouth like a perfectly cooked scallop should.* Frogs legs appetizer - blah.  Nothing can help these dried out legs with no taste.  Tough pieces of meat and just a disappointment. Do avoid.* Escargot with fresh Garlic and Parsley ($14) - It's not the snails that are so delicious, it's the butter and garlic concoction that has you dipping your bread into each little pool of heavenly goodness.  And don't be shy about mopping up all the tasty drippings, the waiter will be sure to bring more crusty bread just for the occasion.* Homemade terrine of fresh Foie Gras ($18) - Reminisce of our trip to Paris...a side of peppery arugula leaves to challenge your palate.  The salt and pepper mixture only complements the foie gras that leaves you wanting more.  The cooked apples were unmemorable in enhancing this indulgent dish.* Grand Marnier Soufflé with Vanilla Ice Cream and Whipped Cream ($13) - Beautifully presented tableside with the soufflé popped and ice cream and whipped cream are scooped on top as they melt and drip into this not-overly heavy dessert just perfect for sharing.Service is top-notch with beverages refilled without requesting and silverware brought out for each dish.  Don't bother coming with a large group, enjoy this more romantic atmosphere with someone that you plan on getting intimate with! (Photos of our appetizer journey posted!)Wwwwwwwwwooooooooooowwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww!!  This place is awesome!!!  My wife and I went for our first wedding anniversary after such great reviews of this place and it was right on the $.  We couldn't believe the nice place we walked into on that side of Sahara but it's like you're transported into a different place where no one is in a rush..a meal is a MEAL and it's first class all the way.  Our eccentric waiter, Keifer, was funny and entertaining although I am not sure how anyone remembers the specials of the day after 1 listen...so many to choose from!!My wife and I both agreed the French onion soup was the best we've ever had!!  I never actually thought it could ever be this good!  We went with the specials for entrees.  I got the fruit de mare which consisted of pasta with shrimp, scallops and a lobster tail with lobster cognac sauce over the whole thing...unreal....and $29 to boot which isn't bad at all!!  My wife went with the veal and that was incredible.  Best veal ever.  We also pre-ordered the amazing baked souffle and they also gave us a nice extra dessert for our 1st anniversary.  All in all just a wonderful way to eat with the one you love.  Keifer suggested we come back for our 2nd anniversary but I honestly think we won't be able to wait a whole year to come back!!!French food can tend to get overly complicated and annoying, however this classic provincal french restaurant is perfect in everyway.It opens only for dinner @ 530PM Located on E. Sahara, we were greeted by the head waiter and then allowed to chose where we wanted to sit, we chose a quiet knook that was hidden for an extra romantic touch.  Le Pamplemousse only serves wine, champagne and beer.  We ordered the baked goat cheese in a puff pastry and the tomato basil soup along with this Frank Sinatra favorite, panchetta with fettucini alfredo (not french but great with the pancetta).  The soup was better than I ever thought, I hate tomato soup but this was great. The goat cheese was very good also. Our main course was a peppered filet and crispy duck leg confit with duck breast. My boyfriend couldn't finish eating the entire filet, which is usually unheard of and the duck was falling off the bone (in a good way) and cooked perfectly with a great reduction sauce to accompany.For dessert our server, Evan, brought us out a grapefruit (pamplemousse) sorbet which had champange in it and also a creme brulee for my birthday.  Sadley they didn't sing, but it was fantastic anyway. It felt as if all the creme brulee I had ever had were a joke compared to the one at Pamplemousse...so amazing. Also to top it off, we ordered the Lava cake, which was also very good, per my boyfriend.We cannot wait to go there again and eat something completely different.  The wait staff is great and entertaining by telling old stories of old vegas, make sure they show you the bullet proof walls where mafia used to sit. :)If this restaurant were in a different place with a different wait staff, this would be a five star review all the way. The food is exceptionally good.But let's start out our dining experience with getting to the restaurant. The website states that it's across the street from the monorail. Technically, it is. It's also about two sketchy blocks down Sahara. Is it me, or has the area surrounding the Strip really become run-down over the past 10 years? My colleagues were looking at me like "what kind of crappy restaurant are you taking us to" as we made the trek. When we walked in, it looked like a place that once upon a time was a nice place, but it's struggled to keep up with the times.Then there's the service. A smarmy know-it all Maitre 'd/waiter took care of us. Don't ask him for anything that's not on the menu; he will yell at you. The rest of the wait staff looked like they walked in from the set of Goodfellas... you got the feeling that these guys had screwed up everything they had ever done so they were thrown into the restaurant where they could presumably do less damage. So we had bread thrown onto our plates and were constantly being growled at when we weren't listening to the Maitre'd berate the staff for doing things wrong. At any moment, I expected Gordon Ramsey to walk in and start filming Kitchen Nightmares, call this guy a donkey, and march him outside to cuss him out.But the truly bizarre moment came when our customer (who I will admit is Chinese and her English is fair but not great) asked if she could have a salad as an appetizer. Smarmy guy got downright rude and told her no, we don't serve those. We will give you a vegetable plate. Customer looks at us quite perplexed. Our international sales manager tried to explain that the lady would like a salad, and perhaps you could prepare one for her? "Alright, fine, since you don't understand how we do things, we'll just do this now..." and pulls out a giant basket of vegetables and some dijon vinaigrette to dip it in. "There, now are you happy?"  Several awkward minutes after we had our fill he returned to take our order.The entrees and soup were nice. Had the service not been so awful, we might have a better feeling about this place. The much hyped chocolate lava cake was overcooked, so there was no molten center. It was a poor ending to a comical meal. 15 years ago when my boss last dined here, this was a fantastic restaurant, but like the neighborhood it's in, it's in decline.I had not been to Pamplemousse for many years, so, armed with a Groupon, a return visit to this venerable classic French restaurant seemed in order.  The dimly lit interior, with mauve and white linen tablecloths gives off a romantic vibe, but tables are very close together.  There was a small hiccup at the beginning of our stay when I was told that I had to choose between use of a Groupon or Open Table reservation but could not receive credit for both.  That solution was easy, since Open Table reservations made through the Yelp site are not eligible for point credit, and I had already paid out money on a Groupon that was set to expire within just days.  So, the Groupon was used, and the Open Table reservation was cancelled by the restaurant.Nevertheless, we were seated right away, and not too long afterward were presented with a very nice basket of crudites and a mild Dijon Mustard Dipping Sauce.  I enjoyed fresh red cherry tomatoes, celery sticks, cauliflower florets, radishes, green onions, hearts of Romaine, onions, and zucchini.  I saw that the couple at the table next to me was also served green olives on a silver dish, but we were not.  Complimentary slices of bread were good and crusty, and, with butter spread over them, enhanced the early part of the meal.  The crudite basket substitutes here for salad.Escargots Bourguignone featured very good escargots in a buttery, white-wine-based, Scampi-like sauce served in recessed areas on a ceramic plate likely made for the purpose of serving this or a similar dish.  French Onion Soup was very hot and pretty good, but cheese clotted into knots inside the broth.  Lobster Bisque contained no chunks of lobster, and was just okay.A serving of Chicken Cordon Bleu was small but quite cheesy, filling, and very good.  It was accompanied by a Madeira-wine-based sauce, but I chiefly enjoyed my entree just as it was, along with a good Puff Potato and an excellent-tasting creamed spinach-topped cooked tomato and very good Bechamel-covered Cauliflower.I arrived with a mindset to have a leisurely meal, and it was that.  But, after a long interval with an empty glass, I asked for more Iced Tea, and instead my glass was simply taken away.  Later, after another request, the Iced Tea was restored.  I don't think the delay getting Iced Tea refills was intentional.  The Consumer Electronics Show was in town, and the restaurant was bristling with demanding patrons.Ending our meal on a great finish, Diane and I enjoyed a made to order Chocolate Lava Cake which was simply superb.  With a hot chocolate core, this moist cake resembled a cross between plum pudding and a souffle, with the hot Chocolate Sauce tasting almost like rivulets of Hot Fudge.  The dessert was even better mixed with Vanilla Ice Cream and whipped cream.Owner Georges Laforge even dropped by our table while working the room to greet his guests.  This was a very pleasant meal, and a fine way to spend a Friday night.  This time I won't wait so long to return for my next dinner visit!Pamplemousse is different than the average Vegas restaurant!...and I love that!Come here for an old-school (almost vintage Vegas) feel!Come here for outstanding service!Don't come here is you are all about French food and want an incredible meal :(The food is A-Ok.  If you do come here, go for the tasting instead of ordering entrees.  I have a soft spot in my heart for duck confit.  I ordered the duck...I was not happy.  I also tried the Grouper in a classic French White wine butter sauce...This was much better.Some people may also feel that the atmosphere is cheesy...I preferred to think of it as classily dated.The wine list is not that extensive, but has a better price-point than most French places in town...but again may leave the French wine snob in your group wanting.Wow where to begin? I guess at the beginning. Ok so im a chef from san diego in town leaving tomorrow and remembered i had a groupon i needed to use before I left in the morning. So I   made my reservation at 430 for 530 on a Sunday night and explained I had a groupon. The maitre'd explained 6 would be better or the kitchen and I figured no problem. Plan was; apps and wine to start. Had a big late lunch but we wanted some munchies for one last, all night run at craps and roulette. Upon arrival I noticed the parking lot was full so we ( girlfriend and I ) were excited because we figured full lot means great place. We were seated by Keifer ( the maitre'd ) into a small corner. I didn't mind. There was tinsel hung on all the walls. The place reminded me of a kitchen nightmares episode but again I wanted to see the menu. I looked at the menu and know my girlfriends tastes so I ordered for us. Perry , the beyond pompous waiter, took our order of foie gras, fettuccine ala George, and French onion soup and a Stella. He asked " all appetizers " I said " yes sir " thinking nothing of it. He whipped himself around quite flamboyantly and proceeded to walk away. I thought nothing of it nor was I made aware of any issue. A few moments later Keifer brought out my gf's Stella to the wrong table and being that I was so close to the table next to us I heard him mention something about you can't just order 3 appetizers. My girlfriend caught it aswell and we knew they were talking about us. Perry proceed to come behind Keifer very quickly and hiss something about that's the wrong table. And as they walked to the back the looked like 2 children arguing an making a scene in what is already a small place. We were laughing at their behavior. It was embarrassing for both of them but perry was the one heard throughout the place " I CANT BE 2 PLACES AT ONCE!!! ". Really, priceless. Lol. So we now realized there was an issue perry was too afraid to bring up to us so he asked Keifer to take care of it. Now Keifer comes over all red faced and sweaty from embarrassment w the Stella to the correct table and tries to explain we either have to order an entree, a 5 course or a 4 course prefixe menu in order to use the groupon. I tried to explain it was fine we didn't NEED to use the groupon and it was all good but he kept trying to sell me on his " wonderful salads that come w the pre fixe menu " lol. I tried to explain again we weren't hungry for mains. We wanted to try the apps and be on our way but again he was insistent we order main or the pre fixe. He was insistent " there has to be a balance in the bill " which I though was funny because I had already told him we didn't NEED to use the groupon. By this time I was insulted embarrassed and about to get angry. (The guy opened the menu on my charger plate, stood next to me and WALKED ME thru the menu!!  Wtf!?! I'm a grown man I can read. Lol. ) So I told him we'd gladly pay for the beer and be on our way. Keifer explained the beer was on the house and there would be no charge. So I said " I thought there had to be a balance on the bill?" My girlfriend was more insulted than I was so she left the full beer there. I've been in the food biz for 13 years. Never have I seen anything so mishandled. A) why not address the issue of a main course before or while I'm making my order??? I told you twice I had a groupon B) after explaining we would pay for it out of pocket would you continue to try to sell me something I emphatically refuse. C) why didn't the management word the ad more carefully?? This is the fine print: Reservation required. Dine-in only. Must purchase a food item. Party must have 2 people or more for $50 option, 4 people or more for $100 option. Not valid for online bookingI think 3 apps constitutes a " food item " why not write " an entree must be included in purchase "? Or " there must be a remaining balance AFTER you've used the coupon in order to use this coupon" ?? It's pretty simple.  Bottom line: 1 star because I can't give 0. Yelp won't allow it. The food was probably great but ill never know cuz ill never go back and ill tell everyone I know everywhere I can no to either. Thanks for reading. Happy dinning.Oh la la! Pamplemousse is so fancy and so French, but not in a snooty way at all!  This is very much a Vegas throwback to the days of yesteryear.I have visited Pamplemousse (which is Grapefruit in French, in case you were wondering) on several occasions.  I had heard about the place growing up in Vegas and was excited the first time I ate here, as well as the other visits I have made to this restaurant.  It is definately a different dining experence than what I am used too, but it was fun.  This restaurant is one of those places from Vegas' heyday that you always hear about.  Bobby Darin (the singer) actually envisioned the resturant and helped it get it started! Don't you just love Vegas trivia?  So yes, this place has some history to it, which is rare in this town.  The wait staff here are what make the place special.  They have a ton of stories about the place and really make the whole dining experience come to life.  If you are lucky enough to get Keifer as your server, you will hear all about the stuff that went down in those walls.  It is fun to hear stories about Frank Sinatra and Debbie Reynolds and all of the celebrities of the past.  I am a youngin' and wasn't in Vegas back then, but I love the history of this town, especially juicy gossip!  Everything I have tried here has been really quite good.  It isn't going to be your fancy, ultra modern French food that you find in restaurants today, but I think they cover the classics of the cuisine.  If you like escargot or haven't ever tried it and want too, try it here.  I really enjoyed the way Pamplemousse prepared it...I mean it was soaked in butter and garlic, what isn't to love?  My foodie friend loves the Coq au Vin and has gotten it both times were have gone together. I always get the steak because I am all about the meat, but the bites I have sampled from friend's dishes have always been yummy.Pamplemousse is located off of the Strip and doesn't even look like a restaurant, so you have to keep your eyes open for it when you are driving by, otherwise you will miss it for sure.  It is right off of Sahara at the entrance to a neighborhood, so keep that in mind when you are visiting for the first time.  Also, it is a small place, so I would recommend getting some reservations.  They are on OpenTable, so you can even gets your self some points booking it yourself, if you have an account  (OT is free, so get an account, if you don't have one already!).  You can even request Frank Sinatra's table if you want.  It isn't always available, but worth a try anyway.  Pamplemousse also pops up on Groupon from time to time, so check there too, because it never hurts to save some cash.This was without doubt the best menu offering of Restaurant Week that I experienced, and every course was very well prepared.We began our dinner with good French Bread and a Basket of Crudites in which all vegetables were fresh and crisp.  Also served was an excellent Olive Tampenade.  There was a long wait for fresh-brewed Iced Tea; when it arrived the tea was strong in tea flavor, and my second glass of it was noticeably smaller than the first.  Go figure!The ambiance was romantic, as Diane and I sat at a small wraparound love seat booth.  This is great for a second or higher date or a happily married couple, since legs are likely to be locked together throughout the meal.Escargots Bourguignone were lemony, garlicky, and delicious.  An added La Soupe A L'Oignon Gratinee with Swiss Cheese (for I'll never pass up French Onion Soup offered at a French restaurant) was hot, cheesy, and well deconstructed.For my entrée I selected Veal Medallions Normande with sliced Baked Apples, Light Calvados Cream Sauce, and Mixed Wild Rice.  The veal was well pounded and barely fork tender with al dente carrots.  It was delicious with the sauce and the best moist and fluffy Mixed Wild Rice I have had.  Meanwhile, Diane enjoyed her veal medallions with very good fluffy Mashed Potatoes.   For dessert I enjoyed topnotch smooth and rich Belgium Dark Chocolat Mousse with heavenly Frangelica Chantilly Cream (Oh yeah!), while Diane delighted in Grand Marnier Souffle with both Vanilla Ice Cream and Chantilly Cream.  During this RW meal, portions were big for one diner, with a four-course meal generously priced at $50.13.  Service was attentive and excellent.  Above all, diners got to select among several fine dishes from an inventive and creative menu that was quite well executed in the kitchen.Five stars all the way!I have been wanting to go here after 4 years.It's been a number of factors as to why I hadn't gotten around to it, but with a belated Valentine's dinner (due to my work schedule), I finally got to experience the restaurant.I can honestly say that it is one of the finest dining experiences that I've had in Vegas.The place is extremely "Old Vegas".  It just looks it.  It just feels it.  From every facet of the building.  Ambient with low lighting, it looks like a little French cottage on the inside.  The waiters wear tuxedos, and refer to their boss as "Chef".  The pacing of everything is leisurely (not that you should rush it - clear your schedule for the next two hours to get the best experience, as European dining is not rushed as it is).Keifer was our server.  You want Keifer.  Keifer will take great care of you.The missus and I got the tasting menu, a five course experience that is... well, let me explain it better through the food.Course 1: Crudites.  Not a salad, but a big bucket of various fresh vegetables with a Dijon vinaigrette.  Everything tasted garden fresh and was plentiful.Course 2: I tried a pastry filled with various seafood, and covered in some amazing sauce.  The missus has escargot.  Both were devoured instantly.Course 3: Granite. French sorbet doused in champagne.  I nearly cried at this point.  Between three excellent courses, and the prospect of two more, I think I discovered that Heaven was actually a kitchen.Course 4: I got the prime beef.  The missus got the duck breast and leg.  The beef  sliced like butter upon contact with my knife, and came with fries and this rich gravy.  The duck was incredibly sweet and moist.Course 5: I got dark chocolate mousse.  The missus got the creme brulee.  The mousse was rich and delicious.  You could just taste the cream in the brulee.All of this went with wine, of course.The tasting menu does offer other selections (check the website), just so you know.  The service was impeccable.  The music selections for the atmosphere were appropriate.  I got exactly the experience that I wanted from this restaurant.  This really is one of the "Top 3" dining places that I've experienced in Vegas.There are meals that are simply made, and then there are meals that are crafted.  Pamplemousse understands and respects food as an art form.If you have not been as of yet, set aside the money and time to go.  I often make glib, witty comments about places I venture to, but I can only say this for here: Go.  Just go.Sacrebleu! What a hidden gem. This French restaurant is off of the the strip, near the Stratosphere. Apparently, it's been around since 1970 and judging by the decor, I believe it.We did the special 5 course menu which was only $56 and if you've done tasting menus around the strip, you know that's an incredible deal. It comes with a vegetable basket and baguettes, an appetizer, a palate cleansing dish, an entree and a dessert. The lobster bisque appetizer was amazing. Definitely the piece de resistance. I had the lamb shank for my entree and it was aight. I would try something else if I went again. The Grand Marnier soufflé for dessert was also outstanding. Tres bien!Considering the only employees in the place was one waiter and one chef (who I assumed was like the chef in the Little Mermaid, back in the kitchen singing "Les poisson les poisson, he he he, hoh hoh hoh!"), we had excellent service. The waiter played the part of host/busboy/server/food runner all in one and he was great. A little bit of a character, but he had that situation.My only complaint was that it took like 20 minutes to get our check after the meal. I think they like the guests to stay a long time for ambience but I was ready to peace out at that point. 5 courses is a two hour affair and my attention span had maxed out.Overall this was a fun, kitchy experience. I recommend this place to anyone looking for unique night out.It took a Groupon to bring me back...curse you Groupon! I looked at what others on Yelp had said at the time of this Groupon purchase...I think that some of my friends may have been high when they ate here.  Either way, I came again and I've learned my lesson this time. The food is two stars across the board. There is no evident French technique in place here.  They aren't using outstanding, quality products. Their sauces aren't balanced. They have a pathetic selection of French wines for a French Restaurant. etc., etc, etc.The only reason to come here is for an atmosphere that you won't get at most places. Le Pamplemousse is true to its 1976 roots. A two-toned pink & burgundy palette dominates the space, and though the carpet was changed a few years back it looks and feels like everything else has remained untouched...literally your ass gets the "privilege" of feeling the springs in the cushions if you are "lucky" enough to sit in one of the booths. We had this "opportunity" for a few minutes until a cockroach decided to come out from behind the cozy booth and tried to take up occupancy next to my wife. This happened shortly after we arrived.  I wish we had taken this occasion to vacate the premises. Alas, we were very hungry, had a Groupon, and failed to make the most of this auspicious circumstance.We shared a Creamy Tomato Soup, heavy on the cream--this was the best part of the meal for me. My wife enjoyed the raw vegetables in the crudité a little more. For our entrees we shared the forgettable Duck and Wild Mushroom Ravioli and caped the experience off with a heavy yolk included soufflé that we left unfinished just as we had to every other item we shared before that other than the soup. At any price it was pretty bad.  At a hundred dollars some would consider it awful for sure.

Restaurant name  Bazic Bar & Restoyaky
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Bazic Bar & Restoyaky serves up what I would call Korean bar food.  It's located on the second floor of the Pacific Asian Plaza.  They have a bunch of random Asian dishes that are meant to be shared with friends over a few drinks.  Their specialty though is their fried chicken deep fried in olive oil!  As a result, we had to try it!  We got the Leg and Thigh Special, 5 pieces for $7.95.  It came with a basic cabbage salad with Thousand Island-like dressing and a side order of pickled daikon.  The BF is the connoisseur on fried chicken and he thought it was pretty good.We also got the Sweet Rice Crust Soup with Seafood for $17.99.  It's good enough for about four people to have a small bowl each.  The waiter will come with a big bowl of about four to five rectangular pieces of rice crust.  And then he'll pour the thick soup (more like gravy than broth) onto the rice crust.  It's filled with octopus, calamari, and veggies.  Pretty tasty and the rice stays crispy because the soup is so thick.  (There's a Chinese version called sizzling rice soup, except that soup is more broth-like and the rice may not be in rectangles.)We didn't get any kind of bowl to grind our own sesame seeds like lena d. or Mike C., so maybe that's only if you order the katsu, which we didn't.  And we also came for dinner which I think is a different experience too.I'd definitely want to return to try out their other Korean goodies, but I would prefer going with a larger group so you can order more stuff.  Their portions are meant to share, so it's hard when it's only the two of you.The artwork in the bathrooms makes for interesting conversation (especially the men's room) and there's also a Luxury Music Studio in the back.  (Is that for karaoke?)  There's also a little bell to buzz from your table should you need the staff, that way you don't have to wave them down or go looking for them yourself.Then swing by next door to Dessert Avenue to have some Fried Ice!  Yum!Overall, 3.5 stars.Its Monday evening around 9pm and I get a call. I've just gotten home from work and changing out of my work uniform. I get a call from these chicks that I work with and they are going out drinking. Drinking? On a Monday night?! Freak! Apparently, its their "Friday" since they have Tuesdays/Wednesdays off. Sure I answered. I don't start work until noon the next day... So it should be fun.They chose Bazic, which I have seen many times before but never eaten, so I had no complaints. One of the chicks is Korean so she will know what to order... And they've been there many times before... I arrive there around 10:15ish and the place is pretty crowded. Not standing room only crowded but most of the tables were full. The Korean chick asks if I like beer, and I tell her that I'm not a big fan (due to an incident when I was younger) but will drink hard liquor if we order it. Whats cool is that they have this large beer tube (google it) if you like a lot of beer. Instead of the beer tube, we just ordered a 40 oz bottle of Hite, which is Korean beer. I've never had this beer before and was pleasantly surprised how clean it tasted. There was absolutely no after taste. Leo likes it! The Korean chick also ordered food for the table and the rest of us just went with it.We ordered the sliced pigs feet, spicy raw squid, spicy ramen noodles, udon noodles, and two more bottles of Hite beer. The food was amazingly good. To be honest, I personally wouldn't of ordered these dishes if I was ordering, but I'm thankful that the Korean chick knew what she wanted and knew what was good.Overall we had a good time of eating, drinking, laughing, and drinking... Haha. They actually have Karaoke rooms in the back which you can rent out to get your jam on. Unfortunately, we didnt get a chance to put on a show. Darn. Maybe next time. Would I come back? Definitely.Vegas Yelp UYE Karaoke Extravaganza!SITREPWhat a good time it was at Bazic Bar & Restroyaky.  After the wonderful Fremont Street Experience, we knew there would be some Yelping madness we would want to engage in after Midnight.   But after that crazy fantastic time, we indeed wondered if we would have any "juice" left to manage this task as we planned to attack the early morning (Midnight - 3AM) with renewed vigor!!SETUPOrganized by our very own Seattle Yelper Clover A., this proved to be a good location to have a "meet-up" with Yelpers from different cities.  [First we had to get there!  LIMO RIDE:  While at Fremont Street Experience, we went by the Golden Nugget, and there was a bored limo driver who looked at our crazy group and decided then and there that he wanted to be part of our madness.  We had to get to Bazic QUICK for set-up, and so we negotiated with him, and he shot us over to our Korean Karaoke Bar destination in no time.]BAZIC ROOMSIf you are familiar with the Rock Box in Seattle or Rurulala in Sacramento, it is a very similar set-up.  Big rooms.  Nice physical plant layout of couches and sectionals.  Decent serviceable equipment.  It had the potential to be Karaoke at it's very best.  KARAOKE BOOKS & EQUIPMENTHowever, the books were JUST in Korean!  There were some English-language inserted pages, but that was an obvious afterthought.  In addition, we were somewhat limited in our selections it would have appeared, but we did manage (for the most part) with those selection of English-language songs in the narrow band of yellow and green pages.  And then there was the tech itself - such as the controls - which was all overlaid in Korean language and no English to be found.  Made it difficult for us to read the stereo & equipment controls and it did become a nuisance to have one of the guys come and adjust/modify sound levels, feedback, distortion-issues whenever they did arise instead of being able to take care of the issue ourselves.MY PERSONAL FAVESI got to belt out my Def Leppard and Linkin Park Standards, so I was dam happy.  I even smoothed out the end of the evening (er, morning) with the Beatles "Michelle", so it was all good.THE FOOD & DRINKThere was an ample supply of all kinds of chicken appetizers, beer and sake to keep our energy up, so no complaints in this department.  There were also some sweet-potato fries which were powdered with sugar so that they were sweet, and not savory the way I prefer them.  Ah well.  I still ate them and enjoyed them because I haven't met a sweet potato fry I do not like.PRICINGInteresting to say the least:  unlike the Karaoke I hit in Sacramento, San Francisco, and Seattle, this establishment has a sliding-mechanism that takes into account the consumables factor.  If it was just Karaoke, the room rental was $40 per hour.  However, if we consumed more than $100 in drinks & food, then the room rental would go down to $20 per hour.  Since there was a group of about 14 of us, and we were there from 11am to 3am, we made sure to get more than $100 in consumables that we would probably have gotten anyways, but Clover and I did buy drinks at the end to "get us over" that last bump to $100 so we could default the hourly rate down to $20 an hour.  [Note to self:  I HATE doing math when I'm trying to concentrate on singing!]KARAOKE CABBIES!Now this was different: it was 3AM at the end of our stint, so this place does something interesting for it's customers - the servers / chefs double as cabbies!  SERIOUSLY!  Since we are "quite a way into" Chinatown-Vegas, it would take a while to get a cab out there.  However, two of the establishments associates got two vehicles:  one to take part of our group back to PLATINUM, and another to take my group back to STRATOSPHERE.  A total win!THE LOWDOWNAll-in-all, a good experience.  I don't like to nit-pick the little things, and also have great respect for cultural traditions and cultural business-choices.HOWEVER, given this establishment wants to do business with a mainstream English-speaking demographic (it's in Vegas, USA, after all), and given that one could reasonably expect that there would be a preference for more mainstream English-language music by a significant customer base of English-speakers, I'm just saying it would be prudent (as a BUSINESS owner or BUSINESS manager, etc.) to make sure to supply better books and readable tech that is readible in English.  If on the other hand, the point is to discourage English-speaking patrons from coming here to enjoy Karaoke, then don't change a thing.  Frustrated customers just won't return.  However, we hardcore Karaokers will find a way to manage, even if a bit more grumpily.All-in-all, a 2-STAR experience.  However, I'll be honest & say I am bumping it up to 3 STARS because of the courtesy the gentlemen showed us in getting us back to our hotels at the end of a lonnnnng night in the weeeee hours of the morning.

Restaurant name  Jersey Mike's Subs
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
There is a $6.99 lunch special from 11-3 weekdays that gets you a regular sub and a drink. Not bad since most of the regular priced sandwiches are about $7 anyway. The inside is clean and it's being run by a father-son team. Father was wiping down tables and making sure customers were good the son was slicing meat and cranking out sandwiches. I like the original italian and get it pretty much every time. The sandwich has a good amount of different meats and just tastes good. This place is way better than Subway any day. I get it "mike's way" with the addition of mayo. Get a shore points reward card and start earning free food with every purchase.This Jersey Mike's in located in kind of a cramped shopping center. I've stopped by this location a couple times now and and am glad to have a decent place to grab a sandwich for lunch when in the area. The employees inside are nice. I don't always remember my Shore Points Card, which accumulates points with each of my purchases towards free food, so it's nice that I can just give my phone number and they can look it up easy that way. I don't know if this is the only location that does it because I haven't seen it at other locations, but currently they offer a daily lunch special from 11 am to 3 pm that costs $6.99 and gets you any regular sub and drink. I like the "Original Italian" and "Club Sub" the best. Mike's way of course! The Italian has 6 different meats. I'd rather pay a couple dollars more to eat subs here rather than Port of Subs or Subway because the meats, breads and cheeses just taste better. They also had some "Chocolate Chip Cookies" which I never knew they had, so I got some and they are good!You can place your order over the phone or online (you have the option to enter your shore rewards points online) for convenient pick-up.This location recently closed for a brief time and has reopened under new management. I have been in a few times since the change and it's been a much better experience. I used to come by a lot and liked the previous owner and his son but they really let things go in the end sadly. The current people working were really nice and made my sandwich just the way I asked. The giant size can easily be shared with someone else or used for 2 meals. My favorite sandwich is the Original Italian and I get it Mike's Way with the addition of mayonnaise. They take coupons here and run different specials. Having the shore rewards is a nice thing if you eat here often because you can get a free sandwich or wrap after so many purchases. I'm glad that the rewards program is still around and hasn't changed. I decided to do a review update so others know about the change in owners, quality of the food and service and that they are finally back open.

The tally was $13.35 before my son said he would like to add a soda, now the total would be $15.14 said Perla, the sandwich maker/cashier, presumably she was reading off the register as she said that.  As I was paying, I asked her if the receipt was in the bag, she said yes.  Seeing I was ACTUALLY looking for the receipt, she said: "Oh, it's here". The receipt was on the register all along and it seems like she didn't want to give it to me at first, but she grabbed the receipt from the register finally.  As she was handing that receipt to me, she asked how old my son is, (she wasn't friendly at all prior to that moment), so I answered her question meanwhile forgetting to look at the receipt.  Back to the hotel, I happened to see the receipt, it was ACTUALLY $12.65 as shown on the pic.  I also realized she didn't give me a receipt for the sandwiches I bought the night before and she overcharged me more than $2 as well.  I know it's only a few dollars, most ppl don't even bother checking or asking for a receipt.  I see a lot of taxi/limo drivers here, and I wonder how many ppl have left without a receipt.  Speaking of receipt,  Subway has a slogan, "If we don't give you a receipt, you get your sandwich free".  The register automatically printed their current sale code which I wasn't aware of, each Subway has it's own price and various codes from time to time.  Either way, discount or no discount, we pay the receipt amount, plus whatever the tip amount, isn't that the whole point of receipt?  We had been here before, the service was good generally.  Hopefully this is NOT their common practice.  Two stars for them opening 24 hrs.

Restaurant name  Las Pupusas
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Maybe my taste in men has helped me feel less awkward in situations or restaurants like this. Having once had a Hispanic boyfriend allows you to escape the awkwardness of being the token Asian in an establishment, but when you end at Las Pupusas with your Asian brother, the discomfort is inescapable - in fact, it is exponentially multiplied. With the intrigue of pupusas lingering, the both of us were willing to endure the uneasiness. We sat down - ordered a plate of plantains and three pupusas - mix, cheese and pork.The Mexicans have tortas, the Venezuelans have arepas, the Salvadoreans have pupusas. All of these things have some similarities: take some dough, throw in either cheese, meat or both of these things, and you're done! But mind you, even though these are only $1.75, they are huge. When they came out, we were stunned. Eating them, the flavor is just as big the pupusa itself. The mix with beans and cheese was the best in its simplicity. The cheese was another favorite with that salty cheese that oozed out and made a crust. The pork was not our favorite - its texture grounded to a pulp and flavor just being 'meh'. Throw on some of the slaw they give you, and one pupusa could be a meal in it of itself. The plantains, on the other hand, were also just as good. Perfectly fried up, fresh, and teetering between sweet and savory - they were my first plate of plantains and certainly not my last.Consider me a Hispanic food hipster, but as I grow older, I am now branching out into these lesser-hyped, obscure cuisines. It's places like this that perpetuate my interest and hunger to try the new and unknown. While initially uncomfortable, I now take the amount of discomfort to directly correlate to the deliciousness of a place - in this case, it's damn good.

Review Text :
Superb! And a shocker to some degree. (more on that in a bit)Can't argue with the reviews already given.I don't know what region the food is of origin, but Spicy is it's foundation.And it's tasty!!A Saturday lunch.3 tables active. Two other couples, and one big family. I was not the only tourist looking patron. But I was outnumbered. And thats GOOD!Maybe 15 total tables in the place available. Nice size in my opinion.Good clean room too.Yes, new owners. "wun yeer now thank yoo" (no offense intended)Spicy & Sour Noodle Soup, $5.95 (like spaghetti w/ chili broth, and herbs)Wontons tossed in chili sauce, $5.95 (YUM, nice garlic hints)Sliced Chicken w/ Szechwan Sauce, $8.95 (YUM YUM, spicy smoke flavor  trails off w/ a sweetness, YUM)Yes the rice is done w/ perfection as a goal. Details, all in the details.The "shocker"........This menu is as authentic as I've ever seen. Reminds me of times in San Francisco's Chinatown when I might have ordered off a menu to be refused by the wait staff  "No no no no, shaking their head". You see, I'm a big tall Gringo looking dude......they were just protecting me is my guess. Saving my fragile "naive" palate.Yun Nan Garden offers what I think you can't get many places in SF anymore. At least spelled out on the menu, here they are.Chongqing Spicy Frog.Blackened Pepper w/ Eel.Three Flavors (Squid, Fish, Black Sea Cucumber)Chickens Intestine w/ pepper sauce.And the afore mentioned Pigs Ear.Don't be afraid though. You will just be missing out on some tasty meals.I like the location, easy in, and easy out. Great parking!!Just below Spring Mountain, 3rd driveway on the right off Valley View.Yun Nan will be on your right, far corner of the first building. (mid lot)7 days a week, 11am - 10pm.And they have 2 additional locations:Monterey Park, CA. 301 N. Garfield Ave.Hacienda Heights, CA. 1229 S. Hacienda Blvd.Enjoy!!For my first review of 2009 I really wanted to find a 5 star place but I guess this one will have to do! It's hard finding 5 star places anyway so a 4 star review is just as good I'll say.For some odd reason, everywhere else besides Orange County seems to be able to get Yunnan/Sichuanese food right. San Diego has awesome Sichuan cuisine and now we've found something in Vegas as well.We decided to try this place out after reading the reviews and I'll have to say, yelp didn't lead us astray!We started off with the appetizer buffet station where we got the ma la sliced beef and the tendon. I saw this table with a plate full of chilis so I asked the waitress what it was. She told me it was the 'spicy chicken'-- la zi ji. We got that cuz I wanted something super spicy. Then we got a dish for the young man, dried tofu with Chinese chives. I also like 'mi xien' a Yunnan speciality. Sichuan province and Yunnan province border each other so the food is similar --spicy as hell, mostly, featuring the Sichuan peppercorn.The la zi ji kicked my ass! I mean I can eat spicy foods -- ie habanero -- but man this spicy chicken was super spicy. Maybe because the entire dish was filled with dried chilis -- about 70% chilis to 30% chicken. I was glad I ordered the other stuff which contained no chilis to balance out our palate.When your mouth is in flames, take a few bites of the mi xien and drink a few sips of the broth. It really calms your mouth down.All in all, a really nice meal. The gals there were sweet and came around many times to make sure we were enjoying our meal. I would definitely come back here again!!Yun Nan Garden was brought to my attention courtesy of my fellow yelpers.  The Husband and I tried once before to check out this 'authentic' Chinese restaurant hidden away in the Spring Mountain area but arrived when it was closed.We were on a mission and had a (small) crowd with us.  Taking no reservations, the five of us arrived around 6:30 pm on a Friday night.  With plenty of tables available, the waitress seemed conflicted as to where to put us.  In the end, a round table in the middle was where we ended up.Our menu:   * Boiled Beef with Szechuan Sauce ($9.25) - Arriving in a large bowl, pretty tasty stuff that you need lots of white rice to eat with.  Lots of spice and oil, but pretty good and is amongst their specialties.* Wild Pepper Tofu ($7.85) - Soft tofu with lots of flavor and gravy.  Another good choice!* Eggplant in Garlic Sauce ($7.85) - Really good as well, although not the favorite of the bunch.  * Local Style Dry Pot Chicken ($9.25) - At least that's what I think we ordered...it arrived with a fire going on beneath it.  Others really enjoyed it, but it was okay to me.* A pork or chicken dish with green bell peppers - It was a good dish, without the gravy.  It had hidden heat amongst the green bell peppers because green chilies were hiding in the dish.I had low expectations on service, and you really don't come here for service.  No one spoke or understood any English, which was a major problem.  Only Mandarin speaking only!  We thought they forgot about a dish because it took so long, and we think they really did.  It eventually came out at the end.Our second visit was a party of five again and this was our menu:* Boiled Fish and Beef in Szechuan Special Sauce ($10.25) - Any of their "boiled" things in Szechuan special sauce is a good choice.* Wild Pepper Tofu ($7.85) * Local Style Dry Pot Chicken ($9.25) * Potato ($7.85) - The Husband saw a lot of people ordering this on our first visit, so we had to get it.  It's potato that's been stir-fried without the spice.  It's a light dish and we liked it so much that it inspired us to make it at home.  (It comes out different at home, more like Chinese-style hash browns when I do it!)* Sauteed (Garlic Sauce) Seasonal Vegetable ($7.85) - The vegetable was snow pea shoots which are always good when cooked with garlic.* Pork Intestines - Stir-fried with lots of veggies.  It was good, but we just ordered too much food this time around.Service was better the second time around, only because there was one waitress who spoke and understand English very well, AND she spoke Cantonese, which helped since my mom was there.  But everyone else who worked there just looked at us as if we were aliens whenever we tried to ask about anything.  I also had some problems getting my credit card receipt.  They gave me one to sign, but nothing to keep.  When I asked for it, it was a big deal to get a copy and I think it's because they really didn't understand that I just wanted my credit card receipt.Go with a large group so you can try more things.  One dish for every person should be an ample amount.  The food is pretty authentic and there's a definite heat in it.  Most diners are native Chinese and this place definitely fills up by 7:30 pm.  Just don't have any expectations with service or anyone speaking English.3.5 for really tasty and authentic Chinese food but negatives for crap service.(Pics posted!)After beginning our recent dinner at a nearby restaurant and knowing that we were going to leave unfulfilled, The Husband and I suggested Yun Nan Garden to our friend who is always curious to try something new.* Boiled Beef with Szechuan Sauce ($9.25) - We knew we wanted something with their specialty sauce, and we've ordered this dish twice before.  It's always been a winner, so why not go for it again.* Bean Curd Fish with Szechuan Special Spicy Sauce ($9.25) - We asked for a recommendation for fish, and the waiter suggested this one.  It has a very similar sauce as the beef dish, but it also has peanuts in it too.  Loads of spice again!* Home Style Potato ($7.85) - We wanted a potato dish and thought it was the same one we've ordered before where the potatoes are cut into strips and stir-fried.  This dish is different since the potatoes are sliced and boiled, it sits in a chicken broth with jalapenos.  It was good, especially against all the heat from the other dishes, but we wished we had gotten the other potato dish instead.When you eat at Yun Nan Garden, you have to be prepared for the heat.  Our friend said he liked spicy, but had no idea it was going to be this spicy!  Bring on the water and tissues!  And for anyone hoping to skip the rice, impossible here because you need the white base to slop all the spicy goodness to slurp up!Service was better this time.  A male waiter seated us and took our order.  Another girl brought our food, beverages, and our check over.  We had minimal contact with the wait staff this time, so maybe that worked in our favor.We had plenty of leftovers from the two spicy dishes, but then it  might be because our friend couldn't handle the heat! Haha!3.5 stars.BEST CHINESE IN VEGAS. When all the Chinese tour buses drop off their passengers at Yun Nan, you know this place is good.FOOD: Chinese restaurants in Vegas are either unauthentic, too salty, or leave a bad taste in my mouth. Yun Nan is authentic and will kick your butt with flavor. There is so much to choose from; the menu is huge! I haven't had the opportunity to try more than a few dishes. The Noodle dishes I could live without.... but their Mapo Tofu is the best in town and their white fish seafood dishes are ALL delicious.SERVICE: The service isn't bad. Its just hard to communicate with the waitresses. They don't speak a lot of English. If you can't speak Mandarin... just order using the numbers. CREDIT CARDS: Minimum $20I have been to many Chinese food spots in town, and this place blows them away!Reason why?  My personal reasons...I prefer Vietnamese food when I crave fresh, Japanese food when I want flavor, and Thai food when I want spice and depth.  Yunnan delivers on ALL three!We tried the stir fried Eel with dry pepper....the eel was very flavorful and the dish was spicy!  It had a nice consistency and tons and tons of taste going on!  The portion was huge and they did not skimp out on the goods!   Check out the pic :http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yun-nan-garden-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#roxUo3o8u3yg7px8D7wgawHad the salt and pepper shrimp, and it was good, just thought it would be full head on and done a little differently.  Also thought they would/should have been larger at $12-13 for the plate.  I wouldn't order these again, unless I can specify that I want head/shell on.  Pic :http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yun-nan-garden-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#7M6BnswF5BV-esTvISeL8gLastly, tried some fried egg and green onion dish.  It was light and flavorful.  Wanted something that wasn't spicy, and this filled in well.  Also a generous portion and inexpensive.Service is typical authentic Asian.  Just friendly wave if you need anything and you will get it fast....just don't expect service like you would in an American establishment (auto/fill drinks, check on food, getting bill etc), and you will have a great time.I WILL be back again.  Even their non spicy dishes are packed with taste, and blow away any other spots I have tried in town thus far (Chinese food wise).2 words describe my experience at Yunnan: pleasantly surprising. I'm half-Chinese and I'm very picky when it comes to Chinese food and Americanized "Chinese" food makes me sad.A lot of Chinese people told me about this place but I've been putting off giving this place a try since I heard most of the items on their menu is spicy. I don't do spicy.I was browsing through the menu and sure enough, 90% of the items on the menu had not one, but two peppers next to their name! Yikes! I saw the spare ribs with garlic didn't have the two pepper symbols and I love garlic so I chose that. The garlic was minced and crispy fried and the flavor was just great covering the spare ribs. I sprinkled the fried garlic on the other dishes we got including the MaPo tofu. I think tofu is the only thing I don't mind eating spicy. It was good and it took several bites before my nose started running.The shocker on the menu was the Chongqing Spicy Chicken. The big plate was at least 50% red peppers. I was very afraid and highly intimidated until I tried a small piece of chicken. The chicken was lightly breaded, fried and super crispy. Reminds me of my Chinese grandmother's fried chicken. To my surprise, it wasn't spicy. I mean, there was a bite to it but not a kick. It was absolutely delicious and enjoyable. This was my favorite out of the dishes we tried and I'll get this again.The service was ok. A lick of Chinese might help you a lot. I was watching and listening to Shawn and our server's interaction and it wore me out!I don't know what's happening here. This is one of those places that you read all the glowing reviews, you go try it yourself, and you think you must have gone to the wrong place. Upon sitting down, the waitress came over and waited at our table for us to decide on a dish, little weird but ok. I chose the Kung Pao Shrimp and my friend chose the Yunnan Style Dried Beef. What came out was shrimp in a pile of oil and my friends dish was even worse. It tasted like beef jerky from a 7-11, and it resembled Shit on a Shingle. $11.99 for each dish and PLUS they charge you for rice $3 extra. I didn't think my shrimp was spicy at all. My friend couldn't finish her plate is was so salty. Then the waitress comes back around with our bill and stands there until we pay. This situation was bizarre. Too many other places in Chinatown to ever give this place a second try.This place gets better and better. And busier, I might add. This is Szechwan Chinese food at it's finest. Short recap - this is a get in and get out kind of place. It was INSANELY busy last night and they were trying to just get people seated, served and get them out. Again, don't expect excellent customer service here, just expect the best Chinese food you may ever have here in the states. It's the best. We brought my boyfriend's parents here last night and they haven't had much authentic Chinese food, and they were very impressed. The best thing we had last night was the Rice Noodles w/ Sweet and Sour soup and spicy pork stew. I can't even begin to tell you how amazing the taste is with this soup. It's a perfect blend of spices, herbs, the cilantro that gives it that nice topping and just the pork itself...mouth watering. We also shared:Cured pork with green beans, which was okay. It was more like cripsy dried out bacon. It was the only thing I've ever ordered that I wasn't a fan of. Cumin Lamb, always a favorite. Not too spicy, but the cumin in it is very strong. So be prepared. Garlic Shrimp, good, but not my favorite. A good dish if you can't have soy. Chongqing Spicy Shrimp, awesome. This is one of the most recommended dishes and I see why. It is friend with tempura, but it's so bold, spicy and full of flavor.Overall, I absolute LOVE this place. It's so good and the prices are still very reasonable for the amazing quality this place has. They raised the prices by $5-7 per dish. But again, it's so worth it. Be prepared to wait, but also be prepared to be amazed. This is Chinese like you've never had it. You'll never wanted Americanized again.This spot is hidden around the back of a Chinatown plaza next door to Mayweather's boxing gym, but had a bus full of Asian tourists parked outside? Found that super bizarre.Ordered takeout based exclusively on the Yelp photos: won ton soup with spicy pork and the garlic pork spare rib dish. Didn't glance at a menu prior, surprised my total was $25. Other reviews state that prices have risen in recent months, and it certainly doesn't make me want to rush back.WON TON SOUP WITH SPICY PORK: Generous portion, boxed with noodles and dumplings separate for at-home assembly. Spicy broth with plenty of cilantro and pork, tasty dumplings and generous portion of noodles.GARLIC PORK SPARE RIB: A little underwhelmed by this. I'm a huge garlic lover and the plentiful crunchy-fried version in this dish was sweeter and more understated than I expected, it's used more for texture. Did not finish this dish.Service was typical for the area. Location is clean and organized. Other reviews mention the tour bus visits being a regular occurrence, which would be a deterrent for me. I might return for a dine-in visit another time to try different dishes.

Was in the area and was hungry for Mexican Food, so I stopped by this Chipotle to grab some lunch.  It's a typical Chipotle.....if you've never been to one before here's a breakdown:You select your menu item...ie Burrito, Taco, Quesadilla.  Then you instruct the employee making your meal on what ingredients you'd like on/in your item.....ie Pinto/Black Beans, Guacamole, Sour Cream, Salsa etc.I decided to go for a Chicken Burrito w/Pinto Beans, Guacamole, Sour Cream, Pico de Gallo, Hot Sauce, Rice.  To wash it down, I got a bottle of Izzle Clementine Soda.The Burrito is huge and was delicious.  I really like their Hot Sauce at Chipotle, it has a nice kick to it.  I devoured the entire Burrito, then enjoyed my Izzle.Overall Value - I always get great value for my money at Chipotle.Will I return?  I like this location, I'm sure I'll be back.

I was expecting to see a celebrity dining here like they do in LA, but we were there on an early Sunday evening and there were only a handful of other tables occupied. Like its other locations in LA and NY, the interior of the gorgeous restaurant is zen-chic. The floor to ceiling windows provided an amazing view of Bellagio Lake. We asked if we could be seated in the lounge facing out to the lake because there were several tables inside - and all unoccupied, but unfortunately they were "reserved for friends of the owner." Disappointing. Our booth was pretty nice though, and we were able to get a glimpse of the water show every now and then. The food was pretty tasty, although nothing was mind-blowing. It may have been because we stuck with ordering rolls, and not the signature dishes like miso black cod or Kobe beef filet mignon. Our friendly server suggested his favorites to us. We had the scallop roll, dragon roll, baked lobster roll and crispy rice topped with spicy tuna. The baked lobster roll with cream sauce melted in our mouths and was hands down our favorite. The crispy rice with spicy tuna was supposed to be their most popular dish, but the texture of the spicy tuna was odd. We weren't quite sure why it was so popular. It was super spicy though! We ended our simple meal with a simple dessert - mango mochi ice cream with blackberries. I'm sure Koi is hot and happening on Friday and Saturday though, so get your fabulous self over there on those nights! They totally have the potential of being 4+ star worthy.The first evening we arrived in Las Vegas for my birthday weekend, my wife and I wanted to eat something different but familiar so we weren't overwhelmed to question where it came from. Luckily, after our first afternoon outing, we went back to our hotel room at Planet Hollywood and found a discount coupon for 15% off dinner at Koi sitting on top our pillow. I bet it was strategically placed there by housekeeping, but nonetheless a great idea. I immediately made reservations for 6 PM through Open Table to take advantage of accumulating dining points and to make sure we had a table. No problems there.The restaurant is located upstairs next to Holly Madison's Peepshow. A couple of tables and sofas were placed before the hostess check-in booth. When we arrived for our reservations, the restaurant was dimly lit. The host walked us through the restaurant and sat us in a booth. At 6 PM, there were only two other couples and a handful of people at the sushi bar, but I figured people were still sleeping or getting ready for their evening events.The waiter was very polite and courteous, answered all our questions, and made suggestions after we asked what was good. After reviewing their extensive menu, we ordered:Seafood Miso Soup $8, Miso soup with bits of clam, squid, tofu.Crispy Rice(Tuna) $16, Uniquely made, these Tar tare styled tuna over a crispy rice sushi were a hit with us. The rice was crispy outside and chewy inside.Fresh Oysters on a Half Shell(6) $24, 6 flavorful fresh oysters over a bed of ice garnished with lemon slice and dipping sauce.Edamame $5 Lightly Sea Salted.Grilled skirt steak $28, Piled high like a log cabin, the succulent slices were stacked 3x3, garnished with Alfalfa and paddling in a tangy reduction sauce.Bowl of white rice $3, Got rice?Total Bill = $77.18 before tip. Priceless.Each appetizer and entrée plate was nicely decorated and simply beautiful. Pictures are proof, but tasting is believing. Therefore, I must encourage you to visit Koi at Planet Hollywood in Las Vegas. My first experience here demands a return visit the next time around.Came here with my girlfriends and hubby after watching a show at Planet Hollywood. Some guy stopped us downstairs and gave us a bracelet for the club later that night. We decided to check it out and ended up going in for the happy hour. I'm not really into sushi but I must say I enjoyed them here. Chef Tim sent over some shots for all of us then dessert samplers after dinner. I enjoyed my time here but did not stay very long for the club portion. I do plan on coming back for happy hour if we ever see another show at Planet Hollywood.This review is for my experience in the main restaurant (as opposed to the lounge, which turns into a nightclub at 10:30pm).  Ambience:  great!  Loved the decor and setting. Service:  friendly,  attentive, not pretentious--our server was great!!!!   The bar service would be my only complaint and it wasn't enough to dampen our evening whatsoever.   The pours where a little weak and as the restaurant became more crowded, bar service slowed down.  Food: delicious!!!!   Black miso cod, skirt steak, teriyaki chicken (for me:) and tons of sushi.  Sorry, not sure what rolls we ordered, but all the die-hard sushi eaters at the table had zero complaints and every crumb got devoured which praise.  The cod was a stand out as was the shishito mashed potatoes.  I loved the whole experience and can't wait to go back.Such a letdown. My big 30th birthday dinner bonanza here felt more like a 29th birthday whatever. You know the difference I'm talking about. Don't act like you don't!We thought 8pm reservations on a Saturday night would mean a full restaurant, trendy vibe, and the restaurant's best servers. You know, 30th birthday-worthy treatment. Nope. If there were other people dining at Koi, they were nowhere near us. The lighting felt like being at the bar at 2AM when the fluorescents are kicked on to scoot everyone out. And our waiter had no clue what was on the menu. He tried describing the sashimi the way a freshly-pimpled teen might try to describe wine. "There's like notes of flowers... and the texture is like, raw..." Just stop.The sushi was also underwhelming. We did the larger chef's selection and a few specialty rolls. The pieces on the chef's selection were really fresh tasting and worth the order. However we all felt pretty disappointed by the specialty rolls. Not a ton of flavor, but a lot of mayos and crunchies. Like what you get at the supermarket. Or Walgreens. Fortunately the cocktails were strong and smoothed over the meal and service; but for over $100/person I needed more. Yes 'need'. It was my 30th birthday and I NEEDED that top notch celebration. Skip the namesake of Koi and try another sushi restaurant on the Strip.

Review Text :
"Hot Dough in So Faux"When I was a kid in upstate New York every Saturday was pizza night. Dad would call Jocko's in East Rochester and order a large pepperoni and a large green pepper. Ten minutes later we'd pile into the Chrysler Newport and forge through snow, rain or sleet to get them. Once back home Dad would set up the bridge table for Sis and I and the two of us would watch TV in one room while Mom and Dad watched in another. My sister and I would watch Emergency and the parents would watch Lawrence Welk or something. It was always fun and each of us looked forward to it every week.Well, these days I live in So Faux, Nevada, aka Las Vegas, where precipitation is almost as rare as an occupied strip mall.Dad's Chrysler is gone and I drive a Crown Vic LX with leather interior, known city-wide as THE Chick Magnet.I have a bridge table in a closet somewhere but I usually eat dinner over the sink.And Saturday night television? Usually whatever movie is on HBO or Showtime if I'm feeling too cheap to order Butt Sluts on PPV.Sadly, take-out pizza is no longer a weekly affair. Somewhere along the line I started buying frozen pies at Smith's. Some of them aren't too bad, you know. DiGiorno, Freschetta and Paul Newman's come to mind. Even Tombstone makes it into my oven sometimes.Yet every so often I miss the days of take-out pizza on Saturdays. It just isn't the same with frozen pies, metal sinks and Butt Sluts. And on those certain days when I long for both yesteryear and fresh goodness, I pick up the phone and call Metro. And do you know what? It's always the same: One large pizza. Half pepperoni, half green pepper.My mouth waters as I drive the Crown Vic LX with leather interior down 215. And after parking THE Chick Magnet I'm always warmly welcomed as I stride into Metro Pizza, usually by two bubblicious brunettes with scintillating smiles. The brunettes even offer me complimentary soda if I'm early, and they ALWAYS ooh and ahh over the Crown Vic LX with leather interior. I just smile and say thanks and pay the 22 bucks. I even beep the horn as I leave the Metro lot, the brunettes at the window blowing kisses as I fade into the night.Sigh.They pine for me.(Or is it just the car?)But, alas, they cannot have me(or the car), for my heart belongs to Butt Sluts.The scent of hot pizza drives me wild as I traverse home, so much so that I frequently open the windows regardless of the weather. Desert wind tears at my thick mane, the drivers beside me jealous of my looks, locks and LX.Upon returning home I do what many consider unthinkable: I place the pizza, cardboard and all, inside a 250 degree oven. I like my pizza hot, and thou shalt not microwave Metro.On occasion I blister my mouth but do not care. It's worth it. The chewy crust is to die for and I love fresh pepper slabs, the pepperoni reminscent of those sub-zero Saturday nights near Lake Ontario. I even forego the sink when I consume Metro and sit at my cherrywood table, sprinkling slices with oregano and red pepper, staring at the telly and wondering if Jocko's is still there. I suppose I could find out but I prefer not to know. I might be saddened if it wasn't, or disappointed if it wasn't good anymore. I even scan the channels for Emergency and Lawrence Welk. But I never find either. Probably just as well. Someone once said the past is in the past because that's where it belongs. Perhaps they're right.Anyway, when I'm done eating I always have enough for another meal, which usually means brunch the next morning. Sometimes I eat it cold, sometimes I heat it in the oven. Depends on my mood and the temperature outside. But rest assured, it's always as good the following morning as it was the night before.Even if Butt Sluts or Lawrence Welk isn't playing.I'm a fan and didn't even try their pizza.I've had Metro Pizza bookmarked, then I took it off, then I put it back on, then I finally tried them.  I was seeking this place out every since I read an ROTD on it from last November.  Never found the time and wasn't in the area to ever try them until now. Let's start with the restaurant itself.  It's bigger than I expected. One thing missing from most reviews is the size of this restaurant. I expected a small typical pizza joint with your checkered red/white tablecloths and gaudy decorations all over. Boy was I totally moted!!  This restaurant is classy, spacious, clean, and well lit.  Because of what I experienced walking in, I assumed a pricey menu.  My first thoughts, sure glad Terri R. is paying for lunch this time. Then I reviewed the menu and was brought back down to earth.  Bang for your buck for sure! Metro Pizza has a large selection of pizza, stuffed pizza, salads, calzones, platters, dinners, and one type of soup (Minestrone).  I didn't want to feel too heavy for lunch, so I opted against pizza this time.  I'm not a huge pizza guy anymore anyways.  I chose their Chicken Parmesan Sub w/Garlic Fries ($9.25).  This is served hot, melted cheese, and just the right amount of sauce on top of about 8 oz of breaded chicken breast.  Simply delicious, portions big, and the chicken breast tender.  I washed my parmesan sub down with their garlic fries and glass of water.  In about 10 minutes, my meal was devoured.  One thing about Italian Restaurants, either there's too much sauce which sometimes sogs out your meal or there's not enough where you're wanting more.  At Metro, they had it just right, not too much, not too little, and definitely not too thick.  Since I'm a new fan of Metro's Parm Sub, I'm sure their pizzas are good too.  Service was great from start to finish. Our food was also prepared and served with little wait. Voted "The Best of Las Vegas" 7 years in a row!!!  They obviously don't need my review to keep their status, but they got my 5 stars anyway.I asked my kids what they wanted for dinner. Well what do you know they wanted pizza. Shocking news. Well, it just so happens that Metro Pizza just happens to be in the same plaza we were in so off we go.As soon as we come in to what appears to be a full house, we are greeted warmly by the host and showed us to our table. Right away our server hands us menus and gets our drink orders. Great first impression so far.We order the Domenica Salad, Garlic Romano Fries, and a large thin crust half Pepperoni half Gotham. The Domenica Salad has romaine lettuce, salami, ham, provolone, cucumbers, onions and tomatoes all tossed in their own house dressing and served with a fresh-baked garlic knot.The Garlic Romano Fries has shredded romano cheese and real sautéed minced garlic. No vampires will attack you after eating this.And for the star of the show, a large thin crust half Pepperoni half Gotham pizza. On one half you got just about every topping they have and on the other half just your basic pepperoni. The crust itself seemed like it was hand tossed at first sight, but as soon as you take that first wonderful crispy bite, there is no mistaking it is genuinely thin crust. With thin crust, usually a lot of toppings tend to make it limp. Not this style, the overall slice kept its shape. As for the service, lets put it this way, if you don't have to ask for anything, that means everything was on point. This was one tip I didnt mind going over the standard. Great service is few and far in between it seems so I dont mind showing my gratitude.So there you have it. Great food and great service. Finding both in everywhere you eat is usually a low percentage. If I am in the area, I will ask my kids.........no what I meant was I will tell my kids we are having pizza.10 years ago Metro would have gotten nothing but 5 stars from me all around. As I know they make a great pizza-pie, I have recently been let down by the consistency. I placed an order for delivery not too long ago. My total came out to $50. They forgot my ranch and gave me the wrong pizza. When I called to politely let them know, I was offered $15 credit. The large pie they messed up was more than $15, so I am confused on why this amount is appropriate credit. Basically a way to get me to spend more money there, cuz ain't no one eating there for $15 solo. I was grateful for the credit, but expected more. The quality of products, and customer service is almost always at 100%. I have never had a complaint about service. The prices have gone up over the years, but at least they have not cut corners on using high standards.Over-all, yes I will dine here. But it use to be my 1st choice, and I can't say that now. There are quite a lot of old school, east coast style, pizza joints popping up around town, Metro may be the OGs of their trade, but they still need to step their game up to keep up with the competition. Especially in Henderson, when Bistro pizza is right around the corner.

Starved yes... They gave me a  hoof off of a steer! You call this Prime Rib? It's a dried up piece of meat...harder then beef jerky.... Not even close to Prime Rib... It needs dozens of Au Jous to soften this rock hard prime rib.And...quit calling this hoof....prime rib...I guess eating food in Vegas is like gambling with your tummy.Maybe something might be good in here... But...I suggest you use your stomach to find out. My stomach is out for temporary repairs...

Review Text :
Thank you to future yelper Christina P for insisting on meeting at Bomberos for our lunch meeting today.  As Ayesha said previously, it is adorable, unique, intimate, and perfect!  Since we met for a late lunch, it was pretty quiet in the restaurant and we received personal attention from both Oscar and our waitress - i felt so special!Since Christina P is a regular, I asked for her favorite items (pretty much everything on the menu), listened to the salad of the day (which sounded delicious), and then since I was having a hard time making a decision, we decided to split a tuna and a veggie panini sandwich.  It was a great decision... the kitchen split them for us and the were both delicious!  The tuna is not creamy; it's flaked and the perfect consistency with capers and vinegar - we had manchego cheese melted along with it... like a Cuban version of a tuna melt!  The bread was toasted perfectly - crunchy on the outside and moist and soft on the inside.  The veggie version includes artichoke hearts, roasted red pepper, tomato, basil, and manchego cheese too - everything tasted fresh and light.  Although the servings are pretty generous, so I managed to get full without cleaning my plate.  Paninis are served with potato chips (the kind that taste crunchy and salty and you know they are not good for you but you eat them anyways) and pickles (which I requested more of because they were also so good).It was lunchtime, so we stuck with water but I will have to return to enjoy their wine selection in the future.  That, and the live music, back patio (which is beautiful), and the welcoming atmosphere and friendly service...Thanks again, Christina, for selecting Bomberos  - I enjoyed your company and our lunch very much!I was in Bomberos for breakfast this morning, and I was told they now carry Coca Lite!  So much better than Diet Coke - I had no idea I could find it anywhere in the US!  How great is that?Also, Bomberos is now using MJ Breads and Tammie Co pastries... not too shabby, huh?Wow wow wee waa! What a nice place.  Didn't eat any food, but I will next time, I promise.  Tried three wines, including their special house Pino, and all were fabulous!   Great patio, ---no REALLY great patio! Good service. Rockin' good looks. On a Thursday night, only about 50% full, so it's not like Postinos where you have to wait 30 mins for a table.You might say I'm a "regular." I absolutely love Bomberos and can be found there with my laptop on a Saturday morning for breakfast, having a lunch meeting during the week, unwinding at the bar after a long day at work or on the patio enjoying the company of friends late into the evening. (Although, not THIS week, because it appears they are closed from 12/22 - 12/28. Making up for it with a free wine tasting on 12/29 though...)Truly, there's little to add to what's already been said:Hands down it's the best patio in the Valley - water features in the summer and an awesome fire pit for the chillier months.Live music on the patio most Saturday nights gives people a chance to relax or get up and get their Latin groove on.Inside is urban chic but unpretentious and lets you feel cool for being there no matter how cool you are.Breakfast portions are generous and the coffee is awesome (said the self-proclaimed coffee snob).  By the way, my favorite breakfast option made a short appearance on the menu but can still be ordered: salami and Swiss omelet - egg whites only with home fries... yummy!Lunch offers a half salad - half sandwich option and there's always a "salad of the day." (I can't pick a favorite panini or bruschetta because they're all good but I can say putting manchego on the tuna makes it even better!)Free WiFi and it's VERY quite during the day making it easy to have a meeting or catch up on some work.I remember sitting on a crate in the building that is Bomberos before it was a wine bar and drinking a bottle of whatever my friend picked up from Orange Market at the corner and dreaming about what it would be one day... Christi and Oscar have done a superb job in their first year and I'm so grateful to have such a great place as my neighborhood hang out!Bomberos, a Norwegian based group, playing what they like to call "obscene, disgusting punk", was formed in 2002......ooops my bad, Bomberos are Fire Fighters in Chilie...incidently my second favorite south american country..stopped here for Chrissy's surprise birthday party hosted by the fabuloso Amber and Teh "Cool Kids"...so what is my take on Bomberos? well i found it to be very comfortable, i feel kinda lame to write a review on a "Cafe & Wine Bar" if i didn't actually eat or drink anything. but the environment alone deserves 4 stars. it is truely an enchanting spot. everything they served looked awesome and there was nothing but Hmmmm's and "Yumm" and from the previous reviews i tend to believe that most of them are not over exagerated.  i look forward to returning sometime soon. for what i consider to be outer limits of my bubble, it's certainly not off limits. i will let Bomberos put out my fire any time. as long as it's with a nice Chilean Lager.Yelp!So, I had been here before, for all of about 10 minutes and wasn't able to sample any food or beverage. On Thursday last week I was able to get the full experience. I was taken here on a date. That's right, someone took ME here. That was a nice change of pace. We got there around 8 on a Thursday night and the place wasn't too busy. we sat inside right next to the roll up doors. The place used to be a firehouse. So there was perfect weather. We started the meal with drinks. She ordered a bottle of Sauv White. I finally got to try an Argentinian Malbec, full bodied(well that is what the waiter told me). The malbec was very good. I tried some of the Sauv, it was very tasty also. I usually don't like whites, but it wasn't too dry. We shared a small bowl of marinated olives. Kalamata and Green olives, very good. I ate most of it. For the main course I had the Salami & Manchego panini with pesto. OMG!!! This thing was awesome! Very toasty and buttery. I had half of it with a salad. The salad was simple greens with flaky tuna. Now, this could have been canned tuna and anyone who knows me, knows I hate this with every ounce of my being. With that being said, the salad was excellent. The tuna was marinated in vinegar and capers and took away a lot of the nastiness. It had a simple balsamic vinaigrette on it. I was very impressed with the food and ate every bit on my plate. For dessert we split a flourless chocolate souffle. It had a very large, ripe strawberry on top and a huge dollop of fresh whip cream. If you like chocolate, get this and you won't be disappointed. We finished up the food and headed to the patio. The patio is cozy with several fire pits and lots of seating. This would be a great patio for a day drink or to unwind at night. I have always wanted to try mate,pronounced Maw-tay (thanks Z), a traditional South American tea. It was very good, but on first taste reminded me of a cigar. Ask them for honey and put it in. Very good. They bring out a thermos type thing of hot water so you can just keep refilling. I highly recommend it. This is a little gem in the heart of Sunnyslope. Great patio, very warm interior, great service, and great food. The food menu is small, but I bet everything is done to perfection. Large, interesting wine list for the wine aficionados out there.  I love when little local places blow me away.I absolutely despise feeling like I've been judged not worth someone's time due to their assumptions about my financial status based on my outward appearance.And this time it wasn't even by a girl in a G-String on a pole!Okay, so anyone who reads my reviews knows I'm not regularly dining high on the hog, but don't the beautiful rich people slum around in workout gear sometimes, too?So after a recent run down Central Ave, one of my K9's and I decided to partake in a little of the awesome concept Donald S calls RETOXIFYING.  A little snack and some wine out on the patio sounded great to me, so I went over to Bomberos.It was early in the day, so they weren't at all busy, there were only a couple of other customers either inside or out.  I walked in and out between the patio and the inside seating area several times over a few moments, purposefully contorting my face into the restaurant patron's "where do I go?" look.  Since the server's work station and door to the kitchen area were in that narrow hallway, I actually was in the way of the couple of servers who were there trying to move to and from the two dining areas.I did not get greeted at all, either before or after I had to stop one of them and ask for a menu. I sat and reviewed the menu for a several minutes, all the while continuing my confused, helpless patron routine.Nothing.With nary a peep out of the servers, I walked away.My tendency to frequent $ instead of $$$$ places comes less from a lack of means than it does from my countless experiences that what you get for your $$$$ is often not worth it.  If I have a 2* experience at a $ restaurant, I may be a little upset, but if I have a 2* experience at a $$$$ establishment, I'm going to be postally pioughd.Bomberos may treat you like one of the Sunnyslope Elite, if you show up looking like you are one of the Sunnyslope Elite.  Maybe then their overpriced wine and admittedly tasty looking nosh might seem worth it.  (It IS all from South America)  Without friendly or at least minimally cordial customer service, they can stuff it up their stuffy butts.I ended up stopping at a nasty dirty nearby Sonic (limited options due to the dog, remember) where both the order-taking electronic voice and the rollerskate-less carhop both had the decency to ask me how I was doing that day.Still loving Bomberos...~ They've added some pannini including a cantaloupe, prosciutto and mint which is a refreshing choice with a salad. ~ $8 now for salad, panini or bruschetta OR a 1/2 pannini and half salad at lunch! ~ Happy hour from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. gets you 1/2 price wine by the glass or $4 for beer (all imported).Finally made it to Bomberos for an after-dinner glass of wine.  I was really surprised at how small the place is!  I love that!  And the patio is so nice we opted to sit outside.  Seemed like a good idea at the time..until we realized it was 95 degrees outside and the breeze had died down.But I enjoyed my glass of white wine.  I couldn't tell you what it was beyond something South American.  Glasses average $10-$12, so it is a little expensive, but I would gladly return.  Can't wait to try something from their menu next time!we're talking ridiculously delightful, here.  we're talking about an adorableness that is surpassed only by the hugely adorable morning barista, Sam, who put up with the idiosyncracies of my extended family with ease.this place is so f$%#ing cute I can't stand it.  It has a smallish inside with free wireless, a coffee bar, and a small but well-appointed menu that is just full of delicious stuff.  There's a huge outside patio which has some good tree-shade so that it's palatable even when it's a bit too hot to sit outside under other circumstances.We had some of everything when we went.  The panini are served with this thick (in size--it wasn't very dense at all) bread that is buttery and flaky and golden all at once, and really good ingredients.  My mom got the melon and prosciutto panini.  I got the veggie panini (tomatoes, red peppers, artichokes, etc) which was really great--my personal preference would be fewer red peppers but I just plucked them off.  There's a chimichurri panini.  All really good.  There's a panini (I'm guessing the singular of panini is panino but how pretentious should I get in this forum?) with mozzarella and tomato and basil.  Yesterday was vegetarian day, and there were plenty of options for that.They also offer bruschetta, where you choose from a bunch of different options--mostly the same as would be available on the panini, so a lot of the above possibilities--and that received rave reviews as well.The wine was half off.  The cappuccinos were tasty (I hear).  Sam was charming.  What more can I say?Ah--one more thing.  They had a flourless chocolate dessert from Tammie Coe, which was my first experience with a Tammie Coe item, and it was reeeeeally good.  It was called the Chocolate Sensational and it had a few berries around the rich chocolate thing.  I would add more berries if I were god.  But I'm not, I keep getting told.One final note.  There are a couple reviews that bash the place for slow-ish service.  I would just remind everyone that this isn't ihop--this place has a south american (and in my opinion, european) feel and if I can tell you anything about service in south america, it's don't be in a hurry.  I know, you rebut: we live here. in north america.  But that isn't the point.  The point is this: you go to this place to get a taste of what such a restaurant would be in south america.  it's clean, it's cute, it's small. the food is excellent, and surprisingly well priced.  It's like your own little foreign exchange coup!  Moral: Bomberos is the mad note.  Go there and relax.  You're too uptight, anyway.Returned for a recent breakfast, and can't stop thinking about how much I enjoyed it.  I did an omelet, which was great, but I LOVED their coffee.  What a nice morning.Now that they're doing happy hour, i need to get back here in the evening, especially now that it's nice enough to really enjoy the patio.One time, before we became "official," I walked into a UYE at Bomberos and gave Dallas G a high five. That's right, instead of a hug or kiss on the cheek for the man who had graced the sheets of my bed many a times, he gets a high five. It was awkward. Realllllyyyy awkward. I'm so smooth.... So, thank god Bomberos has such a dope wine list and attentive service, because I most definitely needed the Chilean Riesling to take off the edge of that massacre!They have an amazing bruschetta plate, a tasty breakfast wrap, perfectly brewed Illy coffees and they even let me bring in my own cake when it was Chrissy P's surprise party!The patio is amazing whether you want to lounge out on a Sunday morning and read a book on the comfy patio furniture or sit with a romantic date by the fire. I also hear that they have free wifi. Score!Winner!! (Unlike me, who gives awkward high 5's!!!)

Review Text :
I had always been a 5 star fan of yellowfin, until one day.I am probably one of the more tolerant restaurant customers giving servers, and restaurants the benefit of the doubt.  It's true that sometimes servers have bad days and are grumpy, and that's no problem, we've all been there.  There are also sometimes mistakes in food, and likewise, a chef or sushi chef could be having a bad day.Still... when I was serve edamame in my lunch bento... and there were literally maggots coming out of the edamame... i was pretty horrified.  It was definitely one of those situations where you know the food is old.  The edamame was lifeless, brown, old.  And to my surprise, there were maggots in it having at it.So being as tempered as possible, I alerted the server who apologized and took it away.  I was expecting one of two things... 1, the server (or owner) will come to the table, apologize, and comp my meal.  2, nothing will happen until I receive the check, and the meal will be comped on there with some kind of apology note.By the time the check came, neither of the two happened.  Giving the restaurant one more chance to make right their wrong, I politely asked if I could get my meal comped since there were maggots in my food.  The server responded politely that the owner said there was no way for anyone to know there were maggots in the edamame.  Even though the edamame was all pretty much opened up with maggots coming out of them when it reached the table in the first place.So... there you go, I gave every chance for them to make right their wrong.  Suffice it to say that getting maggots in your food is a totally unacceptable situation, they took it 3 steps too far by doing nothing about it before the check, on the check, or after the check.  By principle alone, and from fear that the rice, or even fish are likely aging beyond their safe tolerance levels, yellowfin gets a 0 star if I could give them one for committing egregious health code violations, and donig nothing about it.

Restaurant name  MORE Buffet

Review Text :
I had a myVegas comp for the buffet and used it last night.  I was surprised by the get your own drinks, but that's OK with me.  I didn't have to wait for anyone other than myself.I started by doing a walk through of the entire area to see what they had.  I ended up starting with salads.  I had macaroni salad-pretty standard and OK.  The western salad was shredded lettuce with red bell pepper and fresh jalapeño rounds.  This salad had a nice kick and was quite good.  I also had some couscous which also was good.  I did find some bread sticks by the salad station.  In the regular roll area, they had standard large rolls.  They were out of butter packets so only small margarine containers were available.  The breadstick didn't need it.I then went to the carving area and he had a new piece of beef.  This is not prime rib.  It looked like it was a rectangle of beef and it looked well done.  When I asked the gentleman where had all the nice rare meat gone that had been there when I did my walk through, he cut the beef in half and gave me a nice slice from the less done inside.  I got a piece of bok choy, some hush puppies, and a macadamia crusted chicken breast with apricot.  There was no  macadamia nut flavor at all.  The apricot gave the chicken some taste rather than being plain chicken.I then went to the desserts.  They had a fairly nice selection of the small plastic cups that are appearing in buffets everywhere.  My first plate had a panna cotta with a lemon top filling with a fresh raspberry, flan with a fresh blackberry and some chopped nuts, and a small container of chocolate trifle.  The panna cotta and the chocolate trifle were great--the flan less so.Second dessert plate had a macadamia nut cookie, a small pastry filled with vanilla cream and another fresh raspberry, and the star of the desserts, an Oreo cookie cheesecake.The buffet was OK.  For the $22 they charge, you're not getting the kind of fare you'd get at the Bellagio or other property but they also charge $10 or more.  I wouldn't drive to the Strip to pay for this buffet.  We have a lot better choices in our locals casinos not on the Strip.  But for a comp, it was a nice dinner.  And I really did like the fact that I got more iced tea anytime I wanted without waiting.Finally, every time I left my table, it was bussed before I got back.  That's not something that happens at all buffets.  I saw several people leaving last night without leaving even a dollar for the bus person.  I know I did most of the work, but he cleaned my table before, during, and after my dinner there last night.  He and the other wait staff deserve a tip!There's something for everyone here. I find that most of the 1 and 2 star reviews are filled with nothing but negativity... If you're looking for exotic cuisine, stuff Gordon Ramsay would actually compliment, this isn't the place for you, and I don think they are trying to be. The food is fresh and the people are friendly. I'm not an exotic foodie so this place is A-OK by me. It's pricey for just coming in for one meal; but they have a $35 all day pass that would get you into here and the Excalibur buffet as many times as you want all day - if you are staying in the vicinity all day it's a good bargain to prepay for all of your meals. I take all of the bad reviews with a grain of salt. I've worked in the service industry for 10+ years... Everyone can't please everyone - there is nothing egregiously bad about this buffet.The worst buffet ever, don't do it! I usually read Yelp reviews prior however a friend decided to treat me and it was their last minute decision. Just say no! If you re staying at Luxor I recommend you eat somewhere else because the selection and quality of food is HORRIBLE! I sampled quite a few items and everything was bad. A lot of the food was cold, not cooked well and tasteless. There is no selection and it must be the world's smallest and most sorry excuse for a buffet!The name says it all, MORE BUFFET because you will be left feeling that there must be MORE than this buffet has to offer!The best thing to eat at this buffet was their ranch dressing.The best part of my night was when I grabbed 3 sugar cookies and stuck them in my tits and walked out.We always come here if we are on a family Vegas trip because the kids love the food. If I'm on an adult only trip I prefer the bayside buffet at Mandalay Bay. Only because it's classy and has comp drinks. Let me say beer and wine lol. Here at MORE the kids like the huge amount of breakfast food and the large selection of of different food that they have. Right now I have one kid eating waffles and breakfast potatoes. The oldest is eating seafood for breakfast. He has had sushi, crab legs, and shrimp. I had breakfast foods and before we leave I always have a salad.  They have really good salads here. The prices are good, but my meal is always comped here. Get MyVegas and take a lot of trips to Vegas and get your Mlife card upgraded. It helps when it comes to paying for meals. When we were at the counter to pay the guy even comped a few beers. They are super sweet here.

Review Text :
At last, a sushi bar that isn't a hot spot, and isn't completely devoid of atmosphere. It is the perfect balance -- clean, but comfortable, sophisticated, yet friendly. What's more, the food is EXCELLENT.I have been there three times so far, and I have yet to find complaint with the food. The sushi is fresh and fantastic. Hana orders whole fish, straight from the coast. The ahi I had was glossy and ruby red; the flavor delicate. It had the perfect texture, with just enough "give," so that one does not struggle with biting it, and not so soft that it lacks substance. It was also a generous portion, draped over a small, but flavorful rice ball.Their tempura has lovely and light batter, and it enrobes fresh, crisp veggies, and sweet, tender shrimp. The miso soup is also good, and they don't hold back on the goodies. For once, I found that tofu can have flavor!When I ordered the bento, it was filled with all sorts of treats! Some I could not even identify. I am embarrassed to say, I was well and truly stuffed, when I finished eating it all. Surprisingly, the prices are very reasonable! Nigiri goes for about $3-$5, maki about $5-$10, noodle dishes $80-$10, and entrees $12-$15. I have only been during lunch time, so I don't know if these change for dinner.That all said, since it is brand-spanking new, and its staff is still learning the ropes, Hana struggles a bit with service. Sometimes entrees come out poorly-timed. Sometimes you have to wait for your dishes to be cleared. You might get a bit thirsty, waiting for your refill.But it is worth it. It is so worth it. Check it out!So about 5 months ago I had a normal life, you know a dope little condo, a nice girlfriend, even a little pup, but what my life was really lacking, was a dopalicious sushi joint in my life and as if my eyelash wishes came true Hana appears, I can easily say its the second best sushi joint in Phoenix (right behind Yasu) and honestly if Hana could figure out a way to make there sushi rice a little more enjoyable I would easily pass the crown. There fish must be caught in Garanda Parks lakes thats how fresh it seems (I know horrible reference but they have great fish) and the statement BYOB is bob spelled with a y and who doesn't like bob (which will save you cash money son, plus there is something liberating about drinking 40's in public). So if you want to have ultra fresh sushi without all the garbage glam that most sushi places throw in your face, while drinking some steel reserve with a date who you are trying to convince that you once lived a normal life, than this place is perfect for you yo.What the heck am I missing here?  The rice again was ooey and gooey again on my last visit, sticking to the roof of my mouth and having a waxy feel about it  .... I guess some people like it that way?   I was hoping that it was just a fluke the first time but now also the second time.  Other people's review I trust give it more stars.  I just don't get it.The sushi is ok-good, not worthy of a 4 or 5 and if you're OK with crowded, noisy, bustling places then Hana is for you.  The staff is very nice and will be as accommodating as they possibly can. It is BYOB and they will keep your drinks chilled for you. However, it is not the perfect spot for an intimate dinner or first date. You will find yourself muffling your ears and trying to compete with the noise level from every table in the room. Unfortunately my party was seated next to a large table of inconsiderate, obnoxious, cackling chicks who for some reason felt the need to constantly scream WOO HOOO throughout the entire evening. Don't get me wrong I love seeing people have a great time but this was not cool at all. My ears are still ringing from all the screeching. So here is the low-down on what we had:Tempura - 2+  Bland at bestSquid Salad -  3+ Shrimp Tempura Roll - 3, Fell apart and gummySpicy Tuna - 3, so so.. Lacked the burn that I'm used toVolcano Roll - 2, Gobs of mayo.. Gag!Baked Green Muscle - 5+ very good.I just wish the Sushi was great enough for me to overlook all this petty crap but it just wasn't. Sorry.I had to reflect on our dining experience at Hana before writing a review.  We had great company while dining here and that certainly colors the experience as a whole.First thing, Hana is BYOB so either don't leave your beer sitting on the counter when you head out like I did or go with cool folks like Kevin H and Marian H who bring a six pack and are happy to share!After reflection I decided that Hana merits about 2.75 stars.  They are better than average but in some important ways they fall short.We did not have any sushi so consider this review for the dinners only.We started with miso soup.  It was very *(salads arrive)* good.  Marian and my wife Audrey were cold every time the ventilation kicked on so the soup was a *(server tries to take Audrey's soup before she is done, is politely rebuffed)* nice warm-up.We were about to start on our salads and *(Audrey and Kevin's shrimp which comes with the steak arrives)* the chef or manager (I'm not sure which) came over and offered to provide several dressing choices so that we could try different ones.  I went with the *(Kevin's steak arrives)* ginger dressing, although the miso dressing was nice as well.  The shrimp which comes with the steak was served nicely arranged on *(server asks if I am done with my salad)* a small plate with lemons, they tasted very *(Audrey's steak arrives)* fresh and delicious.  Marian and I each ordered a tempura dinner.  They arrived and were nice and hot.  The veggie assortment was *(rice bowls arrive)* very good and the shrimp was tender and flavorful.  I found the pieces of fish to be overdone and one bordered on chewy.  The tempura treatment here was good but heavier than most.Throughout the meal two things were occurring that detracted from the overall experience.  The blower would kick on and the cool air was focused against the wall and right on Audrey and Marian.  Kevin and I were cool on one side, warm on the other.  We jokingly discussed changing seats from time to time when we were done on one side and needed to warm up the other.  I suggest an 8 foot ladder and some tweaking of the vents would correct this issue.The food had no pace and toward the end of the meal it become clear that they wanted to turn our table.  Lingering over dessert was not a welcome option.  Water refills stopped toward the end of the meal.In summary:  the food was pretty good, the pace of the food and service was rushed and random, company was excellent and the atmosphere was warm//\\cold//\\warm//\\cold//\\warm//\\cold.Ate here months ago.  Was excited to finally find a Phoenix sushi venue, and one that also offered brown rice as a sub for sushi dishes (don't quote me on this however, since it has been many months and I may be recalling another venue).  One item did impress me, and that was the complimentary appetizer that was comprised of tempura'd chips with perhaps a squid salad topping (?)  I should have just ordered another serving of this!  Instead, I tried an Ao Yasai (mixed gourmet greens with ginger) and a sushi roll w/ brown rice, the latter I thought was price-y considering the very small portion given.  I was so unimpressed by its unexciting flavors that I don't even recall what kind of roll I tried!  Pretty sad, I know.  I told myself I wouldn't go back, but I would like to give Hana another try, perhaps for lunch and/or dinner with a group of friends and have apps and wine/sake!Oh hell no.I don't understand the hype. I was totaly grossed out. I love sushi but did not like this place at all. It was overpriced, the menu was limited and the fish was a little too fishy for my tastes. It was like a lot of the sushi places I visited in Japan - but it was NOT like the good ones.I know Hana is one of the most authentic sushi restaurants in Phoenix, but that doesn't mean EVERYTHING has to be covered in mayonaise, does it? I hate mayo. The Hana roll was supposed to be a "house specialty" but it was just about as special as the Shrimp roll at Safeway. The Hamachi Kama was a highlight, but might have been a bit over cooked. The tuna sashimi was chewy and rough. Ew! Sashimi should melt in your mouth, not take longer to take down than roadside beef jerky. Also - green tea in a can? I can get that at Lee Lee's market. Fresh brew it or gring it up in a bowl or something. No cans please.I DID dig all the punk rock lesbian servers. The contrast of small Asian men to big lezbot women was priceless.I have had good and bad experiences at Hana in the past, and overall, I like their sashimi choices, but last night was the final straw. The wait staff is very hit and miss, with most being fun and friendly but a few being the typical 'cooler than thou' hipster wanna-be types that seem to plague Central Phoenix restaurants these days. I can overlook the BYOB (which honestly I find annoying in a sushi/Japanese restaurant since I love an ice cold martini with raw fish) and the sometimes attitudey service, and even the ho-hum rolls offered (nothing special, really). But what I cannot overlook is the ridiculously overpriced items and the blatant overcharging. My partner and I were going to order the oysters, and when we were told it was $9 for 2 oysters we politely declined with more than a bit of amusement. 2 oysters, really? Durants, which has amazingly fresh oysters, presented incredibly, and is one of the priciest restaurants in the area charges $13 for a half dozen- in a far better atmosphere. Ok, so then I order the Chirashi bowl, which apparently is not on the menu but they will do it anyway. I always get the Chirashi as it is my favorite item at sushi restaurants, and Hana does a very nice one indeed- for $35!!! Of course you don't know this until AFTER you get the check since it's not listed anywhere. I understand that I ordered it and I should have asked, but honestly I have ordered this a hundred times from SF to LA to NY (and even at HANA before!!) and have NEVER seen it more than about $20-22. Locally, it goes for $19 at Stingray, and $17 at Sakana (which btw is much better). Anyway, I have never in my life complained about food prices before so it is a little weird having to write this, but I truly feel Hana is fleecing people and since they were the only game in the area for a long time, they think they can get away with it.  We'll see what happens now with Stingray opening up nearby, and Moira downtown, along with a few other newbies scheduled for openings in 2010. Competition is a great thing! Some advice for sushi lovers: it's a bit of a drive, but Sakana is still hands down the best sushi in town- with a full bar and dinner for two in the $50 range, including drinks.I think I have found my new favorite date night sushi joint.. Last week the illustrious David B.  was recommending Hana to the ole plus one and I .. being the adventurous couple we are ,we invited our sushi friend Paul and family to  join us to try somewhere new.. First Note : Hana is small groups are not their forte..although they nicely accommodated our large 7 person group.  After being seated we took in all the specials on the board and began making sushi plans .. Second Note  : Our waitress had a difficult time understanding our order, not sure if it was language barrier, ordering a little unusual , the larger party or what... daughter doesn't want any wasabi or garnishes on her sushi...  after getting order ins  , it wasn't long before some lovely  sushi began coming our way.  Unfortunate Waitress did not understand daughters order and it came with ta daa  onion garnishes .. the owner (?)  came out and rectified the situation with finesse..We ordered for hubster and I : Hana roll  a tasty roll with friend shrimp sticking up all over  good stuff, rainbow roll  clean and traditional,  Vegas roll , nice touch because it was fried but not doughy or overly  breaded like some places get it , and a tasty  hot volcano roll  , not the fave but still  a good roll, we also had tako salad our favorite extra at japanese restaurants , theirs is a sweet yet vinegary concoction  that me happy loved it.. Friend   Paully ordered  a seared maguro dinner that looked tasty.  All the food was refreshing and delicious  but here is where it went wrong  Third Note , traditionally in a restaurant when you have a big party of people done with their food  and they are staring at the wait staff and fidgeting with the empty plates and suck on the ice cubes you bring them the check ...guess our waitress did not get that memo... we sat and sat.. finally the womenfolk took the kids across the street for Mary Coyle ice cream to let the men wait in peace. Fourth Note, how do you negotiate the 20% gratuity already added in when the service wasn't up to par?   Well once again owner ? Lyn came to our rescue and rectified the situation .. Hats off to Lyn who did an outstanding job of smoothing over a bad situation.  Because of her we will go back and give Hana another try  just with a smaller group and not the same waitress. Oh and BTW  they use Sweet Republic for their ice cream .. got give that a try next time...SETS THE STANDARD FOR JAPANESE FOOD OUTSIDE JAPAN. _DON'T_ MISS IT.It's been a long time since my initial review of Hana. In fact it was one of my very first on Yelp. I opined on my five-points requirement to get on my sushi-worth-eating list, and those first visits did not fail to impress. I spoke about my personal scale of very good, excellent and life changing sushi. Indeed, Hana is always excellent, and i may say _usually_ life changing. Over the months Lori, Koji and family have shown me the the secrets of Japanese cuisine and the delight of specially-ordered ingredients, like:-- real Japanese Kobe beef.-- live ama ebi-- live scallops-- live giant clam-- daikon delight-- zaruten soba-- miso ramen-- monkfish pate (ankimo)-- oysters on the half shell-- bento box delight-- hamachi kama-- natto maki-- hawaiian walu sashimi-- shima mackerel-- wild salmonAnd that's just the specials. Hana SETS THE STANDARD for quality, every time in its-- Toro sashimi-- Fresh Salmon-- Maguro so red, i've heard it called beet red.-- Ika-- Tamago-- Seaweed Salad-- miso soupAnd if you're feeling adventurous, many Americanized-craziness dishes abound for your culinary quest:-- Mt. Fuji roll-- Volcano roll-- Pride roll-- Lobster roll-- Hana rollSERVICEhas matured into an approachable and almost joyous pride to be able to share their food with their customers. Restauranting can be such a gritty grind, but Koji, Lori and the team present their carefully chosen ingredients with love and passion every day. Besides the excellent food, it is that passion which brings me back night after night, week after week.I can see that despite my instructions against it, you all HAVE told your friends about Hana. Please stop spreading the news! There just isn't enough room for us all. LOL. Enjoy.P.S. Check out their website for social-network specials on Facebook and Foursquare. By the way, don't bother trying to oust me as Foursquare Mayor; it's a lost cause!What's raw, slick and makes you feel good all over? It's sushi! From trendy scenester food to its current mainstay presence, sushi has been a part of the dining scene for ages. Even with time this time spent, sushi is still very much exciting to enjoy.For me, Hana Japanese Eatery puts the amore in enamored and the fat into infatuated.With a solid menu of offerings and loads of daily specials there's plenty to keep things fresh and engaging. When I'm eating my way through the valley, almost 8 out of 10 Ill order the special when offered. In this experience Ive been able to try amazing off menu items that were seasonal or the chef was feeling whimsy that day.Not to whimsy but fully fun and interactive, Edamame ($3.95) is always a must for me. There's just something about biting into each pod and sucking the soy beans out that I find satisfying.Like something out of a dream, the sashimi, nigiri, and rolls were served on a small boat. This beautiful presentation just goes to show how attention to detail goes well beyond the food. Such things like wasabi get special attention, Hana's pickled version will make you quickly forget about the traditional paste variety. Putting the wasabi to good use, the Blue Fin ($20/$20) was ordered 2 ways, sashimi and seared, the first being my favorite, each bite almost felt like eating butter, that tender. Such favorites as Octopus ($10) and Crab Nigiri ($5) were as pretty as they were delicious.Loving rolls with contrast and crunch the Shrimp Tempura Roll ($8.50) filled both counts easily. However its special cousin, the Lobster Roll ($20), takes a California roll then is adorned with large pieces of battered quick fried lobster meat, no skimping on the good stuff here.Hot dishes on the specials menu are expertly prepared. Scallop Edamame ($10.95) takes the sweet tenderness of scallops, then is battered and rolled in soy beans and lightly fried. The texture of the buttery soy beans meshed well with the sweetness of the scallop, a must. More special menu love was felt with the sauteed Giant Clam with Scallops ($16.95). Tempura Udon ($9.95) was ordered off of the regular menu and let me tell you, those chewy noodles are simply addicting.Ive never heard the words Japanese and pizza in the same sentence before. So after our server described the Okonomiyaki ($18.95), it had to be ordered. More like a thick savory pancake in taste but the looks of a pizza, this was certainly a surprise by taste and by oddity. The top of the Okonomiyaki is sprinkled with bonito flakes which move and quiver when exposed to heat. So when it was sat down in front of me I couldn't help but stare at the movement. Yes, I was a little freaked out but how cool is that?Hana An Mitsu ($6.95) was the most perfect ending for the style of cooking. This refreshing dessert made up of aloe vera and was accompanied by oranges, blueberries & red bean paste, reminded me of an exotic fruit cocktail. If chewy and creamy intrigue you try the Ichigo Mochi Ice Cream ($4.95). The chewy rice mochi shell encapsulates your choice of ice cream, very different and tasty.Hana doesn't serve alcohol but feel free to bring your own wine, beer or sake, they wont charge you a corking fee, which makes that scallop even sweeter.I had the distinct honor of dining at Hana this past week under the special care of Lori, the owner.  I should preface this review by stating that I'm a travel and food writer who has traveled to more than 40 countries and all 7 continents....I'm a chef in Dallas...and I was in the top 5 on season 2 of MasterChef.  So the fact that my dinner at Hana was one of the best and most memorable dinners of my entire life should carry at least a bit of weight!  Phoenix, you are SO lucky to have this establishment.However, it wasn't the first time I had dined at Hana.  Scarcely 3 months before I had eaten sushi there with a local friend while passing through on my way to LA.  For her, Hana is the best place to get sushi in central Phoenix.  I had to admit, I was dubious about eating sushi in Phoenix, but the freshness and perfect presentation of the sashimi we ordered was stunning.  Still...for virtually all their regular customers, Hana is a sushi joint.My second experience was quite a bit different.  I was a guest of the owner, and she and her chefs took us through a 15 course menu that consisted of both strictly traditional Japanese presentations, and contemporary twists.  For more than 2 hours, the courses kept coming.They started with small bites...refreshingly simple, yet somehow complex, despite only 5 or 6 ingredients each.  One was a shooter on a base of Meyer lemon with monkfish liver, quail egg, bonito flake, and caviar.  Hot dishes soon followed...tempura lobster with a hot salted tea for dipping.  (It made me cry, it was so delicious.)  A custard of egg white and dashi broth that hid scallops and shrimp and crab at the bottom...so delicate it basically evaporated in my mouth.  (And I cried again.)There was no sushi on our table.  That doesn't mean there wasn't raw fish!  A mackerel was brought to the table, and we plucked off juicy delicate morsels of incredibly fresh fish.  (It's eyes were so clear it appeared to be looking around the room at me.)  Once we had finished, they whisked the skeleton off to the deep fryer, and returned the crispy bones for us to munch on.The fact that the chefs at Nana have the skill and ability to produce this kind of world-class meal just blows my mind, when I formerly thought of it as a mere sushi bar.  And the fact that it is BYOB...I thought I had died and gone to heaven.So here's what YOU need to do, next time you're ready for some food that will blow your mind:Walk into Nana.Ask for Lori, the owner.Tell Lori that Ben Starr sent you.Tell Lori how much you'd like to spend on dinner, whether that's $20 or $200.Tell Lori to show you something amazing.Forget about the menu.  Let the experts decide for you.  Lori will make sure you go home full of food that you will dream about that night, and tell friends about the next day.  Americans are not accustomed to dining this way, which is a shame.  There is a vast trove of knowledge, skill, and creativity hiding in the Hana kitchen.  It would be a crime to go there and order a California roll!I am still resonating with the memory of this meal.Ever since I have moved back from Japan I have been looking for some place that feels and tastes like home. Because, that is what Japan was for me. It was home. I loved the people and the culture. The way the earth and the ocean offer the other balance there. The night life and let us not forget ever, the food. Well Hana is not it... :PBut it is still pretty damn good. I love coming here with my mom. I am always trying to push her to eat something new! She is typical fraidy cat and wont hardly touch sashimi which is delicious here. One piece and she's out. I have ordered tuna tataki here (one of my favourite meals in the world) but I don't think it is on the menu, and for me they over sear the fish. I like it just lightly fire kissed. The rolls here are pretty typical. Avocado and cream cheese to satisfy my mother and cover up any real flavor of the fish. The miso is really very good here. Its always hit or miss with miso in the states... Usually extremely too salty, but here has always been good. The tempura platters are shazaam! Fun and delicioso. In conclusion, i suggest you give it a try. Don't forget to bring your own booze, an empty tummy, and an open mind!Hana has without a doubt the best sushi I have ever had. I was blown away at how good it was. The Salmon Sashimi was so fresh and delicious! Every roll we ordered was just mouth watering goodness. Only complaint is that the Edamame is served cold, I've never been a fan of that. Not even a big deal.This quaint little neighborhood sushi bar has charm that stretches for days. Our group of 4 came here Friday night for dinner and business was bustling. We had to wait around 15 minutes for a table which wasn't so bad considering how busy it was.The menu is very stream lined but the focus is still always dedicated to the freshness and quality of their sushi. We enjoyed salmon sashimi and uni sashimi. The spicy tuna roll was delightful and the spiciness did not overcome the fresh flavor of the tuna. One of my favorites, unagi nigiri, did not disappoint! We definitely plan to return here. Our go-to will most likely be the scallop dynamite, which our friends ordered and we tried and loved. The uni oyster shooters were fun and yummy. It's a great way to introduce people who don't usually eat uni to enjoy the unique melt in your mouth texture. I'm slowly starting to enjoy uni since we order it so much. I think I could get others addicted to it too!

Review Text :
What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas right? But I have to share a secret with you and it's OK to tell your friends.  On nearly the top floor of the Binion's Casino and Hotel you can find a wonderful steak house in the heart of downtown Vegas.  Sure, you can go to another steak house du jour along the strip and be treated like a piece of meat or you can come here and enjoy one.When the elevator door opens on floor SH (Steak House), prepare to step into a time machine whisking you back to the early days of Vegas.  A maitre d', classic dark dimly lit decor and red vinyl booths will welcome you.  The Prime Rib was delicious and the Caesar salad was yummy.  My only suggestion for improvement was the dinner rolls were a bit dry.  Other then that, the Binion's Steakhouse was simply a classic experience and a nice way to escape the crowds.The glass elevator ride on the way up presents a unique experience and a nice view of the Stratosphere and some parts of the Vegas Strip. This, along with attentive service and classic steakhouse ambiance promises a great meal. I was disappointed.While the lobster bisque had some nice lobster chunks, the bisque's texture was gritty. I ordered the Filet Mignon (8oz for $36.95) crusted with bleu cheese for an extra few bucks to be medium rare but I received it overcooked. It was more medium/medium well than medium rare. A third of it was stringy and chewy. The bleu cheese crust well-complimented the steak but the green beans that accompanied the entree tasted watery. I expected more.[3.5 stars]Vegas was packed...with the strip looking like the perfect-feeding/multiplication-ground for a zombiepocalyse that emergency measures were immediately taken to get both the lady and I out...QUICK...before disaster strikes. So zipping away from the strip, she immediately asked where we were headed. GOOD OLD VEGAS was my immediate reply. Pulling her trusty iPhone out, she started looking at destinations to check out. Five minutes later, we were keen on Binion's Ranch Steakhouse as it promised "great service with a great view over good food".The parking lot was unsurprisingly empty and the old-Vegas almost-prehistoric feel permeated the air. Fine...fine...it wasn't exactly PREHISTORIC but definitely a drop (not a leap) back in time. It was a feeling similar to staring at a much-beloved-386 computer (if you're even old enough to know this) after using and getting accustomed to a spiffy-oh-so-hot-and-bank-breaking Alienware or MacBook Pro for several years. Yet, seeing a 386 computer once again doesn't mean I would back away. Rather, just like I used to grab my little box of 5" floppy disks in anticipation to stuff it into the floppy drives to begin playing DotT (Day of the Tentacle - and if you remember and have played this game...you immediately get an additional Yelp fan who will read and UFC your freaking reviews), I held the lady's hand and eagerly made our way through stale-tobacco-scented corridors to the elevator that would port us up and back in time.We reached and entered the elevator without seeing a single soul. As the ascent began, the zombiepocalypse image returned. Crap, did they attack old Vegas first and we just stupidly volunteered to become fresh ingredients in their gruesome-human-buffet? GREAT...@#*&^$*&@^#!!!!!! Elevator door opens and we walk right out to see...a cool-demeanor-well-dressed-gentleman with a smile on his face that immediately implied no such harm has descended upon this area - yet. Of course, that reassuring welcome and asking if we had reservations and such immediately removed all the zombie crap in my mind and refocused my attention to this...nostalgic feeling. Where are we? I almost thought I had grey hair with a backed so hunched that complimented a croaking voice. (Ok, just kidding, I should describe something like Elvis instead...).Our table overlooked the city in the evening lights. Although, I can't say it was mesmerizing or romantic in the least, we did somewhat enjoy the difference and spent some time pointing and figuring out the area while discussing what it probably was like 30 years ago.Service was spectacular...and very accommodating. My lady has certain refined preferences with her vegetables and meat (unlike the recycling/food-processing plant that I am that eats everything up and then complains after as necessary) and our server made sure every single part of it was met.The food wasn't as spectacular as their service and fell in the "decent" category. Both the New York and Rib-eye steaks came out done exactly the way we wanted them cooked...the former being medium well and the latter completely alive for the blood craving diner. Steaks were under-salted but that is not an issue in my books as a little toying with the salt dispenser on the table immediately got it exactly to the requirements of our differing palettes. The overall experience was decent and I would recommend a visit if you (a) want to get away from the overwhelming crowds on the strip; (b) crave a decent steak; (c) want to view old Vegas from atop a building without getting a room; or (d) want to port back to a different era.Just on the name alone I have to give it 4 stars.  Add the great food and service and it is a total winner.  I have been here more than a few times and always enjoy my visits.  The view of the mountains is outstanding and the service was perfect.  I had a rib eye steak that was cooked to perfection and as a starter had their version of French onion soup.  Very good.  History 101.  When this was owned by the Binion family all the beef that was served was raised on their ranch.  I sometimes wish for the good old days of Las Vegas knowing they will never return.  But the vibe is still here.

Review Text :
I'll be the first to admit that when it comes to food I have a little bit of OCD. I live to eat and plan my day accordingly. When my coworker suggests we go to Nora's Wine Bar for lunch, I'm on their website at 9:30 AM plotting carefully what I'm going to order, salivating over the delicious list of food. I came in with mind made up - the lamb chops ($12.50) or the grilled chicken thighs ($9.50). We show up and not only is the menu ridiculous (a leather menu?!), but it has no descriptions and it's COMPLETELY different from the website menu found here (http://www.noraswinebar.com/lunch.pdf ). Hey Nora's, we're in the internet age - keep your website up to date!I settled on the ribeye ($17), my coworkers got the chicken milanese and the salmon with pasta. We started with some bacon wrapped dates. Dates were tasty but can't compete with FireFly. Salmon eating coworker seemed happy, chicken eating coworker was disappointed (the chicken milanese at regular nora's is WAY better), and my ribeye was fabulous. I was pretty bummed when they showed up with diced up ribeye, but it was legit. It was cooked medium-rare as requested (no easy feat on diced meat) and I was happy with the microgreen salad despite how heavy on the dill it was. A delicious filling lunch, but for $17 it should be!They'd get 4 stars for the tasty ribeye, but the service was atrocious! The restaurant was packed and they had 1 waiter. Ridiculously under staffed. I look forward to trying them again - hopefully they hire some more staff in the meantime and fix their website !

Review Text :
I thought the burgers and drinks here were delicious.  They have specialty burgers that are sorted by "country," which mostly meant there was some type of special cheese/ingredient that classified it that way.Anyways, the burgers were juicy and very satisfying, and not that overpriced considering this is Vegas.  The drinks, on the other hand, were very expensive but quite good, including 1 watermelon flavored martini that I don't remember the name of.  If you stay at Harrah's or any of their hotels, they usually give you a coupon here, which is why we came.  Glad we did!Don't get fooled by the Trio of fries!!!If i see a fries sampler, i always want to get all of them. It said on the menu- waffle fries, steak fries and petit fries. You would think petit fries would be shoestrings (a neighbor made the same mistake), but they were just mini waffle fries. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/AjWFFZN8KwyqJzzi0DyEsw?select=F4NLspbB1o4xetDmIEKmXQ. You're better off just ordering two different kinds. We ended up too full and not even finishing half of the trio order. Good to share though between 4 people or more. I got the signature burger Le Paris. Comes with brie, caramelized onions and bacon. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/AjWFFZN8KwyqJzzi0DyEsw?select=5ZAFIRT5zqm6FeTlTH-9zg Tony got the Le Blue http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/AjWFFZN8KwyqJzzi0DyEsw?select=t3WtvkSrPOn7tGN-TZwrLw with blue cheese, avo and bacon. The burgers were decent, but at 12 bucks each, i wanted Uhmaaazzing and they were not. The hefty burger patty was perfectly round and flattened, but i like my hamburger kind of mishapen so you get those nice charred marks around the edges. Service was friendly, everything tasted ok, but i wasn't wowed enough to add to my vegas favorites. Inside the Paris Hotel. Buddies: please chime in on your best burger in vegas!Came here for dinner and left disappointed. It was a 15 minute wait to be seated which didn't bother me, but there were plenty of open tables and booths. We ended up being seated right near the entrance in front of the window. After asking to be moved to one of the other open tables we were told it would be a longer wait. WTH??? Our server was great, but running around taking care of too many tables at once, so I guess they were short staffed. I ordered the "Chopped Salad" priced at $13 and it had chopped romaine and iceberg lettuce, salami, cheese, tomatoes, avocados, cucumbers, celery and croutons. I asked that the red bell pepper and Italian dressing be left out. I wanted just extra blue cheese dressing, but my salad was tossed in the Italian dressing anyway and still had blue cheese dressing on it. I don't have an issue with the cost if the salad since it was a nice portion and had a lot of yummy sounding things in it, but all I tasted was a big pile of chunky bitter blue cheese, celery and really gross Italian dressing. Hubby had an overpriced $22 burger combo and said the burger tased frozen. The peanut butter shake he got I shared with him and that was actually good. I would just skip this place and go down the street to Tacos El Gordo!This place was good, not great. That being said, I did end up going back in the same weekend lol. I think my expectations were too high, I was expecting  one of those gourmet burger places that had really high quality food and that's just not this place. Unfortunately, the fries and onion rings are a frozen product ;( The service was average, the girls are busy and working lots of tables so I get it. The positive? My Le' Paris burger was delicious!! It had Brie cheese, carmelized onions and bacon on it, the combination of those flavors was awesome!! I would probably go back for a quick bite without a wait.My opinion is that this is an older Vegas restaurant that used to be poppin' and now it's lost some of that hotness that's so important in this city! I would guess that this gets a makeover into a different restaurant in the near future! MY GO-TO: Le'Paris Burger!We usually end up here for a late lunch. The menu has changed a little bit, but most of the expensive burgers and salads remain. The beer list is decent but leans towards the mainstream. Once you get over the fact that you just shelled out $15 for a burger with Gruyere and caramelized onions and it didn't even come with fries you'll still enjoy the food.Service varies. I've had great servers, and I've had ones that aren't too swift. But the eye candy is great, and there's sports from every angle. The milkshakes with booze are fun, too.It is easy to miss this early adopter to the "gourmet" burger craze currently in full swing. Burger Brassiere is located in the walkway that connects the Bally's and Paris hotels. While actually closer in proximity to Bally's, it is in fact part of the Paris property.   it is as much a sports bar as anything with a large bar area booth seating throughout the restaurant.  You are never out of TV view and there is always a game playing on the flat screens. I like Burger Brasserie for a few reasons, they do have a quality burger and some clever sides at a reasonable price, they have a beverage HH everyday from 4-7, and they offer discounts to total rewards members. The biggest complaint is just the noise level and the fact they can get very busy to the point of it effecting service.Anyhow it is a great place to grab a draft and a burger and enjoy a game. In my opinion it beats the sports book at both Bally's and Paris. I have been several times over the years and it's been a while. My last visit recently was a pleasant reminder that they do a reasonably good job of the sports bar theme with some very nice comfort food. I mixed it up this time and ordered the very rich and decadent  French Onion Burgercaramelized onions, gruyère gratinée.  It comes dry so the condiments are up to you.The burger was cooked perfectly and the bun was pillowy soft. A touch of Dijon Mustard and this puppy rocked. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/burger-brasserie-las-vegas#r_s8PTg5rBhtgUoGTZZwGAhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/burger-brasserie-las-vegas#nbckoyMUu_oHOtiWLOXziQThe cheesebuger mac n' cheese bites are sinful to be sure, and a great appetizer to share. They are filling and pack a calorie punch so be prepared. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/burger-brasserie-las-vegas#VCe6IjVG4RZVXkdidCyV_AI will definitively go back for a spot to watch that game in an inviting, quality venue like BB every time. Did  I mention they are pretty consistent? Well they are and kudos for that, see you again BB.

I am here every week now.Walk in. Don't look at the menu yet. Wait. You just looked! Don't be impatient, I understand the urge. We get anxious when we're about to eat delicious carbs. Walk up to the counter and ask for your free sample. They'll slather some butter on it if you want to get crazy. YUM. My favorites are Cinnamon Swirl, Pumpkin Chocolate Chip, Cinnaburst, and Hummus Wheat. They have a list of their daily breads baked for each day of the week. These are available as whole loaves. You can also customize any sandwich.The staff is very friendly. If you buy a loaf and want it sliced up and bagged, just ask. This location has been giving a free giant, and I mean GIANT cookie with your Yelp check-in. They're nice and soft, YUM. Even more sugary carbs. My son loves when I pack Great Harvest bread in his lunchbox. I don't blame him, so I stop in here every week now. Completely worth it.We have been here several times and this is a good place but unfortunately like most bakeries like this one in town, for some reason they put cinnamon in a lot of their breads which means I cannot try it.Some people are lucky and some are not.  I got the not card on the cinnamon...The sandwiches are very good and they do have some bread I can have.We did ask if they use NON GMO ingredients and one worker said she did not know and the other said, 'Uhm, yes we do use NON GMO ingredients.I have not verified this so if you go here you may want to ask.  They do not advertise anywhere in the place about organic ingredients or NON GMO, so we found it odd they would say they do and not have it posted anywhere.Obviously GMOs do not stop people from eating things they should not and like I said this place has never disappointed, it would just be good to know that the employees working there have a clue as to what they are serving you and not have to guess.This is still a good place and you should seek them out if you have never been here.

Haha! I didn't understand why a lot of people kept saying to me,"Breakfast of champions!" as I walked out of here with my early morning breakfast at McCarran airport.With airport food, it's always a fine balance between price and getting something edible. In the end, my Chinese Thrift Gene allowed me to get a plate of wings for a calorie laden breakfastNot bad for chain food and the crispy warm wings assuaged some hunger pangs. l like the the dips tooThere was an area of seating nearby, which was in a less hectic part of Terminal B, so a nice place to start your day off with an early flight

Restaurant name  Focaccia Fiorentina
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
I love this place. I wish they had dinner hours. It's a little loud. But other than that, it's by far my favorite place to eat lunch in the heart of downtown. It's so consistently good. I believe it's family-owned and as such nothing has changed in years, which is a wonderful thing. I highly recommend the Vodka and the Fiorentina and the mushroom-sauced daily special when they have it. And the manicotti. And the calzone. Oh, you dirty little calzone... It is what it is and what it is is sooooo good.For some reason, I always worry that 3-stars is a bad thing. It's not, really. Just an indication that it's good but not great. Foccacia Fiorentina represents this philosophy, to me. While I've not had a bad pizza here, they do require thinking ahead enough to call in my order before I walk over, thus maximizing my lunch hour. But if I'm just walking around looking for something to jump out at me, not such a good thing. Such was the case for my most recent visit to FF. Pressed for time, I decided on two pasta dishes--one a creamy cheese and mushroom sauce, the other a balsamic vinegar mixed with fresh basil, tomatoes and mozzarella. Individually, they sound very good. But the reality fell short of my expectations. Maybe if I'd gotten them in separate containers it would have felt differently about my meal. I'll stick to pizzas in the future.Focaccia Fiorentina, it sounds like a string of italian curse words but it tastes like a gift from the heavens...I went down here with Melissa because I had purchased a $2 coupon from that online place (wink wink) that let us buy $35 worth of food for only $10. Needless to say, after all the restrictions of the coupon (minimum 2 people, dine-in only), we had enough food for an italian army! Still, it only cost $10 and I was hungry!I got the #3 sandwich which had Genoa Salami, Moz, Tomatoes, on (you guessed it) Focaccia bread (pardon my french, er... italian). She got the #6 which had Turkey, and a bunch of other stuff that I can't remember.  We also ordered the Penne (something) Vodka.  You know you're an alcoholic when all you remember is the vodka part! Oh, and a large greek salad. Finally, we passed our $35 minimum and we sat down with all this food.People were staring at us all hateful like we stole this food from ethiopians or something! Geez! I didn't know there was a law against ordering this much food. We weren't going to eat it all there, I promise! We got boxes! Yes, Plural!The food was great, the lady that greeted us, not so much. We must have interrupted her break, because she was giving me the stink eye. Yes, can I order the #3? Ugh! Did you see that?!?!Why is it that Italians have the best of everything? The tastiest sandwiches, the tastiest pasta, the tastiest bread, the tastiest men... ahem, sorry. got carried away.  But its true! Everything about italy is awesome. Pizza! Anyway, this place has pizzas too. Maybe next time!

Restaurant name  Teriyaki Madness
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Conveniently located in the same parking lot as 24hr Fitness.  This Teriyaki Madness is perfect for your post workout meal. If you're at the gym and dreading that PWO shake, then this TMAD is perfect for you.  Besides, whole foods is a lot better than shakes anyway.  Trust me, whole foods will bring density to your muscles.  Like all other TMAD's, this one has everything chicken breast. Even their katsu is made out of chicken breast, not minced chicken.  Their teriyaki chicken is flavorful, but I usually opt for their chicken breast by itself, with vegetables, or with brown rice. My most recent visit was with Terri Elite and we shared a chicken breast w/veggies.  The meal was filling and because we didn't have the sauce, it was plain.  But remember, we chose to eat it that way. Want flavor? Have their chicken with the sauce. I also had the benefit of talking to the owner, Dean, a couple of weeks ago. He's very professional, cares about his business, and most importantly, his customers.  I'm a fan of TMAD's and each location has it's perks. When it comes to taste and service, I still think the location off Craig Road is the best.  When it comes to size of the restaurant, the Centennial location wins.  When it comes to convenience from one of my gyms, this one takes it.  My only issue is that this TMAD is one of their smaller restaurants.  It's a good thing that they weren't too busy when we ate here.  They were also out or didn't have broccoli in stock.  TIP's:  -Gym goers get a discount.  I keep forgetting this.  But still think that the cashiers should ask us, especially when it's obvious that we just came from the gym. -Order ahead if you're in a rush or if you are requesting brown rice. -This place also serves salmon

Review Text :
There's a lot to love about the Hookah Lounge and Cafe once you get past it's tough exterior shell. (Seriously close one eye on the drive up the hill no matter which way you go and avoid looking around too closely as you go inside. Once through the door, eyes open. Take it all in.) [1] But let's be honest, a lot of things have a tough exterior and delicious insides. M&MsStar FruitCornucopias the list goes onI suggest you start your evening in the bar area. The Friday I was there, there were some inexpensive drink specials, and the space is so large that even when I arrived around 6 it hadn't filled up. You're not going to get the full experience sitting at the bar, so after a bev or two (you can take unfinished drinks with) walk over to the cafe part. There's another bar (win!) and a smattering of tables. The menu has a number of options sure to please anyone's propensity for Mediterranean. I got the shaved lamb plate and couldn't polish it off, it's seriously huge. Your meal will start with some pita and Zatar (look it up) which is an uber authentic way to get things going. Didn't stay for the hookah or for the belly dancing. I get super uncomfortable when those ladies get close. Personal space please, personal space. [1] Don't actually close one eye. That would be dangerous. Unless you're trained.

Sweet and Pungent shrimp (Aromatic) is simply Amazing! I have not been able to locate a Chinese Cantonese style restaurant here in Vegas that has it! I have to get my fill of it when I am visiting Los Angeles! Not anymore, now I can have it anytime I want!Everything was marvelous, the won ton soup, the almond chicken, and moo goo gai pan! There chicken is top notch, all white meat and big generous pieces of it!The service is Fantastic!This was my first time and certainly will not be my last!Mmmmmmm I am just about ready for a few more of those mouth Orgasms!I finally found a Chinese restaurant that has decent, quality food. If you like eggplant, you must try the spicy eggplant dinner! The eggplant is cut in chunks with noodles and some vegetables. It has a great flavor; I was pleasantly surprised.Another great entree we enjoyed during this meal was chicken egg foo young and beef and snow peas. The egg foo young consisted of thick pieces of egg omelets with chicken in a tasty sauce topped with chives. The beef and snow peas entree consisted of a lot of fresh snow peas, onion, watercress, and carrot. Although the food preparation is fairly quick, the table-side service (e.g., refills of hot tea, more napkins, check) is slow. When we were in, only one server was on the floor handling everyone in the small restaurant dining area. Regardless, she was nice and the atmosphere was comfortable, clean, and nicely decorated. This complemented the dine-in food experience.I will be back - next time for take-out!

Review Text :
Perhaps it's just me. Perhaps I confuse easily. I mean, I could never even finish a TV Guide crossword. But the layout at Foodbar is a little freakish. ORDER HERE. PAY HERE. It's an upscale cafeteria style, that looks oh so cool and stylish but navigates like a maze and left me feeling like the dorky high school guy who wants to sit with the jocks but ends up with audio visual club. I wasn't quite sure where to go, it's very clean and modern, yet quite cluttered. The curried chicken salad was delicious as was the buttermilk chicken salad. Were they expensive? Well, it's a new Scottsdale restaurant, so yes, and I wasn't surprised. But $8 for a little dish of chicken salad? Hmmm. The parmesan risotto cakes were also good and came with a field green salad. Ham and brie baquette, well, not too inventive and quite dry and hard. The food is delivered to the table. When ours arrived, the server didn't have silverware for us. Oh? We're supposed to get it? Didn't know. Hate that. All in all, it was OK. Worth checking out again. At least now, I might know where to walk, stand and pick up my silverware and the other kids won't make fun of me!

Review Text :
Here's my recipe for a perfect Vegas trip: Three parts obscenely cheap to one part ludicrously expensive. The $10.99 champagne brunch at Paradise Buffet is the perfect flavor for the obscenely cheap part of that recipe. Are there even cheaper brunch buffets to be found in the City of Sin? I'm sure there are, but this is the perfect three star buffet for me. For the most part, it's what you'd expect from an $11 buffet - some of the stuff sucks, some of it is okay, the bacon was dishearteningly bad, but the prime rib was surprisingly delicious. They do tout themselves as a "seafood" buffet, but... that seafood wasn't looking too hot, so I stuck to the carving station.And, of course it wouldn't be called a champagne brunch without the champagne.... that they bring to you in these awesome plastic champagne glasses (not flutes, but the older saucer lookin' ones). And, boy do they keep it comin'.... and comin'... and comin'. It's not one of those places that proudly declares endless champagne and then a waitress is nowhere to be found. No sir. You'll be lucky if you EVER see the bottom of that little plastic champagne glass here.All of this in the lush, dark, tropical setting of The Paradise Buffet. A-OK through and through.Now I'm not a buffet kind of person, but I wound up here this evening. Now why people would go here baffles me. The servers in the front are rude. No hello, hi, please, thank you, or you're welcomes from the lady Shirley. I felt like I was in a cattle herd waiting in the line and getting my way to the front. Lucky for me I had great company so I put up with it.We got seated and went up to the buffet. This was the smallest buffet selection I have ever seen. (which I guess could be good because the food was awful.) I took a little bit of the buttered noodles which were so hard and crispy. nothing like a flimsy noodle should be. The beef in the asian dishes was extra chewy. I sampled some of the taco meat, mexican rice, and beans mixed all together on my plate and got a piece of plastic in my mouth. yes, you read right. PLASTIC in my food. I was instantly turned off from anything else. In order to please my party I ate a slice of pineapple, some cottage cheese, and the wimpy salad bar. As for dessert in the ice cream section they give you warm bowls. it melted my poor vanilla ice cream into soup.This place just left me disgusted and sick to my stomach. That is hard to do but they sure did it.Thanks paradise buffet. I will not be returning and you can keep your plastic with your rude employee's.

Review Text :
Stay away.  That's all I can really say.  My mistake was not reading all the other yelp reviews before trying this place, otherwise I would have just said no.Looks can be deceiving and this place is pretty busy with large parties taking over the tables.  Not only is there a regular menu, but if you look around, you'll see pictures with numbers posted on the wall.  Good luck trying to find out what they are because they are listed on the menu and there's no pricing.  When we asked a waitress about a particular picture on the wall, all she could really say about it was that it was fish.  (Uh, we could tell that it was fish, we wanted to know what kind of sauce or how it was cooked!)In the beginning, the wait staff was on us to order but since we were taking so long, it's as if we were forgotten.  (How could they miss us with their bright yellow menus still in front of us?)After passing on their expensive pho ($6.99 to $7.99), I chose the Com Ga Hai Nam (Hai Nam style chicken with seasoned rice) for $8.99.  Initially, I had seen an entrée version of this dish and was going to inquire about it, but since I wanted the seasoned rice, I chose to go with this option.  The Big F is a big fan of Com Bo Kho (Beef stew with steamed rice) for $7.99, but usually sees it served with a French roll instead of rice.  As we waited for our food to arrive, the wait staff at a nearby table was attracting my attention.  Although I couldn't hear what they were saying, their actions were speaking louder than their words.  They were talking about clearing a table and apparently the previous diners left their barely touched strawberry shake on the table.  I'm not sure what the busboy did with that shake, but he sure didn't toss it into the garbage right away like he should have.  What really bothered us was the plate of pho garnishes that were returned to the kitchen for further use.  (How do I know he did that?  Well, he had a cleaning cart with a garbage can attached to it and he dumped all the other garbage in there.  But he made a point of taking that plate of garnishes and bringing it back to the kitchen.  That looks suspicious to me.)When my plate of Hainamese chicken arrived, it looked awful.  (Check the photos out for yourself!)  First off, it looked like leftover chicken all thrown on a plate and covered with scallions, ginger, and cilantro so I couldn't see the banged up chicken underneath.  And there was no skin left on my chicken!  Part of the dish is the tasty skin, and it looked like they gave me the healthy version!  Once I got past how little chicken I got, I noticed something else was wrong.  Uh, where is my seasoned rice?  There's a huge ball of white steamed rice on my plate and the seasoned rice is half the dish!  When I asked the waiter about it, he said they ran out of the seasoned rice.  When I explained that was why I ordered the dish, he went to the back to the kitchen.  He came back reaffirming that they did indeed run out of seasoned rice and he would give me a discount on the dish.  I was hungry, so I ate what I had in front of me.  It was far from special.The Big F's beef stew was just okay, and he's had a lot of the stew in other places.  He was initially turned off because it didn't have the same color that he was used to.  He pointed out that there was a lot of MSG in it too.  I also saw him pour soy sauce in it, so I knew that it was not hitting his taste buds.When we went up to pay, I noticed they didn't give me any discount.  I had to ask the waiter about it, and he took $2 off the total bill.  (At least he did that!)In the end, bad food with average service and suspicious kitchen practices.  Although they offered a few unique family dinner options, you won't see us walking through these doors again any time soon.  Keep on driving, there are plenty of other better Vietnamese restaurants along Spring Mountain.Cash only.Update: After posting this review, someone contacted me saying their wife worked here part-time.  He mentioned that they do not resell the smoothies, but they do reuse the pho condiments since they are a bit expensive.  The last I checked, bean sprouts and limes were not expensive.NOTE: I'm only reviewing this place based on what I heard and experienced. I didn't get a chance to eat here, but I do have an AWESOME story to tell...You know wassup..after the club..where do you usually hit up?! The spot that's open 24 hours or hella late. In San Diego, it's usually Denny's for me. I have many memories from there (good and bad), but mostly good. =)In Vegas...it was "Pho Little Saigon" for us! Now..I have been to establishments for pho post-clubbing and it is always PACKED full of asians. We sure love our pho! Usually, it is the go-to spot to sober up and grab some good eats, even though everything does taste good under the influence of alchy.Half drunk and feet in major pain from the shitty heels that I wore, I dashed to use the restroom while everyone was seating. Again, this place was practically empty and wow so was the restroom. Very rare for a female. Oh! Joy! I get to pick my own stall! The BIG one! I do my bizz and I noticed the cool electronic hand towel machine. Wait..no paper towels are coming out. This is automatic and sensored?! Is it broken?! Oh wait..a light on the bottom right was visible so I do a circular wave and WABAAM...paper towels pop out! Woohoo! Pretty awesome feeling when you're typsy!Next thing you know another girl (from the club I assumed) walks in slightly typsy as well and was about to get paper towels and I noticed she was having a difficult time getting the paper towels to come out.  Feeling like an "expert" by now, I showed her how to operate the machine and in amazement she was pretty impressed that I was able to figure it out and she couldn't. She kinda felt dumb. haha So..my head was kinda getting slightly big at this moment and we both were about to depart the restroom and as I was exiting I went straight out the door into the MENS RESTROOM!! Well..ALMOST! Oh man! I stopped just in the knick of time and she looks at me and we both laugh uncontrollably! I didn't feel so smart anymore and she didn't feel so dumb. =/Head over to where my group was and told my little story and all were amused or from what I recall at least. Wasn't slightly hungry since I ate prior to clubbing, which wasn't very long since I couldn't groove much to the music due to my CRAPTASTIC shoes! Ugh! Anywhoo, I noticed poor Melly Su was somewhat enjoying her soup until she accidentally spilled it on her legs..SUPER HOT..like boiling HOT! I only touched the bowl, and it was waaay toooo HOT!! No bueno. I think that may have woke/sobered her up though!What the PHO?! I know. These pho jokes are getting old, but I had to slip one in there. It's kinda like tradition. Anywhoo...No mmm's or ahhhh's from the group of friends so I thought maybe it was just A-OK. Soup is just soup sometimes. Oh ya..I also recall Melly Su telling my pal, "Chris-Chan" to eat her burnt eggroll. haha! It seriously was beyond burnt! As typsy as I was..I even knew it wouldn't taste good. Who you foolin' "Little Saigon" ??? GHETTOO!!The End.**Okay..so maybe not an AWESOME story. Maybe it would sound better under the influence??? Oh well..still worthy of a review right?! heheThere is little doubt that this is the best Pho restaurant in Las Vegas. I think the reason why there are a lot of bad reviews here on yelp is because  a lot of Pho restaurants on Spring Mountain  have the word "SAIGON" in their title. There is "Pho old SAIGON", "Pho SAIGON 8", " Pho SAIGON" "Pho Huong SAIGON" "Pho Vietnam SAIGON", and even another "Pho Little Saigon" that is an unrelated restaurant. .  I think most the people are confusing this place for another restaurant because there is no way you could dislike the food from here. Everyone who follows my weird and profanity filled reviews knows that my favorite food in the world is Miso Ramen.  The Pho at PHO LITTLE SAIGON is the only Pho in the world which I would eat over Ramen on occasion.  Obviously, I would still rather go to a place like "Anime Ramen" where everyone knows your name after only your 1st visit, and your bowl of noodles practically comes with a show + entertainment....but  sometimes I'm just in the mood for cilantro and a clear soup.I recommend everyone to try the Rare Steak Pho.  They use a very high quality cut of steak. I think it might be petite sirloin because it was extremely soft tender and just melted in your mouth. It almost had the texture of Filet Mignon. What I really liked was how the steak  was blood red. They don't even cook it, they just poor the hot soup over the meat and serve immediately. The broth is crystal clear and clean. It looks like the water off the coast of Hawaii because you could see clear down to the bottom.  The top of the broth is full of natural oils. These oils are common in soups where you had to boil bones for over 20 hours. They are purely natural and are a great visual indication of the high quality.They use Red Onions instead of generic onions! Red onions make the Pho taste so much better than the regular brown onions. They are definitely not cheap here. You get over 1/2 a pound of free bean sprouts and basil. You ask for extra limes and they literally hand you the whole lime(and it's a giant lime).  Most places like "Pho So 1" and "Pho Kim Long" give you half of even a half of a lime wedge.  If you ask for extra onions, they literally slice the whole onion and give you the whole thing. The service was very quick and fast. I think it's worth mentioning that they are Cash Only. So don't blow all your cash at the casino..save some of it and bring it here. It is also worth mentioning that they are open 24 hours/ 7 days a week. From now on, this is the only Pho restaurant I would ever go to in Las Vegas. Not only is the food great, but you don't have to sit next to the typical drunk-degenerate-immature Vegas Club Douche like at  "Pho Kim Long". And you don't have to be ignored and treated like crap like at "Pho So 1". PHO LITTLE SAIGON also better fits my lifestyle. It's open 24 hours, it's atmosphere is more quite and relaxing, and the service is alright by me!COCKROACHES IN MY FUCKING SOUP! Stay away, I'm seriously fucking sick to my stomach right now. They are still trying to charge me even after I showed them it floating in my soup, mind you I've been eating it already. I told them I'm not giving them anything. I mean pest control is not that hard and if you have a problem take care of it. How dirty does the back have to be for this to happen. NEVER AGAIN!Writing this review as I leave this place and sadly If I could give this place no stars I would. Keeping this review short and simple... Came here with 8 friends on a late night and found a baby cockroach, in one of my friends pho after he was half way done with his food. I don't know what's worse but the fact the cockroach was in the pho or the fact that everyone got the same thing and it was the same broth? I guess thanks for the free food? Never again will I come here!!Very rude and not helpful at all. I was looking for a dish with snow peas and he said they don't have it because of holidays and to try pho Kim long.I explained how I went there and management told me they don't sell snow peas and his response was "us too" when on the menu there are about 3-4 options WITH EFFING SNOW PEAS.I've come here once before and thought id try a second chance but after this and all their health code violations NEVER AGAIN.

Do NOT go here!  It used to be Taste of India or something like that.  I went out of my way on a weekly basis to go there.  Until just last weekend.  Ugh.  The pakoori were plain old fried veggies.  The Chicken Tikka Masala had chunks of...something white.  The chicken itself seemed ok (how can you screw up tandoori???) but I will never, EVER go there agin!NE corner 32nd St and Greenway.*sigh*

Review Text :
I like the burger tapas concept thing they have going, but the entire time I was here as I sat on the patio, I laughed at the "Under Construction" sign of Delux under plain view smack dab across the street on Scottsdale Road.So of course during my meal I couldn't help but draw comparisons to Delux.  Granted, it probably would have happened anyway, but regardless, I found the constant reminder amusing.  My friend Maya brought me and some out-of-towner friends who ooed and aahed over the place.  "Sliders are so trendy!" I exclaimed to the group as we basked in the stench of the Scottsdale canal from the patio and watched as sceney passersby and diners enjoyed the Saturday afternoon.  I immediately felt like hurling, not sure if it was over the stench, the half-joking insipid exclamation I made, or the poseurish crowd - inclusive of a blond Scottsdale broad in a baby blue jumpsuit with matching blue flip flops. (We saw that blue Smurf atrocity later at Giligin's, naturally.)Back to Stax -- the 3 oz. burgers themselves are good...not excellent, and not bad either.  They offer more variety in burgers than Delux:  salmon, turkey, ostrich, veggie, etc.  The meat was cooked well done on one and a little too charred on another - the buffalo.  The highlights here are the toppings and customizable add this, add that option (incl. cheese, sauted mushrooms, caramelized onions, tots, sweet potato fries) which opens up a number of possibilities.  I really liked the toppings on the buffalo - muenster cheese, peach bbq sauce, pickled shallots and an onion ring.A friend asked our server how many to order to equal a typical hamburger and her answer was 2.5, so basically two or three.   Ahh, there's the rub.  The sliders are $4 - $5.  Ordering three will mean you spend $12 - $15.  Yikes.  Definitely more expensive than an oft-criticized-as-expensive Delux.Service here was solid if a bit slow to start.  My friends' margaritas came out very quickly, but the Diet Coke I ordered took about 10 minutes.I would come here again, if for only the dipping sauces. Garlic, aioli, pesto, chipotle.  Crap, they were all excellent.I actually love the food here.  Everything is fantastic but I have decided to write a review for another reason.  3 weeks ago I ate at Stax (as I have many times) and my final bill was $25.10 and the person who ran my card (turned out to be the owner) charged me $77.10.   Overcharging by $52.00 is quite a bit but would not have deterred me from going back if it was settled appropriately.  I noticed the charge pending and decided to wait a couple days and hopefully once the charge cleared it would be the $25.10 I had expected.  The charge ended up clearing for $77.10 and I called Stax to inform them of this and was assured that the overcharge of $52 would be readily returned to my account.  I waited about a week and still nothing.  I decided to go in and speak with an owner/manager directly.  After waiting 20 minutes for the owner to get off a personal phone call with someone he seemed to be in a dramatic relationship with, he finally was available to "help" me.  I explained what had happened and he seemed annoyed that I came in to bother him with something like this; asking "Umm this is a hassle for us, why didn't you just call your credit card company?"  I asked if I could just get cash since I was here and the refund had never been processed.  He said no and that he would "work with his accountant to get it settled."  He even tried to take my only copy of the receipt and when I said I was going to keep it he got even more annoyed asking "You don't trust me? I'm the owner."  All in all I have waited another week, called my credit card company who stated they have to give Stax 30 days to refund my money since they initially said they were going to, and nothing has happened.  I'm so very disappointed with how this situation was handled and that the owner clearly does not care about keeping costumers that have been frequenting his restaurant since it opened :-(   I know this is not a food review but although I love the food here I will not be returning to Stax since I have been treated so poorly.  You would think that an owner of a small private business would be bending over backwards to keep his clientele when he makes a mistake of this magnitude.  I guess not.It took me this long to make it to Stax and I was expecting to love it!  The concept is a good one... a la carte little miniature burgers of all kinds including turkey, veggie, beef, bison, and chicken.  Plus, several salads and sides that are meant to be shared including sweet potato fries, onion rings, and more.  I am still a little bummed as I write this review that my experience was just mediocre.I met my friend Laura for lunch at Stax per her suggestion.  When I arrived, she was waiting for me inside and although it was busy, there were a couple of open tables.  We asked on of the hostess/waitresses if it was ok if we sat there and she said yes.  No more than 2 minutes later, another waitress came over and said "Excuse me, we're holding this table for a big group and we're going to seat them here as soon as this other table is finished" (said while nodding at the table next to us).  She then escorted us to another table that was not yet cleaned off from the previous diners.  It took a while to get the new table cleaned, but it wasn't that big a deal as I was busy catching up with Laura.  But once seated the service continued to be horrible.  Our waitress seemed rushed and took our drink orders but it took forever to get our drinks.  Then, she finally took our food orders and disappeared for a really long time.  I did enjoy the salad I ordered when it finally came (I cannot remember the name but it had spinach, corn, tomato, and cheese in it) and I had a bison burger served with it as well.  Unfortunately, Laura thought she ordered two burgers but was only given one... when she wanted to add another to the order, it took forever to flag our waitress down and even longer for her to get her 2nd burger!I know this review is only based on one experience, so I am not giving up on Stax... I will go back - I have to try their sweet potato fries after all!  I just hope that my next visit to Stax is better than my first one!The great thing about Stax is when you want a burger, but not a whole big, giant, regret it by the end of the meal burger (which ABSOLUTELY has its place) their 3 oz. servings hit the mark!Today was my first visit and I enjoyed the buffalo burger as advised on the menu (topped with BBQ sauce, cheese and an onion ring). The petite sandwich was just enough to quench that hankering. The table shared the spinach-artichoke dip (super creamy and loaded with spinach) and some sweet potato fries (called sweet pots and served in a mini-fryer basket) with the "spicy" (not to be confused with the chipotle or jalapeno) aioli. Every thing is a la carte including the dipping sauces, but the prices are reasonable. Three of us had burgers, shared the fries and artichoke dip and the bill was $30 (before gratuity). We all left satisfied.The happy hour features some $3 food options to match the $3 beer and sangria. Some of the house cocktails sounded marvelous and are $6 during happy hour. Looking forward to my next visit!Kangaroo! You heard me. Last night I tried a Kangaroo burger at Stax. Um, 5 stars for that alone.  This place is awesome. I am so glad I finally tired it. The whole concept is great. The smell is intoxicating, even in the parking lot.  It's like hamburger utopia. You mix and match different types of mini burgers, usually two is enough if you order sides.  The exotic meat section blew me away and I just had to try the Kangaroo burger. I believe the selection changes frequently. I also got the turkey burger, which I really enjoyed. The patty had spices and bell pepper mixed in and the pineapple made it extra yummy with a touch of sweetness. I tried a bite of my dinning partner's buffalo and that was pretty tasty. The bread on these little guys is top notch too and grilled to be slightly crispy around the edges. The mini burgers were hefty. Honestly, they really weren't that mini, I only got through one and a half.  There were some other big hits with me. The sweet potato fries rocked. YOU MUST GET THEM.  Okay, so Fez still has the best, but these are my second favorite. I also love the cucumber water, so much better than lemon. I hate that sour crap in my water, but the cucumber is so refreshing. The only thing I didn't care for was the Mac n' Jack. It wasn't bad, just not my style. Too spicy and not creamy enough for me, it wasn't worth the calories.  The service was great too, my waitress was extremely sweet and helpful since this was my first visit.  I can't wait to go back.The decor/atmosphere rocked, the food rocked, the selection rocked, and of course- I rock.I was torn on how to rate this place. I guess If it is based on burgers alone it would be 1 star for flavor and price for that little gross thing. If it was based on customer service 5 stars for sure, sadly it is by far the best service Ive had in a whileSweet potato fries are for sure a 4 star probably the best damn friesThe burer though jeeze that thing sucked. I know they have salt because the fries were perfectly salted. For som reason the burger had absolutley no flavor at all.  Scratch that it had an overwhelming flavor of fat but no salt or seasoning. They put 2 pieces of an onion on ther even though I paid like a quarte and didnt even get one full slice. If the slider and I really mean slider is like 5 bucks the topping should be free..ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THE MEAT WAS FLAVORLESS AND OILY  IT WASNT EVEN GRASS FED. I could go on and on about that awefull waste of a cow but really the fries were that good I would go back, just for the fries. I would never put another piece of meat from that place in my body. I just cant get over the price and the non existant flavor. USE SOME SEASONINGS PEOPLE oh and free topping come on. .25 cents for  2 finger nail clipping size pieces of onion. after paying 5 bucks for about 1 oz of meat that tasted like flavorless oil I just cant say anything good about the burgerIt was Stax for lunch today. Out on the patio (heated for our enjoyment...it was too doggone cold today..can the Scottsdale CofC do something about that please?).Our beautiful daughter Whitney is moving to Old Town Scottsdale, and she had to come over for a walk-through. She called and asked if her dear decrepit father (me!!!) was available for lunch, so we walked up to Stax.I have been here several times before and I always enjoy it.We got some totz (which is similar to a Tater Tot, but with a "z", so hipper), and sliders (a sloppy joe, a chicken, a kobe beef and a veggie).Everything was well prepared, and well timed. The service was really good (it's been a little bit uneven at times in the past, but I say "judge slowly"). They even brought a sampler of some of the aioli's to try with the totz, as well as with the sliders, no charge! Very nice touch!The only down side to Stax is that it's a little expensive for sliders, esp compared to places like Chicago Hamburger, etc. But this place is not a hole in the wall. The atmosphere is really pleasant, Stax has a full bar so I can get a marti with my sliders, they have totz, there's room to sit down comfortably and the people watching is, as always, great.You will enjoy Stax (that's not an order, BTW, just an observation:) )I've been back to Stax a few times recently... and actually twice in the past week - so, it's time for an update and a bump up in rating from 3 stars to 4.Service has been consistently much better than it was my first visit, and the food is consistently fresh and filling.  If you order a bunch of things ala carte like I do, the bill will add up, but you get what you pay for... it's worth it.  I've continued to order the buffalo burger but I've branched out and tried a few different salads, the brussel sprouts, and broccoli.  I like that there is a wide variety to choose from and that you can custom create basically whatever you'd like.I also love the cucumber water!Still haven't tried the sweet potato fries - they are extremely tempting though, so I am sure I will go back soon to try them when the craving strikes.If you haven't been yet, Stax is worth a visit.  Enjoy!my boss asked me where we should go for lunch today and i was already a nervous wreck thinking he was going to fire me or something. why did he want to go to lunch??! i've been here 4 years and we have never had lunch. i think i got an ulcer worrying about it yesterday. anyway, i panicked and just started listing things that I knew would be close to work and some how stax popped out of my mouth. instantly i started thinking to myself  'oh, crap, why did you just say that? i hope he doesn't say he wants to go to stax' and then he was like 'hmm, stax sounds good' CRAP! so whatever, i'm an agreeable girl. and i did, afterall, suggest it... kinda.  we got a table and i ordered water w. lemon and he had a diet coke. when his DC came, i remembered another reason for hating this place. the DC came in a stupid bottle. i hate that they do that. its like they just want to find any reason to charge you for something stupid. i bet they wanted to charge me for my lemon slice, too. which, by the way, is the dumbest, lamest lemon wedge. you can't even squeeze it. totally pointless slice of lemon. i wasn't hungry so i just ordered a little burger and it looks so sad and wimpy on the plate. he took a bite of his chicken and put it down and it totally looked raw. so i look at my boss and he has this look of disgust on his face. sure enough, it wasn't cooked. he lost his appetite.they comped our meal but now he won't ever go back either. that makes another person i know of who will never eat there again. we left and the waitress came running out to ask if we wanted the receipt?? that's funny. so you didnt notice us the entire time to notice that my water was empty or his DC was gone? you didnt notice us when my boss tried to track you down to tell you his food was raw so he had to bring it to you?  but you notice us the second we leave so you can chase us down the street to give us a receipt?? ummmmmmmm. ya, i hate this place.

I only ever go to this Olive Garden when I have a gift card. The couple of times I ate inside the service was terrible and too many things went wrong to mention. I did bring it up to the manger. I decided from then on out I would only use the curbside to go and only like I mentioned, if I have a gift card.I decided to get the "Soup, Salad & Bread Sticks" deal and a side of the "Alfredo Dipping Sauce". I found the curbside parking and waited. And waited. And waited. I know it doesn't take that damn long to ladle some soup in a bowl, gather some bread sticks and container me some of that store bought salad mix. So, I got my food and headed home. I thought the salad looked yummy but it didn't taste yummy. The soup was good though. I loved the bread sticks and alfredo sauce. I just wish for $3.75 they weren't so stingy with it! They give you this cup that could clearly hold decent amount yet they put like a little layer in it.The curbside is convenient if they can bring your food in a timely manner.

Multiple Choice Quiz:1.  How long does it take to make and deliver two salads?a)  5 minutesb)  15 minutesc)  30 minutesd)  45 minutes2.  What is the appropriate  waiter response if the wait for a salad is longer than 30 minutes?a)  "Terribly sorry about this!"b)  "I'll have these out momentarily and apologize for the wait."c)  "Please don't hurt me hungry ladies - please."d)  "Well, somebody stole the first one.  It'll be a couple more minutes."3.  How should a hungry green bunny deal with a lack of immediately available veggies?a)  wait patiently and be sereneb)  down several glasses of wine and dance on the tablesc)  start sharpening the fork tinesd)  gaze at the fountain, sigh loudly and pray her stomach doesn't decide to consume her spleenAnswers:If you responded with (d) to all of the above - you win!You know...this was almost a 4 star review but the super shadyness of our server dropped this down to a 1 star.My girlfriends and I had stopped in here for a quick drink and a small snack.  We sat at the bar where there was a happy hour special, with mini sliders and drink specials - all of which were lovely.  The service up to this point was pretty good, and we had great time chatting and noshing and drinking.The bill came (it was $60 something) and the four of us each threw down a $20 and a few bucks so there was close to $90 to cover our bill plus tip.We proceeded to walk away and as we were trying to decide which direction we should go, the server comes running after us telling us that we were trying to stiff him!  Huh?  I thought maybe we miscalcuated the tip - so I reached for my wallet, when he tells us that we only put down $40...not $90 that I *KNEW* we put down.After an *intense* discussion, the moment where one of my friends started to demand a manager, the server tells us to wait where we were, so that he could check to make sure that nothing was left under a napkin or something.  Magically, he checked with the busboy and the busboy "accidentally threw away" the rest of the money.Um, I call BULLSHIT.  We should have stuck around and demanded to speak to a manager anyways - but we were on a short timeline to get a lot of shopping done so we left...but I seriously regret not calling a manager over, because seriously, that is some shady shenanigans!!!!!!!

Thanks, Yelpers!  We never would have walked around the corner and found this place if not for you!Since it's called Stripburger, I was hoping there would be strippers, boooo for no strippers!  Yes, I get that it's on the strip, hence the name, but I'm always hoping for strippers.....Good sliders - why am I the only one in love with the buns here?  Maybe I'm just a carb slut, but those buns are GOOD!Good fries, hey if you're having a burger, you must have fries!GREAT milkshakes!  And with a SHOT?! (and by that I mean 2 shots...) How cool is that!?  Decent service, good people watching, nice to sit outside.Good place to have a nice, inexpensive lunch!$2.00 Specials at the bar at Happy Hour. Great Cheap Late Night EaTS!Sliders,Onion Straws,Fries and beer $2 eachI went for the full-size burgers this time however, we ordered the cheddar & mushroom and the greeen chile burger.-BOTH were fantasticThe warm potato chips with cheese & onion was quite delicious as well!!Service is good, the atmosphere is great for people watching and is really nice in the fall here in Vegas since its an outdoor bar.Be sure to check them out this coming weekend 10/17 at Desert Breeze Park at the BITE of Las Vegas!!Saturday: The bf & I are driving up & down the strip & noticed the words "Burgers, Shakes & Cakes" in neon green letters. It was 12:30 am, we're starving & had just been told Mesa Grill closes at 11 pm (this is Vegas, baby, why would anything close that early?) Stripburger to the rescue!Atmosphere: circular design with bar in the middle & tables on the perimeter. Lots of neon green lighting (like they're on St. Patty's Day overload.) Music is a super upbeat & is a mix of R&B & hip hop (Rhianna, Kanye, Fergie.) Wherever you are seated, you'll have a pretty good view of The Strip.Service: Hostess was a very concerned Asian girl who explained why there would be a few minute wait & checked on us to make sure our waitress had come by. Waitress was quick & efficient-loved her.Food: Extra yummy. The bf & I shared "the threesome" (fries, extra thin onion strings & something I've been wanting to try-fried pickles) & a banana shake (good size for sharing, lots of *real* banana flavor.) I ordered a chicken burger with bacon, BBQ sauce & caramelized onions (flavors are fantastic-i definitely recommend this one ) & the bf had a cheddar bacon cheeseburger. Total: $33 (not including tip.) I could give Stripburger a big ole' smooch for being open til 2 am.We arrived in Vegas just in time for lunch. After checking my mother's luggage at the Wynn we roamed around looking for a place to eat. Being hungry and a bit cranky we decided to go somewhere before I got to the "Feed me now or it's off with your head" stage. Lo and behold a burger joint across the street! Stripburger is an all-outdoor eatery with shaded tables and of course: full bar. The friendly hostess greeted & seated us quickly. Scanning the menu, two things quickly caught my eye: the green chile cheeseburger and the pickle fries. H ordered the hickory burger and my mother settled on the daily special which was the bacon cheeseburger with small fries. We ordered a side of fries (the burgers do not come with a side). The pickle "fries" came out first but were actually chips instead of spears. I was expecting spears and prefer them over the chips but these fried sour pickle chips were pretty darn good! I have come to the conclusion that the best pickle to batter and fry is the good old sour dill. Sliced thin and coated with a light crispy batter, these pups didn't last long. Our burgers arrived and Whoa Nellie are they huge! My burger was laden with roasted Hatch green chiles, melted pepper jack cheese, tomatoes, pickles, lettuce and onions. The burger was thick, juicy and full of flavor. Grilled to perfection and served piping hot once I picked it up it never kissed the plate again. Fries? What fries. I was too busy with my burger. I did manage to try one and it was a-ok. But really you don't need no stinkin' fries! H declared his burger superior to the Cheeseburger in Paradise found you-know-where. The staff's friendly and they work together well. I spotted several heaters for when the weather is cold but have no idea what they do when summer hits L.V. If you are looking for a quick, cheap and insanely great burger look no further than Stripburger.Went to have dinner with some co-workers and we all agreed on Strip Burger! It is located right beside the fashion show mall, towards the strip.  It is also an outdoor setting, so beware come summer time!! There are about 10 burgers to choose from, and all are about $10 each, without fries! So, I'm guessing that's pretty pricey for just a burger. I recently tried the Southwest chipotle burger, and the burger was A-ok!! I'd have to say the famous blue cheese burger is what keeps me coming back!! Another must-try are the onion strings!! An order can be shared until it is all gone! =DThe chocolate shake is also magnificent! You can just taste and feel the chocolate bits melt in your mouth!! I wish there was a happy hour, or maybe there is? One that I don't know of yet!I must admit, I expected an over priced tourist trap with mediocre at best food. Instead, I received an extremely delicious buffalo chicken sandwich and sweet potato fries. The food was very much on point, albeit still pricey. The sandwich ( a la crate) was $9.95 + sweet potato fries which were around $4.00 and a Stella which was also around $4.00. But, my friend works for Apple at Fashion Show so our gracious waiter gave us 20% off discount which brought our bill to $24 combined. This was reasonable price to pay for a delicious sandwich with a beer and fries on the strip. Our server was very nice, but the hostess and the bartender looked bored and snobby. Yawn. Also, be prepared for the OBNOXIOUS drunk foreign tourists. All in all not a bad place to grab a delicious burger and a beer and people watch.HAPPY NIGHT!The Happy Hour starts here at 11pm and goes until close...I love Vegas! You can really find a happy hour at any hour in Vegas. I can not believe I am reviewing this place because it is my secret place to go to and just veg out alone.  One of the managers at Mon Ami Gabi told me about this place 6 years ago and I always come down for some cheap $2 beers (Happy Hour) and a little dinner. Amy the bartender is really nice and I've seen her on past visits but I'm sure she doesn't remember me.  You might think she's unfriendly at first but once you start talking to her you will then realize how cool she is. She works her butt off at the circle bar. Running around keeping customers happy and also making drinks for the servers tables. The burgers here are good but I wouldn't expect anything less from a Lettuce Entertain You restaurant. Plus Chicago chains rock!!! I know...spoken like a true Chicago Boy! Hey I've got to stand up for my city! I have no idea why they haven't opened this concept in Chicago. (I'm not a fan of there M Burger...the rip off version of In n Out)My favorite thing here is the butter salad but now it seems to come with romaine and spinach. The salad is nice and large. It is worth the money because you will feel full. I know what your thinking...a salad in Vegas...yes after everything my body has been put through it needs this. I also enjoyed the onion rings too. I know it's an app but it really isn't for sharing because there's only like 6 rings in here. So get your own basket! No really get your own!This is just a great place to chill out and relax. I also love that it is outside too. There is not much of a view unless you like looking at Steve Wynn's billions towering in the desert sky. The food is priced reasonable for Vegas and the Happy Drinks will save you a bunch. Until next time strip burger.Lettuce Entertain You sent me some coupons for 5 of their restaurants in town and Stripburger was the last of them that I had never been to.  Today, I stopped in for lunch/dinner.I opted to sit at the bar and chat with Rebecca, the bar keep and my server.  She got me an iced tea while I looked at the menu.  Good server, very pleasant woman!I had looked at the menu online and was all set to order the burger I had chosen when I did a switch and went with the mini burger sampler.  This consists of three sliders--the blue cheese burger, the whiskey BBQ burger, and the cheddar burger.   I asked for the burgers to be done rare and they were.  That was a bit surprising because of their smaller size.  They cooked them the way they should.  With the burger, I got an order of garlic, herb fries which was large enough to feed me and the two other people at the bar.While waiting, I enjoyed the people watching which is a big draw for this place.  Being on the corner of Las Vegas Boulevard and Fashion Show Drive and with all seating being patio seating, it's a great place if you just want to have a drink and watch the tourists go by.  Of the burger sampler, I liked the blue cheese and the whiskey BBQ the best.  All three were good, but these two were better.  The fries were excellent.  So much garlic, good herb seasoning, and lots of salt on my part and I was set.My iced tea was refilled without asking.  I'd bring my wife here sometime if it wasn't so difficult to get to.  It is outside at the farthest corner of Fashion Show Mall.  Maybe I'll just go back myself.Cool lunch spot on the strip for a casual and quick meal. Ordered the pickle fries to share, a big green salad, the famous cheese burger, and an orange whip cocktail. The food was average and not something that I would go out of my way to eat again. The fried pickles were good; something you'd only be able to get at a fair or carnival. My only complaint about the dish was that the pickle slice wouldn't hold to the breading, so I was left with a chunk of fried breading after each bite. The big green salad was fresh and light. The croutons on the salad were house made and also very fresh. I enjoyed the lightness and acidity of the avocado dressing. My dining partner ordered a cheeseburger which was great in terms of flavor and presentation, but not comparable to my favorite LA spots. The cocktail was refreshing and well made as well. The service was average for being on the strip. Our waitress was sweet and made a few recommendations on our orders. The ambience was also nice because even though we were technically sitting indoors, the view of the strip and the openness felt like I was sitting in an outdoor setting. Overall, good place to grab lunch if in the area but otherwise not something super memorable.My daughter and I had a GREAT lunch here!!!  It's on the corner of the Fashion Show mall across from Encore/Wynn and is all outside/patio dining.  Don't fret--the misters on the patio are cranking and we were borderline cold on a July afternoon.  The caesar salad was perfect for splitting and the burgers/sandwiches were a good portion.  We both loved our lunches (minus a tad too much pepper on the burger) and we left full and happy.  Looking forward to the construction in front of the mall to be done to enhance the ambience a bit, but all in all a good choice for lunch.

70+ visits and Tender continues to deliver!!!This is my goto spot to unwind in Vegas.  Why?1.  Top notch service especially at the bar.  Bar staff is incredible.  Perfect if your dining alone.2.  Simple food done right.3.  Well chosen "special" ingredients (like their butter... ask them about how its sourced, and the game).4.  Very reasonable prices. (Expect to pay less than $100 for a couple of drinks and dinner especially with all the discounts they give you just for walking into the Luxor).As always, the rule with Tender is, if its different, order it, else keep it simple.The charcuterie and deli meats (different) is outstanding.  It includes wild boar sausage, duck ham, and antelope pastrami with a selection of mustard.  Wow!  The salmon sampler (simple) is also well worth the try.  Both are large portions and can easily be a light meal if you pair it with a drink.For mains, its all about the meat.  Take your pick of the cuts and different producers.  This is the short list:  American Kobe from Mishima Ranch, Durham Ranch Bison, Strauss Farm veal, and free-range Berkshire Heritage pork.  Any cut.  All incredible and take the classic flavors of each type of meat to the limit. You will notice this immediately.Finally, if you're adventurous, have the wild game tasting or if they have it as a special order the elk chop.  I can't even describe how good these dishes are.Skip the sides unless you are really hungry.RECOMMENDEDAn incredible steakhouse.   Outstanding food.  Solid wine list.  Excellent service.  Stellar value.(Sorry this review is long, there is a lot to share).It's in Luxor.  Stop laughing.  Once you get past the lobby (hey, you can't hide the fact you're in a giant pyramid), renovations have made the casino as contemporary as any.  Five years and 120+ visits;  Tender continues to impress.  Innovation keeps the menu exciting.  Rapidly changing seasonal specials showoff the chef's commitment to freshness.  For summer, the heirloom tomato salad with over a dozen varieties of fresh, vine ripened tomatoes dressed in olive oil and sea salt with micro basil and slices of uber fresh, milky mozzarella just incredible.  A full blown tomato party in your mouth.  The salad is large enough for two.For bison month, a charred bison carpaccio topped with a spicy aioli, arugula salad with roasted peppers and sweet corn finished with a touch of sea salt.  Incredible!Other killer starters, the charcuterie of game and deli meats (bresaola, finochietta, wild boar sausage, pork coppa, lamb prosciutto and antelope pastrami) with cornisons, assortment of olives and mustard, an excellent take on the classic.  The chilled salmon tasting, a true standout; hot apple wood smoked salmon topped with black truffle "caviar" on a bed of pesto, edamame, and sea asparagus.  Wow!  An explosion of flavors, oily salmon, earthy truffle, herbaceous basil, the back taste of the pine nuts, the crunch and oceanic flavor of the sea asparagus.  Perfect.Outstanding steaks at all quality and price ranges.  The Bison ribeye is very hard to pass.  Deep meaty flavor, low fat.  JAPANESE KOBE A5 WAGYU.  The real deal.  $95 / 8oz.  I doubted it, I saw it, I tried it.  Yes, yes, yes.  Extremely well trimmed.  Request it cooked below rare.  It's an ethereal experience, seared goodness on the outside, chilled, tender with melting fat on the inside.Something different?  Wild game platter remains excellent.  Berkshire kurabuta pork chop (order this medium) near perfect heritage pork flavor.  Sweet, tender, and porky!  Finally the bison osso buco; tender perfectly braised, deeply flavored bison on a bed of enriched mashed potato and tangy bbq onions.  Incredible balance.  The marrow is a special treat.Tip:  check out the sides.  Roasted bone marrow glazed with a veal demi an insane value at $5, Hudson foie for $10.  Add it to any steak or have it alone with some bread as a starter.Sure, missteps do happen but are always corrected with no fuss.For the absolute best service on a casual night out, eat at the bar.  Friendly, very knowledgeable bar staff who aim to please.  The music in the lounge a little loud, but it keeps the energy up.Great wine program with the lowest markup on the Strip.  Huge by the glass pours.  Wines by the bottle near retail.  Check out the Captains' List for clearance wines below retail.Snub the Luxor all you want, you will be missing a great restaurant.Tender was good.  I don't know if I would crave to go there again. The service was excellent. Our server was very nice with a sense of humor. They did however get the cuts of meat mixed up and cooked them the wrong way. We did not bother to correct it.  My steak was cooked the way I wanted.  I also asked for extra butter to which they forgot. The oysters were good. The Mac n cheese was probably the best thing I ate.  I love truffle.Review #500Allow me to preface this review by thanking Yelp for providing me the opportunity to become part of such a friendly and positive social community.  I am thankful, as well as grateful, for all the acquaintances and friendships that I have nurtured and developed over the past five years.  Since becoming a more active member last year, I have attended numerous enjoyable and lively events, met many fun and humorous people, gained knowledge on the art of photobombing, co-hosted three UYEs, and established new friendships.  Though this review is about a restaurant, it's significant since my meal at Tender was with two wonderful friends I met thru Yelp.  At the same time, my main purpose of traveling to Las Vegas was to meet and reunite with old/dear friends.  And so, I dedicate my 500th review to Yelp, good friends, good food, and good times.  Now, on to the review:a TENDER moment.Truly some of the best food and service I have experienced has been in the gambling capital of America, Las Vegas.Many thanks to fellow yelper, Rod U., for introducing me to his "kitchen" while vacationing in Las Vegas recently.  Located on the casino level of the Luxor, the bar area is inviting while opening up to the remainder of the spacious restaurant.  Though Tender doesn't look very grand or large from the outside, surprisingly the restaurant stretches farther within (as I soon found out after a visit to the restroom).Since Rod had dined here numerous times (and actually regained his Dukedom during the trip), I allowed him to take the lead on where to sit and what to order.  Rod's area of choice:  the bar, of course.  Now, for those of you who are not fond of bar seating, I implore you to rethink your decision.  Bar seating is quite enjoyable and entertaining to say the least.  It was clearly no surprise that Rod knew practically all of the bartenders working on both of our visits.  Mike and Robin stand out, particularly, in my memory for their outgoing and social personalities.  FOOD:*Tomato salad (shared):  A special consisting of various types of tomatoes from the Napa Valley served with mozzarella cheese and spattered with olive oil.  It was exquisite.  The perfect start to our meal.  Recommended if available.*Chilled salmon tasting:  Three types were served including house cured gravlax, hot apple-wood smoked Skuna Bay salmon, and cold smoked Atlantic salmon.  Absolutely delicious.  I'd order this appetizer again for sure.*Lamb Tasting:  This dish included lamb rack chop and lamb loin porterhouse.  Served with couscous and rosemary garlic lamb sauce.  Having only tried lamb once before, I decided to be adventurous.  The lamb was prepared well, and I enjoyed this dish immensely.   Cuts and portion size were just right.The second dinner/visit with Rod and Terry K proved to be more enjoyable, humorous and full of laughter.  It seems its always a party with these two whether in Hawaii or on the mainland.  Of course, we all sat at the bar where we could engage in good conversation with the staff and amongst ourselves.  Plus, another round of drinks is quicker to order at the bar (*wink).FOOD:*Escargot (shared):  A nice start to the meal.  Small portions shared between the three of us.  *Bone Marrow:  Generous portion that looks intimidating, until you realize the actual portion must be separated from the bones themselves.  Very delectable.  For those that have yet to try bone marrow, take a chance and do try it at least once.  *Pork Chop:  I was shocked when the dish was finally set before me.  The portion is a behemoth certainly.  My fear was I wouldn't be able to make a dent after all the appetizers we ordered.  The meat was tender and preparation just perfect.  DRINK:  Martinis and wine were the beverages of choice for dinner.  An extensive wine list is available.DESSERT:*Espresso martini:  The perfect end to a delicious meal.   That is all.SERVICE:  Friendly, accommodating, meticulous, with superb attention to detail.  And I'm not just talking about the bartenders.  All staff we encountered exhibited such exceptional customer service.  Waters were readily refilled, rounds of drinks were quickly provided when requested, plates were cleared away and silverware replaced in a timely manner.  Appetizers and entrees were also delivered within a reasonable amount of time from when orders were placed.  There were some great conversations had with the bartenders especially, as they asked about where we were going and what we planned to do while in Vegas.  All the while they were also seeing to other patrons and filling drink orders for the restaurant.  Just an outstanding showing of camaraderie, teamwork, and exceptional service overall.  A job well done.BOTTOM LINE:  A memorable and delicious meal shared with two wonderful friends, whom I never would have met were it not for Yelp.  Cheers to good friends and good food!!Located in Luxor with nearly three-hundred seats and the sort of pandering service that describes everything as 'beautiful' or 'amazing,' despite evidencing zero knowledge of the province or preparation technique involved in the cuisine, it was finally on Saturday that myself and two friends sat down at Tender - the combination of a gift certificate and one of the few menus in Las Vegas to offer wild game making up for everything service and the humid, stagnant space lacked.Heralded by some as a hidden gem, while others find the entire Luxor property almost entirely irrelevant to Sin City's culinary landscape, it was just after 5:30 that our trio sat down in one of several dining rooms and with heavy wood speckled with rustic décor beneath low lighting the upsale specials were largely ignored, a focus on the cheese menu showing far less unique options than those suggested online (and described, oddly, as only available 'at the bar',) leading to a three course menu - one friend's Oysters Rockefeller completely forgotten when the waiter tried to push 'outstanding' tuna tartare while the rest of the order trickled out slowly with minimal description, but excellent execution from the men and women behind the grills.Having reached out through social media in order to understand how the wild game menu had come to be in such an unexpected space it was not long after warm bread and aromatic pesto arrived that GM James Clare stopped by to say hello and subsequently fetching Chef K.C. Fazel, a gracious man with obvious passion for his products and preparation, the story of Tender's relationship with farmers up north as well as the Chef's Midwestern upbringing soon had me all the more interested in what was to come - not even the frequently empty water glasses, 80F+ temperature, or ongoing "beautiful," "wonderful," "excellent" verbiage being fed to each and every table around enough to bring me down.With the aforementioned oysters forgotten, course one began with two appetizers, and as one friend was treated to a rich broth teaming with tender oxtail, caramelized onions, grilled bread, and cheese that ranks amongst the best I have ever tasted my $19 slice of duck liver a true first glimpse of things to come - the foie gras' sapor more intense than generally seen amongst steakhouse fare with the crispy rice cake providing a texture-rich base more than amicable to sopping up both the offal's residual oils and a drizzle of port wine and juicy red fruit.Moving on to mains and sides, it was after some delay that seven plates arrived tableside and although presentations were sorely lacking, save for the young man who described the seafood tasting, it would be nearly impossible to find fault in anything save for mundane potatoes - the smoky bone marrow portion exceedingly generous given the $6 tab while both the crispy duck bacon and thick, cheese-imbued rice were equally well prepared, all of them dishes best shared.Speaking to entrees, for myself the beef was a bit humdrum, though the sear and center were both on-point medium rare, while both tastings were every bit as good as the quality of sourcing, the whitefish admittedly a touch fishy thus allowing both salmon and scallops to steal the spotlight while each constituent of the wild game trio was peerless, the Osso Buco tender and full of funk while both elk and boar delivered on the chef's promise that even his leaner cuts were bound to impress, the latter particularly impressive as smoky saline notes met a perfect foil in housemade chutney.At this point feeling the effects of a full stomach combined with the restaurant's toasty temperature it was in an elegant iced coffee presentation that I indulged while my tablemate fancied tea and genuinely unable to resist dessert the team at Tender had me at the words "Bread Pudding," the sizable round swimming in a pool of boozed up bananas beneath slowly melting ice cream - an excellent dish its own right but certainly no match for the torched s'mores cake, an absolute stunner that was neither too sweet nor too heavy, something I only wish could have been said for a fallen-on-arrival soufflé that was worth neither the twenty minute preparation nor the calories involved.Flying well below the radar given its gaming-floor adjacent location in Luxor, Tender is at once the sort of 'big meat' place that many envision when thinking of the typical Vegas steakhouse AND the sort of place where a largely unheralded chef has been allowed to carve out a niche that few would expect - if only the front of house could be brought up to speed with the team in the kitchen there is little doubt that this diamond in the rough could shine amongst the city's best.Review #500"For those who believe, no proof is necessary.  For those who don't, no proof is possible".  Stuart Chase.Personal Musings - What makes a restaurant great?  Cutting edge, imaginative food?  Michelin quality service?  Magical ambiance?  Dare I say, as a foodie, they all contribute, but Michelin stars, James Beard awards, even yelp stars mean jack $hit.  Great dining experiences are based on the company one chooses to share the meal.  Everything else just plays a supporting role.  To some, it's the neighborhood deli down the street or the okazuya of their childhood.  To me, simply the place that I have celebrated more evenings with friends, old and new, forged more new relationships in a new city than anywhere else...170 visits.  Solid food.  Outstanding service (especially at the bar).  Comfortable ambiance.   When a rare problem arises, it's corrected with no fuss or excess intrusion.   Nothing get's in the way of a great time.New management is currently updating the menu and the wine list.  Many old time favorites are gone, replaced by simpler dishes and seasonal specials.For starters, the seasonal heirloom tomato plate (over a dozen different types of tomatoes dressed in EVOO, topped with pink Himalayan sea salt and micro basil) is a must.  Colorful and playful for the palate.  The contrast in sweetness and acidity between the different types of tomatoes is very pronounced.  The exotic mushroom soup is also outstanding.  Mushroomy flavor in a broth seemingly including bone marrow in consistency and flavor.   Fresh oysters and a classic shrimp cocktail round also make for good eats.This is a steakhouse and the beef shines.  The A5 Kobe is the real deal.  Ask for the certificate if you don't believe it.  Offered in both a filet and boneless rib eye, absolutely delicious and the lowest price anywhere on the Strip.   Very tender, sweet, with a clean beef flavor.  Very buttery.  Order it simply seared (below rare) for the best experience.   A good selection of cuts from different producers including an outstanding bison rib eye.  All are perfectly seared, cooked to temperature, simply seasoned with salt and pepper.Other standout mains include the always delicious wild game trio (venison osso bucco, elk medallions, and wild boar rack chop) and the full size, perfectly braised and sauced venison osso bucco.  Solid sides including a very fairly priced bone marrow ($6).  Great albeit huge desserts, try the souffles.Very good selection of wines by the glass; massive pours.  Well chosen wine list with reasonable Vegas resort pricing.Experiences ready for the making.Bravo.

After the Walk to End Alzheimer's at the Fashion Show, several of us decided to go to the food court for late breakfast/early lunch.  All of us opted for Great Wraps.  I stayed to watch our things at the tables and when some came back with their breakdfats from Great Wraps, I decided to go there too.The breakfast special was $4.99 and consisted of 2 eggs any style, 2 bacon slices or sausage links, a bagel, and some hash browns.  The order was done in about 2 minutes.The eggs were cooked as asked-over easy.  The sausage was standard and the hash browns were a oblong patty that was briefly deep fried.  The breakfast came with cream cheese for the bagel but it wasn't buttered.The breakfast was OK.  A couple of things stand out.  In the need to be fast food, the bagel was only toasted a little.  I don't want it black but neither do I want most of the bagel to be just off white toasted.  Also, the hashed brown patty could have been fried a little more.  I guess to move customers along, the cooking is done a minimum amount of time.  It was OK, nothing more.

While walking through New York New York, I was excited to see this place. I love seafood and knew I had to try it out. They sell fried fish fillets, fried chicken planks, fried shrimp, fried calamari rings, fried clams, and clam chowder.First off, their fried items are fresh. It doesn't come frozen when they fry it. You can actually see them dipping the items in batter and frying it. After seeing all of this, I couldn't wait. However, it was a bit of a let down.We ordered the fish and chips, fried clams, and clam chowder in a bread bowl. All of this came out close to $30, with the addition of the add on meal. For $4 more, you get a large drink with a cole slaw.I really wanted to try the clam chowder. That's my soup of choice. I just wanted it in a cup. They only offer it in the bread bowl so I was forced to get it. The soup was good. It had chunks of clam and potato in it. It wasn't overly salty. I ended up throwing the bread bowl away.The menu was misleading. I ordered fried clams, I got fried clam STRIPS. Most of the clam strips were tiny and it was all breading. The fries that it came with were huge and crispy.My husband's meal came with two big pieces of fried fish. I tried a bite of it and it was the best thing that was ordered. The fish was moist and smooth on the inside of the hot, crispy breading.

Review Text :
I've been here a few times and this place is just not that good. If you're looking for authentic Hawaiian food, this will definitely be a disappointment. First, the staff aren't really attentive or helpful. They kind of just take your order. No personality and not very welcoming. For foods, the chicken Katsu that I've ordered a few times had a very bland taste to it. The outer coating was more soggy then  anything. The sauce for the Katsu had a different taste to what I'm used to. It has a very watery texture to it. It comes with Mac salad which taste like pure mayonnaise and on the salty side. You probably wonder why I've ate here a "few" times like i mentioned in the beginning if I didn't like it. Well, the beau kinda likes this place and it's pretty close to his house so it's convenient when we need something quick and close by. But def not my "to go" Hawaiian joint.

Indian food in Arizona.I think Tandoori Times is a solid Indian restaurant for great saucy masala, soft and tender fish, hot crispy naan, and super flavorful chicken.But minus points for Justin Y. to receive an unpleasant bathroom experience after T.T. and the food took literally forever to come out. I really did appreciate the ALL YOU CAN DRINK self-serve chai teaI liked it. JY didn't.

Review Text :
I was stuck in traffic on the strip - no surprise!  But, I was SO hungry after my flight that when I saw the word 'Bahay', I became so excited and did a jacked up turn to make it into the parking lot.  Stepping inside was like heaven.  Especially to a person delusional from hunger.  They have all the Filipino food you could imagine...honestly, it was that big of a selection.  After much debate, I decided on the kare-kare (ox-tail in peanut butter) and sinagang (tamarind broth soup).  With a heaping pile of steamed rice.  Under $10.  Deal alert!  The kare-kare was realllllly good.  (ALMOST as good as my mom's.)  You know how some places skimp out on the peanut butter?  Nope, not this place!  Peanut buttery goodness.  Sinagang, yum.  It had so many veggies and such a nice broth that it balanced the heaviness of the kare-kare.  I think I sat in the booth for a good 10 min after I was done eating. Food coma at its finest.I'd been craving Filipino food recently, so I decided to stop in here to satisfy that feeling. Kapit Bahay, located in the Chinatown Plaza, probably has the most authentic traditional Filipino dishes I've had in Vegas so far. The name of the restaurant, which loosely translates to "neighbor's house," is fitting because the interior decor might remind someone of a traditional Filipino household. The inside is small and does not have a lot of tables, so it fills up quick. The staff was super friendly to me and was quick to serve, despite it being a little busy in there. Just on the other side of the food line, there's a grocery area where filipino snacks and other products (eskinol, efficascent oil, etc.) are sold.They give out big portions at a good price, so it's pretty affordable (even if you do decide to get extra items or things from their grocery section). I had the kaldereta, pork adobo, and their chicken tinola. All were very flavorful and SUPER close to how my mom makes filipino food (but let's be honest, nothing ever beats your family's cooking).They didn't have labels for their food, so you'd either have to ask about them or know for yourself what you're getting. I don't think their menu is set, so it's basically whatever they decide to cook that day is what they'll be serving. I'm pretty sure they always have the popular "staple" dishes like Adobo and Lechon available all the time. Overall, I think this place is definitely for those people who love filipino food in the style closest to it's roots (and yes, sometimes being "too oily" is part of that). The food is very authentic, affordable, and you get good portions! A must-try if you want to try food that reminds you of home.

Review Text :
*note, sleepless night, just finished my first pot of coffee, so this review might suck*Hard to find, no sign visible from the street, most people rush past ignorant of it's existence...Even my Sons family who had lived here a year before us had never been there, and he married a coffee person.Welcome to my "Third Place" I make a fine "cuppa" at home, but a day I don't stop by here is a day that I feel a lack in my life. By far, my favorite coffee house in years, and here it is in Gilbert Az? Really? Here? Thank you Starbucks, for convincing the Masses that paying more than a quarter for a cup of Joe was acceptable, even mainstream! Lovely space, well decorated, by a person with taste, flair and fun, NOT by a committee or a panel or by customer survey. , lots of wood, with a sitting room in the back for your lazy hanging out needs. Ratty recliners? Not here, Nice... VERY nice leather chairs and sofa with driftwood tables scattered about. Nice artwork on the walls, mixing family photo's, nature photography with understated rock and Roll pictures. (having a pic of Jim Morrisons grave is cool, having a UNPRETENTOUS picture of Jim Morrison's grave is worth a star of its own, there is a fare farmers market out front, but for myself, I like to park in the rear and walk through the garden and patio... It's a oasis amidst the sprawl, the explosion of colors and aromas are a extra treat that shouldnt be missed.This family understands that the atmosphere, the music, the creation and integration into the lifeblood of the community is what makes a coffeehouse so effen awesome.and effen awesome it is! And probably most importantly... full of the exact friendly faces you need when getting your java on. Homemade sugar goodness is available. It's the sort of thing that one dreams coming from your own kitchen, but with a tad more color and odd combinations (Coffee and Cigarettes cupcakes anyone?), to intice you in. Displayed in the front case, drawing you in like a moth to a flame,  like Teri Garr in Young Frankenstein... wholesome goodness you want to introduce your Mom to, yet you know it's soooo bad for you... It's gonna kill you, but your urges make it impossible to say no.*ahem*Did I mention awesome cupcakes?Oh, I guess I just did.The "real" food is quite wonderful as well, and worth the trip on its own, you simply cant go wrong, the open face omelet is magnificent, sandwiches quiche, burrito's etc, all normal food, but with a flair and style that make every bite full of extra-awesome.One downside... success.Alas, they were discovered and won a much deserved "Best Of" award for Phoenix, since then they have had to hire more  people and the family has had to move into the kitchen to keep up. The service has not diminished, the only downturn is has been in my beloved coffee. they still remember my families order, but sometimes its not as good as it was, and I view that more as a sign of how much they spoiled me before than anything else. Business is booming, and they couldn't keep up so they had to hire. It's normal that new people need to be trained, and that any amount of training will not equal years of experience.As other coffeehouses fight and cut corners in these tough times, it says a lot that The Coffee Shop is growing and healthy. Still, with that all said, this is my favorite coffeehouse in years, This is a perfect companion to Joes Farm Grill next door. (many reviews on Yelp and elsewhere) Together, they are reason for my Bride and I to want to move to the Agritopia subdivision they are a part of, just to be able to walk there in the morning, along the tree lined streets (rare around here in a work of cactus and ... dirt)Tucked away in Agritopia, The Coffee Shop can be hard to find. Maybe that's a good thing.I found The Coffee Shop because I like the restaurant next door -  Joe's Farm Grill. And when I found out it had free wifi, it quickly became my office away from home (of note, as appears to be typical everywhere else, there can be a shortage of electrical outlets at peak hours. Just club someone over the head and take theirs. A more sophisticated approach may be to hand them a five, tell them to go buy one of the DELIGHTFUL pastries and take their plug while they are at the counter).The coffee is great, the pastries are to die for and the patio / garden area makes you say, "Toto, we're not at Starbucks anymore".This place is a gem, and their pristine outside patio is perfect for morning lattes when there is a scent of chill in the air.The wife and I popped in based on an article she had seen.  I know the following statement has no business being in a business review, but the cashier had the bluest eyes I've ever seen, and it took everything in me to refrain from asking if they were real.The Lemon Whoopi was a great little cream-filled, sponge cake cookie.  But the real shining star was the Cinnamon Cupcake.  Amazing concentrations of cinnamon sugar were dispersed throughout the cupcake, delighting me bite after bite.  The frosting was creamy, with a little crust of sugar, adding to the consistency.  It was simply wonderful.I simply must try to recreate this award winning pastry.  So Joe, if you're reading this, we can do it the easy way, or the hard way.  You could bestow the recipe for this little treasure, and I could sign an NDA, and it would be our little secret.  OR... I could assemble the greatest axis of cupcake aficionados this side of... um, a place that would be notorious for cupcakes?  Then, after purchasing hundreds of these treats, and returning most of them to my team for careful analysis, could come up with the same recipe.The ball is in your court Joe, but be forewarned: I wont wait forever before soliciting my hench-women.PS: Applications now being accepted for cupcake hench-women.07/07/10Had coffee and some sweets here w/ a friend, and after much anticipation on trying the fare here, I was a bit disappointed w/ what I found :(  I decided I'd try a couple of scones and a berry coffee cake, and a cup o' joe.  I really enjoyed the coffee, but the pastries?  Not so much.  The coffee cake wasn't sweet enough, and I found it to be too greasy.  The scones, also a bit on the greasy side, were so flat, they looked like cookies!  Out of the two, I liked the butterscotch best.  However, I wouldn't order these again.  A few hours later, I decided I'd go back to write some reviews and have another cup of coffee.  I went back up to see if there were new additions to the display, but was turned off when I saw a couple of flies crawling over the cupcakes.  (((shudder)))  The clerk manning the counter followed my gaze and saw the flies, but didn't shoo them away.  Tsk, tsk.  Turned me off on trying anything new.I am a big fan of Joe's Farm Grill and The Liberty Market (a little less of Joe's Real BBQ, but I've only gone there once, so a return visit may change my mind), so I'd like to give their sister company The Coffee Shop another try.  The sandwich and salad menus look delicious, but most of the selections are off-limits to me.  But... flies in the sweets counter?  I don't know if I can stomach another visit :(It was a perfect day to sit outside in the patio enjoying the Bacon & BBQ sauce cupcake from the Food Network "Cupcake War" Challenge.  The thought of BBQ sauce on a cupcake doesn't sound very appealing, but surprisingly it wasn't too bad.  Joe's BBQ sauces are good by itself.  The cupcake was moist and with some unique flavors.  I just couldn't resist not trying it.   The view of the farm was gorgeous too.

Review Text :
I spent a lot of time thinking about reviewing this place. I held off for a lot of personal reasons. 1 I used to work here. But being unbiased...There are a few things I'm bitter about but it's mainly with the owner. Most of my friends refuse to deal with Trader Vic's because of me. But overall....If you're on the strip it's easy to get to. But if you park in PH Valet...Not so bad. If you park in Miracle Mile Parking...It's like a Lord of the Rings quest. Ya if you don't know your way around - you can walk in circles. When you get there, the hostess stand is in front and you can't tell if it's a restaurant. When you walk in, it's a little more posh than most other TVs. Apps: I like the coconut chicken. I hate the prices. I like the Kahlua pork sliders....but it's not Kahlua pork. It's like pork in a sweet sauce. The food is not cheap. Believe me for the quality and size of portions - it sucks. Lobster Potstickers YUM. Satay is ok - I mean I've had authentic - so when I taste this stuff, it's just ok.Main courses: My faves are usually the chef specials. They had Ribeye once which was great. All in Fried Rice was good. Not worth 20 bucks but it's not bad. It's hard to say. I haven't been there since February - so I don't remember the food....so its kinda forgetable?Breakfast is good if they still serve it. The waffles yum. The stuffed french toast is amazing....Drinks: I developed the Wasabi Mary. So of course YUM. I also developed the Coconut Raspberry chocolate Frappe. YUMMai Tai is good if made right. Originally they use Fresh Lime Juice - this place uses lemon concentrate for some reason. You have to order it from scratch otherwise they use a Mai Tai syrup for speed. Most of the other drinks. Taste the same all citrusy. The bowls eh can be worth it usually they have 6-8 ounces of liquor in it. But its better between two people otherwise there's no point to getting a buzz. So definitely one up on the view. But it's true - this place is boring. They run out of liquor a lot. It's not FUN like it used to be. Eh...View one star, some drinks half star, some staff, half star.

Review Text :
Good Burgers,Great HotDogs(Sabretts) and Piled High Pastrami!!I went here after a fellow tweeter recommended  it as the BEST burger OFF the Strip in Las Vegas.(RE:RT @Spcialt:--Best Off Strip burger is Sammy's Dog Shack!)It's a cute little shack in the Food4Less parking lot-they have a small outdoor patio area and a drive-thru so it's mostly take-out.We ordered a hot dog, a patty melt and an LA pastrami with an order of Garlic Romano fries and a Large Lemonade=$28!The service was great-fast & friendly-we sat outside and ate since it was a cool afternoon(rare in Las Vegas in August)The food was great, the portions were huge-The biggest PAstrami sandwich I have seen. THe hotdog was great and the patty melt was good too. NOT the BEST burger in Las VEgas but damn good.NEXT trip I'm trying the Ribeye Sandwich & a Fruit Smoothie!!WHERE: Located on Decatur & Flamingo (in the same plaza/area where food4less is at).WHEN: Monday-Wednesday, 10:30am-7pm. Thursday, 10:30am-9pm. Friday, 10am-10pm, Saturday-Sunday, 11am-8pm.Sammy's L.A. Pastrami is known for their pastrami sandwiches & burgers, which has been placed on hold on my "to-try" list! They also serve handmade lemonades, hotdogs, and fries!This small joint deserves way more credit than it gets!! One of my homegirls, @Jessica, recommended this place to me about a week ago. Since then, I've been TRYING to wait patiently until the day I finally get to test it out! This was it!It is a family-runned business and I got to speak with one of the family members (shout out to Brian!). First and foremost, the service was incredible! Brian was indeed USEFUL, FUNNY, & COOL!! He was extremely patient with my friend and I (since I was a newbie, I was asking a bunch of questions. Lol) So... be nice!! =)& TO THE FOOD: On this journey I got to try...-Pastrami dog: a beef dog with mustard, cheese, & pastrami on top! Absolutely unique & tasty!*There are more dogs @ the Decatur location if that's what you are craving =)*-Fried Zucchini & Mushrooms w/ranch: C'mon now, who has fried mushrooms?!! BOMB!! & this was also the first time I've tried fried zucchini, DOUBLE BOMB!-Garlic Romano fries: Extreme crisp perfection! The fries are also perfect size. There are small, medium, and large options (they are pretty generous servings, so you'll get your money's worth!)-Handmade Pomegranate Lemonade:  This definitely caught my attention!! =D While we were waiting for our food to be made, our drinks were given to us (AND REFILLS WERE INSISTED!- THAT DESERVES A 6TH STAR IN MY BOOK). Zestyyyy!The menu is beautiful, the descriptions will surely make your mouth water, and the food is definite REALITY! Enjoy!!What a shame as my first review was a well deserved 5 Star rating!Oh Sammy baby...what has happened to you?I had been bragging to my boyfriend who is a big fan of anything Pastrami so we finally had the time to stop by and get our grub on...eh hem I mean attempt to.We walk up and place our order for two LA style pastrami sandwiches, order of garlic fries and a large soda. He says $30 dollars as I am handing him my two for one coupon he says "ugh" then says OK $20 dollars. Yes I shit you not he actually groaned "UGH" after presenting him with their coupon.Anyhow, I have a bad feeling from the start. This guy is sweating buckets, he is blinded by the sweat in his eyes that he drops our cup on the dirty ground and picks it up and fills it. Wow! He hands us our drink and says 20 minutes. He did not bother washing his hands after just handling our money as he begins throwing stuff on the grill for the order that is before ours.This guy clearly did not want to be here working that is for sure!We go and stand on the side of the building where the door to the kitchen is open, bad mistake as my bf started to add up all of the health violations. I was embarrassed as my experience picking up food here previously was a world of difference. Where was the mature sweet couple who was smiles behind the counter at? The people that were so full of life and excited to explain and suggest menu items? They are a thing of the past I suppose? :(I swear we waited 10 minutes and still our order had not been started and at that point all I could think of was how bad this guy needs a shower and how I will throw up if I see him touch my food with his bare hands after seeing him break health code upon health code violation.The kitchen was disgusting and not once did we see this guy wash his hands. His behavior was odd as well, he clearly was angered at having to work it seemed as he was slamming stuff around in the kitchen. We waited...waited...waited....and then I was to the point of just flat out disgusted so I walked right up to him and said I would like my money back as we have decided not to dine here. He said "how much you give me"? I replied 20.00 he reached into his pocket and gave me 20.00 and that was that nothing else said. He actually seemed happy that he did not have to bother with making our order.The end...What a disappointment, not sure if they sold the business or what however I can tell you this is the beginning of the end for them if this keeps up!I will never be back in fact you could not pay me to come back to this hot mess of a once great operation!!!So sad...I have recently discovered that very yummy things come from tiny little buildings. The menu here at Sammy's L.A. Pastrami & Burgers offers a variety of options for such a small place. The outside is nothing pretty to look at but sometimes it is those places that surprise you. There is a small seating area near a walk up window if you want to enjoy your food outside. There are easy to read menus along the building of the drive-thru it is just hard deciding what to try from it. My man had to try the "L.A Style Pastrami". It was a BIG hit! It has pastrami, mustard and pickles on a sub style roll. They have 3 different sizes with the extra large being $12.99! I wouldn't recommend the extra large unless you plan to share with somebody or plan to have more then 1 meal out of it because he got the large at $9.69 and it was almost too much pastrami. Not that he complained or didn't finish every bite because he did! The guy at the window said the bad for you fried foods were all hand breaded and that they use fresh ingredients and I was craving something I could dip in ranch so I chose the "Variety Platter" at $7.99. I picked battered zucchini slices, fried mushrooms and fried mozzarella sticks. The zucchini was the best part! It really wasn't greasy and had great flavor. The fried mushrooms were good but I can't say I would order them again. The mozzarella sticks were perfect. The batter tasted good and the cheese wasn't rubbery like most places it was really stringy and super good. The ranch was thick and creamy. I really like this place and will be back regularly. There is plenty of options for burgers or chicken sandwiches. They also have a philly cheese steak that looks like it would be good. The menu says their shakes are made with "thrifty" ice cream. The "Garlic Romano Fries" are on my radar for next time.Plan to wait a while while your food is being made. It is being made fresh so it does take some time.When you come here be prepared to wait a bit for your food. It is well worth the wait. The food is prepared fresh and the dressings are made from scratch. They have a walk up window, a few seats outside and the drive thru. I used a $14 for $20 yelp deal and the guy took it with no problem. I ordered a hot link with pastrami, jalapenos, and extra mustard. It was freaking delicious. I also had garlic romano fries and split a pastrami melt with my wife. The fries live up to the name and everyone should order these. The pastrami had great flavor. The pastrami is really the star attraction here if you are going to try anything and it comes in different sizes. I asked for a side of ranch for the garlic fries and they were out so the guy suggested some other sauce. I said sure and it turned out to be a perfect pairing. It tasted like thousand island but with no pickles or relish it was just sauce and good! Everything was great and The yelp deal just made it better.7/5/2014  4:15 PM  Saw a Yelp review from Brandon (yesterday July 4th) & figured they were OPEN! They were OPEN alright.. The doors were WIDE open, no bug screens, lady on the phone was sweeping with a broom used on the interior of the establishment. Then sweeps the garage out the back door that was propped open. Uses the same broom on the concrete outside... NO HEALTH GRADE POSTED.  My boyfriend having worked in the food industry in the past takes one look at it & says, "if you feel like getting sick, SURE! Let's go".  I figured it was like the one on E. Tropicana... NO. The one on Tropicana makes this place look amazing.Now we get to the front and I'm still being optimistic.  She's still sweeping & sees us standing there patiently waiting.  She gets off the phone, I smile ask her how are you.  Just being my usual friendly self. She hands us a menu that's greasy... Gross.  Boyfriend takes one look at it & says, "Nothing looks appealing on this menu but I guess I'll try the wings".  She tells us there's no wings.. Okay then I'll just stick to my original order of Pastrami Chili Cheese fries (I've had them once at the other location, strangely delicious despite the weird idea).She tells me the total is $13 and some change for a large order of Pastrami Chili Cheese fries. I said that's fine, hand her my card. She never once asked for my ID when it's written on the back (instead of my name just in case it's ever stolen).  I usually hand them my ID if they need to compare signatures.Here's what breaks my optimism.  She opens the freezer, turns the cold water on the faucet, doesn't use the soap dispenser in reach. I guess to her she "washes" her hands in the cold water & grabs the paper towels to dry off.  I then with a disgusted look on my face, asked her, "do you have SOAP back there?", eyeing in the direction of the empty soap dispenser on the wall.  She turns to me and says, "EH? Soap? YEAH Yeah", then DIPS HER HANDS IN THE SECOND SINK WITH STANDING WATER.  "See I wash, there's soap".  My face went from disgusted to HORRIFIED, one of my biggest PHOBIAS is standing water. My stomach turned & flopped a few times as she continues to "wash" up.She asks me, "want me to cancel?", I replied "YES".  She hands my credit card back to me (I'm shocked I even got it back, I would of never known).  She tells me, "Okay, no charge". We walked back to the car & left.INSTEAD we went to Roberto's in Spring Valley. Cross streets Rainbow & Sunset.  We spent about the same amount as they were charging here.  MINUS all the health code violations & they had an A grade posted as we walked in.  DON'T GO HERE!!!!!!

I'll just come right out & say it. Service sucked! Period. From the moment we sat down & weren't serviced, to the times we had empty glasses & weren't serviced, to the times we asked for bread & weren't serviced, to when we got the $300+ bill and it took them 10 or more minutes to pick it up. BUT, the food was great. So weigh it out, folks... Bad service but great food... Bad service but great food. Some (myself included) would say we expect both. In which case, look for fine dining elsewhere. It's Vegas, baby. There are plenty of other choices, just take your pick. ....and Good Luck ; )

Restaurant name  Gluuteny Bakery

Review Text :
I end up at Gluuteny every single time I visit Squirrel Hill because I want to love this bakery, and now that I've tried almost all their offerings in the way of prepared goods I can safely say, "It's okay."  Their brownies ($2.50) are the best thing they make in my book: they're better than most "normal" brownies. So good they don't taste gluten-free? Hell yeah, I'll make that claim!The pumpkin and lemon loafs ($5) are addictive: I ate one small loaf in a day...by myself...and then I ate another one...don't judge me! The pumpkin tart ($2.50) is also really good.The muffins ($2) come in blueberry, orange cranberry and chocolate chip, and are on the spongy side but their flavor is spot on. The cookies ($2), however, aren't done right; the sugar cookies are slathered in what can only be described as a suspicious amount of frosting. The other varieties, like chocolate chip and walnut chocolate chip, are just too crunchy to be enjoyable. What can I say? I like soft cookies.If you're gluten-free this is a good place to stock up on pizza crust and pancake mixes, bread, muffins or any other pastry mix your heart desires; the lady in front of me bought fifty bucks worth of stuff!The girls behind the counter that rock some of the cutest haircuts in all of PGH are willing to answer any questions or explain that you need to cook the pizza at a higher temperature to get the crust the right texture. Plus, you can order birthday cakes.I have tested out a lot of Vegan and Gluten-free desserts over the last few years, and they can range from being terrible to great.  Gluuteny kind of falls right in the center quality wise for me, although they do fill a much needed void in Pittsburgh.  I came in here to test out some goods to decide if I should buy treats for my godmother here for the holidays.  I always taste test GF options before gifting because too often they are not good.First, the staff is very friendly.  I tried a sample of a garlic cheddar bagel while making my selection, and while the garlic was a bit overpowering, it was pretty good in the scheme of GF goods.  I decided to order a double chocolate cookie ($3.99).  The price was skewed a touch high, but the cookie was very large.  It could easily be dessert after two or three meals.  The actual cookie was lacking in flavor, though.  There was a slight after taste, and the texture didn't quite line up.  The cookie was clearly covered in sugar, and I wonder what exactly is going into these cookies.  Overall, it was OK, but I won't be purchasing any gifts here.  They do hit on my pet peeve of not marking prices, which is a real downer.  Also, it is unclear which options are vegan.  $8 card minimum.

Review Text :
How did I only give Z's three stars the first time I was here?  This update is overdue as I have been here 2-3 times since my first review.They have been consistently delicious and fresh.  4 star all the way.  The atmosphere is ok, nothing special.  Free wifi is a bonus.  But the quality food makes up for it by far.Three stars?  What was going on?  I'm going to have to have a talk with myself and get back to you on that.  Three stars?  Seriously?I was a virgin until today... that is a Z's Greek virgin!  So was Christina P!We decided to try it for the first time together... and I think we were both pleasantly surprised.  I'm actually rounding up from a 3.5 rating since I'm in a good mood... but if you're in the mood for Greek, I recommend trying this place; especially if you don't care much about atmosphere.  The place itself feels a bit like a fast food restaurant.  It's a fast casual concept where you order at the counter and they bring your food to you.  They also check-in to make sure everything is ok; extremely friendly staff.We shared a hummus appetizer and I had a large Greek Salad with chicken.  Christina went for a falafel pita.  Their pita is fresh and moist and I ate more than my share of it... the hummus is good too but maybe missing a little something.  My salad was perfectly dressed and came with lots of chicken.  The chicken wasn't the best I've had but I'm extremely picky when it comes to chicken; i ate most of it anyways.  The prices are extremely reasonable.The reason I am rounding up my rating?  WiFi and drive through... yes, they have a working drive through and I can guarantee I will be taking advantage of that sometime soon!I will be back; nice to have another solid Greek restaurant in my 'hood!A welcome change from the boring assembly line of "kronos" style gyros.  Everything here has a fuller flavor than more other Greek restaurants.  A particular hats off to their pita. Four stars and a big Opa! to these guys.Best. Gyro. Ever. Yes, they have plenty of other items on the menu, but for me, their Gyro is the gold standard by which all others are measured. A typical visit to Z's with my FFY* consists of reviewing the menu, considering new things and then deciding to get what we always order. If it isn't broken, don't fix it!  My personal favorites are: Gyro - Z's is generously filled to nearly bursting with juicy and flavorful Grecian Delight. No Kronos here, like so many others serve. I like mine without the tomato and onion, so I can enjoy the cool lettuce and perfect amount of tatziki, embraced by a soft, warm, pillowy pita. I have yet to finish one, but have certainly enjoyed trying! Falafel appetizer - crisp on the outside and tender inside, these falafel are complimented by a side of hummus and warm pita. If you are really in the mood for a decadent and potentially heart-stopping treat, try the Z's Crazy Fries. These fries, topped with cheddar and Feta cheese, are fantastic when dipped in tatziki! While this family-run restaurant is not going to blow you away with its beauty or ambiance, you will keep coming back for the food and the friendly staff. Now if I can only convince them to move a bit closer to where I live... * FFY - Favorite Former Yelper

Restaurant name  Shabu Shabu Paradise

Review Text :
I am always in search of good shabu shabu / fondue / hot pot places, and Shabu Shabu Paradise in Henderson delivers!Their menu is only shabu shabu, which can be a good thing and bad.  If your dining companions aren't into cooking their meal themselves, then this place won't work for them.  However, they can always stuff themselves on the appetizers like cod fish, salads, and beef misoyakiAll entrees come with a green salad, rice, selected veggies, tofu, noodles, and three dipping sauces.The Big F went for the King #18 ( 1/2 Beef,  1/2 Shrimp, and  1/2 Scallop) for $25 and I went for the Jack #1 (Original Beef) for $18.As the water, lightly seasoned with seaweed, heats up, a small green salad with yummy dressing starts you off.  Feel free to ask for more because they are more than happy to give it to you!Then your table gets set up with your rice, various raw veggies and food, and your three dipping sauce.  The first being a peanut sauce, then a ponzu one, and then a spicy ponzu-like one.The pot is split so you don't have to worry about your dining companion stealing your food! When the water starts to boil, start adding the food.  I don't recommend adding all the food at once, but rather a little bit at a time.  I like to swish my beef around just to cook it a tad before dipping it into the various sauces.The beef and shrimp were great choices, but the scallops got rubbery too quickly.  (Reading Steve X.'s review, I wish were given soy sauce and wasabi so we could have eaten the scallops raw as well.  Bummer!  At least we know for next time!)What makes Shabu Shabu Paradise a step up above Swish is that they also give you additional veggies without charging for it!  It seems a bit ridiculous to be charged for what is considered inexpensive veggies when you're cooking it yourself!  And to close it off, complimentary ice cream with fruit cocktail is offered!Service is great - the waitresses are really sweet and friendly about bringing you additional things as requested or when they see you need it.  It can get a bit hectic when the restaurant fills up as it started to on the Saturday evening we went.They have about three tables for four and one long table that seats about 10-12.  You'll definitely see us back here again when we're in the area! (Pics are posted!)I'm upping my stars to "five" because Shabu Shabu Paradise is just a great spot to eat at!They have since added "sukiyaki"-style as an alternative option to the seaweed broth for shabu shabu.  It's not the kind of sukiyaki where the plate is sizzling and the sauce is thick, rather it's the flavoring of the broth is now different.The Husband ordered the Queen Half Pork and Half Beef Dinner, (You can easily substitute the meats for each other, chicken for pork or beef, etc.)  while I had the Jack Scallop Dinner.  When my plate arrived, we were both very surprised with how much scallop came out.  Laid out ever so nicely, the quality grade is definitely sashimi-style.  (After reading about Steve X.'s experience, I was certain to ask for some wasabi and soy sauce so I could it raw.)As Calvin L. mentioned, the noodles given to you are tofu noodles and they are SO good!  We definitely requested more of that because it's  yummy and definitely not something you see often.Service is always exceptional.  Sometimes it can get a bit busy and you have to wait awhile longer, but the staff are so nice and friendly.  The wait can easily be overlooked.Overall, Shabu Shabu Paradise is a bit pricier when you first look at the menu.  But in the end, when you get unlimited salad, rice, veggies, tofu noodles, and free ice cream dessert (vanilla with green tea powder this time), it's well worth it!We're more than happy to eat there when we're in the area!* Check out their website because they have Monday night specials and daily specials too!We just love  this restaurant, even though there is another shabu-shabu restaurant closer to us.  The Wife usually orders the "shabu-shabu style"  seaweed based broth, while I always order the "sukiyaki style" soy sauce based broth.  Both are mild in flavor.  The broth is placed in a stainless steel bowl on top of an induction cooker in front of you.  They have also creatively crafted a bowl shaped in a yin and yang, so that two people can enjoy both broths at the same time.  What a great idea!You select the type of meat, poultry or seafood you desire.  I get either beef, pork or a mixture of both.  The Wife usually orders the raw sea scallops.  We found out that the scallops are sushi grade and not the tiny ones.  Forget cooking them in the broth, we just eat these neatly sliced and scrumptious raw scallops after dipping them straight into a mixture of soy sauce and wasabi.  Another great thing about this place, is that the vegetables are unlimited.  Also, the salad is so tasty.  It's has this awesome dressing that is mayo-based, tangy, and has a slight sweet finish.  I usually end up ordering at least 2-3 salads because of that damn dressing.  The main reason why I love this place is all about those tofu noodles.  This was where I had this type of noodle for the first time.  I always go insane and ask for heaps of it.  It's unlimited!!!  It's all about the texture of these noodles.  This noodle is perfect for shabu-shabu because no matter how long you leave it in the boiling hot broth, the noodle it's texture.  It does not get mushy.  It's so hard to describe its texture because it's slippery and soft but has a slight crunch to it.  It's like eating jellyfish in a jellyfish salad.  It's out of this world for my mouth!!!!  (i mean the noodles....hmmm maybe also the jellyfish salad, but i love both)  Because of the mild flavor of the broths, after cooking each piece meat, vegetable, and tofu noodles, you are able to flavorize them by dipping them in either a peanut based, a ponzu, or a spicy ponzu sauce.  I love the spicy ponzu sauce because it has a good amount of heat and is just so tangy.  I highly recommend this place.  The service has always been excellent and the flavors and quality of food has been so consistent for the number of times we have gone there.  I can't wait to go back there again!!!My first shabu experience!Thank you Misti and Bobby for taking me to Shabu Shabu Paradise on Sunday night when I arrived to Vegas...From the salad to the seconds and thirds of veggies, I really enjoyed the meal.  I went with Jack (Single Portion) #2 - Large Shrimp Shabu-Shabu ($20).  It was a lot of food, and so much fun to cook up myself.  I enjoyed the dipping sauces too.  The nice thing about this cuisine is that despite eating a lot, I didn't feel overly full.  The food is pretty light, which I love!I will have to return, however, as I just read on Wikipedia that "Once the meat and vegetables have been eaten, leftover broth from the pot is customarily combined with the remaining rice, and the resulting soup is usually eaten last." ---- I didn't know this!  I left all of the leftover broth instead of eating it like soup!We skipped dessert and opted instead to treat ourselves to foot massages.  What a fabulous night!The Skinny: great service, reasonable prices, and a great ponzu sauce has me coming back again and again despite the lengthy drive - 30 miles, yo! (4), service: efficient service where a glass is never empty without asking, a waitress always asks whether you want more... (4.5), value: lunch is a better value for your dollar but dinner is also quite reasonable (4).High marks goes to all the Yelpers who love this place. I've been dying to try out Shabu Shabu Paradise and my hubby indulged me after being away from Vegas for 6 agonizing weeks. Due to my late flight in (which I won't even get into because it was possibly the worst flight of my life - whole different story), my hubby called ahead to ensure that they would take us in. The lady informed him that as long as we got into the restaurant before 9:30 pm, it would be okay. Sweet!So we squeeked in 15 minutes before closing and were welcomed (genuinely) by the waitress. She never left a beverage unfilled and kept bringing us all the accompaniments we needed without asking for it. She was the most efficient waitress we've had in a long time.Portion sizes for the meat are Jack ($18; only one choice of protein), Queen ($18 for 2 choices of protein) and King ($23 for two choices of protein) and they serve finely sliced kurobata pork, organic chicken and high quality beef. Seafood (scallop, shrimp) are extra. Veggies plates are unlimited and include: green onion, sliced bamboo, carrot, napa cabbage, tofu (medium soft), and tofu noodles. Mushrooms are an extra $3 as a side or can be ordered as the vegetarian only option ($12) and the choices include shittake, enoki and maitaki varieties. Your meal will also include unlimited salad and a bowl of ice cream for dessert during dinner time.Shabu shabu here is the thing to order - a simple broth made with seaweed (kombu) served with the freshest vegetables you have and the best quality meat you can find. The ponzu is fantastic - the strong citrus flavouring of yuzu really comes through and tantalizes your tastebuds. So good! The sesame sauce adds a sweet richness to the cooked ingredients. Spicy ponzu has quite a kick - be forewarned!The sukiyaki is similar to the shabu shabu however the broth is derived from a sweet soy sauce. You eat the sukiyaki without any adornments.There are a couple reasons though, this restaurant does not get a full 5-stars.First, the waygu beef is sliced a little too thin for my tastes. When you have something as luxurious as waygu, it is best served in thicker slices for you to enjoy the melt-in-your-mouth-ness. When sliced so thin, it is hard to tell the difference between wagyu and regular beef due to it's tendency to be overcooked. (FYI - cook the meat only to pink if you ordered wagyu - otherwise the cow will haunt your dreams for such an egregious insult). Tip: try the wagyu during lunch time as it's more affordable in combination with the 20% lunch coupon.Secondly, the sukiyaki broth a little thin for my tastes - I really like a slightly thicker flavoured broth.  Finally, the dessert was rather poor considering the quality of the other parts of the meal: a scoop of ice cream with either chocolate sauce, green tea powder, or strawberry sauce then topped with canned fruit. To be honest, some small slices of fresh fruit would have been more preferable.Overall, the experience fulfilled my craving for an Asian soul food winter staple. Coupled with some really great lunch/dinner coupons, it cleared up the sniffles better than chicken soup and is good on the wallet! 4 star review.Shabu Shabu Paradise has been our favorite place for shabu shabu for quite awhile now.  We go there often, and we love that the waitress remembers specific details about how we like our food and condiments.  (Specifically, the evening waitress since we see her the most.)This year, I haven't been able to indulge in their raw scallops, so we've been ordering their beef only.  (Pretty soon though, I'll be back on the raw scallop diet!  Yes, you can eat their scallops raw - ask for some soy sauce and wasabi.)  Sometimes I'll pick the mushroom option for a little change though.They also have raw garlic paste which is nice to add to your ponzu sauce, be sure not to add it to your broth because it'll boil over and make a mess! We love their salad and dressing - no iceberg lettuce here!  And we love the free refills on that!We love their veggies and of course, can't get enough of their tofu noodles.  Yes, free refills on all of that too!Most recently, we did the whole split plate charge (courtesy of reading Bobby Y.'s review).  It says there on the menu that they'll charge you $6 for a split plate and here, it's so worth it!  We ordered one item from the Jack menu and paid the additional six.  This worked out well since I wasn't eating that much beef and the Husband could have it all to himself for the most part.  Meanwhile, I still get my fill on the salad, rice, veggies, tofu noodles, and dessert too!  Not a bad way to spend $6 in my opinion!And you can't help but love that they give coupons out every time you visit - it's hard getting there within the next 20 days though.  Their lunch prices can't be beat either - free beer or soda?! Wow!  (And as one friend pointed out, it's a real full glass of beer...not a tiny little one.)***3 STARS***Not to shabby for decent shabu shabu!I've had shabu shabu back to my home-home (SoCal) and although I may not be an expert, I do know that it isn't supposed to be THIS pricey! I was visiting my grandma and had bookmarked this place since it was only a couple blocks away from her neighborhood.[atmosphere]It may seem a bit dark inside due to the red walls and such, but the tables and environment is clean and well kept. It isn't quite as fancy nor hole-in-the-wall, it's somewhere in between mom-and-pop and neighborhood local spot.[devour]*Q-8 1/2 SHRIMP & 1/2 SCALLOP ($20, **3 STARS**) When you receive your order, you would think, "THAT'S IT?!?!?!" Lo and behold, your order also comes with unlimited veggies, 3 dipping sauces (sesame peanut, ponzu and spicy), and a bowl of white rice. After cooking your fresh shrimp and scallops in the seaweed broth (shabu shabu) alongside with the unlimited veggies, you're full and you didn't know it. If you wanted to add other additional stuff like ramen ($3) or shitake mushrooms ($2) or other items, it will cost an additional arm and a leg. I had always thought that stuff is a given and comes with your order..... I guess not!But was my dish worth $20? Probably not! I think it was worth $12-$14 at the most. And if you want prices like that, you would probably have to go here during their lunch hours. [imbibe]Green Tea was as expected - divine. Glad they didn't use fake stuff here! ($2)[service]Awesome! We were well taken care of by our lovely waitress. She was able to answer all the questions we had on the menu. She was very kind and considerate and couldn't have asked for more! (**4 STARS**)The flavors here were okay. I wouldn't say it was the best nor the worst. In addition, the prices were a bit steep for shabu shabu. I liked the fact that the food wasn't salty, but felt there needed some additional seasoning somewhere. If I were to come back here, I would try their sukiyaki instead of the shabu shabu. It may be a better choice. And if I were to also come back, it would be during lunch since the prices would be more reasonable.Yelp 2013 100 for 100 Challenge - Review #43Although this place is technically in Henderson and not Las Vegas-proper, I'm going to say it------ I think Vegas does beat SF in all forms of Japanese food. It was hard for me to find a quality Shabu place in Vegas that even matched what I was used to in the Bay Area, but Shabu Shabu Paraside has blown everything out of the water for me!This place isn't huge by any means, so reservations are a must. At first I thought we were lost, since we ended up at a strip mall where nothing else looked occupied. Luckily, the Best of Las Vegas sign confirmed we were in the right place. I never have been able to finish my plates of meat at any shabu shabu place, but I finished the Jack-sized portion here because it was simply delicious and mouth-watering. The veggies are fresh and AYCE. The one con I would say is mushrooms don't come with it, but they can be ordered as a side for $3 (and you get your choice of two different kinds). Their ponzu sauce has a very bright flavor, their sesame sauce tastes like the best aspects of Kare Kare sauce (Filipino dish with a peanut sauce base), and their spicy sauce was unfortunately too spicy for me, but I'm sure does the trick for those requiring that kick of heat. They have an array of ice cream options for dessert and they gave me a great idea of a dish to do at home - vanilla ice cream with matcha green tea powder on top. Service here never left us wanting, even when it got super busy. One server was juggling everyone effortlessly and never missed a beat. I will definitely be making the trip out to Henderson to enjoy this place again!.. Honestly, as soon as we left, I was already eager to go back.

When did the Wheel of Sin become the Wheel of Suck? Seriously, when I started going to Diablo's for happy hour the wheel had many awesome items for a mere $2...fast forward to 2011 and the items on the wheel are $5 and $7. Um, since when is a $7 shot of Patron considered a good happy hour deal? Or how about a $5 Pacifico? With all of the other awesome drink deals on the strip I am saying adios to the Wheel of Suck.Walking down Las Vegas Blvd on a sweltering summer afternoon, passing all of these more or less rock bottom priced beer and drink places, we made The Mistake of Massive Proportions and went into Diablo's. Why? It looked good from the outside. And it had those two magic words: Happy and Hour.We ordered two margaritas, chips and salsa. In Vegas. Where drinks are more or less free. The Diablo "margaritas" were more like watered down 99 Cents Store Lemon Lime sodas and the chips came with three tiny wasabi-sized bowls with non-spicy salty green sauces. The bill: $32! I asked, "Isn't this Happy Hour?" But my real question should have been, "Happy for who?" Oh, and the $32 included a $4 CHARGE for the chips and salsa!!! WTF!!! When was the last time you paid for chips and salsa? Uh... never! Moral: Don't judge a book by its cover. Especially when it's called Diablo's. Better you go sell your soul somewhere else.I came in for lunch with two girlfriends while staying at the Monte Carlo - we were starving and Diablo's looked pretty cool from the outside.  I ordered a shrimp salad which literally had exactly 3 shrimp sliced in half lengthwise then flipped over (cut side facing down) to appear to be 6 shrimp.  That, however,  is the least of my complaints.One of the girls ordered tacos and asked for Tapatio. You know, a bottle of Tapatio.  She received a side of 3 salsas.  When she pointed out that this wasn't what she wanted the waitress told her they didn't have any and walked away.... adding a $6 charge for the salsas she delivered.My other friend ordered a hamburger.  It didn't come with mayo so she asked for some.  The waitress brought a small side of mayo... adding a $3 charge to the bill.  (Notice a pattern here?)About halfway through the burger my friend wasn't looking so hot. She said it tasted funny.  In an instant there she goes running to the ladies room to vomit it back up...  She came back to the table  practically green.We reported this to our waitress who obviously didn't care at all or apologize - she simply rolled her eyes, took the burger away and dropped off the bill. After noticing that we had still been charged for the burger in addition to the $6 salsa charge and $3 mayo charge we asked to speak with a manager. The manager approached our table with attitude and before we could even tell him that the burger made me friend sick he said that he already knew and he "tasted her burger and it tasted fine to me - maybe she threw up because of alcohol."  I explained that we hadn't started drinking yet - it was only lunch time. When I brought up the charges for condiments. (Seriously?! THREE DOLLARS FOR MAYONNAISE?!) I told him "I've never been charged for condiments at a restau-" he interupted me and said, "Well, we do."  I told him they should at least tell people instead of just bringing it out then adding it to the bill.  He snipped back "Oh, well I guess you expect me to comp the whole bill then?"  I wasn't going to argue with that.  "Yes, that would be great.  Thank you."  We threw down some cash for the tip only and walked out. I'd give them a zero rating if I could. The food made one of us sick, they charge for everything to pad the bill, and the manager that I dealt with was a rude prick. I wouldn't go there again if they paid me.A seductive female devil sporting a two piece bikini, thigh high boots and a pitch fork surrounded by flames & palm trees got my attention.  While staying at the Monte Carlo on Las Vegas Blvd we thought we hit the jackpot having a Diablo's Cantina attached to the hotel.    The food was kick-ass, I will give them that.  The guacamole was creamy, packed with just the right amount of heat and was topped with diced tomatoes & a sprinkle of fresh sea salt.  We also ordered the chicken nachos, holy shit they were huge.   They had to have weighed at least 5 pounds.  Fresh crisp tortilla chips layered with melted cheese, shredded chicken and lines of sour cream.  Seated at the tables closest to the side walks enjoying the people watching we were spotted by a couple we knew and they joined us for some drinks.  They asked the server to bring us another round clearly saying that the round was on them.  The server not only charged them, but when we received our bill, we were also charged for the same drinks.  I explained to her that you already charged the couple who left for those drinks, and as good as they were I did not lose track of how many $7.50 margaritas I drank.  She then played dumb and sent over the manager.  The manager showed up running his mouth like he wanted to fight. Already having had several drinks & knowing how little the LVPD tolerates patrons beating up a manager of a bar no matter how rude and obnoxious he was, I simply smiled, stiffed the waitress on the tip & left.Until the incident with the blatant double charging of the drinks and the unnecessary attitude from the manager I thought the food, drinks & atmosphere were 5 stars!! Just a heads up to Diablo's staff, dumb clueless servers who hustles there customers with her pimp like manager's support gets you very few stars.The service is so horrendous it's laughable. The food is mediocre at best. Came in with a party of 7. The place was busy, but not insane. I ordered a skinny margarita. Not bad. After I got my drink I had decent expectations. Table got guac and chips. Not very good albeit expensive. My chicken quesadilla was greasy and tasted like canned chicken. My boyfriend got fish tacos, and they were a little better, but bland. Our server was basically non-existent. My friend had to ask three different ppl for a lemon for her water. The food runner brought her some, after a ridiculous wait for our food. We would have ordered more cocktails, however we didn't get the opportunity to. Don't even bother. This is Vegas. There are much better restaurants. My wallet hurts from the price gouge.Disclaimer: this is only for the bar area and drinksCame here during the early evening hours before our dinner reservations elsewhere. Seated at the bar we ordered beers and margaritas. Service didn't not disappoint and the drinks were great. The margaritas may be on the pricier side but you get what you pay for. Quality then you don't need quantity! We'd return for drinks next time we are in the area.We happened to be on the strip to try a different place of dining.  Every time we walked by it smells so good so why not try it.  We were greeted and seated immediately.  We had great service here with a friendly waitress and quick food delivery.  The dining area has much seating for the Vegas visitors with the bar located near the front.  There are plenty of tv screens around the entire place for a big game you just can't miss.  We decided to split the Combo Nachos which had steak, chicken and cheese.  We were actually going to order something else when we were informed how large the nachos were.  She was right.  This could be easily split between two or three people.  Just because it was a huge portion doesn't mean it's great.  They were very bland to me.  I tried adding hot sauce but their only hot sauce available was burn your stomach hot.  Pretty disappointed. If you need a drink you'll be safe ordering here but if it's food you are looking for, I'd keep searching.There are degrees of devilish creatures. There are some that are bad ass scary ones like Lucifer himself; and, there are some who are cute and not scary at all like Casper. Diablo's Cantina was neither or. In the world of devilish creatures, this Mexican restaurant is more like a creak in your wall that you brushed off thinking that it was nothing and wasn't paranormal activity. It's forgettable at best.We ventured out to find cheap food and ended up here. After all, how expensive could this be? Some tacos and a glass of pop and free chips and salsa? Yeah, we were dead wrong. The diablo has spoken and this must have been what selling your soul to the devil actually felt like because the diablo for sure robbed us.First off, chips and salsa weren't free. What kind of Mexican place is this? "El diablo." *shaking hands in the air* No devil would give you shit for free. Remember that.Well, one thing free is scantily clad waitresses. Luckily, they did have hot bods so it was okay to dress minimally like that. It went with the whole devil temptation thing and if you succumbed to it, you would probably get apple instead of taco and condemned to all eternity to jail.Our server was a dude and dressed complete with full length pants and shirt. WTF man. Where's my temptation? He acted smooth and flirty but nope. Unless he showed up wearing short short and midriff top, I ain't buying his act.I ordered quesadilla and pepsi. My coworker ordered tortilla soup and steak fajita. All tasted okay and edible. They weren't the best thing we ever ate but it was okay. No devilish punch or tickle or red trident stuck us in the gut. It was just okay. The check came. Mine was close to $30 with tip. My coworker's was over $40 with tip. Not okay. Diablo's Cantina.. You are truly evil for taking too much of our money and didn't give us chips and salsa. Hope you burn in hell!

Cheeburger, Cheeburger!It's a restaurant called Cheeburger, Cheeburger!!The little kid in me squealed with delight. Like pasghetti and sammiches, cheeburgers are one of those willfully mispronounced foodstuffs that bring back a little nostalgia. They remind me of those rare days when we'd all pile in my chain smoking babysitter's Caddy and cruise to McD's for cheeburgers, cheapo happy meal toys, and a romp in the pee covered ball pin. Urine, second hand smoke, and cheeburgers. I couldn't fathom a better combination at that age.Then again we didn't have Cheeburger, Cheeburgers when I was a kid. If we did I'd be eating my kid's meal out of a super sweet pink hot rod that looks almost identical to the Barbie mobile, sippin' my hand shaken soda and munchin' on a cheeburger, American, ketchup. I'm in my twenties but I still wanted one of those little card stock car boxes, even if my taste in toppings has become a bit more adventurous.Just because my tastebuds have matured doesn't make me any more decisive now than I was then. Not a good thing with a place that boasts 50 or so toppings for you burger (or chicken sandwich, or salad-- they're all based on the same "every order is a special order" model). I didn't even attempt to figure out what kind of fancy pants shake or soda flavor I wanted (100 flavors, people! 100!!) and just kept it simple with a glass of water in a mason jar. The fries vs. onion rings debate was also too heated, but a basket of crisp and delicious frings came to the rescue. The onion rings were thin and lightly battered, definitely the better of the two options, and the fries were fresh cut and uber greasy, just how I like 'em, even if they were under-salted.In the end I went with a Classic green chile cheddar burger with the traditional fixins (lettuce, tomato, onion, mayo, mustard, ketchup). It was cooked to a perfect medium and the price was right, ringing in at about 5 bucks. I agree that the top bun was way too big in comparison to the bottom, but I solved that by shaving half of it off so I could wrap my mouth around that thick slab of meat, because let's face it people, the bun is just filler. It's all about the meat. It was messy and juices were dripping all over my face, and I must have gone through at least four paper towels, but hot diggity damn, it was a great burger.The smallest burger possible (the Classic) is about five ounces or so and they increase incrementally until you reach the big mamba jamba 20 ounce 'nother nail in the coffin coronary on a bun. I can't even guess how many pieces of cheese it takes to cover that beast. I did however witness two people finish this outrageous burger while I was enjoying my dainty (by comparison) fare. Both gastric champions had their pictures taken with a gigando stuffed cheeburger (I would have worn it as a hat), and then had their image pasted on the wall of shame...err...fame.My inner child's parting words are: "Cheeburger! Cheeburger! Go eat cheeeeeburgerrrrrs!"My more mature counterpart: "Ahem, a myriad of combinations are possible between burgers, shakes and sides, variety enough to satisfy even the most discerning of palates and leave everyone...CHEEBURGER!!!"P.S. Fuck Red Robin in its bony little chicken wing. This place is miles ahead of that bland dump.

Review Text :
I wanted to eat Ramen today, but the Ramen world is just so complicated.  I can't go to Monta anymore because the tall Japanese girl who works there figured out who I am and she has been treating me real bad since I posted that bad review about the place. I can't go to Shuseki anymore because it turns out the psycho old man from Ichiza eats there every night, and he is still pissed off at me because a few months ago  I made a very unflattering impersonation of him. I don't want to go to Anime Ramen anymore because ever since Ryosuke went back to Japan, the service and food has been bad. I hope he comes back soon. So, I was just about to go to Yagyu for Ramen when I remembered that SUSHI TWISTER is owned by the same dude who owns RAMEN SORA. So in my head I was like: "Maybe Sushi Twister will have Miso Ramen since they are owned by the Sora people!". The very thought of me eating AYCE Sushi and Sapporo Style Ramen at the same time overstimulated my brain. I was very disappointed when I arrived at TWISTER to see no Ramen on the menu. But, after ordering two pieces of Nigiri and having a great conversation with the Japanese sushi chefs, my disappointment left instantly. This place actually has AYCE TORO! I have NEVER seen that before. But according to one of the workers, the AYCE TORO is like a random promotion. Some days when you show up they will have it, but most days they won't have it. So coming here for the AYCE TORO special is like gambling. The Tuna nigiri has the highest quality Tuna I have seen in years. It wasn't even Toro but it had that fatty marbling. The fish was so shinny that the light reflected off it like a shard of glass. The Tuna literally just instantly melts inside your mouth. The Eel Sauce with my Unagi was very strong. I don't know how they get the sauce to have that certain kind of deepness. I love places that make their own tempura sauce. Places that use that generic bottled stuff suck. SUSHI TWISTER has possibly the best Tempura sauce I have ever had. They got the best Sushi Rice on the face of the earth. It's seasoned perfectly! Many people don't have the sophistication to notice small details like that, but because I am so awesome I can.My personal favorite "Ichiro Mashita" roll is the Dead Dragon. You should try it! I also want to point out that this is the only AYCE Sushi place I have ever been to that puts wasabi in the nigri. Other AYCE Sushi places don't do this because they market their restaurant towards "westerners". I am actually really happy that I came here today. I had a very entertaining conversation with the a chef named Hiro. And all the workers were really great to me. When it comes to AYCE Sushi, Goyemon can't touch this place. Also, I rather come to small independent places like SUSHI TWISTER or SUSHI ON RAINBOW any day over one of Martin Kollefs multi-million dollar bankrolled hipster/douchebag sushi orgy places.UPDATE OCT- I've lowered the rating from 5 stars to 4 because one of the sushi chefs accused me of being "HOOTO". When I told him that I didn't know what that was, he began to describe the person. Eventually I figured out that he meant Hootie B.... I was like: Are you f*cking joking? Do I look like a middle aged man with a Korean wife? Apparently, he thought I was "Hooto" because I told him about how most people on Yelp want to kill me. Don't get me wrong. I am a big fan of Hooto reviews and his Sysco comments always have me rolling on the floor laughing, but how the hell do you confuse me as him?Ok, over the course of the last few months my love affair with Sushi Twister has intensified. Like any relationship, we have had our ups and down, but managed to beat the odds and continue our romance. The food is consistently delicious and the fish is fresh. Their rice to fish ratio still bothers me a bit, but I'll let it slide. There are times when the services is spotty (an older female server will leave you hanging for quite some time), but there are times when the service is pretty flawless. This weekend we had a young gentleman as our server as he was on top of his game. Their selection of nigiri is great and choices of baked and regular rolls vast. My favorites are Friday the 13th, Cowgirl, Oh My God, Ecstasy, and Rum Jungle. I also really enjoyed their baked mussels. I am two stamps away from a free AYCE meal...oooooh yeah!This review is mainly about their customer service. Dined here with some friends on a Friday night. Unfortunately for us they close at 11, so coming late in the evening we were left with an hour or so to eat. When we were seated our waitress seemed a little annoyed, which was just really upsetting. She stressed that the kitchen would be closing in 45 minutes and that she would just rather have us acye-ers place all of our orders at once. We did just that. She made frequent visits to the table and occasionally threw in comments such as, "Anything else? We all want to go home, you know."  No one at my table seemed to take offense, but I, however, found it very disrespectful. The restaurant was not yet closing so for her to just hate her life and take it out on poor, innocent customers was just rude.  It's unfortunate because the food was pretty good. I just can't get over the fact that our server had such a foul attitude the whole evening. It's like: Relax and smile a little. Everything's going to be OK. They have set such low standards for customer service that I can't bring myself to rate them more than three stars. Regardless of how good their food was. Meh. Sorry, not sorry.The night was young and the family was hungry. The family needed food fast. And I am not talking about plain restaurants, I was talking about delicious sushi chaos! So I knew the perfect place to tame the wild beasts of a family was the one and only, Sushi Twister!  It is also owned by Ramen Sora in Chinatown.The trip was a little farther than our home. It was on the other side of town and in a sketchy area. As we got there, we were disappointed and excited because of the long wait in line. It took 20 minutes! But once we got inside, the waitress brought our drinks in a jiffy. Now comes the sushiness you've been waiting for!So we started with a large order from the AYCE menu, the long wait had starved us. We got the usual rolls like caterpillar, dragon, and lots of salmon nigiri along with some of  their special rolls like the tiger yamazaki and the sushi-twister and ninja. The "salmon loves lemon" was slightly tart when eating with the slivers of lemon, but was oh so good! The crispy vacation roll was crunchy from the garlic flakes with a nice bit of spicy from the tuna.  The orders came so fast that we had to order MORE! We ordered the yellow mango with shrimp though the yellow mango was a bit overpowering. The baked scallop appetizer was a little too burnt on top and a bit oily for our taste. Baked mussels were also pleasing. The ordered chicken skewers brought us accidentally to another dish called the pork katsu with a tasteful sauce. All the rolls had good consistency.  The overall experience with the dishes were outstanding, just like the staff's fast and friendly service! The interior of the place was a tad bit tight, thus creating the long line. There was a projector screen which had the Sochi Olympics showing. It was a nice size for entertainment. The atmosphere was busy and the chef's were making those great rolls. The prices are comparable in town with kids 8 and under for half the adult prices.Overall the service and sushi overcame the long wait and trip so I gave them 5 stars. In the end we came home happy, stuffed, and satisfied!Before my Seattle trip, a friend and I had a sushi craving. The wonderful think about living in Las Vegas is having the option to go to AYCE (All you can eat) sushi joints. I've heard some really great things about this place from friends and neighbors. The best thing is that it's located right up the street from my house. This meal was a brainer. This joint is located on the southwest corner of a very busy strip mall. Walking into the restaurant, you'll notice that it's cozier inside than it looks outside. The joint has a few sushi bar top seating, a couple of high top tables and a few other table seating. Staying in place for a couple of hours, I've noticed that the servers do a good job turning out the tables so there's no wait. Speaking of our servers, they were very efficient. They always came by the table to see if we were alright and if we needed anything else. For the most part, good service. For my meal, I decided to get the All You Can Eat option for $26.95 per person. If you're going to have a few rolls, this would be the best option. Keep in mind though, this is one of  the only places I've noticed that holds everyone to the 1 hour limit. Whenever I go with the AYCE option, I tend to chow down on a lot of Nigiri sushi as it's usually a lot ala carte. On this visit, I went with the salmon, ahi and tako nigiri. The serving size was good and the fish was fresh! For other options, I went with chicken katsu, baked mussels, mochiko chicken, shrimp tempura and gyoza. All dishes were good. The katsu used white meat but had a nice crunch to it. For my gyoza, I asked for it steamed. It was flavored nicely and cooked nicely. Overall, the food is definitely worth returning to. The food came out fast, the service was nice and everything was super filling. If you're willing to eat in an hour and then leave, come down and check them out!Auntie Em, Auntie Em! It's a twister! It's a twister!!I've been hearing a lot of people say to me that Sushi Twister makes some of the best sushi in town. Well,not quite. But, Sushi Twister is making some good sushi over on the east side of Vegas. First, for those living on the east side near boulder highway and Trop, and around that area, this might be your only option for AYCE sushi. And, it's not really such a bad option.After walking in and sitting down at the bar, I was later told by the sushi chef that  Sushi Twister is owned by the same people that own Ramen Sora in Chinatown. I was expecting a lot, and I think that they delivered nicely.Ordered too much to analyse bit by bit, but will try to give an overall impression. I thought the fish and seafood quality was good, but not great. I also thought that the rice was a tad bit on the slightly sour side. I also thought that their signature sauce that they put on many of the apps and nigiri, sort of a yuzu-type soy sauce, was too sour as well. As for the apps, I really liked the chicken karage, it was crispy, well seasoned, and cooked very nicely.So, I like this spot, but it's a drive from me so i'll stick to my favoritos. But, for those that live in the area, this is a super solid option for those who don't wanna travel to Spring Mtn. Rd., but would still like some quality sushi.To me this is the best sushi place on the Eastside of las vegas.  More important when I have a sushi craving it's not far from where I live.  Upon entering, the employees are there to greet you and as you leave it's almost like they are greeting you again as weird as it sounds.  One thing I love about this location is that it's open until 11 pm.  It's definitely not fast food but It's made and cooked pretty quick.  I love going here at night because of the ambience and the atmosphere.  It's dark but not too dark and it's perfect for casual conversation.  I love the teriyaki chicken with salad.  Nice healthy meal  I've been during the all you can eat sushi and left stuffed.  Service is very fast even if it's busy.  I can honestly say I haven't nada bad experience there and love going when I can carve out the time.

A friend of mine has been recommending this place for some time. She is a big fan and is trying to  slowly sample everything on the menu. So today we decide to give it a try. Now I just wish it was a wee bit closer to our house.  You  walk in off Glendale Ave. and it's very comfortably decorated  with a clean Italian style. It reminded me of Pizza A Metro with more room , and decor.  There is a large brick oven in the front  that gives it an authentic flavor. All the servers were very nice and treated us like we have been going there forever. We ordered a  cheese pizza for my daughter and a "Italian stallion " pizza for us.  The crust was very nice chewy , with a light oven char that I really liked , a bit of tomato sauce , cheese and very different Italian sausage. Very tasty. My daughter loved her pizza , she was thrilled , I was afraid it would be too upscale for her. But she was so enamored she about bit my husband hand off when he reached for a piece. We are  anxious to try some of  the  other items , they brought a basil and cheese pizza by our table that smelled heavenly. we also saw some great pasta dishes at other tables.Well, at  first I thought  this might be a BUST,  and had it not been for the lovely gentleman Danny and his guest Lindsay with whom we sat next to , it would have been. We entered the pizza place because all the raves we had been hearing about the pizza, to our diappointment we where greeted by the hostess, with " we are out of Pizza", how the heck do run out of pizza, this we said to one another. So we asked for a menu and sat down at the closest table to see what we might like to try, the stuff crab shrimp as an appetizer looked fantastic the couple next us had just received, so we decided to try it and a ceasar salad with grilled chicken.   Not but 5 min after we order the waitress comes back to say " we are out of stuffed shrimp too!", Holy cow what kind of joint are you running. This is where it gets good, Danny- the gentleman next to us , offers of the last shrimp from their order and says" don't worry we ordered THREE pizzas- we will share them with you, just order something else to try" with that we ordered a meatball sub.  Thanks to Danny we had the cheese pizza- AMAZING,the vegitarean- ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS, and the white pie-YUM YUM, as for the ceasar it was a 3 out of 5, the dressing needs some work but the grilled chicken was really great, and the meatball sub was just average.  We will definately go back , the pizzas' are FANTASTIC8/11After visiting Cerreta's candy factory, I thought I'd knock another eatery off my list of places I've wanted to visit for many years.  La Piazza joins the ranks of Matt's Big Breakfast and Pizzeria Bianco as being the only places, that I can recall, where there was a wait to get in!  No, correct that, THIS is the only place I can recall, in the US, where I've been to that there was a crowd waiting to get in before store hours began.  Correction, again: La Piazza and Todai (in Schaumburg, IL) are the only two places I've visited, here in the US, that I can recall that had a line of people waiting to get in, in my last 20 years of life thus far.  I can't claim that I've lined up at Matt's or at Pizzeria Bianco before they opened for business...What a cute place!  Really liked the atmosphere here (wine cabinet, murals, brick walls, etc.), and the staff seemed to enjoy their jobs.  Well, most of them did, anyway...  But why don't we just get straight to the food?!  Hmm?I ordered the La Piazza Bianco http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-Dnh48f029YNugtMKkkI-Q?select=Oadu8QvsrHJU-4PMfLTjYw#Oadu8QvsrHJU-4PMfLTjYw, which is comprised of ricotta, fresh mozzarella and basil, garlic, and garlic butter sauce.  The cheeses looked so beautiful and exquisite (!), but the pizza came out charred in so many places.  Unfortunately, there wasn't a hint of crispiness to its crust ANYWHERE, and this is no exaggeration.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-Dnh48f029YNugtMKkkI-Q?select=fV3E74fisRXUvjU85CalOQ#fV3E74fisRXUvjU85CalOQ  The pizzaiolo's excuses for the lack of crispiness were that the fresh garlic sauce and homemade cheeses caused the crust to be more soggy than his other pizza varieties, and bec. the restaurant just opened, so that the brick oven was not hot enough.  His mother offered to have another pizza done, as she didn't want to see anyone dissatisfied.  I asked if perhaps rolling the crust a little thinner would be possible.  The second pizza was clearly much better... http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-Dnh48f029YNugtMKkkI-Q?select=sbGKg7yJwLmX4wlhWsEJRQ#sbGKg7yJwLmX4wlhWsEJRQ  Loved the thinner crust, and the crust's edges on this one were crispy!  (The butter garlic sauce caused the main areas to be soggy, but at least there were crispy areas.)   I wish I could've videotaped handling the slice of pizza of the first one... it folded without the slightest crunch or flakiness.  If you're a crispy thin-crust lover, I suggest you specify this before ordering from here.  While my beef was due to the sogginess of the pizza crust (I didn't even mention the burnt areas- I didn't think there was any need to!), the ingredients, however, were of high quality!  I was so disappointed that the matriarch took the remaining slices away- I only had about one and half slices' worth of toppings to enjoy :'(  Most places I've been to that offered to correct grievances left the original items on the table, gratis.  She did, however, offer complimentary dessert.  Their cheesecake is fantastic!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-Dnh48f029YNugtMKkkI-Q?select=dUlITiNdAY5kue075cevJQ#dUlITiNdAY5kue075cevJQ-Service has improved a lot since my last visit.-Greeted and thanked by Hostess.-Pizza is still outstanding (order the Italian Stallion, it's the best!)-Pizzas came out pretty quickly.-Some tables are too close, do I need to be touching elbows with the stranger at the next table?-Parking was convenient.Let me preface this by saying I have been in the service industry for the better part of 20 years. I understand how restaurants work as far as service, reservations, repeat customers, etc. I was so extremely disappointed in this place. Here's my story: While looking for a centrally-located place for the fam to dine, we came across this pizza parlor and remembered seeing it on TV. On their website it states they take reservations for parties of 6 or more so I called to make a reservation. The gentleman that answered the phone took our name and phone number and then proceeded to let us know the rules: 1. They won't seat you until your entire party is there (not really understandable since they pushed tables together and could have easily separated them should our party not all show up) 2. They only hold the table for 10 minutes (kind of understandable since so many people flake out on reservations, but 10 min is a little short, especially if there's traffic) and 3. We had 1.5 hours to eat because another party was coming in. He asked if #3 was an ok time-frame. I said it was up to his kitchen and how fast they can pump out the food - they did good.  He said there was only one table in the restaurant that could sit 6 or more.  However, when we arrived they were pushing tables together on the patio to accommodate a party of 6 and they had another large party just in side the patio and we sat in a different location, so not sure how he thought there was only 1 table for large parties.  Plus each table is a 2-top and can be combined with x number of other tables to accommodate - there was plenty of room inside the restaurant.So after hanging up I already felt like they didn't really want us there. Four of the six of us arrived a slight bit early.  We introduced ourselves as the reservation and they promptly corrected us by saying they don't make reservations, they just hold the table and our table would be given away at 6:10 if the entire party was not here. Right at 6pm we called the other two who informed us they were 3.6 miles away (according to their GPS) but they still wouldn't seat us. We explained they were only 7 min away, but they said it didn't matter and asked us to wait outside in 100 degree weather sweating our a$$e$ off. They never offered water or anything to drink. Just literally shuffled us out the door and proceeded to ignore us for the next ~7 minutes. Sign #2 they didn't really want us there. Since we were in 3 cars and not familiar with downtown Glendale, we decided to stick it out. The other two arrived and we were seated back by the bathrooms. Sign #3 they didn't really want us there. The restaurant was not packed, nor did it get packed while we were there so I'm not sure why they couldn't seat us or even let us wait inside in the air conditioning. The ONLY reason this place rec'd 2 stars rather than the 1/4 I would have preferred to give it is because of our server, Sandy. She was AMAZING! We wanted wine so she made some suggestions for both red and white. The table took her up on all that she suggested. She was polite, timely, funny, professional; she just rocked. She saved the dinner for all of us. Thank you Sandy! The food was fairly good. We ordered the fried ravioli (REALLY good) and bruschetta as apps. The salads came next (ok to split with someone - they are fairly good size). Definitely ask for the dressing on the side. We couldn't eat half of ours because it was absolutely drowning in dressing. The pizza was pretty good. Be careful of the pies that have garlic on them - they are large pieces of garlic so you definitely want to make sure your date likes garlic too. ;-) We won't be back nor would we recommend this place to friends. We will tell them our story and let them make up their own mind. And we will definitely have them call ahead to see if Sandy is working because she really did save the night.I admit I was hesitant to try La Piazza al Forno, since typically I try to avoid restaurants 'as seen on the Food Network'.  Well, in this case, a couple of visits for Saturday lunches proved that I was wrong - this is a small restaurant that creates big, wonderful flavor!  Over the course of two visits, we tried:Pizze Bianca ($12) - certified Neapolitan pizza - oh yes!  The thin yet chewy crust was graced with homemade mozzarella, extra virgin olive oil, ricotta cheese, basil and plenty of fresh garlic.  Four Cheese Ravioli ($9) - this is a simple yet completely fantastic dish - three cheese ravioli is baked, topped with a red cream sauce and mozzarella.  You will definitely want to use some bread to enjoy all of the remaining sauce from this dish!Panino ($7 + $1 additional for a slice of Proscuitto) - basically pizza crust-like bread with mozzarella, tomatoes and the additional proscuitto inside, served cold.  I was hoping for something more along the lines of the Schiacciata Romagnola served at Cibo.  While this was good, I wouldn't order it again.  Zeppolis ($4) - a very large portion of hot, puffy 'donut holes' sprinkled with powdered sugar.  No, there weren't any leftovers.  ;)So I really love the crust...really love the cheese...but this place needs to work on their customer service.The first time we visited they wouldn't seat two of us at a four top until our other friends arrived.  We would have spent more $$ on some drinks, but even though they were not busy they wouldn't seat us.The second time we had a better experience, but after moving tables to be father from the door (and cold air coming in b/c they wanted to leave it open) our original waitress who brought our drinks was upset and said..."well now I can't help you" because we were in a new area.The third time, though, is the ultimate in tacky service.  Our night was great with awesome pizza....half of us coming from the E Valley for a get-together with out-of-town relatives.  It was great...until after we paid the bill...  As we sat there visiting and enjoying our night, drinking the wine and pop we had paid for, our waitress comes up and asks us to leave.  She said that we were sitting at the only 4 top...and that a wait list was forming.  As we walked out and I think "Is this really happening?  Did I we just give her a 24% tip just to be asked to leave?" I see another totally empty 4 top and only 2 people waiting to be seated.Wow...for a place that claims to be straight from Italy, they should know that in Italy restaurant owners let their customers eat and talk and take as much time as you like.  I'd have to say that time number 3 was it for us...we'll go to Grimaldis, Pizzaria Bianco, or Spinatos the next time we want pizza.Long term friends of mine saw this place on DDD and had been wanting to try it the next time they were in Phoenix without a family obligation. Well that opportunity happened when I was going in town and Saturday was the only day they had off.My friends drove down from Camp Verde, picked me up from my Grandma's in Sun City and we embarked on Downtown Glendale. I hadn't been to this part of Glendale since I was still living in Phoenix almost 10 years ago now. It was crowded in the whole area when we arrived and at first I thought maybe it was the Farmer's Market, but then realized this was early February and this meant we were stuck in the Chocolate Fair crowd (also meaning not the best time to go to a place for lunch that had been on TV). Since I was technically on "vacation", waiting to eat at a place my friends were so excited about meant I could relax, but what was irritating is that the "hostess" advised to all who put their name down to stay within the direct vicinity of the restaurant as the entire party had to be together. It was a cold and windy afternoon and there was no waiting allowed inside. I did a quick peruse of the surrounding businesses and it seemed as if very few if any had changed. There are still a ton of antique stores, Haus (whatever the German restaurant that was also featured on DDD and other restaurants. It was actually nice to see the old timey feel was still in the neighborhood. After about a good 35 minute wait, we were shown in to our table. The restaurant itself is small and it seemed as if the menu and service was going to be impressive. We all decided to try a couple of salads and a couple of pizzas. They chose one of each as did I. My girlfriend had a glass of Reisling and her husband had his 3rd choice of beer (they were out of the first two choices). I had icd tea and after asking twice for "fake sugar", pulled out my own Grandma stash. It wasn't until someone other than our server came around to refill my tea that Splenda was brought. Long time ago, I was a waitress so this alone tends to piss me off -hence mark off for customer service. The salads ordered were the spinach and caprese. The spinach salad was pretty good but should have been tossed. The caprese was sad. Really really sad. We all know that February is not tomato season, but under ripe beefsteak tomatoes cannot be saved even with house made mozzerrella. For a "foodie" restaurant, this should not have been on the menu at all given the season. The pizza's ordered were the Bianca and the Italian Stallion. I have been to Italy. I have had pizza in numerous places with ovens like these and though it was good, I was not blown away (sadly either were my friends). The Bianca was very mild in flavor and benefited from a splash of balsamic. The outer crust was good but the rest of the pizza was soggy on both-either because it needed to cook a bit longer or because something topping wise was too wet. Our server was friendly taking our order but we never saw her again until the end when she asked if we wanted dessert. I loved spending time with my friends, wished the food was a bit more exciting and super happy that little old Downtown Glendale is popping!Oh man I had such high hopes for this place. Well lets just get into it. When wegot there we waited about 2 minutes before being acknowledged then after finally being greeted we were shown to a table that was 2 seats and very close to another table with people. So I asked if there was anyway to move us to another table in which I pointed too. Only to be told "oh umm if I sit you over there and a party of 3 or 4 come we will have to move you". Being so perplexed by this answer my wife and I sat and stared at each other for a moment.  Then still wanting to give the restaurant a chance we ordered. We got stuffed shrimp and a Bianca pizza. Well the stuffed shrimp was fine I wouldn't order it twice. The pizza was also very bland and just not what we expected. Feeling a little dissatisfied with the whole experience we just left after that.I never thought it would happen. Guy Fieri betrayed my love and did me wrong. My heart is heavy. **cue woeful harminica**Hubby, daughter and I embarked upon Piazza al Forno after watching triple D and seeing the menu online. We got there and were seated next to a large group that was incredibly loud. So not the restaurant's fault they were obnoxious. But, the waitress would talk to us in her "inside voice" which made her sound like Charlie Brown's teacher. Project, woman. Project!The service was just so lacking. If you are clairvoyant, this is a good place for you. Those of us less gifted need not attend. She asked us if we were ready to order several times and saw we were clearly struggling to decide. Never offered menu info or a run down of specials. She didn't even offer a wine list! This week has sucked, so imagine my horror upon thinking this place was dry as no one ever alluded we could have a glass of wine or presented a list! Mama needed some wine. Help a sister out. Our food came and we got the fried ravioli, baked spaghetti and the Italian Stallion. Nothing was even remotely worth writing home about. The baked spaghetti gave me the sense that they made a whole mess of spaghetti early in the day and threw it in the overn to heat it up when needed. Viola! Baked spaghetti!When we appeared done she just brought us our check. Apparently, my brain waves caught on with their psychic vibe and told her we wanted to get out of dodge.  She never even asked us about dessert or brought back a menu. So, we went to Gelato Spot and I had triamisu flavored gelato. Done. Wanted to love this place but it was so lackluster. So many places in the valley are better.What is better than having pizza for lunch?  Following it up with pizza for dinner!  I had this placed bookmarked and decided to try it out on the way home from work.  It's located in downtown historic Glendale which looked pretty cool.  I found parking around the corner on a side street and walked half a block to the restaurant.  I walked in, was seated, and placed my order.  I went with the Margherita D.O.C and a Diet Coke.  Here is how it was...................Margherita D.O.C ($10.00) -  This is simple and straight to the point.  San Marzano Tomatoes, Olive Oil, House Made Mozzarella and some Fresh Basil.  So simple yet so delicious.  The pizza was perfect!  The tomatoes, fresh mozz and basil did wonders to my mouth.  The crust was nice and salty and chewy with a nice char on it.  It was foldable and everything held together well.  This is one of the times where I was damn close to ordering another pizza.  It was phenomenal and one of, if not the best Neapolitan pizzas I have ever had.  It was a pretty large "personal" pizza too and the price was right!Diet Coke ($2.50)-  They serve Mexican Coke products here.  They bring you a bottle and a glass with ice.  It was refreshing.  No refills though since its sold by the bottle.Service was fantastic!  The hostess, waitress and even owner? came by and asked how everything was.  It was pretty much a perfect meal!  I will be back in the near future!  Now that I think about it, I definitely should have ordered another one..........my mouth is watering just thinking about how great it was!  Fantastic pizza!

Can somebody please give me a tongue scraper??? Quick! The taste (or lack thereof) of the crappy $9 bloody mary is piercing my tongue! One of the things that irks me the most, is when you go to a restaurant, spend ten dollars on a "signature" cocktail and it tastes like garbage. In this case it tasted like water tomato juice, with a sprinkle of pepper. And a massive celery stick that engulfed the glass. So you say, you should drink beer when you go to these places. You're right! But then don't put crappy drinks on the menu, just to fill up space. All in all, we are in Scottsdale after all...there are a million places to go that have more to offer.. I left after the drink. You got me at "hello?" No, not so much.

Cafe Rio, WTF happened to you??? You were one of my favorite places to eat. Now, I must resort to someplace else. On our last visit, I decided to just get a chicken tostada because my usual chicken salad would have been too much food. Plus I wanted the crunchy tostada shell. So here's where it gets bad. I order the shredded chicken on the side because I didn't want the juices making my tostada shell soggy. As the girl proceeded to put the chicken in a separate cup, she made a comment about how she hates when people get the meat on the side. The guy next to her then made a comment about how he agreed. Um, I'M STANDING RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU IDIOTS,  I CAN HEAR YOU!!! Then as the guy puts the lettuce on my food, he doesn't let the water drip from the lettuce. So all this water ends up making my tortilla shell soggy. Just what I didn't want. Then to top it off, as I'm eating my food, the chicken is way overcooked and super mushy. And there's a puddle of water at the bottom of my plate. See picture. I've noticed over my last few visits to this location that the employees don't seem to give a crap about the food they serve. They're just there for a paycheck. No care or quality. I love their food, especially the tortillas. But now, I might have to drive to a further location if I want my fix.

Review Text :
The makers of Rawmakery foods. I don't recommend their pre-packaged stuff. If you're raw (I was for a time), they use Braggs Amino Acids in their crackers, which is not raw and contains soy. Also, their crackers have a distinctively rancid taste and smell, as the fats in the seeds and nuts used in their products go bad quickly. Aside from their pre-made stuff, this is one of the few places in the LV that offers raw essentials: raw coconut oil, nut butters, raw olives, dehydrated fruit, etc. The restaurant fare is good, but I wasn't feeling the overpriced mock-entrees; I recommend the salads instead. The organic house salad with cilantro dressing is fantastic, and their dehydrated toasts are very good. Juices, smoothies, and the self-serve salad bar are all fresh, organic, vegan, and simple. Service is above average. Overall, a great organic vegan lunch spot for when you're in the mood to eat something living.I had Go Raw on my to do list for  years but never got around to it until recently. Let me start with the good the female  working the counter was very friendly and welcoming after I told her it was my first visit. She suggested juice ( Green Zing- granny smith apples, lemon, ginger) based off my bitter/tart palate I described to her. I ordered the green zing and the gimme the beet 'cheese" burger with a house salad. The juice was made rather quickly.  I was really looking forward to it. Tasted like motor oil and was "luke cold" pretty disappointing start to my first experience but no biggie. The beet burger came out and I really enjoy veggie burgers especially house made.  The "living bread"  it came on had the thickness and consistency of beef jerky but tasted like tree bark. The beet burger itself was only slight less disgusting.  I  came into raw very hungry so for me to say it was terrible is mostly shocking to myself. The house salad was the best part as it was mixed greens kale and a flax seed oil garlic dressing that was just OK and that's rounding up a bit. The salad was by far the best part of  and otherwise awful meal.  I ate the entire  meals as I was hungry. After eating I was literately turned off by the thought of more food even if I went  next door to get a slice of pizza. They do not refrigerate or cool  or heat items to keep with the "raw" theme. That didn't seem like a big deal to me but only added to the awful tasting tree bark flavored meal I just ate. I like the concept of "raw" and natural yet they put to go items in plastic bags, plastic cups that are not made of corn or anything sustainable or green.  They have bottled juices and vitamins in a refrigerator as you walk in but then everything tastes "luke cold" as if nothing is refrigerated that you order.I wouldn't wish Go Raw on my worst enemy. If anyone wants a free  get juiced card with a stamp on it, it's all yours.   Skip it  and thank  me for saving your taste buds later.I am a big fan of Go Raw Cafe, BUT this particular location on Windmill I do not enjoy going to and that is because of the service. I do not like to mention names but this lady never makes me feel welcomed there.  I always feel I am bothering her by asking her a question about something or even if I do not ask a question and I am just ordering. The last two times I have been there it has been pretty bad and I swore to myself I will not go back for a few weeks. I like to eat at a place where the staff is happy I am there.  What I do love about this location is the salad bar.  They always have amazing stir fried veggies and brown rice.  I get a scoop every time!  Its pretty pricey here so expect to pay over $10 for anything you order.You have got to love this place. It's the only cafe thats truly raw and organic on the eastside. They also have another location on the westside by the lakes. I buy all my supplements here and super foods such as the most amazing goji berries and other Go Raw products. The green zing is my favorite juice and I usually ask that they take out the apples for my personal preference. If you love smoothies get the superfood smoothie in a bowl with granola. To die for. I would get it every time I went.  They soak their nuts (for optimal digestion) so it's truly made with care. Such a treat. Oh and if your really looking to indulge I recommend the cookies and cream which is coconut and cacao blended. Yumm. In regards to the raw wraps my favorite is the portobello mushroom wrap. Spot on. If your looking to elevate your health and gain energy, Go Raw is the way to go and you can learn so much from this place. They also have a huge book collection including recipe books, books focused on certain ailments and other cool topics. I probably bought most of the books from there. Good luck on your health journey and I hope you love this place as much as I do !!!disclaimer to start: I have been to quite a few raw/live restaurants. (wooohoo!) And DEF a ton of vegan ones. As that is my lifestyle. Not to mention the fact that as a part of my business, people pay me to create healthy recipes. Not only for people personally, but cookbooks, blogs, etc...including raw.   I have  even taught people how they can prepare delicious raw & vegan food at home in a class format.On that note:We were excited to check this place out and taste another fun take on raw amazingness.  And sadly, from the moment the cashier opened her mouth the tone was set, it seemed. She was flippant & rude... especially when we asked to get almond "cheese" on 1 side of the "pizza".  The man and I both wanted to try and I am not a fan of nut cheeses. (or fake cheeses in general... or fake meat. For me... it freaks me out that something is not being what it truly is. I could prob say that's how I feel about fake people too! haha!)  That brings me perfectly into my biggest point...Technically "raw" is anything under 119 degrees... SO, you could potentially  have warmed items that still maintain the delicious nutrients that all raw food offers. AND--- our fav places in LA do this.  For example... the biscuits and gravy do not come out ice cold. Same as their pizza. The pizza was ice cold. And apparently every thing they serve is that temp. Or room temp. That really turned me off. I really don't know any time I would say... ohhh, I am totally craving a cold enchilada. I spoke with what seemed to be the owner to ask a few questions and of course... he was offended and will prob reply to this post. But alas... I am hoping it causes him to re-evaluate the temp? the service? As I know it is probably super easy to not have any worry regarding temperature.  The Buckwheat bread it came on was great! BUT--- we could've driven to whole foods and bought the same bread ourselves and assembled our cold dish at home. (especially with the price point so high)The menu also said it came with "walnut sausage". Throwing small pieces of walnut on a cold piece of bread does not a sausage make. Another one of our fav places at home has an incredible walnut sausage... that is a delectable mix and packed with flavor... not just the walnut.Which brings me to ANOTHER item on the menu they call "fries".... we were like... cool! Let's see the fun spin on "fries" done raw. Come to find out these are merely avocado slices. Just. Avocado. I LOVE avocado. If you say it's avocado. But don't tell me it's fries.SO---  in a nutshell---the flavors were actually quite good. BUT--- I could buy at the store and assemble at home. (was hoping they built more ingredients in house, especially with the price) Don't tell me things are NOT what they actually are. "walnut sausage pizza" is not cold store-bought bread with nuts on top. Fries are NOT avocado. And please make a disclaimer somewhere.... ANY where on the menu that says all of our food is served cold or at room temperature. (I know its a RAW place... but I know RAW... and it doesn't have to always be cold or room temp.)  then, we would know what to expect and probably really truly enjoy our experience. Also--- a little kindness and maybe a crack of a smile goes a real long way.I'm not fully Vegan or Vegetarian, I still eat meat around once a week but I'm slowly getting there! I was looking for a new place to try that would help boost my studying so I was looking for someplace that had a lot of fresh and healthy options and I came across Go Raw Cafe on Yelp! Located on Windmill and Eastern in the shopping center with the Smith's located right next to Tups. Walking in, on the right you see a ton of books and supplements about raw eating, vegan eating, etc., on the ceiling were a bunch of hanging plants and near the back there's a salad bar. There was only 2 tables sat with 2 people at each table when we went and there was no one at the counter. Since it was the first time I'd been there, I didn't know whether to just sit down or go to the counter so I went to the counter since I saw a handful of paper menus. I grabbed one and started looking through it, I wanted to walk to the salad bar to see what they offered but I didn't since I felt a bit awkward not really knowing how to order so I eyed the Salmon Roll: Mock salmon, mustard, alfalfa sprouts, tomato, avocado, enoki mushrooms, yam "rice", garlic, & ginger as something I wanted to try but there was no one at the counter so I started looking around. Finally one of the ladies sitting at a table talking to a guy gets up and goes to stand behind the counter and just stares at me. No hi, nothing! Not even a smile! So I said "Uh I'll try the Salmon Roll" and she says "Sold out" Okay uhmmmm..."the Veggie Roll?" and she replies "No, out of Seaweed" Dang okay...then I start looking at the menu again and I hear her let out a heavy breathe. Wow! How Rude! Then I saw the "Salmon" Cakes w/ "Fries" & Veggies $15: "tartar sauce" accompanied by garlic flat "bread", House Veggies, & your choice of avocado "fries", or jicama "fries". and my boyfriend orders the Blood Transfusion $8.50: 2 oz. Wheatgrass & Coconut Water. She rings it up, we pay and then she walks back to sit with the guy she was talking to so we sat down. My boyfriend told me he was planning to get something to eat also but didn't want to deal with the rude lady. By that time we kind of already lost our appetite. Trying the food, the veggies were very good, nice and fresh and I also liked the avocado fries. I never received the garlic flatbread and as for the Mock Salmon, it was extremely sour and kind of smelled a bit rank. I finished the veggies and avocado but left most of the mock salmon. My boyfriend's drink was really good but I mean it really was just coconut water and wheatgrass, you can't really mess that up. Overall, I would want to come back to try different items on their menu but the really bad service just kind of turned me away from this place for a while.

I was a little embarrassed to admit to my co-workers that I REALLY wanted to eat lunch at Nordstrom Cafe! To my surprise they were equally as delighted and it was a nicer alternative to the hum drum food court experience. The cafe is located on the third floor of Nordstrom's right next to the young women's clothing department. I adore Nordstrom Cafe in my hometown of Honolulu and was very happy to see that the quality was right on par. I always order the angel hair pasta with spicy shrimp and it was EXACTLY what I expected. I always request that there be no spice added and they were more than happy to accomodate! Move over McDonald's because Nordie's has got the duplication process down to another level! (Photo: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cafe-nordstrom-scottsdale?select=8KOO0n8EuWaUWGK_Ha4Z3g#8KOO0n8EuWaUWGK_Ha4Z3g)Although the restaurant was smaller than I expected, service was wonderful, food was delicious and the only thing which went wrong was they got my friend's order mixed-up. But of course in true Nordstrom Cafe fashion, they apologized profusely and fixed it right away. You are my cafeteria style home away from home Nordstrom Cafe!!!31 Yelps Challenge: #10/31I love having a late lunch after a successful shopping day. I prefer to come here over the food court since it is so much more relaxing.  The service is so attentive and I can enjoy my meal and rest my tired feet for a bit.  I usually order the Cilantro Lime Chicken, light on the dressing or the Grilled shrimp and arugula salad with sweet corn.  I guess I like all my meals with a little sweetness on them. Today I felt like a grilled cheese and tomato soup. I was splurging since I have lost some weight. They don't offer that choice for adults, but how awesome are they. The let me have the kids meal, with the beverage and the side of fruit. I was in heaven.I can honestly say that there's nothing better than shopping and having a small bite to eat at the Nordstrom Cafe/Bistro. It's pretty much tradition that Stine H. and I would grab cups of soup and buttered noodles to share whenever strolling through Nordy's so this place brings back many nostalgic memories.I love the Tomato Bisque and the French Onion soups and the little toast served on the side is crisp and perfect for dunking. This time around I wanted something a little heavier, the Spicy Shrimp Angel Hair Pasta is perfect and you can even half the serving to share. The pasta was perfectly cooked, topped with tangy marinara and big pieces of shrimp! The food is way better than anything you could get in the food court- for obvious reasons. It's just simply delicious.The atmosphere is pretty quiet, the view and natural light makes it comfortable for eating and the service here is great. From our cashier to our server, they do their best to make your time spent in the cafe as pleasant as possible. I always tip and the little mint chocolates that come with the bill is always a great touch.

38 for under $8 is the way to go! i brought my mom here for a nice dinner and we ordered: tea, veggie fried rice, LSD roll, crab salad, chicken dumplings, edamame, veggie tempura, and beef skewers for $57. the servings are very generous and not what you would expect for a classy place like this one. if you are used to dropping a grip for the atmosphere and presentation, you will get more bang for ya buck here. troy was our server and was supa sweet! great personality, attentive, informative, and a comedian. actually, come to think about it, everyone was really great. =) i am definitely looking forward to heading back for some mo' LSD roll, that shiz is good!This is a beautiful restaurant located inside of Red Rock Casino. We arrived late and actually were the last ones to leave the restaurant, but never felt rushed by any of the staff. Everyone from the hostess to our server was very attentive and friendly. I had Miso soup and we shared three rolls: Q, EE and Hachi... I found them to be extremely delicious. The fish was fresh and the rolls very well put together. The prices range from $11-18 per roll from what I recall. No AYCE here! They have few specialty cocktails and several beer choices..oh yeah, and a huge sake list!I loved it here 2+ years ago when Iived nearby (pre-Yelping), and I still love it.  While the menu has been redone and missing some of my old favs, the new menu had some interesting new items, and thus, I now have a few new favorites.  The decor and lighting are really gorgeous, romantic and colorful.Amazing:------------1A.  Salmon Carpaccio (absolutely amazing; wafer thin gives it a super soft and tender texture), with sesame oil, ponzu, and sesame seeds.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4ugJ4F8jDJ9-2dEiZ47wLg?select=J0FFzxNuH4TF0jexP2tY3w#J0FFzxNuH4TF0jexP2tY3w2A.  White Lotus Roll - rock shrimp tempura, asparagus, avocado, albacore, crispy onions, soy sauce http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4ugJ4F8jDJ9-2dEiZ47wLg?select=J0FFzxNuH4TF0jexP2tY3w#hdHiCVdAaf7kAWeKjf5Nuw3A. Yellowtail Jalapeno (great flavor in ponzu and fresh cilantro, not too spicy, and fresh fresh yellowtail) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4ugJ4F8jDJ9-2dEiZ47wLg?select=J0FFzxNuH4TF0jexP2tY3w#A6RULrkYC9QaU7vKrZracgThe Norm/expected:--------------------------1N.  Spicy Tuna on crispy ricecake (great presentation, tobiko, avocado, chili; ricecake was too crispy, and while tasty, I've had it better many times elsewhere)  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4ugJ4F8jDJ9-2dEiZ47wLg?select=J0FFzxNuH4TF0jexP2tY3w#lsZKgmNnGTA6yz0y6oo0xQ2N.  Shishito peppers (in a miso sauce, all mild)Meh:-------1M. Albacore Sashimi (with Crispy Onions in a CItrus Ponzu sauce; great presentation, but its more complex than it needs to be, and it hides the tuna...that's my goal for sashimi, hello!)  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4ugJ4F8jDJ9-2dEiZ47wLg?select=J0FFzxNuH4TF0jexP2tY3w#KGCR_WyqmS6CdQvpjsSGwQ2M.  Saki - Nigori Genshu (Murai Family).  I wanted a cold, unfiltered saki, and received a thick-as-a-milkshake one, that's sweet.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4ugJ4F8jDJ9-2dEiZ47wLg?select=J0FFzxNuH4TF0jexP2tY3w#vRFiQLLbInhEkYdlAhr5wgService:----------Everyone was super nice, BUT, everyone I spoke to was newly hired (all less than 3 months).  Beside the manager (who was super and recommended the White Lotus Roll), the server and the assistant were very young and unseasoned, and I don't believe fit Hachi and it's lovely appearance and price-point. Plus, no Bernie, the girl with the dragon tattoo (see my earlier review, posted 11/3/2011).Summary:------------Food is still a 5.0, prices are fair, and I love the decor, but the service dropped it one star.Lounge Review:Sometime after my third lap around the tables, this place finally caught my eye.Looking to satisfy my craving for whiskey, I was really hoping to find some nicely aged Yamazaki but secretly hoped for Hibiki.I reluctantly had to settle for Black Label neat and decided to wash it down with a side order of tempura.Tempura was crisp, light and delicious.They served an avocado tempura that was a rather half-assed attempt to try something different or a stroke of genius; considering how good it was, I'm thinking it was the later.

First of all, this is not the donut house.  That's what I was thinking when the homegirl chose Winchell's for lunch.  Come to think of it, she's always choosing a pub for lunch. Pros:-Cheap eats.  Food here is priced pretty good.  Example:  8 oz filet for $21.99.  Ton's of daily specials and lunch specials. -Wide selection for a bar, grill, and pub-Taste:  I say you get what you pay for.  Nothing taste really bad, but not excellent.  Again, it's cheap.  -Dining room seating or bar seating-Video Poker if that's your cup of tea-Plenty of parking. Cons:-Smoking:  It's a bar and pub, should be expected.  -Dark inside-Service is not the best.  Took a while for our orders to be taken, even longer for the food to arrive.  -Wide selection of food, but not the best place to if you're watching your cals.I tried their 8 oz Filet and cup of chili.  The filet was little dry and tasted close to a NY Steak.  Still got my protein from it, so I was happy.  The chili here was my highlight. It's topped with onions and also has a little kick to it. I almost got seconds, but figured that it was best that I didn't since I was trying to keep the calories a little low for the day. Overall, the 3 stars means that the food here is just okay.  Don't let the 3 stars discourage you.  Winchell's is a good place to hang out with friends and even get a meal in. I'll probably be back again to meet the homegirl for lunch.  Otherwise, I just don't see myself going out of my way to eat here.

Review Text :
Nothing personal against Nine Fine Irishmen...this review is more about ALL Irish pubs in general. WTF is the big allure with Irish pubs? Drunk, aggro mooks swilling dark-ass beer and eating grotesque, high-sodium high-fat carb-heavy food in a frenzied, fake-ethnic Animal House atmosphere. WHY???????I was coerced into having lunch here the other day, and it was GROSS. I thought I'd be OK just ordering a good old-fashioned cheeseburger. Little did I know, the Irish apparently slop garlic mayo all over everything, and even a simple cheeseburger isn't good enough without adding a layer of some kinda weird flesh-bacon on top of the regular meat patty.Aside from the food, I find the atmo at Irish pubs to be INSUFFERABLY ANNOYING. All that dark wood paneling, hearty waitresses, manically jovial Irish music blaring from the jukebox....it's my own private version of hell! Secret fact about me: I looooove holidays, but on St. Patrick's Day I crawl into a hole and HIDE -- all that green beer and all those drunk idiots make me want to VOMIT.The sole exception to my anti-Irish-pub stance is O'Shea's...because it's more of a shithole dive bar than a pub, they keep the wood paneling to a minimum, Irish music is almost NEVER played, and my friend Brian works the door in a leprechaun costume. I'll reserve my VERY infrequent Irish-bar hankerings for O'Shea's! With any luck, I will never set foot in 9 Fine Rí Rá Paddy MacGillicuddy's Krazy Old-Tyme Potato-n-Whiskey Shack again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Ugh!Like many things in Vegas the Irish bar Nine Fine Irishman at New York New York sounds much cooler than it really is, but the pub does provide an alternative Vegas experience. The bar is laid out like a house with plenty of secluded tables. At Nine Fine Irishmen, the Smithwick's Irish Red Pale Ale Beer is cold, the Jameson Whiskey free flowing, and the Irish band lively.Olivia Z. and I came to enjoy the band. It wasn't very busy, however, since there are only about 8 seats with a view the options are to stand & watch or find a table around the corner. We stood for awhile and then floated from table to table as better spots opened up. The upstairs was closed for a "private event." The outdoor patio provides even more space.We were dishin' out dough at the tables inside of NY NY. A few hours in with the house consuming our money, it was agreed, consumption of food was absolutely necessary. ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY. The ambiance is 'pubbish' with stained wooden floors and walls, head stones, mirrors, marble pillars and dim chandeliers. Very subtle and nice. Being a quarter Irish, I'm always drawn to places like this. It gives me a false sense of feeling, that perhaps, this is what it might be like over yonder. We were sat in a neat little sofa style seat adjacent to the restrooms. I don't mind this.. In fact, it was quite the scene. The entry / exit door for waiters / waitresses / bussers and so on is conveniently  placed side by side with the restrooms. I couldn't count how many men and women walked into the kitchen dazed and confused. Even the restroom entrances themselves were a little confusing, with dudes going in the women's and women going into the men's restrooms. Good times.I was about to order a chicken pot pie and my sister the Shepherd's pie when a waitress walked by with an individual chicken pot pie. These things are ginormous! They're served in a tin pale that's stuffed to the top! The proverbial 'muffin top' so to speak. We ordered the chicken pot pie to share, drunken onion rings and each had a cup of Colcannon soup. The appetizers were delightful. The drunken onions rings are marinated in a bloody Mary / beer batter mix, fried and served with spicy honey mustard. Scorching temperatures had us waiting on these bad boys, but I have to tell you, they were really good. I didn't catch the hints of bloody mary flavoring, however, the spicy mustard sauce made up for that. The Colcannon was what the doctor ordered. The weather during the day had been in the mid-70's and evening hours around the low 40's, so the soup compensated for the cool weather and warmed me up instantly. Did somebody say bacon!? Resting inside this creamy soup delight, Irish bacon is topped on pureed potatoes, cabbage and leeks. The chicken pot pie took the cake though. As mentioned the crust spews out of the top of the tin pale it's served in. Light, flaky and buttery.  The crust's solid defense was no match for my fork's offense.  The chicken was succulent, salty and tender. And wow.. The sauce / stock the vegetables are mixed in was probably one of the best tasting things I've ever had. Period. There was cheddar in this pie, which I've never had in a pot pie, and it (along with a few other ingredients) created an orange like cream that was too tasty! I was full, but kept eating.  Flavor in every bite and never EVER lacked it. Great service and GREAT food!This is an ok place. I do not share everyone else's enthusiasm for it, but it is perfectly acceptable for a casual meal. The layout is odd. There are many odd sized rooms. In the evening they do have live music often.The food is ok. I ordered the Irish Nachos. They consist of fried potato slices topped with beer cheese sauce, chives, aioli and green onions. I chose to add steak. You get a good amount of food. It is more than enough for a meal for one. Several people could also spit it as an appetizer. The chips had solid flavor and were crisp enough. The toppings were all ok.The service was ok. Our server was not rude, but also not overtly nice. It also would have been nice for her to come by a little more frequently.

My brother and I always come here when we fly out after visiting the family at Christmas.It's our little tradition, getting shots of Agavero and nachos before we head back to our own ends of the country.  If you are looking for a shot of something at Charlotte Douglas, this is a decent place for good tequila.

Restaurant name  Veggie Delight

Review Text :
Lychee Slushie Boba. Extra Boba and Lychee Jelly. My standard mantra as I enter Veggie Delight.One of the only purely vegetarian establishments in Las Vegas, Veggie Delight is the savior of our weekly "what do we eat tonight?" predicament. Their Vietnamese sandwiches (pork chop, crispy chicken and spicy chicken) are amazing. They come in soft french bread and have mayo (or vegenaise), soy meat (trust me, it's good here) and a little pickled salad of sorts with cucumber, cilantro and carrots on it. It's a very filling and satisfying sandwich. They've started to offer their sandwiches as part of a lunch special. About 5 bucks for a sandwich, soup and hot/cold tea. Very very reasonable. Yes, this is not a ritzy place. It's actually very far from that. The staff here is seriously challenged with grasping the English Language and the menu ...not at all appetizing. But voila....the food they come up with is amazing, consistent and very satiating. Service is efficient (remember the language barrier but pointing to pictures on the menu helps lots).Our favorites are the following:Vietnamese Faux Crispy Chicken/Pork Chop/Spicy Chicken SandwichesBasil Faux ChickenTaiwanese Faux Beef Noodle SoupFaux Pork Skin Hand RollsFaux Spicy Chicken. All in all, this is a great everyday meal solution. Not too heavy, expensive or pretentious. And of course, their Lychee Boba is to die for. Remember to order it the way I do (See above).Day 19 of vegetarian month...why didn't I come here EARLIER?? This place is awesome! Yeah yeah its a hole in the wall but what vegetarian/vegan can say no to a menu like this? After going through all the awesome Yelper reviews/recommendations I got a take out order of: Vegetarian pork skin rolls: I probably would've believed these were actually crispy pork skins if no one had told me. Great appetizer that was tasty but light. Vegetarian Black Pepper Beef Steak with Special sauce: This was great. The consistency of the protein was as close to beef as I've had at a vegetarian joint and the sauce was great. Vegetarian Fish Steak with Mixed Vegetables: They shaped the protein like mini filets of sea bass with black skin etc but it was still tofu in the end. Not bad but the "beef" was way better. Sauce was sweet which I wasn't so into either. I'm curious to see how they do shrimp and pork chops so that'll be what we go for next time. We'll certainly be back before Jan end since I am running out of home vegetarian recipes that are satisfying haha.veggie delight is great veg find in a meat-centric town.  thank you for again showing me the way, yelp!pros:- all vegetarian- cheap, depending on what you order.  this is vegas, after all...- tasty, fresh, and very unique food- pleasant servicecons:- location is a tough to find, and you absolutely have to drive to it (note: just because it's on wynn road in NO WAY means it's located near the wynn!)- very casual atmosphere... clean, though- slight language barrier, but friendly service once you realize this- weird dual pricing depending on if you want your dish vegan (more expensive) or vegetarian (cheaper for some reason).  when i asked our server what the difference is, she replied "dairy".  dairy in chinese/thai/viet food?  that seems odd... especially when you see the menu items.based on all the yelp love, we ordered the veggie pork skin rice noodle salad.  holy shit, this was AMAZING!!!  super flavorful, crispy, full of fresh veggies, and not heavy.  yum!!  we also ordered the basil chicken because i just love this kind of dish.  it was really good and came with fresh vegetables, including broccoli, carrots, and snap peas.  we requested brown rice with it instead of white rice and some hot sauce on the side.  delicious!   both these dishes were very unique tasting, and the pork skin noodle salad was unlike anything i've ever had or seen.  we finished everything and left with happy, full bellies and ready for a night of boozing, gambling,and other unmentionable activities.  ;)looking forward to coming back next time we're in vegas!If I had the power to move mountains, my first item of business would be to pick up this little place and move it from Las Vegas to Maryland. As high-profile as our hotel's restaurants were, the availability of eating options for non-carnivores was lacking. Me being just under a few months old as a vegan, I thankfully was able to trust in my handy dandy Yelp app to locate vegan/vegetarian places in the area and was led to Veggie Delight. At first I was a little confused reading the menu because all over it I read options with the words "chicken, shrimp, beef, pork" in them. After looking at the pictures and reading the reviews, I was even more excited to learn of and even more anxious to experiment with several of the meatless options and see their take on carnivorous selections. I was tickled at the fact that it likened many of the Chinese carry outs I'm used to in that they boasted Chinese and American cuisine. Had they've included soul food, I surely thought I was back in Baltimore.I purchased the Basil Leaf Chicken entree, Spicy Chicken sandwich, Pork spring roll and Shrimp spring roll. My least favorite was the basil leaf chicken. I could barely finish half the container, it had way too much ginger in it. The meat used in it was also not cooked as thoroughly as I would have preferred. It needed to be crisp as opposed to soft and rubbery as the meat seemed to squeak while chewing. My favorite was the chicken sandwich. There's this carrot mixture they use as a topping/spread and the seitan had a nice spicy sauce/marinade that was a great match to the sweet tasting wheat roll the held it together. For the price paid, I would have liked a bit more of the "chicken" mixture but if you were eating this with any type of side (chips, etc) you would be satisfied. As far as the spring rolls were concerned, what the other Yelpers stated holds true-go for crunchy!!!  The rice paper wrapped round the rolls became sticky and hard to maneuver without everything falling all over the place. It's unfortunate that the shrimp roll doesn't come crunchy. Perhaps some suggestions should be made to them about this. The contents inside were great matches though and the shrimp substitute was delightful. The pork roll had some type of mushroom appeal to it but the color matched and the taste was convincing once you poured the complimentary chili oil on it. I also purchased an avocado slush and boy was it delicious! The variety in both flavors and milks (soy or almond) they offered was great and the cups they serve the slushes in are vacuumed sealed so as to prevent spillage. Veggie Delight is quite a treasure and I will surely be back the next time I visit Vegas.

Review Text :
Today's lunch choice was Rachel's Kitchen and let me say... It was like eating a Julia Childs meal without all the butter and well without anything like Julia Childs would make.... It was awesome and healthy.We have decided at work to order nothing but good foods for now on and the first choice was Rachels Kitchen. I Personally had the "440" This amazing mound of goodness has the following ingredients:Grilled Chicken Breast Goat CheeseAvocadoRoasted Red Peppers Roasted TomatoesRomain Lettuce. On a crispy chibatta roll with a fresh salad with a balsamic vinaigretteAs you can see, No mayo or any sauces but between the goat cheese and avocado you do not need it. For those of you that know me, I am not a huge sandwich person and this was one heck of a sandwich. I would invite ole Rachel into my place any day to come whip up one of these bad boys!!Another plus was that the entire order was made to perfection No mistakes and not just sloppily through in boxes like some other places we order from. Knowing that this is the first time we have ventured into our new healthy options folder, I think Rachels will be a consistent part of our lunch schedule especially since the menu seems to offer tons of healthy alternatives to a Double Double heart stopper or a quick Cardiac quesadilla!!!Came in for a quiet Sunday breakfast with the BF. Location dining room is clean and well-decorated with bright and cheerful colors, and the fresh fruit salads and parfaits on display in the refrigerated case are eye-catching and make a good healthy impulse purchase.BF works nights and is a heavy eater in the AM, while I usually don't have an appetite at all until the afternoon. He opted for the grilled chicken sandwich from the Lighter Side section of the menu ($13) while I kept it simple with a peachberry smoothie- wish the calorie count for the smoothies was listed, too, as I found it odd they weren't listed in the Lighter Side section, but the fresh-squeezed juices were, with counts.My smoothie came out first and was flavorful and mostly creamy, just a touch icy. Portion was good, and I liked that it came with the domed bubble lid, so that the portion was not cut short by snapping on the flat lids as they are often served elsewhere. Nothing more annoying than seeing a giant, fresh smoothie being poured from the blender, only to have a heap of it get tossed out because it doesn't fit in my cup!BF's sandwich was next- plated with a side salad with balsamic dressing. Salad veggies were fresh and dressing tasted homemade. The sandwich though, we had mixed feelings about: it was topped with grilled veggies (eggplant and roasted peppers?), and the veggies themselves were delicious. The chicken was in two small, flat pieces and was fairly dry. While the flavor was fairly good, this simply was not a $13 value for a sandwich. What we received did not justify the price. Having seen the product, this is not something I would pay over about $8 for.I love to support local businesses, and especially ones that offer healthy options, but it really frustrates me to see places jumping on green/healthy trend and jacking up prices an unreasonable degree when their product doesn't justify it.I have been meeting a friend here for breakfast every time I come to Vegas. We love the wholesome food selection and the outdoor seating on nice mornings. The food is really consistent and I have had a variety of breakfast items on the menu. The service is generally good. You order at the counter and the server brings your dish out to you. No follow up they I've ever seen. This time, my son had ordered a smoothie that we had to return to ask for and he was disappointed in his meal, the protein lover's scramble.  He felt the portion was small and that it had a very small amount of chicken and bacon in the meal. The Protein Lovers Scramble is 3 eggs scrambled with chicken, bacon and cheddar cheese. My friend and I each had The Favorite:  3 eggs scrambled with goat cheese, spinach, sun dried tomatoes and avocado.  We had the seasoned potatoes with it as well.  We both were happy with our plates.  I thought it had very good flavor and the portions were good for us as well. We checked in and got free, super large muffins as well.  I didn't try one, but the consensus was that they were delicious!I will come back to Rachel's again. It is a bit pricey but I like the healthier options available.

Review Text :
Taggia can put on an awesome spread of gourmet appetizers!  Wow!I attended a Yelp event at Firesky recently and I was very impressed with the food and service of Taggia.Oh the olives!  Just the spread of olives was wonderful by itself.  Great variety.  Then the proscuitto, the artichokes, the sun dried tomatoes, the cheeses...all delicious.We'll be back for dinner soon!I try not to revisit restaurants with eh service, but since this is very conveniently located with my hotel (the Firesky) I didn't have much of a choice. And so I had a lunch and a breakfast at Taggia....2 days in a row!Lunch: This was the scene of the bad service experience. Our waitress gave us the dinner menus (instead of lunch) and forgot 1 of the 2 pizzas we ordered. Fortunately, I had the organic greens salad to munch on while I waited for my lost margherita pizza.  Once the pizza finally arrived it was a tasty thin crust (just how I like it), but nothing to special to Yelp about.Breakfast: The very next morning. Fortunately, a different waitress was more "with it' this time around. I ordered the spinach and mushroom frittata from the breakfast menu, but switched it up a bit by adding swiss cheese and asking for egg whites (to balance out the cheese).  She got the order right even with the changes (whoo hoo), although the frittata once again wasn't anything special.I wouldn't go out of my way for bad service and mediocre food, but wouldn't hesitate to grab a bite to eat here during future visits at the Firesky.05/08/10Friend and I had a fantastic dinner here- my first time back since attending a Yelp event held at Firesky Resort months ago.  We chose to dine outside as it was a nice afternoon.  (Also, the restaurant just opened for dinner, so no one was dining indoors, yet.)  We were hungry, so by the time our server arrived for our drink orders (just water, since we had some wine at the bar and reception areas) we also placed our entree requests- the wild salmon sounded divine, so we both wanted it (she w/ fingerling potatoes and I subbing asparagus).  When it became apparent that we weren't going to get bread unless we asked for it (we waited at least ten minutes-- we were there early... we were hungry!), we asked if complimentary bread was available.  (It was, and with delicious marinated olives, too!)Words cannot do these beautiful entrees justice!  As you can see from the photos, the salmon I had was so juicy.  The textures were exquisite-- starting at the perfectly-crisped skin, nicely seasoned; then immediately underneath it, the seared, buttered flesh; through the flaky layers, until you reach the tender medium-rare center...  There, there- I'm getting waves of goosebumps up and down my arms and neck just recalling those moments!  And the accompanying vegetables were equally splendid!  Crunchy, yet dainty asparagus spears flanked by olives, grape tomatoes, artichoke hearts, and fennel!  Mmm... I think it's time to check out restaurant.com for a gift certificate for another meal here soon :)  Didn't know acquaintance James Siao is Taggia's "chef de cuisine"- what a nice surprise!  He was so sweet to offer my friend and me a complimentary dessert to share.  All the desserts on the menu that night sounded great, but it was no contest-- we had to check out the tiramisu!  Taggia serves up a terrific version-- a marvel to look at, and so many layers to tantalize the tastebuds... So cool and creamy, and the cocoa used was of very high quality.  This dessert was packed w/ so much flavor, yet it was very light-tasting (and very light in the tummy, too!).  This tiramisu lived up to its name- a perfect pick-me-up!Can't wait to go back!Located right inside Firesky, I don't think many locals even realize this is here. After a failed attempt to dine a restaurant nearby due to an hour+ wait, we decided to check out Taggia across the street. It's one of those restaurants that have always been on the list but we seem to forget its there. The ambience at Taggia is exactly what I like in a restaurant: an open patio overlooking waterfalls, ponds and a pretty pool. It was the perfect Arizona fall evening and ideal for outdoor dining. The waiter introduced me to a new cocktail, whip cream vodka and soda. It tastes like a creamsicle and was delicious! We started with calamari and ordered the crab raviolis and shrimp risotto for dinner. When I was ordering my meal, the waiter asked me whether I wanted a house or Caesar salad. The way he said it gave the impression that a salad was included in the meal. However, something didn't seem right since it didn't indicate that on the menu, so I awkwardly asked. He then quietly answered me saying no, a salad wasn't included. Typically when a waiter asks whether you want a house or Ceasar, it means that a salad is included but in reality, he was being little sneaky by trying to get me to order a $10 salad thinking it was included. I would have been pretty unhappily surprised when the bill came if I hadn't caught on when I ordered. The ambience was a four star, the food was ok, but the prices were pretty steep for the meal we got and the waiter tried to pull a fast one with the salad comment which tainted my experience. My food was good though and like I said, it was great ambience. However, guests should be warned that if a waiter offers you a "house or Caesar salad," know that it's not included with the meal and that will cost you $10 extra dollars.

Review Text :
A neighborhood cafe serving up breakfast and lunch fare in a laid back beach-like atmosphere.Sure, they have swimsuits hanging from the ceiling and a tiki theme going on.  Walking in, the waitress told us to sit wherever we wanted.  Using our Entertainment Book coupons, we thought we were restricted to the Breakfast menu only.  But the waitress was nice enough to let us use it for anything on the menu, which we definitely appreciated!I chose the Del Mar Melt ($7.95), which consists of their homemade tuna salad with melted Swiss cheese and tomato on perfectly grilled sourdough bread.  Their tuna salad has crunchy bits of celery and was to my liking.  French fries also came with my order.The Husband saw their Specials board, which meant he was getting the Chicken Fried Steak Sandwich ($8.75).  For those who crave a chicken fried steak but it's too late in the day, putting it between two pieces of bread easily does the trick.  The sandwich had lettuce, tomato, and mayo, with their homemade gravy on the side. French fries also came with his order.  I didn't see any complaints coming from him as he ate it all up! We also had a BOGO free smoothie, so we took ours to go.  My choice was their Sunburn smoothie ($4.50/16 oz; $5.25/24 oz) which consists of passion fruit, mango, peach, strawberry juice, and crushed ice.  It was a super sweet smoothie, which had me wondering how much sugar was in it.  The Husband had their Tropical Passion smoothie ($4.50/16 oz; $5.25/24 oz) which had guava, passion fruit, and mango blended with crushed ice.  He said it tasted like baby food, which was a good thing.We went on a Tuesday and they had a steady stream of customers - those taking a leisurely solo lunch break or colleagues gathered together to enjoy their tropical iced tea.  It looked like there was one waitress and she was busy the whole time we were there.  I did have to ask for refills on my water, but only because she was constantly moving around. Overall, Beach Cafe served up a decent lunch.  I don't know if we would be inclined to go back without a coupon though.I have been a loyal customer for three years. I called today for delivery. After an hour I called to check up on the order. The owner was frazzled and condescending.  I said, "Please don't condescend me. I have I right to call and check up. I get that your slammed. I have a business too. "Her response was incredibly odd. "No, this is my business. I will cancel the order and never order from here again. Then she hung-up."I have my own business that has survived and thrived in Vegas for 27 years.We do 250+ events a year and 6000 daily deliveries. I am speaking from experience. When a small Mom and Pop operation is blessed enough to experience a rush;1.  It is the RESPONSIBILITY of the owners to properly staff themselves.2. Maintain prompt and courtesy service to their customers.3. Remember how they got there (and this is ia SMALL operation and pretty pathetic that they can't handle a Sunday morning delivery by noon) is through repeat customers.Here's how I tried to help their business..1.  I have referred this restaurant through my own business as a caterer for countless weddings and events. 2.  I have passed out their cards at my shop located on off the strip. 3.  I have verbally endorsed them throughout my social circle. II really routed for this place in this economy. When my family has been in town I have taken them there and introduced the to the owners and staff.My support is withdrawn.I was disappointed with the service and food here.  I came in for breakfast on a Friday ... not busy at all, which I can't understand why the service was so bad.There is only one server who doesn't seemed thrilled to be there but she was working.  She wasn't rude or anything but she wasn't happy either.  There was another girl who stayed posted behind the counter watching tv ... she must be the owner or something because she didn't do anything or interacted with any customers NOT sitting at the counter.My boyfriend and I ordered eggs benedict and it took over 40 minutes to get our food.  Eggs benedict came with a very small serving of really greasy home fries (aka potatoes) ... it was nothing special.  I was never offered a refill on my drink or asked if everything was ok or if I needed anything else Basically if you want to wait a long time for your food and be ignored during your whole visit ... come to the beach cafe

Wandering around Paris aimlessly might sound hopelessly romantic.  Unless you are in Vegas and are so hungry you want to stab someone in the eye.  Of course all the buffets and restaurants have lines longer than Fry's on black Friday morning.  I was furious.  For food.  We kept walking farther and farther until we reached Bally's.  Finally, we reached a dark hidden restaurant corner.  Steakhouse or pasta.  Steakhouse or pasta?  They both looked rather packed so we just took a shot in the dark.  Pasta - it looked classy and it was mostly full of crusty old people who looked like money bags and hair pieces.  The best part is that they were offering a prefix for $25.  A bunch of food (and a glass of wine) and we don't have to pay $15 just for a measly sammich like the rest of the Strip?We were quickly seated and our waiter was pretty funny but also gangsterish.  I didn't know if I shouldn't laugh at his jokes or if I'd get stabbed if I didn't. Anyway,  I went with the starter of salad and opted for the angel hair pasta with white wine.  The other half went with the soup and the meat sauce rigatoni with red wine.  Both were good but didn't make a lasting impression.  Then a bowl of bread came out - this was definitely the hit of the night.  The whole large ensemble of cheesy rolls, crisp flatbread, and french bread were demolished.  Next, the starters came.  The salad was lightly tossed in vinagrette and the soup was tomatoey and quite finely pureed.  The pasta was definitely not 'al dente' but a little on the too soft side.  The angel hair marinara was pretty potent so if you have acid reflux problems, you'll want to steer clear.  The rigatoni was good but I felt like I've had better meat sauce pasta at home.  The dessert was better looking than it tasted and they ran out of the tiramisu which made me quite sad.  All in all, the ambiance made up for where the food was lacking and so did the service.  The food wasn't disgusting and if you're hungry, you'll definitely leave happy and full.

Review Text :
Kings Fish House is a restaurant that I come to quite frequently. I'm not sure if it's commonly known but this particular Kings location serves sushi in addition to seafood. And I am a self proclaimed Sushi Superfan! I come here specifically for the Tuna Poke salad. It's the best I've ever had. Something about it... They make theirs with macadamia nuts, cucumbers, avocado, seaweed and sprouts. It's really spicy and flavorful and like nothing I've ever had before. I'm a Tuna Poke connoisseur and I've traveled all over sampling various Tuna Poke salads. I've even tried to get other places to recreate the one I've experienced at Kings Fish House to no avail. So therefore, I recommend trying it because it is special, but don't blame me if you get hooked too! You've been warned! I've contemplated bribing the chef for the recipe many times and you might not want to be in that boat, plotting and planning like I do. I've actually been putting off writing this review because I knew I'd start thinking about it and have to go satisfy my urge AGAIN. I just can't get enough! I crave it on a regular basis. And sure enough, I was right about my reviewing Kings and thoughts of Poke overtaking my brain. Yep, I'm wanting it in a bad way now. Doh!!!!Speaking of DOH!!... The other thing I love that is worth mentioning is their Sourdough bread. Amazing, warm, fluffy and yummilicious! Their Oysters, Miso soup & Key Lime pie are all worth a try too.Service is usually quick. Since I've been so many times, a few of the servers remember what I want so I don't even have to order, which is always nice and makes you feel at home.The best buffalo chicken wings in town! Who could have imagined that a fish place would have amazing wings. They bake them first and then flash fry them. You gotta try them :-)I have a new Henderson hot spot when I want seafood. King's fish house won me over in every form. Fresh fish, tons of options, outdoor dining, and exceptional service. I am wondering what took me so long to get here. My stepson wanted seafood for his birthday, and I think it may be a tradition after this to take him here. There are three dining areas, a large dining room, a sushi bar lounge area with a bar yet it is still family appropriate, and a patio with misters. The food options include lobster, different styles of crab, shrimp, oysters, mussels, and even sushi. Since it is salmon season, they also had a variety of salmon specialties. Between the four of us, we had king crab, calamari, crab cakes, spicy seafood chowder, a philly sushi roll, mussels, and shrimp. The only thing I would pass on my next trip would be the chowder. It indeed had a spice, but the broth was a bit greasy. Everything else I would have seconds of in a heartbeat!Granted, this place isn't the cheapest. (4 people = $200 bill) But I think that is pretty average if you are expecting high quality fish. Perfect for a date night, or trying to impress a potential business partner or client. And just as perfect for a family craving seafood. Can't wait to return.Fresh seafood with beautiful decor! I came here with my mom on a late evening and the weather was perfect to sit outside so we got to enjoy the beautiful patio seating. This place is gorgeous inside out. Fresh flowers adorn every corner.We ordered a few cocktails, a mai tai & key lime martini. Both were strong and big; good combos! We then had some calamari that was outstanding with two different dipping sauces; a creamy tartarish one and a sweet & sour one that was a really nice surprise. We also ordered poke and it was so fresh and a tad on the spicy side which was great with some seaweed salad on the side. Lastly came traditional creme brûlée. The meal was great and so was the service. The menu itself is big and we had a hard time choosing what to get because we weren't that hungry. I'm already thinking of going back on a nice evening again to try things that had my interest. They have an extensive sushi menu and are of course known for their seafood with so many fresh fish options. Broiled halibut may have to come next...7:45pm reservations this past Saturday night was greeted by a smiling hostess who sat my favorite close friend and I at a comfortable booth with a nice view of the restaurant.Our waiter David was excellent! He told us about the entire menu including their Wild Pacific Swordfish specials, that are seasonal until 15 December. David was very friendly, knowledgeable and without delay for all that we ordered from King's impressive seafood menu. In fact, the menu is printed daily with the date at the top right, a sign of class! David has been a waiter at this King's Fish House since they opened 11 or so years ago. Make sure to ask for David when you make your dinner reservations and let me know how you enjoyed yourselves.Why are we here? Seafood! We each started with a bowl of New England Clam Chowder that was the best tasting i've had since clam digging in Alaska 2 years ago.Next we sampled the King's crab cakes, delicious, 2 per order. NOTE: Photo below was taken after 1 was devoured!Did you hear the one about the shy oyster? He finally came out of his shell :-)  A half a dozen fresh topless salty Kumamoto oysters were served on a bed of crushed ice with real seaweed. Yes, I ate the seaweed too! These Kumamoto oysters from Oakland Bay, Washington were significantly better tasting than any nearby sushi bar. They are known to be a high prized oyster that were imported to Washington state in 1949 from Kumamoto, Japan. A real treat and a MUST TRY if you love oysters!My entree selection took a while as I was mesmerized by all of the wonderful seafood options offered from this extensive dinner menu. I may not be able to afford coming back before mid December when the regional seafood special of swordfish ends, so this is what I ordered: Wild Pacific Swordfish, grilled w/ Oven Dried Tomato served w/ ratatouille and rosemary potatoes. Yum! Only 7 ounces of fish, but cooked to perfection and absolutely delicious tasting! I never knew ratatouille was a real food, despite enjoying the Disney/Pixar movie about 10 years ago :-)  These seasonal veggies were roasted very tenderly and mouthwatering good! The rosemary potatoes were something I must try to duplicate cooking at home, as I craved more; but did not order more because I wanted to save room for the seasonal dessert...We shared a slice of Pumpkin cheesecake with homemade whipped cream, nutmeg and garnished with a mint leaf! Yes, I ate the mint leaf too! The Pumpkin Cheesecake was excellent!"King's Fish House is a seafood oasis, not a mirage!"YELP 250 CHALLENGE 2015: #240

This was my first time that I've been to a Sonics. It was pretty interesting to see the guy bringing the food on roller-skates. We had just eaten, but were passing by, and I wanted to try it. We drove up, parked, and ordered from the menu board. It was just our luck. It was happy hour, which meant half price drinks and slushes from 2-5pm everyday. I ordered the Jolly Rancher Green Apple Slush with Pop Rock Candy in it. It was a pretty interesting concept. I've never heard of it before. I took a sip and the Rock Candy was just popping all in my mouth. I loved it, except for that fact that it was so overly sweet. My husband got the Caramel Brownie Blastopia. It's a blended ice cream shake. It was nice and rich, but also very sweet. The last thing we ordered were the onion rings. It was decent. It was fried crispy on the outside. On the inside, it was actually the whole piece of onion rather than chopped up, breaded onion bits.Service was pretty fast. The lady who took our order was nice. We had some questions, since it was our first time at Sonics. She took her time and answered it for us. The guy who delivered the food was also very pleasant.

The first and last time I went to this place, customer service was very poor! I mean, the place itself is well decorated, but it seems as if it does not go with the bad service I received! I ordered pad thai and wanted spice added to it. When I received my order, it was just regular noodles. So, I asked them if they can add spice, and they just directed me back to my table and said there was spice that I can add myself! That was downhill for me there.

Review Text :
Steve's Grillhouse was A-OK!After a long, hot trip from California I finally made it into Phoenix. While cruising the downtown area, Steve's was one of the first places I saw- so i decided to check it out. I ordered the Blackened Chicken Sandwich while my Girlfriend ordered the Cajun Pasta with Chicken. The wait staff was nice and the food came out quick. I enjoyed my blackened chicken, however the chicken wasn't really 'blackened'- it was just kinda grilled lol. I didn't mind though- the honey mustard tasted good. The Cajun pasta, however, was a little too spicy for my flavor. I know it's 'Cajun' style, but it left such a hot aftertaste in my mouth that it felt a bit much. I can see Steve's being a cool little spot to grab a burger from every now and then if i was from the PHX area. Right around the corner from the stadium and arena- got nice outdoor seating that's kept cool by overhead sprinklers- I give it a solid 3 stars.We stopped in here for dinner because it was very close to our hotel and we were able to be seated immediately. They have outdoor seating, which we chose since it was a nice evening. The seating its self was lacking. The staff was nice but not on top of their game. They did not come around often enough and made some errors.I was feeling like something simple so I ordered the Breakfast Burro. It comes stuffed with scrambled eggs, green chiles, potatoes and cheddar cheese. I chose to add sausage. It was good sized, enough to fill me up. The flavor was a touch bland, but I was able to overcome that with some hot sauce.This is not a bad place. If you are looking for affordable bar food, then it probably will be ok.

Review Text :
This area has plenty of housing but not many options to choose from for evening cocktails. Luckily a spot like 92nd Street Cafe exists. Now, here's something very important to note: disregard the name "cafe" in the title. When I think of a cafe, I think of a quaint spot where I can get a nice coffee, a simple sandwich/salad and sit for hours while reading a book. But at 92nd Street Cafe, think about this spot more as one where you go to after a couple or to get a couple drinks and waist the day/night away with bar food and dive drinks. The scene here is pretty classic and fun. I walked in and saw a large group of bar goers themed in their best 80s attire. I saw old men who were stumbling around like they'd been drinking since 1989 and I saw normal bar goers just there to kick back and have a few. It's divey in here but clean, the staff is friendly and the drinks are good. It's a narrow bar but surprisingly has a decent amount of seating a room. The interior has plenty of activities for the drinkers as well. I will end this review with a funny observation I made while there and that's the fact that this bar is right next to Sweet Republic. One day the kids are getting ice cream with their folks, the next day they are home from college and discover 92nd Street Cafe next door.-10 stars. They sit there and let their racist karaoke leader mock customers and get into altercations and shove women who are patrons of the bar. He has assaulted our our family by physically shoving  the hat of my brother deeper onto his head instigating a fight between a big group of people. This bar only supports their " regulars" and do not make new customers feel welcomed.Worst place ever! Their nasty karaoke singer who is a regular, physically assaulted my brother-in-law and the bartenders did not care! There was no manager or owner on staff! This place is managed horribly and I do not recommend it to anyone!

So this Nathan's is in the foodcourt at the MGM, which shares the space with a Panda Express-like Chinese food place, a McDonald's, and a Pizza place.  It's actually an interesting place for a foodcourt, considering Craftsteak and SeaBlue (by Michael Mina) are practically right next door.I got the 2 hot dog and fries combo for $8.95.  The staff seemed friendly enough.  I didn't have any problems.The hot dogs are just.  I guess you can say it's like how people go gaga over Pink's for no good reason because let's face it, Pink's isn't even really that good.  You go really only for the experience of eating at a Los Angeles institution.  I feel the same way with Nathan's.  It's such a historic New York tradition that when someone says "I want to go try Nathan's" not because it's THAT good, but because it's a cultural experience.  That's my two cents anyway.I would however have to say that the hotdog skin has nice pop.  You know what I mean?  No?  Amateurs....I probably wouldn't come back though.Nathan's became a much needed stop before heading to the pool in the mornings. Not for a hot dog, but for breakfast sandwiches!We stopped by on Thursday, July 11th & Friday, July 12th. Though we gravitated towards the familiar McDonald's for a sandwich, Nathan's line was shorter, so we decided to try them out.I got the Sausage, egg and cheese on an English muffin, add bacon the first morning. I figured they would just add bacon to the sandwich, but they gave me a good amount on the side. I think like 5 strips. I believe it was an extra $2 to add bacon, so the amount justified the cost. The second morning, I got the same sandwich without adding bacon. I believe the sandwich was over $5, but less than $6. I can't really remember as I didn't document any of these meals. Both days, the sandwiches hit the spot! I liked that the cheese was melted on the egg and not all over the muffin as I could just eat the inside of the sandwich if I wasn't super hungry.Nathan's offered a great alternative to McDonald's sausage egg mcmuffin. Plus, we didn't have to wait in their ridiculously long line!

Came to lunch with a bunch of my coworkers. We made reservations on the patio and although it is right next to a busy intersection and the freeway I really didn't notice either. I really liked their patio and all of  trees provided plenty of shade. It was still a little chilly out when we were here for lunch, but they had a fire going in the outdoor fireplace on which made sitting outside much more comfortable. I wasn't very hungry so I ordered the Dynamite Shrimp Roll, which came with 8 pieces of sushi. It had a little bit of a kick to it which I enjoyed, but I could taste the scallions the rest of the day.  The rest of the table had salads and sandwiches which came in pretty generous portions. Although they were pretty busy, service was beyond slow. We had finished eating at least 15 minutes (but I'm thinking it was even longer than that) before they brought us the check. This normally wouldn't have bothered me if it had been around the dinner hour, but most people only have an hour for lunch and want to get in and out.This place is a bit pricey compared to a lot of the other lunch options around the airpark, but it's a nice place to go for lunch or drinks.

Review Text :
Cheap prices, free WiFi, and a recommendation from Tetsu...inspired us to try this place (twice) in the Miracle Mile Shops at Planet Hollywood.  Lunch starts at $5.99 and dinner at $8.99.  The Island Salmon Salad was my favorite.  The mango vinaigrette and marinated onion not only blended with the greens, but worked well with their salmon filet that was cooked just right.  The pistachios added crunch and flavor to this dish too.  The half pound sirloin burger didn't look like it was half a pound, and taste wasn't all that either.  The wild mushroom pepperoni pizza was good in size, but lacked mushrooms and pepperoni.  A crispier crust would've helped too. As for the Grilled Chicken Club...I've had better!   Service was above average though.  Tracy rocks!  She put cherry flavored syrup in my diet coke and allowed us to plug in our laptop into the wall near the kitchen.For low-cost lunch with nice ambiance ON THE STRIP....I'll be back!We were staying at the Elara Hilton Garden Vacations Club, which was located just around the corner from this restaurant within the mall.  One morning we were walking by with a little over an hour to spare and thought that we would dine here for breakfast.  There were only a few tables with patrons seated, so we figured we would be able to catch a quick coffee and meal for three under an hour.Big mistake.  Once we were seated outdoors around the corner, it seemed as if we were out of sight and out of mind.  Everything took long from placing our orders to receiving our meals and getting the final bill.  It was extremely stressful being that we were on a time constraint, and had to leave the hotel an hour later.  We had to gobble down our food once it arrived and had asked for the bill at the same time.Our simple meals consisting of waffles, pancakes and bacon were pretty decent, but the extremely slow service brings down their rating another star or two.  I wouldn't say that I'd be interested in coming back anytime soon.#100 / 100Yelp 100 Review Challenge 2014Brunch is absolutely necessary after a night out in sin city! We took a short walk over to Planet Hollywood for food, not knowing what we want. The Ocean One Bar and Grille breakfast menu was out so we decided to take a look. Our party of 9 was seated fairly quick.Garden Omelette ($8.95): This veggie omelette came with a side of toast (white/wheat) and some potatoes. Portions were a good size for the price. I'm actually surprised the omelette wasn't more, especially dining in at a restaurant inside of a casino! Everything tasted a little bland or very average.Our waiter messed up on quite a few orders we had (wrong type of bread, incorrect way of how the eggs are cooked, etc). Needless to say, our service wasn't very good the entire stay but I'm sure he didn't really care since we were required to give the 18% gratuity anyways.There are better brunch places out there!It was a 4 "o" clock on Saturday, December 6 when I laid eyes on the sign advertising "half pound sirloin burger with sautéed onions, lettuce, tomatoes, mushrooms, bacon, mayonnaise, and provolone cheese, and seasoned fries for $6.99. I had been on the Las Vegas Strip for hours and walking from Ebar in Fashion Show Mall toward the south Strip my reliable hunger was kicking in. I was strolling the corridors of the Miracle Mile when this sign caught my eyes. $6.99 for a half pound cheeseburger with toppings in a full service restaurant sounds to good to be true, however, I am cognizant of the fact that Miracle Mile with Planet Hollywood have some decent deals in the heart of the Las Vegas Strip. So, I thought, "what is the worst that could happen if I gave Ocean One a try?"     Upon entering the restaurant, I questioned the $6.99 burger. The friendly hostess let me know that it is available for dinner and that it didn't start for an hour (5 PM).     Fast forward to 5 PM, I reentered the exact scenery and talked to the same hostess. It was obvious that the burger deal wasn't a gimmicks at the exact time that they weren't going to give prime seating to that customer who came here for the $6.99 burger at a table in the restaurant. My choices were at the bar or in the patio overlooking the walking path of Miracle Mile. I chose the patio. The hostess seated me at a table visible to the restaurant so that they would know I'm there. A few minutes further, a waitress knew I was there. This waitress wasn't nasty, enthusiastic, or friendly.    I had done enough walking. Now it was time to dig in and do some eating. The burger I was eating was nothing like a Smokestack burger down the Strip in Shake Shack, or nothing like a mouthwatering burger at Fukuburger down the Strip in Hawaiian Marketplace, or as thick and juicy as a burger in Outback down by Showcase Mall. With a bottomless Coke this came out to $10.72 before a tip that made Ocean One a far better deal than OVERPAYING for a $17 dry Philly cheesesteak meal at Nathan's or $16.50 for a cheeseburger at the Treasure Island Cafe. The cheeseburger and seasoned fries were good. It did the job by filling me up at a good price where the only gimmick is that I was looking in at the attractive brightly lit dining room from the patio.      In conclusion I was satisfied just like my wallet was with the $6.99 cheeseburger meal. There are so many dining options on the Las Vegas Strip and so many nights for me to hang out here that Ocean One looks like a one time experience in the near future.

This review is based entirely around the Super Gyro menu item, a fully loaded gyro that happens to be the best I've had in Vegas.  When I'm giving a 5 star review, I'm basically saying that the establishment will be a repeat eat for me.  If I am craving a gyro, this is the place that I want to go.  This place is located on Fremont Street just east of Las Vegas Boulevard, so coming here when I get that craving isn't always the most convenient solution.  How good is their super gyro?  A few weekends ago my friends and I met downtown at Firefly at the Plaza.  I've never been disappointed at Firefly, and this was no exception.  However, after spending a few hours at Downtown Cocktail room (another place that I've never been disappointed) I seriously had a craving for a super gyro.  So after dropping about $20 at Firefly per person (which always leaves me satisfied as far as food portions go) I was willing to get a super gyro here.  As a comparison, the main contenders for my favorite gyro have been the Paymon's, the Greek American Grill, The Mad Greek and The Olive Mediterranean Grill.  Hands down Kabob Korner is at the top of my list, for gyros specifically.Searching for a 'healthy' option for lunch led me to KK. Picked up a large Greek salad ($4.99) and an order of chicken boti ($7.99). Wait, before I chat about the food, let's discuss the place...it's pretty narsty. Seriously, there are wilting posters of gyros on the wall. Poster of gyros? Excellent. Gross poster from 1970? Not something you want to find in a food establishment. When looking around (it took 15 min to make the boti) you can see the place is really long and the kitchen is large for what they put out. I think it's time for a remodel peeps. It should also be noted that the guy at the counter was messing around with his foot and the bottom of his sock (yep, he was in socks n sandals) before taking my order. I couldn't bear watching to see if he was handling my food, so I sat in the corner. Ignorance is bliss, no? So I got my order and went home. The boti ended up consisting of 5 pieces of super awesome chicken and a truck load of rice. Damn that was good chicken! Tender, spicy, yum! But 5 pieces stinks for $8. It was like eating a rice salad with kabob on top. Lame. The large Greek was decent in size for the price, but the dressing lacked any sort of flavor. Kinda reminded me of Italian house dressing (gasp!). This all being said, I'll be back. Def for a gyro and yes, maybe even for 5 delish pieces of chicken over a rice salad. Hold the sock grime. Actually, put it on the side.Had to up the star rating here. Sure, the interior is still the capital of Grime City, but the super gyro is tasty and the chicken boti, while small in quantity, is still a good dish. Plus, I didn't see any bare feet this go-round. Seriously though, the gyro meat is solid. Moist, spicy and flavorful, it's def the star in this sammie. As usual, prepare to wait 10 min for your order. (Call ahead!)New tastes: Hummus (avoid)Greek salad (sub par)Hmmm. Maybe it should be a 2.5 star rating....

Starving, tipsy and needing a place to rest my sore tootsies, I headed to Hennessey's with my group last night. In costume, I might add. We located a spot on the patio for the best spot to people watch. Service was friendly, albeit incredibly SLOW given how not so busy the place was. Drink orders were mixed up and our large order of french fries took about 45 minutes to come out. Great location and typically when I come the service is much better, so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt that the Halloween crowd slowed them down a bit. Definitely a good little place to take a seat and rest with a beverage or some pub grub while you're downtown. People watching from the patio is a plus!While wandering down Fremont Street for the first time I needed to get my drinking started and I started it here. though there was a lack of certain beers they weren't short on Jameson's which I despise. So with drinking aside I went for the food and they had an awesome hamburger. I was really surprised of how good it was. Not the best bar on Fremont but I couldn't knock it, it was cool.Like if there aren't enough eats in Fremont Street to enjoy, I just had to come to this place simply because it caught my eye! Myself and my foodie +1 date were running kinda late for EDC this past weekend and saw that this place was the closest nearby our hotel. Boy, did we sure make quite the great choice coming here!Let me first say that due to the fact that my phone was near death in battery life, I was not able to take any pics of the eats we had to enjoy. I will just describe the experience instead! Inside it is very roomy with plenty of ample seating, as well as outdoor patio seating. This place does have live bands coming to play. Sweet! They do have a fully stocked open bar as well as some of the most courteous staff! Our waitress was very prompt in making sure our needs were fulfilled. I think her name was Shannon or Sharon. Either way, she was very professional and sweet!For the eats, I ordered their Irish nachos, which came with a scoop of sour cream, which added to the already awesome taste. My foodie date had their amazing spinach and artichoke dip. Whoa. Some of the best we have ever had! For drinks, she had the lemonade with vodka. I had to opt for their iced tea(I was the DD that night!) The food came out rather quickly, which we was able to enjoy nicely.As I stated before, there are such a variety of places to eat on Fremont Street in Las Vegas. This is one place that I highly recommend. The service was impeccable, the eats were just amazing and the overall experience was a memorable one. Next time I am in the area, I will definitely be making a pit stop here. That is how much this place impressed me.

We get into Vegas Friday evening, checked in, and began our weekend off with a night of debauchery.Food porn at Oyshi. Yessiree, four hungry men and a AYCE Japanese food? This is gonna get ugly fast, real fast. We get there and it's packed. A nice waiter greeted us and told us it might be a while. 20 minutes. Shit, thats it? His reaction made it seem like an hour or 2. Dude! We'll wait. The restaurant is nicely designed with modern furnishings. Its set to look very relaxing like a lounge. Like Gerald S pointed out, it's not set up well if there's large groups. The good side is that it doesn't feel overcrowded. The AYCE is probably the best and only way to go here. There are so many items to choose from and the quality was not as bad as I thought it would be. They do limit the expensive stuff like uni, amaebi, and raw oysters, but it was well worth it. The sushi was very well made and fresh. Their sushi cuts are very generous. They hardly give any rice, so it was perfect. Everything was awesome, from the salmon, tempura, ribeye, and unlimited green tea or vanilla ice cream!!! Like hawks, we swooped down and attacked everything. Nothing was safe. We washed it all down with hot house sake ($7). For $25, I would do it over, and over, and over, and over, *deep breath*, and over again. The food came out slow, it was expected because they  had a full house. The service was simply awesome. If it's a Friday or Saturday, give them a call to make reservations. We left hurting and sat in our car like beached whales. You may have defeated us Oyshi, but we'll be back. Back with bigger and hungrier guys. *waives fist*Yeah, the Husband and I are sushi snobs - at least we're upfront about it.  But when you're living in Vegas, the only way to go is to do AYCE, right?  After getting tons of recommendations for this place, we finally got around to seeing what the hype is all about.All-you-can-eat dinner is $26/pp.  It was pretty busy on a Sunday night with a steady stream of customers (and large groups) coming in all night long.Like Ned M. mentioned, the sushi rice is only okay...it could be better.  Perhaps that's what put us off already...we had to eat the rice and we weren't digging it.We ordered lots of nigiri and found the fish to be okay too, some of it was mushy though.  As one friend mentioned, she wished the fish was a bit 'colder'.  Maybe we came on a bad night - but everyone is raving about the fish.  I'm also not too fond of 'sauce' added to my nigiri, and they added 'sauce' to a lot of my nigiri choices.  They do offer a wider selection of side items like Asian style skirt steak, ribeye steak teriyaki, etc.  And for this reason, one friend prefers coming here over other AYCE places.  I do like their version of agadashi tofu though.Limitations on their menu include:* one order of uni and amaebi per person* limit one order of oysters on the half shell (4 pieces) per person* limit one order on desserts of creme brulee, mochi ice cream, berry parfait or green tea tiramisu (regular ice cream is AYCE though - plum, green tea, vanilla, and coffee)Sitting at the sushi bar, service was pretty good.  The manager seemed like he was our main waiter and he was quite attentive.  We thought we were supposed to order our sushi from the sushi chef, but he asked the manager to take our sushi order instead.  He continued to take our orders throughout the night and refilled our beverages too.  There was a gap at one point where our tempura order was forgotten, had to be reordered again, and then had to be followed up on again before we got it.I can see why this place is popular - there's definitely a mixed crowd and separate rooms for private parties.  The staff are busy and attentive and they definitely recognize the regulars.  They have a lot of rolls to choose from, something that we usually avoid.  Overall, we found Oyshi Sushi to be an average place for AYCE sushi.Oyshi Sushi is a pretty good AYCE sushi restaurant located in the SW.  After hearing my coworker praising it, I finally hit up the place with a few Meetup folks from Las Vegas and SoCal.  It is the sister restaurant to Soyo Barestaurant in the same plaza, so yes, this is another Korean owned sushi restaurant with some items that has a more Korean flare/flavor.The restaurant itself is well-lit and trendily decorated, and attracts a diverse crowd of patrons looking for good AYCE sushi at a reasonable price.The AYCE menu is practically the entire menu (mostly nigiri and rolls), except the sashimi and if I remembered correctly some salads.  They also have expanded their menu, and the new items are printed on the paper place mats, so don't forget to check those out too.  Plus the numerous options available in the appetizer section is more than adequate to round out the sushi dining experience.  There are three special items (uni, ama ebi and raw oysters) that is limited to one order/pp with AYCE, and the restaurant reserves the right to charge you for the food you don't finish to minimize unnecessary waste (standard rules of the AYCE realm).I Enjoyed:Sibuya No Rice RollNew Moon RollVegas No Rice RollYumYum ScallopAma Ebi and the fried shrimp headsSurf n TurfPopcorn ScallopsI Didn't Care For:Japanese Lasagna (topped with way too much mayo that it overwhelmed and masked the flavor profile of the rolls underneath)Asian Style Flank Steak (basically a not so good version of the traditional Korean Bulgogi served on a sizzling plate)Green Tea TiramisuService was good, especially considering that Ted, was our only waiter, and he was looking after our party of 7 plus his other tables.We were seated in one of the side rooms with really comfortable seats, so it was extra relaxing.Ambiance: 5/5  Great vibes.Service: 4/5  For a busy night, our service was still great.Food: 4/5  Overall, I think it is pretty good for AYCE.Price: 4.5/5  Very reasonable.Parking: 5/5  Never been a problem finding a parking space when I come to this plaza.4 Stars!I am all about trying a new place! I really was pleased with the quality of sushi at Oyshi. If not for Yelp, I would have never known about this cool sushi joint. I fell in love with the darker more intimate atmosphere. I always sit at the bar when I go for sushi, that is the only way to have the best experience! They are friendly, and keep the dishes rolling my way! I have listed a few of my faves that I selected during AYCE. Ok so the Signature OYSHI ROLL was my favorite! I had two of those baby! My mouth was kissing me from the inside and it was the best feeling! I want to feel that again, soon! Very soon!Shrimp TempuraOYSHI shrimp tempura roll with dynamite and crunch flakes an topCRAZY PHILLYdeep fried Philadelphia with eel sauceVOLCANO baked yum-yum scallop on top of a cali roll, glazed with eel sauceFANTASYsalmon, shrimp, avocado, asparagus and cream cheese wrapped in soy paperDYNAMITE ROLL cali roll with baked yum-yum scallop, shrimp, crab mix, and mushroomSPIDER ROLL deep fried soft-shell crab, crab mix, avocado with eel sauceI just realized that I have not yet written a review for my favorite sushi spot on earth! Here it goes!! Although I have not been here in months because I moved on the opposite end of Vegas, now turning into a 30 minute drive, compared to a 5 minute drive =(WHERE: Located on Rainbow & RobindaleWHAT:  Everything about this local sushi joint is outstanding! From the uniqueness of the special rolls to the to the great customer service, this is the place to try!If you do get the chance to come here for your first, second, or millionth time, I suggest AYCE all the way!! Lunch is 24.95 and dinner is 27.95- so worth the time and money spent!One of my favorite appetizers is the ahi poke! There's something about the mixture that makes you want to order 5 of them and make your own dish!ROLLS:-Oyshi roll: The first thing you should try! It is their special roll, and the absolute best!!-Vegas & Sibuya rolls: If I can recall, these are the 2 rolls without rice! & are both full of flavor!-Japanese Lasagna roll: I always have to have my baked roll!!There are other great rolls, but I can't remember what the names were! So, until next time! I will update soon!*NOTE: You also get a free dessert with AYCE!! There are the fruit&yogurt parfait, creme brulee, ice cream, or mochi!I cant believe its taken me this long to find this place! stumbled upon this sushi restaurant while out doing some errands today and what a hidden treasure! Usually sushi bars have a very boring decor and bland music but this place was playing Trance music.. that is awesome! with beautiful decor to the wall art and the exposed pipes it has a very stylish/modern feel to it. I almost felt like I was in San Francisco. I ordered the seaweed salad. It was a very generous portion but my only gripe was it was completely covered in sesame seeds which i am not a fan but know next time to request them to be left out. The seaweed itself was very fresh and the right amount of dressing was used.Then i ordered the Hawaiian roll with soy paper. It had albacore, shrimp, and cucumber inside wrapped in a Cajun albacore and avocado tossed with some ponzu sauce... heaven. Seriously one of the best sushi rolls I have ever had and I consider myself a sushi connoisseur. Next time I'm there I will defiantly get the all you can eat. for $25 its well worth it. Why only 4 stars? horrible service, I sat at a table and had a difficult time ordering and keeping my water glass filled. but whatever the food was so great Ill defiantly  recommend it.I cant believe its taken me this long to find this place! stumbled upon this sushi restaurant while out doing some errands today and what a hidden treasure!

The popcorn scallops are amazing as well. they're little scallops deep fried and served with a wasabi ranch and honey mustard sauce. I had the all you can eat which was only $25 and that even included 2 oysters! Amazing deal especially for the quality. Ive already been 3 times in the past 3 days and Ill probably end up here at least 3-4 times a week. LOVE LOVE LOVE!Oh! and the sushi chefs are awesome. :)This was my second visit to Oyshi and it still stands strong with 4 stars! Our experience started off a bit rocky as we waited to be seated while the bar was empty? The Manager stated that we "needed to wait a few to be seated so that the Sushi Chefs can get caught up". There were two other guys who were waiting as well who told us they have been waiting 10 minutes so far to be seated. This was a Saturday so I will take that into consideration I suppose for the extra wait. Anyhow we are finally seated at the bar as we requested and are greeted about 5 minutes later by the most Awesome server named Diego. Things started to take a turn for the better thank goodness even though we did not have food for at least 25 minutes after sitting at the bar.We decided on the AYCE menu and it was lunch time on top of it so for $21.00 each we were ready to grub!This was my boyfriends first time here and I have only been once prior which was a great visit as well!All of our rolls and appetizers were spot on fresh and tasty! The service we received from server Diego was Outstanding which made our visit a real treat on top of the yummy food. At the end of our meal my boyfriend even informed the Manager of how Fantastic Diego was however he seemed preoccupied as he was rushing us out the door by saying OK , OK ,OK. Wow the same Manager that told us we would have to wait to be seated so that the Sushi Chefs can catch up. That sucks because when people go up and beyond in providing you with excellent service I really think they should be recognized and to give a Manager an employee compliment who could care less is unfortunate. Not the best of Service from the Manager however Diego our server was a Star!I took photos and labeled a few of the items we had.Oyshi used to be my favorite AYCE sushi spot.  They had a wide variety of quality rolls, great tasting food, consistent service, and a really nice atmosphere that made for a great spot to have pre-game Friday night dinner. Although the sushi is still pretty good, the service and management has gone off the deep end and because of this, I don't think I'll ever eat at Oyshi again.  There are too many quality sushi restaurants in Las Vegas to justify returning to Oyshi where the last few visits, all I seem to get are orders that never show up, drinks that never get filled, waiters that refuse to come to our table or our spot at the bar (even though it's obvious that you've seen me flag you down), and servers/staff that are increasingly bitter and unfriendly.  This stuff matters. Oddly enough, it's also the stuff that is easiest to fix. When you've already got quality menu items, quality sushi chefs, and quality sushi rolls that people rave about - why are you letting your terrible servers and management ruin your restaurant?If I'm sitting at the sushi bar and I'm trying to order more beer and sake, why are people refusing to help me out? If I want to give you my money in exchange for some-what overpriced alcohol, why does it take more than 20 minutes for someone to take my drink order and then another 20 to bring me a couple of beers and sake? This should never be an issue with a sushi restaurant.  Never. Sure, AYCE places get really busy and I totally understand that. But, if you can't handle the heat - hire more servers. I shouldn't have to wait more than 45 minutes for my order. And when my order does come out, half of it shouldn't be missing. It also shouldn't take you another 30 minutes to bring out the pieces missing from my order. And you shouldn't have an attitude with customers just because they are asking for the items they originally ordered that are missing because you either forgot to put the orders in or there was a mix up in the kitchen. I am never rude to waiters or management and this last experience at Oyshi was no exception. I was pleasant and more than patient and if I still can't get someone to so much as offer an apology for missing orders/missing drinks and for treating me like I was more of a burden than a customer bringing a lot of business to the establishment, then I will happily take my business elsewhere. Sorry, Oyshi, it was good while it lasted!I went to oyshi for lunch on a Friday and was immediately seated. The ambiance was beautiful.The food was really good with a wide selection of rolls . I love how the customize what goes on the rolls if you ask . The nigiri was really fresh but I've had better. What really stood out for me was the desserts Our server Julia was the bomb ! She was really friendly and answered all of the questions I had . Although she was quite busy , she still kept tabs on us and made sure our drinks were always full and our tables were cleared . Oyshi is definately a place you want to check out , from the food to the amazing service.I've been here too many times to not write a review.Service has always been great. Every waiter/waitress that have waited on my party and I have been attentive and polite.  We usually come here for dinner/late night. Our orders were always correct and it comes out pretty quick...I'd say within 10-15 minutes.We ALWAYS order the ATOMIC BOMB ($11). And yes...it's bomb dot com. We also order the usual spicy tuna roll. Here at Oyshi they make one of the best spicy tuna rolls. Some spicy tuna rolls are not even spicy...but here, there's a great kick to it. We've also tried other rolls like Love Affair, Heart Attack ($9-13) and a few others. Didn't really leave a lasting impression. A few days ago, we tried the JAPANESE GARLIC LASAGNA and it was yummy!!!! Soooo now I got a new roll added to my usual two.Can't wait to be back! Never disappoints! =)

Review Text :
"Iron Chef loser". That's David Burke, and I got to taste this losers food first-hand with the restaurant bearing his name, and I'd have to break it down Iron Chef style:Like the original Iron Chef, each chef can be awarded up to 20 points; -- consisting of up to 10 points for taste-- up to 5 points for plating (the appearance of their presentation)-- and up to 5 points for the originality of their dishes.Since it was New Years Eve, we did the prix fixe menu which consisted of either the 5 course ($125.00) or the 4 course meal ($95.00). TASTE:----------------------------------------------Aside from the amuse-bouche, we were also served a brioche with butter served atop a brick of Himalayan pink salt (odd, but I received this also as an Xmas gift). This wasn't that impressive in regards to flavor, so was this mainly about novelty/plating vs. taste? If this was served atop Elvis collectible plates, it would have won a couple more points for originality.This is what pissed me off the most, and I think it's what made me despise this place to some degree. It's that they served up the main dish as a "Kobe beef" dish which I really questioned at the get-go because most of the times it's not "Kobe" beef. Kobe is from the Hyogo Prefecture in Japan. Most times, this isn't what you're getting. Instead, what you get, including the place I worked at is wagyu beef, but it's usually Australian or American wagyu. We got American wagyu which is what Jay, one of our servers had stipulated to us, and if this confuses you, you can liken the naming of Kobe, like Champagne which should be called "bubbly" or hot tubs being called a "Jacuzzi". So, regardless what it's called, it sucked! It was no where near the quality or taste of Australian or Japanese wagyu. What I ate didn't taste like, and had nowhere near the marbling of the wagyu you can pick-up at Mitsuwa for some freak'n chump change ($59.99 a lb). If they would have just called it American Wagyu, than my expectations would have been lower and more appropriate, but of course it's all about the easily marketable recognition of "Kobe beef". Another sidenote: The "Himalayan salt" is actually also marketing mumbo jumbo because it's actually a product primarily from Pakistan.I already went off on the Kobe beef being called "Kobe", but I never mentioned how it was also prepared overly salted!!, and I'm a huge salt-a-holic. This one was almost so bad that we should have sent it back because they also didn't bother to trim the meat properly, so I had a decent portion of my cut that was a huge chunk of fat. Yum, I got to eat huge chunks of salty fat.... I hope it was Pakistani salt.The biggest redemption to the meal was definitely the fish dish. The roasted red pepper puree and the dish as a whole was very good, and I think everybody enjoyed this one the most. The last bit of the meal to top things off was the dessert. I'm not a huge sweets/dessert fan, but I made an exception for this dessert because I can't pass up chocolate if I do eat sweets, and the crunchy texture of the dessert was probably one of the most impressive elements of the dessert. I should also say that the scoop of ice cream wasn't chocolate. Instead, It was some funky flavor. An Iron Chef trademark.PLATING:----------------------------------------------The butter we had for the brioche was plated atop a brick of Himalayan salt that's pink in color, so it looked kind of cool, but I just thought it was such a waste if they didn't re-use the salt although I'm sure they do since salt is inherently antimicrobial.What I did enjoy was the multiple vegetable puree's that were served with the dishes including the multitude of small little veggies involved in the plating. A lot of detail, and a lot of effort were put into these dishes that were tasty and looked good. Also, they used culinary foam...ooh, aahh.ORIGINALITY:----------------------------------------------The beginning of the meal started with the amuse-bouche which is supposed to be a hint at the what's to come, but what was presented was an extremely unoriginal and extremely typical tuna tartare. After seeing that, I wasn't too optimistic on originality. I think this would be common place even in a mid-west suburban franchise.The next unoriginal dish was the spinach salad with some sort or balsamic vinaigrette which possibly consisted of some gorgonzola cheese, apple slices, and candied walnuts. This was a huge f'n let down because it was so typical. I've even prepared this sort of salad numerous times, but I include sliced red onions for my tastes, and I prefer arugula over spinach.Here's how I judged David Burke's restaurant:-- TASTE: 7-- PLATING: 3-- ORIGINALITY: 2TOTAL SCORE IS: a 12 out of a 20The total bill was $601 for 4 people with an automatic 20% tip, so whose the loser now.... ok, it's not David Burke.

"White chocolate-flavored beer?"  Those were the last words I said before falling in love.  The thing is, I don't even like white chocolate.  But, as a beer, my tastebuds and my stomach were transported to the closest thing on Earth that could be referred to as Heaven.I'm exaggerating, but not very much.  It's like saying, "A gajillion!" when the actual number is 753 quadrillion.Their other beers are great, too.  You can always ask, "Hey, what's new here?" and they'll go through an exhaustive list.  Ask them what their new favorite is and you'll get something amazing.The food is not only nothing special, I don't even recommend going there with food in mind.  It's not terrible but it's really just not that good.  They have a chicken pesto sandwich that's alright, but generally, I would say, come here after you already ate and stick to beer.The service is great.  They're always, always as nice as can be without being Ned Flanders about it.  If I ever saw someone being a dick to one of the help, I'd probably lose my shit and go Tony Soprano on 'em.I saw Barack Obama's acceptance speech here, the vice presidential debate between Biden and Palin and the first half of the Super Bowl.  This is sort of like my second home, only maybe a little bit better because there's more than one toilet.

Restaurant name  The Bagel Cafe
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
What's a good way to start Saturday Morning in Las Vegas....Bagels and Starbucks! The breakfast bagels came with cream cheese and we probably got about a dozen bagels. The bagels were tasty, definitely a little hard on the outside but still good. Got the bagels and headed to the Starbucks drive though :)New York Style Deli's are a touchy subject with me.  When done right, they are like staring into the face of God and having him smile back you and say "You are my most precious creation" but when done wrong, they make me sadder than Pauly Shore's acting career.  The Bagel is in the former category and can easily lay claim to best delicatessen in Las Vegas.Judge a Jewish deli by five things:  The rye bread, the pastrami, the knish, the sweet & sour cabbage soup and if they sell the black & white cookie.  Alright, that last one might be homage to Seinfeld, but the other 4 will definitely tell you if a Deli is worth it's salt.  The Bagel has them down.  First, the rye bread is fresh and the perfect consistency.  Its got a nice crust and the heels are a perfect complement to any of their soups or sandwiches.  Speaking of soups, their sweet & sour cabbage soup is dynamite.  Chocked full of cabbage and with a simple beef bouillon to absorb the flavors, its a nice lunch on a cold day...to remind you of back home in Jersey.  The pastrami is like butter and practically melts in your mouth and if you want to get fancy, upgrade to a Reuben.  Finally the Knish....where do I began?  You are so good, I'm officially declaring myself on "a gravy train with knish wheels."  So you're probably wondering why no five stars?  Well, the Bagel is excellent but I cant dis the original gangsta deli's like Brent's in LA, Manny's in Chicago or Katz's in New York by putting it on the same level so consider the Bagel 4 1/2 stars as it pays homage to the grand masters.  For Las Vegas however, you can't do any better.  Ohhh, and you're probably wondering why I never even brought up their namesake as well.  Bagels here are good, but bagels are bagels.  They do have an impressive selection and to go is available if you're not dining in.  They also have a bakery that would make my Bubby declare this place "Meshugganah!" the portions are so large....I like Italian cookies so, when East Coast peeps such as Mario S and John F kept checking in and posting pictures of goodies from this place, I had to make it my mission to go here.  It must be legit.You seat yourself and read the menu that looks like a newspaper then the server takes your order. For anything to-go, you have to go to the deli/bakery line.I had such a sugar rush when I ate half a pound of the rainbow cookies. Those treats with the colors of the Italian flag that tastes like almond with apricot jam in each layer and chocolate on top. They're so good I couldn't stop myself from eating them.  I easily spent $56 on rainbow cookies, raspberry rugulach, apple rugulach, black and white cookies, Florentine cookies, linzers, etc.  Their eggs benedict was also yummy.  Great Hollandaise sauce (consistency and flavor).  It comes with potatoes.  I also tried their cheese blintzes with strawberries.  Each blintz was fully stuffed with sweet cream cheese filling.  I could only eat 1.They also have sandwiches, matzoh ball soup, salmon, white fish, etc. on their menu. Bagels and schmear, meats, monster-sized cupcakes, 7-layer cake, carrot cake, etc in the bakery/deli. I wish I would have known about this place a long time ago so I could have fed the doctors at work more variety of Kosher treats.  But at the same time, I'm glad I didn't know about this place a long time ago, otherwise, I would be 200lbs heavier by now!Born and raised in New York the warm and soft bagel is a part of my heritage. It seemed that I would have to board the Concorde if I was to have a New York bagel in a reasonable time. That was until I stepped foot in the Bagel Cafe.  The Bagel Cafe is a slice of the Big Apple approximately ten miles northwest of NY-NY in the Summerlin community of Las Vegas. The four times that I have had breakfast here in very recent times, my mind literally left Vegas and entered a New York bagel restaurant. As soon as I stepped on line, displayed right to my left were Wise Potato chips. Wise Potato chips are a popular brand of potato chips that are extremely popular in New York, but sold in a few places in Vegas :( . When I looked to the right, standing out from the display cases of cookies were the rainbow cookies. Since leaving New York, I have rarely laid eyes on them in Las Vegas. The closest rainbow cookies that I have seen to Las Vegas were at Chompie's Deli in Phoenix. After being seated sitting in front of me was the warm and soft bagel. Three times, I ordered egg salad on a bagel and once a BLT on the warm and soft bagel. The quality was superb. The bagel sandwich was overflowing with egg salad that was topped off with lettuce, onions, and a tomato. The BLT was the antithesis of the pathetic BLT that I recently ordered at Panera Bread. It was overflowing with crunchy beacon. With each sandwich, I ordered potato salad and coffee. The coffee tasted just as good as the bagel shops that I remembered before Starbuck's came on the scene. In actuality, the coffee is just as good as Starbuck's.  Just like New York, the Bagel Cafe is crowded. Parking is a challenge, and it is almost guaranteed that some walking is required. The Bagel Cafe is located in a professional park on the west side of Buffalo Drive south of the Summerlin Parkway. Unlike the New York City landmarks, it blends in with the professional buildings. On account of the parking lot being linear with the popularity of the Bagel Cafe, each time I had to walk the distance of two professional buildings (not complaining. I went here before hikes). On weekends, there was a wait. The Bagel Cafe is relatively large and the weekend waits were no longer than 15 minutes. On the other hand, it was less crowded on a Wednesday at 1 p.m., and the "Please Wait to Be Seated" sign was turned around to "Please seat yourself."  The Bagel Cafe differentiates from the prices of the New York bagel shops that I know of in New York. Unless inflation at the New York Bagel shops went up in double digits, the Bagel Cafe prices seem steeply higher than those of the bagel shops that I remembered. From my experiences here, it is the Waitresses that can make and break the price. The first two times that I had my New York moments here, the sweet Waitress passed on a tip that if you order a sandwich on a bagel instead of bread (Did not come here for bread) that you get a full sandwich for the price of a half sandwich. Fast forward to the last two times, and the impersonal Waitress was charging me for the full sandwich (check with tip came to around $15). But what could I do?  It would still be far less expensive than flying in a Concorde to New York.  If you grew up with the New York bagel, or are just a fan of it; I recommend the Bagel Cafe. On the four visits that I visited Bagel Cafe, I have made it a point to stop by on the way to a park. Admittedly I planned to hike in a nearby park a couple of those times with the excuse to check-in here. I am so confident that I will get in a mood for the New York Bagel. With that said, I see Bagel Cafe check-ins in my future.****Please note that there are other establishments using the Bagel Cafe name or similar to it. The one in the Sun Coast I rated 2 stars.I'm updating my review due to the extremely RUDE manager on duty on Easter! I placed an order for pick up early on Sunday to have picked up at two. I ordered four meals and several pastries from the case. When I was checking out I mentioned that I was to get a side and bagel option with the Benedict I ordered, per their menu online(see picture). Two girls told me no before they asked the manager, Jeremy/Jerry. Who said no but go a head and give it to her, I said thank you. He proceeds to get a menu to point it out. I said ok just to let you know your menu online says that all eggs and omelet dishes come with a choice of sides stated and a bagel. (All in the same section of the Benedict's). He said it comes with an English muffin but I'm not going to make a big deal out of a bagel and that he's never had anyone ask for the bagel. I don't respond because I know better and he agreed to give me the bagel. But I think to myself well I understand that a Benedict comes with an English muffin, I'm not stupid but the menu didn't state a bagel for a substitute. The girl ringing me out said oh the online menu? Well what this guy doesn't know is that I've worked in and managed places very similar to this and I know when a cashier is sympathizing with a customer. They obviously have had this complaint before also by the way he immediately got defensive. So I pay $75 AND tip (not to mention the $8.25 for a "large" side of fruit that was a mere pint) and we leave. As were walking out the door I hear ma'am, like I've forgotten a bag. Ha nope! It's the manager coming outside to argue some more. (My BF said after we left that when he came out the manager said I didn't want to argue with you inside....uhhh how about not at all) He tries to speak but I say to the BF let's go and he starts going on and on and I walk around the BF to walk away and the manager says "ridiculous" as he's wailing back in. Ummmm NNO!!! I turn around, open the door and say that was uncalled for and walked away. He comes out again and says next time you can get a bagel instead of the English muffin. Well Manager of the Year, there won't be a next time!! Ok so! So many things wrong with this!! First of all a manager following me outside to argue with a customer!!! Outside!! Over a bagel!!! You seriously have nothing better to do? I never had time to do that when I was a manager nor was it something I wished to do and seek out. He was so mad about giving me a bagel he steamed over it and still felt he hadn't said enough! Second, let me inform some of you who might not know...those bagels you pay $2.00 and then some only cost about $.25 to make. Hmmm customer comes to my store spends $75, makes a valid point about what your crappy online menu says, give $.25 bagel to make customer happy. Most restaurant managers know the common sense in that! I seriously couldn't say enough about this! Uncalled for. Unprofessional. A frequent customer is now a nonexistent. I'm not happy about refusing to have their pastries!! But not worth giving any more of my money to them!!I have been back several times before writing this review update just to make sure all the inconsistency that I have been experiencing is now the way of Bagel Cafe and not just an off day they were having. I'm prepared for the loyal fixtures to be upset, but if you really have been eating here since it opened then you know it's not the same. I first started eating here at Bagel Cafe (I was a teenager) after it opened. It was worth the long wait to get a table as the food was spot on excellent. Sure we all know the best breakfast in town is at the Omelet House on Charleston, but this place definitely came close behind at one point. In the last 6 months I have experienced meals here at Bagel Cafe that were just not worth the money or wait for what you got. They don't even use Boar's Head deli meats anymore! WTH?!?!?!? They use some brand I have never heard of. The taste and quality of the deli meat just isn't the same as it used to be. They claim the bagels are made fresh daily yet they are rock hard. I have never liked the bagels here, but if it's in your name.... live up to it!As you can tell from my previous review and pictures, I really used to like this place. Consistency is a major issue. The sandwiches used to be made with Boar's Head deli meat and was piled high between the bread of your choice and a real winner. Now you get some other brand of meat just bunched up in a ball between 2 dry pieces of bread. I can do that at home! Then there is breakfast. I usually order breakfast here. The last 3 times the coffee has tasted bitter and nasty. Getting a refill was a major chore as well. I noticed the servers didn't have name tags on my last visit or I would give a proper shout-out to the waitress who has messed up my order lately and has terrible customer service. I ordered "One Egg any style W/Bacon" priced at $8.95 and asked for eggs to be scrambled with shredded cheddar cheese on top. Such a simple breakfast right? Apparently not For Bagel Cafe. The breakfast also came with a bagel of my choice and breakfast potatoes. When my food arrived I noticed there was a slice of cheddar cheese on my eggs. UGH! If you don't have shredded cheese just let the customer know so they can maybe make another choice. I would have had the egg over medium or easy to dunk my bacon in if I had known. The "Asiago" bagel I had was so tough and hard!  I was with another yelper one of my last visits and showed him how I was able to bang the bagel on the table and it just broke in pieces.  The bacon was terrible. From the picture it looks heavenly, but let me tell you it was rock hard and seemed like it was honestly pulled from the fridge or something. When my meal arrived the bacon was missing, so I informed our waitress and she replies to me "oh did you want bacon?" to which I'm like HELL YES why would I have ordered a breakfast that comes with it if I didn't want it? She then brings me the cold/hard bacon and when the receipt comes she charged me $3.50 for a side of bacon. Seriously? It was supposed to come with the breakfast I ordered. She made me feel like I had done something wrong when she actually is a very lousy waitress. The potatoes I had were the only thing edible on the plate and even those aren't the same potatoes as they have had in the past. With this place not being consistent and having waitresses who can't do their job right, I'm going to  BabyStacks Cafe and Omelet House from now on for breakfast and will make the drive to Henderson to eat at Weiss.Great deli just off Summerlin freeway at Buffalo.  Been coming here for years and decided it's time to give them the props they deserve. I'd probably give this NY style deli 4.5 starts but since I can't they don't necessarily deserve a full 5 star rating.Let's go with the good then I'll drop my tiny bomb on the bad.  The food is high quality and always fresh.  They have amazing breakfast that nearly all come with a bagel and one of their amazing cream cheeses.  Love the scallion cream cheese.  Lunch is crazy good and HUGE!  They offer gigantic salads all with fresh produce, meats and cheeses.  The also offer great dinner specials.  Today we had a tuna melt that was made with great tasting tuna salad and fries.  We also had a cabbage roll that was served with a cup of soup and of course a bagel with cream cheese.  Loved it all!Parking isn't an issue as there is plenty of it.  The place is always packed but there is never a long wait so don't fret!  The biggest negative is the staff and their "I don't give a shit if you're the customer" mentality.  They kids act like their stuff doesn't stink (imo).  Anyway great food and will be back as I can get over the negative...We stopped in here the morning of the 2nd for breakfast and I ordered a café mocha and the pastrami omelet with provolone, and my Mr. ordered the two egg breakfast with bacon.  I was really jonesing for this breakfast because I'd never been to a place that will put pastrami (and some of the other deli meats) in an omelet.  It just sounded good, you know?  The omelet was great.  The pastrami was really tender and full of flavor.  My home fries were not warm and tasted like they had been sitting around for awhile.  Same goes for my husband's breakfast, which also had his eggs scrambled, not sunny side up.  He always orders sunny side up.  I didn't even notice because I was digging into my tasty pastrami.  He opted not to have it corrected and just helped me eat my omelet.  The mocha tasted like watery hot chocolate and was really disappointing at $4.50.  One of us ordered a chocolate chip bagel with regular cream cheese and the bagel was very nice and chewy.  Really enjoyed that even though there were no discernible chocolate chips in it.Other than the omelet and the bagel, there's really nothing that was good about our breakfast.  The atmosphere was very noisy.  On one side I had a loud talker blaring in my ear his expertise about car tires, and on the other we had a little poopster who had probably just learned to pull herself up and stand and look around.  She also enjoyed pulling on my husband's shirt and ear.  Not cute or cool.  I wish the people who shot out that kid were paying a little more attention to her.  I would go back again and try some of their other items.  Maybe it was just a bad day.  Our total after tax, before tip, was $31.08 and it was just not a good 30-dollar breakfast.  However, I trust my Yelp buddy, Loon E.'s opinion, so next time I'll have to try the whitefish salad.  Maybe that will elevate my next review.I cannot believe that I've never written a review for The Bagel Cafe.  I have dined here well over a dozen times since I moved to Vegas.  They offer the closest thing to New York bagels that I have found in LV.  Both their breakfast and lunch menus have so many delectable choices that remind me of the East Coast.  The line for a table is almost always long, but worth the wait. They also have limited counter seating.Recently,  I have enjoyed the Matzo Ball Soup, which is chock full of large pieces of carrot, celery, onion, and chicken in addition to a fluffy matzo ball.  A cure for what ails you (or just a tasty soup).  The chicken salad platter- a large scoop of chicken salad, two sides, pickle spears and veggies to make a sandwich with your bread or bagel choice.  The chicken salad is what I would call 'traditional style', no fruit, nuts, or other surprise items mixed with the chicken and celery.On recent breakfast trips, we've enjoyed the fantastic Potato Pancake with applesauce and sour cream.  Definitely a welcome reminder of Jewish delis back home.  A huge portion of biscuits and gravy with eggs and bacon and some of their omelets.  We always seem to walk out with a bag from their bakery case too. Not sure how this keeps happening. ;-)  We freeze most of the bagels and they taste just as good after we take them out.  The cheesecake, carrot cake, cookies, and all the other bakery items we've tried have all been well above par.Items Selected:CoffeeVanilla Crumb CakeBlackberry MuffinCinnamon RollBlack & White CookieButtermilk PancakesMalted Waffle with Strawberries and JamChallah French ToastCheese Blintzes with Sourcream and JamCorned Beef Hash with Overeasy Eggs and Everything BagelOnly visited once in the past, but a place to which several others have been referred when craving a good local deli, it was in reminiscing of Langer's a week prior that breakfast was enjoyed at The Bagel Cafe, certainly not the landmark sort of place found in Los Angeles but a very good meal at a fair price just the same.Laid out with a grab n' go area, bakery, and deli near the door as a spacious but tightly packed dining room fills the rear it was just after 8am on a Friday that our party of five entered and with family getting seated while I perused the pastry case it was mere moments before the menu was navigated; orders placed and rather weak coffee poured.Perhaps the youngest people in the place, my 60+ year old mother included, it was not long before pastry selections arrived tableside, the daily muffin and huge slice of crumb cake each buttery soft  while a warm cinnamon roll was unfortunately a bit overbaked, the black and white cookie fluffy and thick although frosting tasted a bit artificial.Moving onward to mains, the kitchen expediting orders at breakneck pace with  the dining room 2/3 full, it was with faux-Maple syrup cast aside in favor of the real stuff from home that French Toast, Pancakes and Waffles were gilded, the last a flavorless disaster when compared to the textbook alternatives; the the hash simply not my style and the blitzes failing to live up to the high standards set by Langer's and innumerable others.    Slipping a bit since my first visit, perhaps an effect of such a large crowd or perhaps a result of me overrating the place based on excellent ordering the first time around, The Bagel Cafe remains a competent spot for those craving Deli foods or what is still, in my view, the best bagel in Sin City.

Review Text :
I should have ran, (not walked), in the other direction when I saw the word "Bread". Chocolate chip cookies are a weakness of mine, and, oh - what's this? Pumpkin Chocolate Chip Bread? With butter? That is a recipe for self-destruction! Everything in moderation, right? Nope. It seems like the logic part of my brain shuts down whenever there are cookies around me. My only purpose at that point in time would be to consume every cookie in site! (My motto in life should be, "No cookie left behind".) The Monster Cookie, (with the M&M's), does it to me all the time. The sandwiches are excellent - especially the Spicy Turkey Pepperjack on five-grain bread, and the B-L-T-riffic. 2 more favorites - the Savannah Bar and the White Chocolate Blueberry Bread - soooo good! On the days that I want to over-indulge, Great Harvest Bread Company is my first and only stop!Every Christmas marks the time that I venture over to Great Harvest for gifts of baked goods.  I usually go to the location on Marks in Henderson because it's near my job, but this store is actually closer to where I live.  The best thing about Great Harvest?  The free slice of bread you can get when you step inside a store, with butter if you want it; of course I want the butter!  I love bread, but I can't come here as much as I'd like or I wouldn't fit through their door before too long.  I like their products as gifts because everyone I've ever gifted their goods to has loved them, as well.  The cinnamon crunch bread is one of my favorites, but I also love the pumpkin chocolate chip loaf.  The cookies that they sell are a nice, big size with the snickerdoodle ones a fave, too.  If you ever need a carb fix, stop here and get yours.

Restaurant name  Firehouse Subs

Review Text :
This was my first trip to a Firehouse Subs, and I liked what I discovered here.  I ordered a Medium Firehouse 'Hero" Sub sporting hot Virginia Ham, roast beef, turkey, Smoked Provolone, tomatoes, lettuce, White Onion, and oil & vinegar on a warm Wholewheat Roll, along with Miss Vickie's Sea Salt & Vinegar packaged Potato Chips.  The vegetables were all fresh, meats juicy from application of vinegar & oil, and cheese nicely melted over the meats.  Service was friendly.  And the atmosphere was nice and casual.  A Rat Pack fire crew wall painting was rather cool.  And, diners were seated at Dalmatian spotted wooden tables.  How fitting for a firehouse ambiance!  I expect to be back.Yet another good sandwich shop in town. They always give my grandson a fire hat. Only drawback is they serve Coke products. Sandwiches are good, recommend the hook & ladder or the corned beef. Comfortable seating and clean surroundings.

Review Text :
I rolled into Vegas late one night and arrived at the Renaissance Hotel.  My companion and I debated where we should eat and finally settled on Envy for two reasons:  it was There and it was Easy.  We weren't expecting much.  Wow...were we surprised!We were seated at a large booth surrounded by lusty red and brown tones.  A single red rose head beckoned from a square, glass vase.  Candles glittered and set a romantic tone.  Too bad I was there on business!We began the meal with a half bottle of an Estancia Meritage and split the Caesar salad.  We then went on to devour perfectly prepared filet mignons, truffled mac and cheese and port wine mushrooms.  It was sheer heaven!  The flavors were robust and delicious!  We also had several choices of how to have our meat prepared.  I chose to have mine charred on the outside, red on the inside.  My companion had her filet in a Bearnaise sauce.  Both were excellent.Then it was time for dessert.  Since we couldn't settle on just one, they made it easy for us with the Chef's trio.  We had miniature versions of the New York cheesecake with raspberry sauce, cappuccino mousse and a chocolate souffle cake.  We paired these with a chocolate port and an ice wine.  The restaurant was kind enough to also give us a complimentary glass of Sauternes.  They knew the way to our hearts! We left Envy feeling elated.  It was complete food euphoria!  When we came back a couple of weeks later, we immediately put in our reservation for the first night we were there.  Envy has become one of our "must dine" places in Vegas.Saving the best review for last and what a way to wrap up our Vegas adventure.We have been eating at a lot of high end steakhouses this year. I knew we wanted to go to a fancy place to celebrate my guy's birthday and since we were staying at The Renaissance and after reading the stellar reviews of this restaurant on Yelp, I knew this would be the restaurant for us. All of the room service at this hotel comes from this restaurant as well, so I had a feeling the meal would be good-I just had no idea as to how good.The menu is creative. Everything like most high end steak houses is a la carte. Kevin started with the roasted tomato soup with fried Jarlsberg(his favorite) cheese. It was light and tasty. I had the spinach salad with pancetta, fried goat cheese and a bacon balsamic reduction. Both of these were a fabulous start to our meal and what we both appreciated was the size of these were perfect. Not too big, not too small. Kev ordered the surf and turf (you get to choose which surf and turf) and he went with seared scallops and a petite fillet. I had the bone-in rib-eye steak and we opted for the lobster macaroni as our side (there were several we wanted but knew it would be too much food). Our waiter recommended the creamed corn, but we still went with the macaroni. Upon the arrival of our food, I was awe stricken at the presentation. Simple and elegant. My steak was perfectly charred on the outside and pink on the inside. Tender and flavorful, I closed my eyes and was taken back to a wonderful childhood memory of an old-time steakhouse in Phoenix called Durant's. I cannot remember the last time I had a steak this wonderful. Kev really loved his meal and said it was better than that of his last summer at Bradley Ogden and might even be better than Fleming's. The lobster macaroni was perfectly balanced in flavor with just enough lobster to cheese to pasta ratio. When I told our server how happy we were with the macaroni, he went to the kitchen and brought us out a small sample of the creamed corn. I hate to admit this, but dang, that was probably the most delicious sample of anything I have ever tasted. It was made with fresh roasted corn, bacon and a hint of cheese. To end our meal, our waiter brought Kevin a banana bread pudding (which was incredible) with caramel gelato and cashew brittle. He even had Happy Birthday written in caramel on the plate.Our server was fantastic. He treated us like royalty and even comped a second glass of wine and our dessert. After our disastrous meal at earlier in the week at Ruth Chris in Walnut Creek, I was overwhelmed with joy.Highly recommended. Take the time, take the taxi and make reservations on OpenTable.com and get to this fabulous restaurant!Did you say, a $75 gift certificate for $9?  5 types of mac & cheese? SOLD! Our reservation was for 9:30 pm and arrived on time to a near empty restaurant.  Once we walked into the lobby of the Renaissance my fiance (wow that's weird to say) says to me, "is this place open?"  I was nervous that we were the only ones there but there were a few other tables.  Phew!  I took the pleasure in purchasing via Restaurant.com a $75 gift certificate for $9. Ah, yeah...$9!!!  What a deal!  The catch was we had to spend $150 (includes alcohol!)  to have the GC apply.  No problem!  Food:*Surf & Turf - a GIANT 19 oz. bone in Rib Eye with scallops.  Very very tender & juicy rib eye cooked medium rare (woot woot!) served with three succulent scallops all cooked to perfection.  *Bourbon Creamed Corn.OMG.  Serious goodness here!  The best creamed corn I have ever tasted.  Ever!  (better than Lawry's....shhhh you didn't hear me say that!)*Bacon and Gruyere Mac & Cheese.One word....WOW!Drink:*Bottle of Red S. Australian wine.  Perfect.The only complaint we had was that we knew we would fill up fast.  We both slapped our tummies and psyched them into a few extra bites.  Food = great.  Decor = beautiful and comfortable Service =  unpretentiousTIPs:  1. If you cab it here, make sure to get his card so you can call him to pick you up.  There's not much activity here so set up your ride beforehand.  2. Check out Restaurant.com's site and sign up for their emails.  They had a sale over the weekend for 80% off so you can score a $75 GC for $6!  Who can say no to that?ENVY The Steakhouse has always been a restaurant we passed by, heard about, but never really thought about dining at.  Sure, we heard amazing things about this place, but it's another steakhouse in Vegas.  We finally took advantage of their restaurant.com coupon and had a cozy dinner for two.First up - I made reservations on OpenTable.com and requested we sit side by side.  Although I do note this in the reservation, it's rarely and sometimes noticed and acknowledged.  In this case, the booth had two settings specifically set up side by side.  Nice!After a slight delay, we got our beverages and menus.  It wasn't too hard to decide.  We barely made a dent in our warm bread and butter when our entrees arrived.* Bone-In Ribeye, 17 oz with Wild Mushroom Sauce ($45)* Bone-In Ribeye, 17 oz with Brandied-Pink  Peppercorn Sauce ($45)Both orders came with garlic mashed potatoes and roasted seasonal vegetables.  One thing I appreciated from our waiter (Joshua) was that he told us that we probably had enough food without ordering sides.  And this is usually the part where they push the sides on you, but not in this case.  And he was so right!  The 17 oz is a big piece of beef, and there's really not a whole lot of room left for much else.The steaks were perfectly cooked rare, and tender and tasty!  So tasty that we didn't even bother with our respective signature sauces that came with it.  Rather, we didn't even care for the sauces at all.  The meat was flavorful all on its own and that's what you call a good piece of beef!  Of course, half the fun is experimenting with their three salts and seeing which one goes best with your dish.The garlic mashed potatoes were also good, and the roasted seasonal vegetables also had a good mix of veggies which surprised us.  Different kinds of squash, beets, and mushrooms were part of it.Overall, we were pleasantly surprised with the quality of service and food.  Service was top notch and the food had us interested in the rests of their menu.  Of course, coupons definitely help in this department.4.5 stars.Went here for lunch today to meet a colleague.  I ordered the Burger with Cheddar Cheese & Jalapenos with a side of Fries.  The food came out fast and as ordered.The Burger was good....not great.  The Fries were outstanding.  The service was good and my meeting went well.Overall it was a good experience, but for $14 I've had better Burgers.Will I return?  I usually have business lunches here because of it's proximity to the Strip & Convention Center.....so I will probably return.  I wouldn't take the family here for dinner....just not good enough for the price in my opinion.Really? I had to make reservations for this place? Because on a Saturday night over Labor Day, this Envy The Steakhouse was completely dead. There was one other table in there. When we left, there were maybe 5. We had a restaurant.com coupon, so thank goodness we didn't pay full price for this place, because I would've rather taken my money to Fleming's.Our waiter was this super mellow guy, and was really nice. He did pay attention to details because he knew we didn't want ice in our water and made sure he didn't accidentally pour it in when it came to refills. It's the little things.Well, the big thing was the price. We ordered the 10 oz. filet mignon to share between us for $45 and paid a $5 split plate charge. $45?? Are you kidding me?? We started with the gnocchi which had wild mushrooms and parmesan fondue, which was pretty good. We also ordered the steamed broccolini. The steak was definitely not worth the money, because the outside was cooked to a slight crisp (not a problem for me because I like a bit of char), but the inside ranged from well-cooked on the sides, to cold red center, which is not good. A well-cooked filet, ordered medium rare, is a cool pink throughout. What I also didn't like was that they cut the steak in half for us and brought it out on two plates, just because we split it. Well, it probably didn't get to cook enough since you cut the sucker open, and it got colder by the time you brought it to the table. What was good was that your entree comes with a small crock of mashed potatoes and roasted season vegetables, which was yummy. That's a nice addition, considering most steak places just give you a steak, a la carte. They had forgotten the steamed broccolini and didn't bring it out until we asked for it. We had a wine from their seven for seven list, which was pretty good for $7. The ambience was very hotel/steakhouse-like. I still felt like I was in a hotel, and I thought the decor was trying a bit hard to be on a more upscale than what it really was. At least I didn't have to dress up to eat here. They didn't balk at my track suit jacket I had with me because I was too lazy to pack anything dressy for the trip. So glad we didn't pay full price for it. It was barely worth it even with the coupon. I do not have steak ENVY.I was first impressed with the birthday card the restaurant had the hostess give me when we came in. Our Open Table reservation mentioned our celebration, and they shined at making me feel special with that thoughtful gesture.Our waiter was very informed and enthusiastic about the wine selection. We shared a bottle of a special house wine that was very tasty and went well with our meal.My Love and I shared the spinach salad with goat cheese, pancetta, warm bacon-balsamic vinaigrette with bacon on top. It was really good, and a very interesting flavor. Our friends shared the Caesar salad with romaine leaves, white anchovy, and black pepper croutons, and both agreed it was the best Caesar salad they've ever had.The four of us did the best style of eating, what I call tag-team eating, where we order two different items and share, so we can try more dishes. Our party ordered two of each of the:-17 oz. Bone-In Rib Eye-Chilean Sea BassThe rib-eye was absolutely delicious. It wasn't just large. It was large, tender, well-seasoned, and well-grilled.The sea bass just melted like butter in your mouth. It was so good!The sides were good, too. The roasted seasonal vegetables were fresh and seasoned with rosemary. The garlic mashed potatoes were smooth and satisfying.My friends shared a dessert, the bittersweet chocolate lava cake with pistachio ice cream and mint sauce (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Fy4t2XHIRKwMk_ocCZze0Q?select=bzRDV05eD7MojFn3rnRsWQ). They loved it.Service was sporadic, but it seemed intended so that we could enjoy our experience, not just dine and dash.Overall, we had a great dinner experience, and I'd love to come back another time. The discounted GC from restaurant.com really helped with making this special meal more affordable, and because I love savings, I enjoyed this experience more because of it.TRUFFLE FRIES!!!Yes I have been on a binge for truffle fries, I blame the Four Seasons in Las Vegas for introducing me to them, now if I see them on a menu, I have to order them!The truffle fries here were GOOD! and worth the $9. Spice-Seared Ahi Tuna with the Sesame-Seaweed Salad, Pacific Rim Sauce - $16 - pricy for what you get but never the less tasty!I had the Warm Spinach salad with Goat Cheese Croquette, Pancetta, Warm Bacon-Balsamic Vinaigrette - 4.5 stars!Ambience is nice and service is pretty good too.Review for Spring Restaurant Week 2012 menu:I went to Envy tonight for the last night of Restaurant Week for this spring.  The choices were limited which is to be expected for a RW menu.  The bread basket was quite nice with slices of French bread, white chocolate walnut bread, and some breadsticks. Course 1:  I opted for the Butternut Squash Soup with brown sugar croutons.  This was excellent!  When I took some soup with a crouton, I had both a somewhat sweet taste mixed with the flavor of the squash.  Truly inspired thinking on the part of the chef to come up with this combination.Before Course 2, my server, Joshua, brought me a small triple dish that had sea salts from different parts of the world.  The white was from Australia, the black from Hawaii, and the pink was Murray River salt.  He urged me to try the salt but to use care because it can be overdone.  It was fun trying the different flavors with pieces of steak.  Australian was my favorite.Course 2:  Of course I chose the filet mignon.  Why get salmon at a steak house?  The steak was anchored on some very thin slices of sweet potato.  The steak was cooked correctly.  I ordered it black and blue and it almost was.  Done a bit more than I like because it wasn't blue enough.Course 3:  There was no choice here but who needed one?  RW dessert is triple chocolate lava cake.  It was outstanding.  The chocolate was rich.  It was also bittersweet chocolate which was a good choice to keep the overall sweetness in check.  There was a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top.  Great end to the meal.A couple of things prevent me from giving a higher rating.  I'm not sure if the bread was warmed in a microwave but it seemed that way.  When I decided to have a second slice of that wonderful white chocolate walnut, it had dried quickly and had a bit of a crust on it.  This doesn't happen with fresh bread unless it's microwaved for heating.  As mentioned before, the steak was a little too done for me.  Finally, as another reviewer noted, you have to take into account the beautiful surroundings, the good service, and the portion size vis à vis the price and Envy comes up a bit short.  I realize this is an RW menu, but when comparing it to other places I went during Restaurant Week, Envy couldn't compare with some of the others.The service was excellent.    Joshua, was very knowledgable and helpful.  Props to Chef Michael for stopping by the table to chat with me and ask for feedback about the meal.  This was a good experience, but I'm not sure if I'd return.  I checked the regular menu and I'm sure my wife would be happier where her choices were more numerous.This is my 100th review and I am glad I can use it for a place that deserves this recognition and honor. :-)I've eaten here twice by now and both times we used the $100 restaurant.com coupon. In fact, that's how we found the place. We wanted to find a new place and looked at restaurant.com for restaurants for our Vegas trip. This place had great reviews, so we picked it.Our experience was so wonderful the first time last year that we went back this year again.I just can't say enough good things about this restaurant. The decor, the lighting, in other words, your first impression is already up for a good start. Everything is beautiful, warm and subtle, including the menus. Their wine list is simply amazing! They have all varietals you'd like for every budget. Josh is very knowledgeable about wine and has great recommendations. He even let us taste a couple selections by the glass as we were hesitant what to get. He gets good reviews here and I can vouch for that. He's very professional, yet friendly and funny, amazingly helpful and simply charming. The first time, after we decided what we wanted to eat, I noticed that at the bottom of the menu they were offering a 3-course tasting menu for a discounted price and it had exactly what we wanted. I can't remember what exactly they were, but I know I had the sae bass and my roommate had the steak and everything was just wonderful.This time last month, we had the oven roasted, stuffed tomato. My roommate doesn't like tomatoes, but I ordered it for myself and we still shared it and he loved it. In fact, after dinner he said that the stuffed tomato was probably the best dish that night.Since I don't eat red meat, I ordered the sea bass again, but it never disappoints. It's always perfect, tenderly juicy yet flaky, just wonderful. The shiitake mushroom and asparagus garnish is also very flavorfully prepared. I had the New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc with my fish. My roommate had the 10 oz. Filet Mignon and he loved it. They 3 different salts they give you are all amazing. I just used it on my bread. But one of them (can't remember which) really goes well with the steak. He had a Syrah that he just loved.You would think that the portions are not that great, but with a 3-course meal, you really get stuffed.We ordered 2 desserts and they were also just mouthwateringly wonderful. I wish I could have ordered one of each of the desserts, but I couldn't have eaten them all,  but any desserts we had there was both time amazing.I can't remember the names of the two ladies who helped Josh out, but they were also delightful. As I said earlier, I can't praise this place enough. Both times, everything was top notch. The food, the wine, the service, everything.I can't understand why this place is not more crowded (we actually like this fact). :-)Anyway, do yourself a favor. When you're in Vegas, try Envy. You will not regret it.Haven't been back in over 5 years and the menu is pretty much the same.  The Travelzoo deal they currently offer (pay $80 for $149 worth of food/alcohol) made a revisit a total no brainer.  The restaurant's appearance even looks about the same.  There's lots of red décor and the bigger rooms were curtained off since there were less than 10 tables being used.  There's good value to be had at Envy.  Most appetizers were less than $15 and all the entrees include mashed potatoes and sautéed brussel sprouts with bacon.  But when armed with the deal I had, it was all about the $55 "Grand Seafood Plateau".  Lobster, prawns, oysters, mussels, clams, king crab legs....is it possible to get high off of seafood?  I think I did!  Everything was super fresh.  The prawns were enormous, lobster was tender, and I really liked the added garlic to the clams.  This would cost at least 30% more on the strip.  All the sides we had were excellent.  There was a plethora of lobster in their version of this mac and cheese staple.  This was a highlight of dinner and a ridiculous steal for only $7.  We also had the wild mushroom medley and grilled asparagus.  Our friendly server, Nicki, must have seen several takeout boxes in our future.  I was least impressed with the steak.  The 12oz bone in filet was 3 stars at best.  Even though $44 was a reasonable price for this type of cut, there are too many great steaks options in LV to say this was any more than passable.  I might not even order steak on my next visit.  The staff raved about the "Envy Signature Sea Bass" as many Yelpers have so I might give that a shot.  Their "Grilled Pesto Prawns" and "Vegetarian Oven Roasted Stuffed Tomato" also caught my eye.  Entrees like these would be totally ignored at any other steak restaurant, yet Envy might only really be a "steakhouse" in name.  The steaks only take up small bit of their menu while so much of it is non-beef.       They would be a clear nominee if there were ever a "Best of LV" category for "Steakhouse for people that don't like steak".  3.79394278797982938641112493 stars.  Round up!Menu:http://www.renaissancelasvegas.com/dining/envy-steakhouse.htmCelebrating Valentine's belatedly, my fella and I ended up at Envy Steakhouse. The restaurant was pretty empty when we arrived around 7pm on a Thursday evening. We ordered the tomahawk chop, lobster mac & cheese and the bourbon creamed corn. The steak was just ok, a little on the gristly side. My expectations were low, but I had hoped for a little more from the steak. The flavors were a little lacking for me and the steak had a glaze that I found unappealing. The sides were decent. My favorite was the creamed corn, which was sweet and creamy without being watery.Our server was so attentive and sweet, she really went above and beyond. She even made sure that they presented the entire tomahawk so I could get a picture before they took it back to slice it up for us. I don't see myself going back any time soon, but it is a decent location close to the convention center.

There was mold on my daughters pizza. I called and told them and there only response was to tell me to call back tomorrow because there was no manager on duty... I left my contact info and was never called.Sadly disappointing......1st time ordered delivery. Ordered sandwich off their online menu. Told they no longer make it. Ordered second sandwich off the same menu. Told they don't do that one anymore too. Ordered pizza which was excellent, but not what i wanted.2nd time we phone ordered pizza for pickup.Told 25 min wait. Wife went to pickup and took pizza to the car. Decided to take a quick look at it and discovered it was not the pizza she ordered. Went back in and was told that they had mixed up 2 orders and "Jay" had taken Jane's order. Asked to wait while the order was recooked. Sort of defeats the purpose of calling it in, if you have to sit there. They must have then hurried it because the pizza was undercooked and the cheese had slid off the pizza. One end had no cheese while the other end no crust......Well, mistakes can happen and we are normally forgiving, but absolutely no effort made by staff to try and make it right. No offer to deliver or take a few $$$ off or even a coupon for the next time. Feel 2 stars is generous under the circumstances....

My Son and I stopped by to watch Anthony M try to finish the 3 lb Burger challenge......the Burger was actually 5+ lbs total weight!  (see pics)We decided to order some food for ourselves as well.  I ordered the 1/2 lb Open Range Cheesburger ($11) w/Onion Rings ($2) & Loco Bueno Hot Wings ($10).  My Son ordered the 1 lb Big Daddy BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger ($16).  There were 11 people in our party, so I expected the service to be a little slow.Our food came out in a reasonable amount of time.....the Burger was OK, not great.  The Hot Wings tasted pretty good, but the sauce was not hot enough for me.  I asked for the hottest sauce they had and it was called the Texas Double Pepper.....it had a small kick to it, but it really didn't do much for me.  My Son enjoyed his Big Daddy BBQ Burger....it was huge at 1 lb, but it was nothing compared to the 3 lb Challenge!Anthony ordered his Burger at the same time we all ordered our food, but he didn't get his 3 lb Challenge Burger until we were all finished with our meals.  Keep that in mind if you want to do this challenge.....it will take 15-20 min longer for it to be ready vs other entrees.When they delivered the challenge Burger, they rang bells, whooped & hollered and made a big deal.  The staff announces it to the restaurant and they count down to start the 30 minute time limit.  Everyone in the restaurant watches as you try to eat this monster.  They advertise it as 3 lbs, which is within range for a normal person.....but it weighs it at over 5 lbs once you add it the 12 pieces of Bacon, Whole Onion, Whole Tomato, 6 slices of Cheese, Bun, and Lettuce!  Crazy!  I give Anthony props for giving it a shot.....he finished 1/2 of the Burger, which is respectful.  The manager told us 150 people have tried it, but only 5 have completed the challenge.  While we were dining there was another challenger at the bar.....we heard he only finished 1/2 the Burger too.  It's a $36 Burger in case you want to give it a try.....Overall, it was a pretty fun time hanging out with other Yelpers.  The food was just eh....OK.Return Factor - 30%

What a fabulous venue for yet another fabulous yelp event. From the valet to the restrooms. From the vast modern space to impressive and friendly service. And the food! Oy Ve (that's Japanese for yummy)...Ika FuraiAge Watari GaniAbura Bouzo No Tataki Shiro Asparagus ZoeButaniku To Hotate No GyozaYakitori-Negima YakiOK. Admit it. You know asparagus. But what about the rest? Well, you'll have to check out Roka Akor to find out. Cuz I'm not spilling it. My fave was the Abura Bouzo. Buttah! Like a big stick of buttah! I could have chowed down several more. And then several more. Light and airy with clean lines and muted tones, this is contemporary asian at its best. Origato. Dori Ori Gato Mr. Roboto.Moe saved the night!I had to try this place...after hearing amazing reviews...So after waiting 45 minutes for a table (even though I did make reservations for 8pm) we finally got our table.  (I know that a lot of you like the decor...I just wasn't feeling it...a little too basic for me)  After being seated..it took another 20 minutes to have the General Manager come over to ask us if we have been asked for drinks yet.  I replied that nobody has even greeted us yet.  He took our drink order (I got this Pomegrante and Sunflower Iced Tea...which was AMAZING...weird since I HATE flavored tea) and he even took time to explain the menu to us.  Since we still didn't have a server yet, the GM (now I know his name is Moe) took our orders and even offered suggestions. We ended up with (I wish I wrote down the actual names of the dishes) Shrimp Tempura (out of this world), Cucumber Roll with this amazing plum sauce, this tasty salmon roll with asparagus, beef skewers, and scallops that were AWESOME with this AWESOME mayonaise in the center.  Of course since their servings were extremely small and my friend Karla and I were sharing...I needed some dessert.  I got the Strawberry and Honey Chawan Mushi with Apple Pear, Passion Fruit, and Banana.  First of all, it looks like salsa, the way the fruit was chopped up.  Then I tasted it.  Ewwww....not good at all.  Moe felt bad, knowing that we had to clean our palattes...so gave us vanilla sorbet and green tea ice cream instead...on the house and even took off the other dessert.Moe Rules!I didn't find the place to be too pricey...I have been to worse.  I even played a game with my friend about guessing the price.  She guessed $78....and I said $ 57.63.  I didn't even add up anything in my head.  The bill came out and it was $ 57.85.  (My friend thought I had some amazing psychic powers...)Food 5 stars...well for dinner.  I won't even comment on the dessert, because I knew that I should have gotten the Flan....I should give it 2 stars for service...but like I said...their new General Manager Moe...saved the day.  He was awesome!  Moe rocks.This is most definetly the best restaurant in all of AZ!!!For one, they do not use any preservatives or hydrogenated oil. If you are someone that refuses to eat that garbage that is banned in multiple countries than you dont know how hard it is to find a place that wont use it in their food.Even Cheesecake factory uses it( I ban them now)The food is very crisp and clean, so clean you can taste many different flavors in their food.I usually give sushi places the spicy tuna test. You can tell a lot by a places tuna. Eat a piece w/o soy, if there is no fish flavor the fish is a higher cleaner quality.The spicy tuna there is ridiculous how good it is. I also really enjoy the Crispy Prawn roll. Usually not something I would pick but the person I was with did. Boy was that a good thing. It is very good. They have a dessert there with flowers and rasberry. I dont remember what its called but it is immaculate.Starters  butter-fish tataki and calamari Soo damn good. MOST PLACES LOOK LIKE REALLY NICE RESTAURANTS, LIKE  SAPPORO, BLUE WASABI, AND RA.... BUTT ALL THOSE RESTAURANTS FOOD TASTE LIKE CRAP!UNLESS YOU HAVE HAD SOME QUALITY SUSHI YOU PROBABLY WILL THINK THOSE PLACES ARE GOOD.TAKE THE TEST GO TO ROKA AND YOU WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO EAT THAT GARBAGE DISPOSAL FOOD AGAIN!!NOT TO MENTION THAT FOR ONCE YOU WONT HAVE THE SHITS!!ITS ON INDIAN BEND AND SCOTTSDALE P.S. THE DUCK IS OFF THE CHAIN!Ok, I went again last night and tried a few new things. I had the Tuna Tataki Starter it was really realy good. Tried the pork dumplings they were actually really gross I brought them backthen my usuals that I love.I havent been to Roka in a while so I decided to pop in and check it out. I wasnt starving so I just wanted a few things. I got an order of the calamari which is soo good there. I actually wont eat it anywhere else. It has thin sliced serrano peppers and lime juice. We were greeted after by William the manager I believe. I love that guy, he is soo good at his job. He is the english guy that will come around with the boy like smail asking how everything is. If it would be soo weird I would hug him when I see him. He is soo cute. Anyway he wanted us to try this new dish out which was a perfect gem of a starter.It had the most perfectly seasoned sweet and salty tuna tataki with chared tomatos and mushrooms and asparagas. Let me tell you, I hate mushrooms, even the name makes me sick. I havent eaten a mushroom in a yr at least, every once in a while Ill give it a shot then realize how much I hate them.Anyway I said what the hell and took a bite of one. WTF, this is the first mushroom I have ever liked, it was perfectly smoky and nutty, you know I watch food network all the time and I hear them say mushrooms have a nutty flavor. All I have ever tasted is dirt, but know I actually know what they mean. This new tuna starter will be on the menu after the 1st he told us, and he surprisingly comped us!!!!! We had already planned to try the happy hour menu since we hadnt been there since they made one. So when he took care of the bill I felt a little awekward going to the bar to get more stuff. I hope he didnt think we were trying to freeload, hahaha.  We paid over there anyway. I will for sure not wait soo long to go backoh and I had a non alcoholic  apple mojito, it was awesome and not overly sweet. My only complaint is that they dont have wrapped straws. Most people dont care, but I actually caught a staph infection on my face from a server who I guess was touching there staph wound and then stuck my straw in the drink with hands were my mouth goes. I will never ever leave home with out a sealed straw.After the disappointment of dining at Quiessence, I decided to try a sushi restaurant in the middle of the desert! Before you all shake your head and laugh, I had checked out their menu and figuring that they also have other branches around the world, they must be doing something right.The restaurant is located out on N Scottsdale Rd and has ample parking. The interior of the restaurant is big and airy, unlike its London counterpart, which has tables crammed up together. There is a bar area where they carve the big pieces of ice on which the fresh fish is served. The main restaurant area is dominated by the open plan robata grill. As I was dining on my own, I chose to sit at the grill to watch/chat to the friendly chefs and to make friends. There was a good buzz about the place.I got a shock though when I opened the menu. I had my heart set on having the tasting menu to sample more dishes but the tasting menu was for a minimum of 2 people. Being the USA where the customer is king (please note, all UK restaurant owners!), I decided to ask the server to find out from the kitchen whether I would be able to have the tasting menu on my own as I had come all the way from London. I was so pleased when the server returned with a positive answer.Well, the generosity of the restaurant knew no bounds. I am sure that they served me the equivalent amount of food for 2 people with double portions of everything. I was starting to panic as the never-ending sea of food kept flowing out of the kitchen - I hate to return uneaten food to the kitchen but there was no way I was going to be able to eat all of it. Fortunately, I made friends with the diners on either side of me and between us, we did manage to eat it all.Having had some misgivings about eating sushi in the middle of the desert, I found out from the chefs that all the food is specially flown in, mostly from abroad, so even the London branch would be getting its fish from Japan rather than Billingsgate.Once service started, dish after dish just flowed out of the kitchen, all beautifully presented.1. Butterfish tataki - lovely delicate fish which possibly needed an accent like ginger.2. Spinach salad with peanut dressing - refreshing.3. Rock shrimp tempura with chilli mayonnaise. Very light batter enclosing just cooked shrimp.4. Premium sushi including my favourite melt in your mouth toro. Mmmmmmm.5. Wagyu gunkan with caviar. My only disappointment of the menu. I think the flavour of the super expensive beef was wasted in this preparation. Was even hard to tell it was beef. I appreciate the expense but perhaps they could do a different preparation.6. Spicy tuna roll. Lovely.Then came the robata grilled dishes.7. Sweet potato. Was a bit sceptical that it would cook enough on the grill but it was lovely and crispy.8. Black cod. Which Japanese restaurant doesn't have a version of this dish popularised by Nobu? Still wonderful with large flakes of white fish accompanied by that lovely sweet sticky sauce.9. Lamb chops with Korean spices. Huge meaty chops but moist and tender.10. Rice pot offered with vegetables or king crab. Had to be the crab though I was ready to explode by this stage! This was something new that I have never seen before. Probably best described like Japanese risotto where the crab was mixed into creamy rice and a generous amount of tobiko added some pops. There was an incredible depth of flavour that I suspect comes from a proper stock.Last but not least and I'm afraid I may have actually laughed out loud when dessert arrived. It was the most fabulous looking and enormous dessert selection served on a block of ice. I can't actually remember what was on there - my stomach may have been telling my brain to abort at this stage! However, I had a taste of everything and like the rest of the meal, it was divine.So top marks to Roka Akor for flexibility and their generosity for feeding me and my 2 impromptu dining partners. I was happy to escape the fate of the exploding man in Monty Python's Meaning of Life sketch ('just a little wafer, monsieur') but it was the quality of the food, not its quantity which captured my stomach's praise.I was able to chat to the Scandinavian head chef later, who extracted a promise from me to go and try the London branch and let him have my honest opinion. Well, Scottsdale wins, guys! You have a more spacious restaurant, more friendly staff, amazing flexibility in customer service and more generosity with the dishes (London's 'premium' menu sushi selection only included salmon, tuna and yellowtail - no sign of any toro) And to achieve this in the middle of the desert!Took Mom and myself to have dinner here after work on Sunday (4/12).  Nice space.  We were given above-average service when we were seated at the robata counter.  (Actually, it's the level of service I expected given the atmosphere of the restaurant.  Anything less would have been suspect.)  When we had to move to the bar in order to take advantage of reverse happy hour, the service level dropped considerably- more on that later.Since we had arrived around 8:30p, we studied the menus to see what we could try off of the regular sushi options for dinner (the soft-shelled crab) and happily found out that Roka Akor recently started offering, "on a smaller scale," a few robata apps only to be served on Sundays.  I thought what a nice way to be introduced to the robata menu.  I asked the usual questions regarding allergy concerns and asked how certain items were prepared.  I even handed the bartender , Colin, a list of allergens to hand to the chefs.  (Evidently this list was only going to be looked at once, since many of our dishes had to be corrected after delivery.)Off of the robata apps menu, I ordered the shrimps ($5) for Mom and the zucchini ($1.50) and the black cod ($5) for us to share.  Off of the regular sushi menu, I ordered the soft-shelled crab roll ($9 for 5 pcs.) for Mom.  The timing of delivery of these items was haphazard.  It took at least 10 minutes before the plate containing two medium-sized shrimp to arrive.  To charge $6 for two grilled shrimp is just ridiculous!  It did smell wonderful and looked appetizing, but Mom wasn't wowed by them- certainly not at $3 per shrimp!  The soft-shelled crab arrived about 5 minutes after the shrimp did and looked great.  Mom found the rice good enough, but she still wasn't feeling any love.  The plate of zucchini arrived roughly about 5 minutes after the crab roll (that's 20 minutes after I ordered!) and held 5 pcs. of seasoned zucchini (salt, pepper, and soy) and a dollop of mustard sauce at one corner of the plate.  Mom liked the one piece she tried, but as much as I tried to get her to try the mustard, she didn't, so I can't report on that aspect.  So here we were, 5 minutes before happy hour was to commence, and all I had to nibble on were the zucchini pieces... Black cod was nowhere to be found.  Correction, Colin the bartender said he spied it at the robata counter, but did not make a move to retrieve it.  I asked Colin if I could give him my happy hour menu selections (all cost $5 each) so that he may have them ready for entry at 9p?  He took my order of Crispy squid and a salmon roll.  I also ordered two Roka Akor burgers, one without the housemade bun, and instead asked for an extra slice of heirloom tomato as a sub.  Would you believe that the crispy squid (again, only for Mom to enjoy bec. the batter contained *!) and the salmon roll (which arrived with **, which I wrote down on the list as two of my allergens- apparently the chefs did not remember, nor did Colin recall to alert the chefs) arrived before the black cod app?  Anyway, the salmon roll was left for my Mom to enjoy while the chef prepared another, allergen-free, for me.  Before I go on, let me say that Mom LOVED the calamari!!  This was the first dish that wowed her, and she exclaimed that this version of calamari is the best she's EVER tasted and even begged for me to forget about my allergy and try them- they were that good!  But I stood my ground.  I found the salmon to be very fresh-tasting and mild-flavored.  The pea-sized miso-mayo garnish that sat atop each piece was so mild, the roll could have been served without these embellishments and no one would know the difference.  I'd say that the black cod (3 pcs.) arrived at least 45 minutes since the time of order.  At least.  Aren't robata items, esp. seafood, supposed to be quick to cook?  I will say that the cod tasted superb, and I'd order them again.  Well, maybe.  $5 for three small pieces is too much, I think.Last, but not least, to arrive were the beef burgers, one-at-a-time.  Funny, the first burger, which arrived without avocado, but with a bun, so that was quickly returned.  My Mom's burger came, with everything on it, but she didnt' try hers until mine arrived- she was still working on the calamari and the salmon roll.  I liked the beef patty, cooked perfectly to medium rare, although I wished there was more flavor.  Mom's burger looked amazing.  Too bad the lighting at the bar was very minimal (one oil lamp for the both of us until Colin saw me taking photos and lit up another and placed it in front of me, but the fire died down soon after).I hope to return again to see if the service improves (better memory recall and timing of delivery).  I found the ambivalence showed by Colin of the (greater than 30%) tip I'd given him off-putting.  Factored in the price of the comped salmon roll, PLUS tipped based on the burgers original price of $4 each, too.  Hmm... maybe not too soon a return.There is Japanese cuisine in abundance here in Scottsdale, such as Sushi and Teppanyaki, but Roka sets itself apart with its Robatayaki Grill. All the fruits of the earth are prepared in view of the guests.   Steaks, fish, chicken - even the asparagus and stuffed mushrooms - are served charcoal grilled.The name Roka Akor derives from the Japanese words Ro and Ka.  Ro meaning gathering place for people to enjoy a good meal, sake, and company; Ka meaning heat and fire, creating energy.The restaurant has an unassuming feeling of luxury, combined with a more terrestrial flavor.   A distinctive character by virtue of the menu's quality ingredients, the clean lines and high ceilings of the dining and lounge area,  the earthy tones of its decor, and the geotic feel of the serving dishes and plates.From the drinks to the grill, I have been swept away time and time again.  For me, nothing has compared to the Sushi or the Shochu.  Because Roka is also a Shochu Lounge, it is of import to incorporate this into your experience.  Shochu is a distilled spirit which can be made with rice, potato, or barley, and which dates back 6 centuries.  It is similar to vodka, and its many varieties can be used as healing tonics, aphrodisiacs, or energy boosters.  The shochu is infused with herbs or fruits, and served with ice that never melts...H2O minus the oxygen which keeps this melange of pure bliss and succor chilled to the last drop, without melting and spoiling the taste.  On this visit, I enjoyed the Honey as well as the Pineapple.  Absolutely incredible!Spanish Mackerel Sashimi, Hamachi Belly, Buttery Salmon Sashimi, Char-grilled Asparagus with sweet soy and sesame, Zucchini with miso mustard, and cremini Mushrooms with butter and garlic , manila clams with red miso broth and cilantro, Butterfish Tataki wrapped around white aspargus and yuzu, and robata grilled teriyaki, it was culinary fireworks in my mouth.  Down to the details, from the wasabi root being ground at the table, to the artful preparation and presentation of the food, we were swept away.I will come here time and time again for the quality, the richness of the flavors, and the great atmosphere.  Culinary exloration and adventure await - and there is good reason for it being voted one of the top sushi locales in the nation, by Bon Appetit Magazine.Restaurant week will be the perfect opportunity to discover Roka when it offers a three course menu for $25 between July 20th and 28th.Happy Hour:Everyday - 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM and 9 PM to CloseBelow are selections from my favorite HH items:$3 White Miso Soup with Spring Onions$5 Crispy Fried Squid with Chili and Lime$6 ROKA AKOR Butterfish with White Asparagus and Yuzu$5 Fried Soft Shell Crab$7 Wagyu Gunkan with Wasabi Ponzu and Ginger$5 ROKA AKOR Hamachi Serrano Chili Roll$6  Shochu in honeycomb or pineapple$6 wines by the glass or 50% off bottles$3 beers$6 house sakeRoka Akor isn't my typical type place. I usually find that the food I love comes from places where they have put their heart and soul into the food and just ground it out. Sometimes these places look nice but often they're not too fancy and they rarely look anything like Roka Akor. Roka Akor is beautiful and huge. The decor is modern and tasteful. They have a great lounge, a huge featured sushi and robata bar and oodles and oodles of wood (which I dig).So often when you see these huge, gorgeous spaces obviously funded by a good deal of investor money, it's all business driven and the organization has lost some focus on the food.That's not the case with Roka Akor. I've been there the past 2 nights (and before) for their happy hour and had some stellar dishes.I'm a Japanese food freak so anything new & out of the ordinary piques my interest. I've been waiting forever to have a real izakaya or kaiseki place in Phoenix. Roka Akor is rolling out an izakaya concept in their lounge. For this first week, they are also doing a special where all food and beverages are $2 (through 11/25). It's absolutely crazy not to check this out.While I wouldn't say this an authentic izakaya, I'm a big fan of what they are doing. I tried most of the izakaya menu over the past two days and had some killer dishes.The tenkatsu fried pork belly is completely ridiculous. It is right up there with some of my favorite bites in recent memory. Then I also had their burger on a homemade sesame bun. Definitely order this medium rare. We had a couple ordered medium temp that came a bit overdone. The meat was tasty though and the thing that put it over the top was the awesome bun. Super flavorful - absolutely made the dish. They also use this bun on the cremini mushroom burger with wasabi aioli. Also very nice. Last night I also got to sample their Chinese style glazed pork ribs off the normal menu - amazing. I was already completely stuffed but it still made a huge impression.As far as other things on their izakaya menu, I'm a big fan of hamachi kama and enjoyed their version. Would have been killer with a bit of ponzu sauce. Robata grilled unagi was very nice and the fried soft shell crab with mixed salad greens was excellent. We also enjoyed the butterfish tataki with white asparagus and yuzu. The list is getting long but we really didn't run across any major misfires at all. Enjoyed the sweet corn tempura with sea salt, braised short ribs with daikon, agedashi tofu & hamachi serrano chili roll.For me the definite standout was the pork belly though. I kind of went through that list in order of preference. I enjoyed it all - actually a bit surprising.They also have a bunch of great drinks. Over the past 2 days, I had the shochu & tonic (barley shochu with spash of yuzu juice and tonic), tanuki peach (again - shochu & fresh peach puree) & sake-tini (lychee). All were great. The last several visits there we've also had excellent service. The staff has been super nice and super attentive. We even brought our young kids (5 & 2) after calling & making sure it was alright. While they are very well behaved, it is still nice to see them welcomed in.I expect that this happy hour will stay in the rotation. Great food, great drinks. Nice value.And I also have seen some wonderful looking sushi come out as well so we have to come back and go that route.While it doesn't look like the places that fall into the norm of what I typically like, I can't help but be a big fan.I was seriously disappointed in my dining experience at Roka. I went with a group of 18 and had arranged to have a fixed menu and reserved the back room. The food was as excellent as all of the other reviewers stated. We sampled several rolls, veggies, soup, sashimi, tempura ect.   The place itself big, with modern tasteful décor, and the tables were nicely spread out. They have a huge sushi and robata bar and a lounge to the side with all different seating arrangements. The back room we were placed in was big but intimate enough for our group. Our server was exceptional (his name was Casey) he was quick to offer suggestions and really knew the history of the drinks. If I had a restaurant I would steal him away and put him as head waiter!So why the 3 stars? Timing, or in this case lack of timing. We were seated and brought the first round of rolls before our drink orders had been placed.We actually received 4 orders of rolls before we received our drinks. We were served drinks without sake cups, soups without spoons, rolls without soy or wasabi... It was a complete mess. I am sad to say the lack of timing really disappointed us, I would return because the food and service were excellent, but I would not recommend it for big groups.One more thing - They offered to call us a car service to take us to downtown Scottsdale, telling us the fist 10 miles were free. Once we got in the driver told us it was a minimum charge of $25. They really need more organization.I hate to admit it, but it had been a long while since my last visit to Roka Akor. I deserve a hand slap. But last week, I had the perfect excuse to pay a long overdue visit during Yelp Eats Week! We went on Friday night and to make a long story short, this is the perfect date spot and the perfect restaurant for delectable dining. But let me dive into details a bit more. First of all, the atmosphere here is vibrant and alive, but it lacks the "so Scottsdale" vibe that some similar spots may have. For this reason alone, I will become a regular at Roka Akor. There's plenty of seating inside, including seats at the bar, romantic couch seating in the lounge, front row sushi seating at the sushi bar and then plenty of normal dining all around. We sat at a normal dinner table and took in the fun environment surrounding us. The staff here is incredibly friendly and attentive. We arrived on time for our 8:30 dinner reservation and were seated promptly upon arrival. The server welcomed us immediately and gave a descriptive overview of the food and serving style they suggest for the restaurant. Since we were there for Yelp Eats, I definitely wanted to take advantage of some of the Yelp Eats musts, so we ordered the Grilled Sweet Corn (Roka Akor signature dish), the Skirt Steak and the Warm Toffee Cake for dessert. But, that just didn't seem like enough, so added on the rock shrimp tempura and Kobe beef and Kimchi Dumplings -- two more Roka Akor signature dishes. Since there is so much delicacy to discuss, I'll break it down by dish. Grilled Sweet Corn -- as sweet as it sounds. I felt like I was in a scene out of the movie Big because the corn is petite and cut into halves, so I found myself nipping away on each tiny ear. The corn was grilled perfectly and had just the right amount of zing. *** PS -- probably not the food choice for a first or second date.Rock Shrimp Tempura -- by far my favorite dish of all and the top anywhere in the Valley. It's fried, it's tangy, it's spicy, it's crunchy, it's just delicious. I could eat an entire bowl (or two) just by myself. Kobe Beef Dumplings -- they were tasty and the perfect compliment to the meal. They were filling but not overly filling and with five to a plate, it's just the right amount for two. Skirt Steak -- I don't even know where to start. They give you a good amount of steak and it's perfectly tender, moist and delicious. We let them pick how it "should" be prepared and that's the right move. It was medium well and the perfect amount of rare and well done at once. The marination on it provided the perfect sweetness and it was just the right amount of steak. It's a great dish to share as well. Finally, the Toffee Cake -- this is a great way to end the meal with a sweet touch. Delicate and delightful. I almost forget about the sake. The sake here is top notch and perfect for sipping. Accompany it with a Japanese beer to sip on as well and you're in for a great evening! Thanks for a wonderful Friday night Roka Akor. I can't wait to visit again!I am a little disappointed in myself for not remembering our bartender's name! He has been at Roka since the beginning and helped the place get up and rolling. He knew every detail of the menu and recommended some great food to try. Even though the bar was extremely busy, he still managed to be very attentive and not seem flustered! Also one of the cocktail waitresses was extraordinarily nice as she picked up our slew of appetizer plates. The service here is seriously top notch! The crowd was also fun! I was there for a Yelp event this last time though so I am probably being biased...but I have been here before and there always seems to be a good vibe. Last and probably most importantly the FOOD: the BUTTERFISH TATAKI with white asparagus is unique and AMAZING! The Kobe beef dumplings I could eat all week for every meal and probably not get tired of them. I have never sat at the sushi bar, but it is definitely on my 'To-Do' list because not only does the food taste great here, but the presentation is quite impressive. I would love to see Roka Akor's chefs in action!Roka Akor is the best Happy Hour place I visited while staying in the Phoenix area. We took a trip to Scottsdale and on the recommendation from fellow yelper Jared R, we gave it a shot. We arrived on a Sunday for Happy Hour and found a quiet little corner couch to lounge in. Everything we ordered was on the Happy Hour Menu and fantastic. There was not one thing that we did not like. To start, I ordered the house sake: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DymZ5vpm7vkSsR__-4sflw?select=9nbjFTP4j7xvm0M3NMN4BA#Z4l2nQd3AN32UmwWoftl4Q and my man ordered the Blood Orange Margarita http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DymZ5vpm7vkSsR__-4sflw?select=9nbjFTP4j7xvm0M3NMN4BA#p2vq7FipyZO-Hn26b_b5dg And although mine was great, he scored the best first drink award.Anything spicy always catches my eye, so we ordered the Hamachi Serrano Chile Roll and it was so good. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DymZ5vpm7vkSsR__-4sflw?select=9nbjFTP4j7xvm0M3NMN4BA#OkLM7fkyeEFa0WbAVwy34Q Second up was the beef teriyaki. Then we ordered two house infused glasses sochu, one cucumber melon and the other a spicy mango. Both fantastic light sippers! This isn't really alcohol is it?! To go with that, we ordered the Butterfish. I am a sucker for Butter fish and it was beyond amazing. Slices of creamy butter fish wrapped around white asparagus! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DymZ5vpm7vkSsR__-4sflw?select=9nbjFTP4j7xvm0M3NMN4BA#2nPo-UaB6chwwASuWjJ3EQThe food was so great, yet I was too full to try anything else. Which is okay, because our fabulous waitress Lisa told us that they are planning on opening a Roka Akor in San Francisco soon! Look out kids, you are gonna LOVE this.I finally sat at to the sushi bar!  I now know I never want a job cracking open oysters; that guy should get a bonus!  Also, Roka Akor knows how to make some beautiful dishes!   I should start off by saying Roka Akor has great food, BUT I am starting to come to the conclusion that I just need to come to Roka Akor for happy hour or the dinner entrees, not the sushi.  Their rolls (we had the Serrano Chili and Spicy Tuna) were honestly not that exciting and on the small side, but they tasted good and were solidly made.  I wish I had gone with my instincts and tried the Dynamite Scallop Roll, because we saw one being made later at the bar and it looked yummy.  The warm Wagyu roll sounded interesting to try next time too.  I ALWAYS get the BUTTERFISH TATAKI; it is seriously amazing.  But, I should also say you get 5 small pieces of fish for $11, and it would never fill you up.  The octopus salad was delicious but came on a plate the size of a tea saucer with more greens than octopus (maybe 5 pieces of octopus); most octopus salad I have had, the majority of it is octopus.  As Jared R. said the Waygu Kimchi dumplings were not as exciting as all the other things we ate.  I think you just come to expect that WOW factor at Roka Akor and they don't deliver that.  I checked in on Yelp and they offered the Yuzu Mousse dessert with a beverage purchase, which was a pleasant surprise!  The mousse was light and fluffy with the perfect amount of lemon; definitely not rich and over-baring.  It came with a raspberry drizzle that complemented it beautifully.  Not to be cliche, but one thing that was kind of noticeable to my date and I, was out of the 8 people in the open kitchen, one was Japanese.  As for our service this time it was okay.  The guy I went with had never been to Roka Akor and had quite a few questions because they have a unique menu that lacks descriptions, which is fine when you have a knowledgeable waiter- but we didn't. I almost wonder if our waiter was relatively new, because he did not describe things very well and most things were described with adjectives like 'good' or 'great' and he basically just said 'I think I would go with that.'  It really didn't give you much to go on, especially since the menu does not have descriptions.  But, he got the job done and he was fast and pleasant, so I am not really complaining.  What to take home with you: Roka Akor has beautiful, yummy food.  The prices are high and I think you can get just as good, if not better, sushi other places. ORDER THE BUTTERFISH TATAKI. They also have one of the greatest happy hours in town, with outstanding, reasonable food options!7/27/11Took Mom for our first lunch here, and she LOVED it!  I really should take her back for lunch again (she won't let me treat her to dinner here, as the ticket could get pricey very fast!).  From our starters of miso soup http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/roka-akor-scottsdale-4?select=QBQnXq0OfJRfDbim4bq8Nw#QBQnXq0OfJRfDbim4bq8Nw and salad http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/roka-akor-scottsdale-4?select=vs7J2Sxqm5CKQD4t737K0w#vs7J2Sxqm5CKQD4t737K0w, to our main courses of sashimi http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/roka-akor-scottsdale-4?select=crw2LPM69lGjbf2aR6nfoQ#crw2LPM69lGjbf2aR6nfoQ and robata pork http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/roka-akor-scottsdale-4?select=oqQ7SHbOv8iTzf3rnS6XYg#oqQ7SHbOv8iTzf3rnS6XYg, she was in heaven!  Everything was perfect-- from the dressing of the salad, to the meat temperature of the pork (fully cooked, no redness anywhere, yet still tender and very juicy).  I'd say the only thing that didn't impress her was the miso.  I thought it was OK, although not enough soy cubes, but I wasn't too worried about it, since I was looking forward to our entrees.So glad I spotted the photos in my iPhoto folders... Now I know where to take Mom for our next lunch date!  :)p.s.  Here's another shot of the robata pork tenderloin-- just look at that gorgeous caramelization!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/roka-akor-scottsdale-4?select=HrhOl_vuURZc31AE4wdbcA#HrhOl_vuURZc31AE4wdbcA$170 dinner for two, before tip. Happy hour is only in the lounge.  Make reservations for the dining room.  We sat in the patio.  There is nothing to enjoy about the patio other than the weather.  Kumomoto oysters - A+! beautifully plated over ice with decorative seashells.  Flavored with a lovely fresh citrusy sauce. Butterfish sashimi - Very good. Not as amazing as everyone makes this out to be.  The fish has a good firmness. Yellowtail sashimi - thick sliced and very firmSalmon sashimi - very niceSashimi is served with Fresh wasabi!!! It's the best, the quick heat disappears after you've swallowed it.  No horseradish here. Petit filet - sliced small and cooked perfectly. I didn't bother with the sauce on the side. Bone marrow - HUGE!  very yummy.  Could be overwhelming for some people and would be better shared with a group.   Tasted great when topped on the steak.  White chocolate brownie - yelp coupon. Topped with ice cream.  I wouldn't order this if it didn't come free.   Not bad but I'm sure there's a better dessert. Our butterfish never came.  So before ordering dessert I finally reminded our server.  They brought it out with an excuse that the ticket was lost. We were charged for it. The food is great!  I would have liked to check out the happy hour.

Review Text :
4 of us went to Arooji's in The Promenade on Friday night.  We've been here 4 times since they opened and had only 1 good experience, which was the previous time we went.  I doubt we will go again.  Though I have heard that their South Park location is better.  Most of their food is good.  We ordered the crab dip which my husband thought tasted fishy.  I thought it was good but a little too thick and creamy.  A lighter crab dip would be better, where you could tast the crab more than what it was mixed with.  I ordered the lobster ravioli, which I thought was very good and had a nice size portion.  More ravioli than I have gotten elsewhere.  My huband ordered the veal saltimboca.  When he asked for pasta instead of the mashed potatoes, the waiter told him it's a $4 substitution charge.  ($4! Is the pasta made of gold?)  We also found out that the SouthPark location doesn't charge for the substitution. My husband wasn't impressed with the dish.  Too much cheese. Our friend ordered a chicken dish which was very good.  So, you want to know why I gave it a two...they had their special select wine list in which we ordered a Malbec .  After we were half way through the wine and not impressed with it..we realized that the year was not the same as on the list.  It was 2 years younger.  We ordered another bottle of wine from the list and that too was not the same year as listed on their list.  This just screams to me that they really don't care about the quality of their service or how they present themselves to the diner. We've had a problem with this before.  Unfortunately, it's not just good food that keeps people coming back..it's great and courteous service.  I really feel that the arrogance comes from the upper management and not the servers because they have always been very good.  If I am going to spend my hard earned income than I want to go to a place that I feel appreciated and at this location I don't.  So, get a new attitiude Arooji's (and it better not be fake)!  I really am surprised this location has lasted so long.After I posted this, someone asked me why did I go after the 2 bad times..this does need some explaining.  After the first bad experince, I wrote to the management and they sent me a gift card, that led me to go there the second time.  Then a friend gave me a gift card which led me there for the 3rd time.  Remember I like the food just not the attitiude. So, this 4th time was the Illios Noches was too crowded to wait.. and it was close.

I probably drove by this place a thousand times, and didn't give it a second thought. Housed in a muddy yellow, squat brick building, with a dingy awning, I didn't have much hope for Ollie's. But Sunday morning, the pantry was empty, we were out of coffee (NOOOOOOO!!!), and needed to calorie-load for a busy day of home improvement. The area IHOPs and Waffle Houses, are always just  meh at best. The dining experiences there usually involve lots of crying babies, spotty service, and sticky tables. Black Bear Diner just had a ridiculous number of cars in the parking lot, and we were not up for a long wait. Plus their biscuits are dry and crumbly.That's when Ollie's popped into our minds. When we arrived, there was a decent number or cars in the parking lot, but not too many. The interior betrays the dull exterior. It is bright, and minimally decorated with cutesy country accents, and a couple of portable AC units. We were seated within a minute by a friendly hostess.Our server, a no-nonsense kind of lady, with probably many years of front of the house experience, came by shortly thereafter. She offered a  a quick "good morning," and came back in a hurry with a carafe of surprisingly good coffee. As she went around the room, doting on the regulars, we looked over the menu.No surprises there. The first 80-something selections are omelets. I'm sorry to say, I'm not a big fan of omelets. So I chose the egg and cheese breakfast burritos and some home fries. My dining companion chose the steak and eggs with hash browns.Our order was to our table in record time. The server left before we could ask for any condiments, but like a true veteran, she was back in a few seconds, laden with everything we could possibly need.First impressions -- presentation was minimal. After all, it is just breakfast, so I don't really care about all that anyway. The burrito was piping hot, so I snacked on the home fries for a while. Whoa! They were good! Crispy and seasoned on the outside, fluffy on the inside -- like curly fries, but in dice form.When I could finally pick up the burrito, I found it stuffed with light, fluffy eggs and cheddar cheese. The cheese was kind of cheapie and took a while to melt, but tasted OK. The salsa served with it was not bad.My companion's verdict on the steak and eggs was that it was good, but not worth $8.99. I believe our total bill was about $21.All in all, this may be our new "go-to" restaurant for breakfast, when we wake up unprepared and starving.

Sumo Sushi 2!!!!!!!!! O-M-G!!!!! FRIGGIN ORGASM!!! 69!!!! YUMMY!!!!!What happened here? My mouth and body were just trippen!I've had some good sushi in my lifetime but boy oh boy was this place AWESOME! It always helps to know someone to who works whereever you go. It also helps to tell them what you like and let them make special things for you that are on and off the menu. MmmMMMM! I'm SOOOOO going back soon!The first thing I had was the ORGASM. It was tuna sashimi with other things and topped with some special sauce. Whatever it was, it did give me my first orgasm and set my body up for the next orgasms as well!!!My FAVE rolls were the 69 roll (yes 69 roll is the name) and the Tuna Naruto roll (I think that was the name). The 69 roll was SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOo good!!!!!!!!! It had this special garlic sauce that was just amazing on the roll. WOW. SO friggin good.Of course we had sake bombs which was complementary to the rolls, sashimi, and special stuff we had. MmmMMM! You MUST go to Sumo Sushi 2. Tell them what you like and let them make you some stuff.Be nice and hook up my buddies with some beer and sake bombs!Have a great time and get ready for a MOUTH-GASM!!!!!!!!!The staff at Sumo Sushi 2 are indeed pretty awesome.  They are friendly, attentive, and efficient.I read some Yelp reviews earlier in the day, and decided I was feeling in the mood for sushi and trying a new place, so when my GPS listed Sumo Sushi as one of the nearby sushi restaurant I knew right away that that was where I was going to go for dinner.The ambiance was great. Right when you walk in, you can see large aquariums (salt water) with colorful fish swimming about.  The lighting is on the dimmer side, which sets a good atmosphere for those on a romantic dinner.I tried their AYCE menu (~$26 +tax).  And overall I thought the fish served were fresh, including their special sashimi (3 options available on the AYCE menu).Special Sashimi:Tuna Karai - basically cubes of tuna with a blend of spicy seasoning.  They can make this really spicy if you request it, but it was pretty spicy without any special request.  So unless you can handle the heat, don't try to impress anyone asking for 9/10, then not being able to finish it :p  It was good, if you like tuna.Cocaine - this one was good too, slightly different flavors, but not all that different.Screaming Orgasm - slices of fish dressed in their "Orgasm" sauce.  Not bad.I mostly had their nigiri and some items from the appetizer section.  The nigiri were good, except they didn't have uni when I went, so that was rather disappointing.  Of the items on the appetizer section, my favorite is the Kurobuta Sausage, which was basically 1 pork sausage sliced up and served with ketchup. In hindsight, I should have ordered like 2 or 3 of these (since I don't think it is on the menu at other AYCE sushi restaurants).Of the rolls, I was only able to ordered two:Tuna Naruto - refreshing roll of various fish (salmon, tuna, krab) wrapped in cucumber.  (No rice).  The chef who prepared it has good knife skill, so it turned out looking as tasty as it was beautiful.  Something Wrong #69 - not a bad roll, but drenched in way too much spicy garlic ponzu sauce or was it regular soy sauce (?), because it was so salty that I drank 2 cups of hot tea trying to finish it all.After that I was done. Too much rice + hot tea = bloated stomach.Service: 4.5/5Ambiance: 4.5/5Food: 3.5/5Price: 4/5 reasonable for AYCE.Location: Off the Durango exit on 215, so great for locals, but not for out of town visitors.4/5 in my book.  And just FYI, the sushi has Korean influence in terms of the way they flavor their special sauces, rolls and such.I first heard about this spot from a buddy who said that Jjanga honed his skills here before breaking into his own restaurant. So, I was intrigued how similar the food was going to be. After eating here, I would say that even though I think Jjanga has the edge, this is a splendid sushi restaurant!This place is located on the deep southwest side of town. I was surprised by how far, but I guess it's good that they are located near a lot of suburbs. I also noticed on a sign outside that they were under new management, so some of the food might have changed since Jjanga had worked there.After walking in, I noticed everything was dark, but in a cool, modern way. The sushi bar is huge, and can hold a lot of people. One thing that kinda weirded me out is that it seems like the chefs are hovering above you as you eat due to the highness of the sushi bar center.I ordered a lot of items, and while I thought they were pretty good, nothing was bad. The fish quality they were using was very good. I really didn't like the rice too much, it was a little too sour for my taste.As far as apps go, the chicken katsu, octopus skewer, fresh oysters, and I thought the fried calamari were really good. I didn't care for the pork belly, ribeye steak, and grilled octopus. And I thought the udon was ok.This is definitely a solid place, I would put it in the same league as a Sushi Mon. I would definitely recommend this spot to those living in the southwest who don't want to drive all the way down to Spring Mountain for some good sushi. This place is also a lot better than the original restaurant in Green valley. A quality place all around.Well we went to three other restaurants before we happened upon this little sushi gem.There was no wait and we got seated immediately. Praise the lord because we were starved!I loved their seating! Every table was in its own little private cubby it felt very warm and welcoming. The appetizers were very yummy!We had:Oysters 5/5Spicy Garlic Edamame 3/5Coconut Shrimp 4/5Creamy Shrimp 4/5They had two appetizers I really wanted to try but my tummy was too full! So if you go and try the Whose your Daddy? Or the Ex-Wife let me know what they are?!We only had a few rolls, but the ones we did try were delicious!Dragon RollSea King RollBad Boy RollAnd another roll that I'm ashamed to say I can't remember the name off which is a shame because it was my favorite roll!Of course we ended our under the sea adventure with Mochi!The service was good but it did take a long time for the actual rolls to come out with it being dead I thought that was kind of strange but it could've just been an off night. Can't wait to come back!

We had gone to Payson for the day and as we were getting ready to leave Payson we decided to look in the Entertainment Book to find a restaurant coupon to use when we got back into the valley.We all agreed Thai sounded good and when we checked the trusty Yelp Mobile app and found Palee's had 4.5 stars on 14 reviews we decided it was a GO.I'll be adding Palee's to my list of Phoenix area Thai restaurants, right at the top with Thai Lahna.  We had four different items and a couple of them were the best I've had outside of the bay area.We started with chicken satay which was tender and very flavorful.  Next we shared massamun curry and pad thai.  Since my youngest daughter was with us we ordered the spice mild.  They did bring out an assortment of hot things on the side so that I could punch mine up if I wanted to, which I did.The pad thai was really good.  Not too sweet, not too fishy...just right.  The massamun curry was also very good.  The next time I am getting my own entree and ordering it hot.  We also had pot stickers which were good, not the best but good. I like a thinner skin but they had a nice flavor.The service was very good as well. We arrived about 6:15 on a Saturday night. We were the only patrons except for a few take-out orders.  By the time we left there were about 20 others in the restaurant.Everything tasted fresh and authentic.  We pretty much agreed that until another Thai place knocks them out, Palee's Crown was going to be our Thai spot.

If you're looking for the most comfortable and welcoming cafe/coffee shop in the world, please look no further!  There are so many great things going on here!  First off the environment is just so warm and inviting.  From what I hear the weekends are pretty hectic, but the weekday was nice and calm for a nice work day and meeting for me!  You really can't get any friendlier than the owner of this place either.  I could have BSed with him the whole time if I didn't have work to do!  Plus, you can really tell he cares about his business and how he wants to present it...I love that!  I even chatted with some other costumers, it was just that kind of friendly environment! I also love that I can grab a delicious, all vegetarian I might add, meal.  But don't worry, it's not shipped in, it's cooked fresh.  I enjoyed the broccoli and white bean soup and a mushroom, red pepper and cheese panini.  Both were delicious.  I loved how the soup had large pieces of fresh broccoli and it wasn't bean overkill either.  The mushroom panini came on rye bread, which I usually don't like, but for some reason this magical rye bread did the trick on all the other amazing flavors from the veggies.  I didn't think of meat for a second!  I'm definitely going to make this a spot to hit up when I want to grab a bite and work...and maybe chat up some strangers!

Stumbled on this place entirely by accident, and it was a good time! Tasty burger and fries (had to try the Zack's Special) for cheap. My husband had the fried chicken, which he wasn't terribly impressed with- but I guess that's what you should expect ordering chicken from a burger joint. I wouldn't say this is the best burger in Charlotte (I'll save that distinction for the Penguin), but it's still pretty darned good- and the place has a cool classic dive feel to it.Definitely worth a visit if you're in the neighborhood. I'd happily go again!Taking into consideration that I am actually one of the twelve people left that are from Charlotte and I still live here, I am officially ashamed that I never tried Zack's before yesterday... The Zack's special was stupendous, guys... I ordered mine without mayo because that's how I get down, but there was still a great amount of toppings mixed all in with the two beef patties and cheese: tomatoes, pickles, onion, lettuce and secret sauce (which tastes quite a bit like thousand island dressing, so I think the secret is out)... I was really glad there wasn't any extra sauce because that sucker was already falling apart toward the end... In a good way, though... The bun was nice and toasty and wasn't bland, but didn't work too hard to prove itself by overpowering the other flavors...The onion rings were pretty good... I'd liken them to Mr. K's down the block... Not too thick, not too thin... Decent batter, but not the cajun kind that comes on most onion straws... A basic, but tasty fried coating... I even took this to go because I was heading home and everything traveled quite well... The food must have been practically on fire when they brought it out because it was still nice and hot by the time I arrived and got settled to eat... I didn't even have to do a quick microwave refresh!  I'm kind of afraid to take the boyfriend here... I doubt he'll want to go anywhere else for a while... But I just have to be the one to introduce this to someone new and I think he's the only one left that hasn't tried it...There's nothing flashy, trendy, or even remarkable about Zack's. They don't throw any fancy slogans out or use some sort of dated jargon to describe their outfit. It's just burgers, fries, rings, shakes, and the best crushed ice in all of the Earth's history. The Zack's Special -- Double cheeseburger, lettuce, tomato, mayo, pickles, mustard, easy like a Sunday morning bun. It's like the king of all lunchroom burgers. Nothing that's going to blow you away, but familiar like an old friend. Just right. Fries are nothing to shake a stick at. Onion rings, however? Sheer greatness. Also, for the price of $10 for two, you can't really be upset. I'm glad that Zack's is around and has been doing the same thing for so long. Don't change a thing, fellas.

I want to be the mayor of my own little electric wonderland! As mayor I promise to offer a fully stocked bar of spirits and fountains of cold beer to allow my constituency to quench their thirst while drunkenly lobbing skee balls down the lanes, spilling beers on the air hockey table, and riding bitch on virtual motorcycles. To remind them of their stay in my land of delight, I'll let them redeem tickets for cheap-o trinkets with the name of my wonderland plastered all over 'em. I'd be the kind of mayor that brings back the nip of scotch with my loyal sycophants on a lazy afternoon and I'd give teenage hooligans the boot, telling them to go frolick in Tilly's or Charlotte Russe because my electric wonderland is a den of iniquity and requires a chaperone over 25 for anyone under the age of 18. Too keep the masses happy I'd offer a massive feast at reasonable prices, with appetizers, soups, salads, sandwiches, burgers, ribs, seafood, pasta, chicken, steaks and sweet, sweet desserts. And to make them feel like they're getting their money's worth, maybe I'll create little indulgences like happy hours and meal deals. Between 4:30 and 7:00 Monday through Friday I'll let my lovely little bunnies indulge in cheap drinks and offer a Power Hour game card for ten bucks that allows all the game play their little hearts desire for a whole hour! And maybe I'll even offer a reverse happy hour from 10:00 to close Sunday through Thursday... Yeah, that's a great idea, and I'll make my closing hours midnight Sunday through Thursday and one in the morning on Friday and Saturday! Now, meal deals, meal deals, how about an Eat and Play combo? It would consist of 25 meals and a ten dollar game card for $15.99, and I'd give them the option of adding an extra ten bucks to their game card for an even 25 bucks. Now I'd be a generous mayor, but I still have to pay for the infrastructure somehow, so I'd have to put a time limit on this awesome deal. Let's say Sunday through Thursday from open to close and until 5 in the evening on Friday and Saturday.And I'll sneak in a $2.00 activation fee for all new cards (except those with my mega meal deal), but to sweeten the blow I'll let my followers retain their cards to recharge them in the future, fee free! And I'll let 'em accumulate their ticket count over time to keep them coming back for more, more, MORE!As mayor I will create a land where divorced dads with their kiddos, young couples looking for some goofy fun and video game nerds can coexist, with a happy beer buzz and over stimulated pupils the size of dinner plates due to my flashing lights, whirling colors and jaunty winning noises. It'll be like a casino, but it won't be a place where dreams go to die. Saturdays will be the most crowded, but will still be manageable in size, as the mob ebbs and flows between midway and video games. There will be skee ball, air hockey, basketball free throw games, streaming water races, those games where the horse runs fast when you roll little balls into holes, virtual bowling, wacky drop the coin games, old skool Pac Man, Donkey Kong and Space Invaders, House of the Dead, motorcycle and racecar games, virtual boxing and my personal favorite, Super Trivia, where six people match wits against one another and get hundreds of tickets if they're super suave like me! Then they can trade those tickets in for junk like nose hair trimmers in the shape of a finger, t-shirts with our emblem on it, Chinese finger traps and jumbo pixie sticks!Ooo, ooo, and there will be fun little shots in those bottom heavy hourglass-shaped shot glasses where the mixer goes in the bottom and the shot goes in the top. And I'll even let 'em keep the shot glass, class act that I am. I can see it now, my own personal funland...What? Dave and Buster's already snaked my idea? Those sneaky fucking bastards. I guess I'll just have to go there if I'm feeling the need for a little goofy fun.Edit: By no means order anything that can't be produced by the divest of dive bars' short order cook. The food blows harder than a hooker trying to make rent on the 30th of the month. The games turn me into a giddy little girl, but the food turns me into a surly wench. Don't do it.On the outside, this place is great.Here is my story.I was at this place with a group of friends who were holding an event there.  Two of my friends, who happen to be gay, were trying to find a restroom.  There was an open door, so they went through it thinking maybe there was a restroom back there.They were told it was an area for employees only, they apologized and said they were looking for a restroom, and then left the hall.They went to go look somewhere else for the restroom, and they were stopped by an employee.  This employee radioed a manager after responding with disgust to the fact that they were holding hands.Before you know it, there are no less than 5 employees, 2 of which were managers, around my friends, peppering them with questions and threatening to throw them out.Mind you - we PAID to rent this place out.  They were *actually* looking for the restroom.  Nothing was out of place.  Except that it was two guys holding hands looking for a restroom.After enough of us stood up and asked the management staff why they were giving our friends a hard time, the employee mob started to shrink down, and the manager left.  One of them obviously very pissed off.My friends were not intoxicated, they were not agressive, they were two gay guys who happened to walk down the wrong hallway looking for a restroom.The management staff was aggressive and rude.  Without cause.It took 5 other people coming over to get them to back off.You put it together.  This place will never see another dime of my money.I've only popped into this Dave & Buster's for booze and games.  I hear they have food...What can you really say about a Dave & Buster's?  The bar is usually short-handed and packed with people wanting a million cocktails.  They offer a rechargeable token card which is both a blessing and a curse.  After a few drinks, losing track of your tokens is the obvious outcome.  At least you can let out drunken war cries when killing zombies with a fake handgun and no one would think twice.  It's loud in here!They also check your ID at the door after 9PM or something but unlike Los Angeles, they don't search your purse and have you go through a metal detector.  Yay?

Restaurant name  Don Guido's Chicago Style Hot Dogs

Review Text :
Don Guido's is Sunnyslope's hot dog place.  I'm not especially a hot dog gal, but Don Guido's offers something else to Sunnyslope too: Italian Beef sandwiches! This was my lunch today: a delicious Italian beef sandwich paired with garlic fries! The beef in my sandwich was not fatty or metallic colored like I've experienced in other places. I really enjoyed it and will definitely have it again (but will probably ask for it a little more wet, next time)! But, seriously, let me tell you about those fries...!!! Don Guido's garlic fries exceeded my expectations!! The fries were nice and crisp, not greasy. And, while I expected a shake of garlic salt to qualify for "garlic fries," I was delighted to find them topped with REAL minced garlic and parsley. A lot of it too! People were coming into my office from down the hall to get in on the action! We've polished them off, so you'll have to make a run to Don Guido's and get your own. TOTALLY worth the trip!

If you're a local, or even a tourist staying on the strip, I wouldn't say you should go out of your way to visit Delights. But if you happen to be at the MGM Signature... well, this is pretty much your only choice. Luckily, it's pretty good! I had their vegetarian egg white scramble in a cast iron skillet and I was pleasantly surprised by how many fresh veggies were on it, and a huge portion of delicious avocado. It was by far the healthiest thing I ate the whole time I was in Vegas. It came with a side of pretty fresh fruit salad and toast. If you order without toast, they'll give you two servings of fruit. They also have things you can pick up and go, like bottles of wine and snacks. Be warned: the prices are pretty outrageous. I think a small bottle of San Pelligrino was 4 or 5 bucks. The SMALL one! But this is Vegas, and what do you expect? If you want a bargain go to Costco beforehand and hoard it in your room!

Review Text :
Finally! A place with gluten free blueberry pancakes. my 2nd all time favorite food :) I've been here like 5 times in the past two weeks and its so good. The side of fruit is amazing too. grapefruit slices, blackberries, raspberries, strawberries, and sliced melon! Fresh squeezed orange juice is the cherry on top to an amazing meal. The staff is very friendly and accommodating as well. My new favorite breakfast spot :)I only ever seem to end up at the Cracked Egg with a coupon in hand. The breakfasts are always solid. Not my favorite in town, but they have quite a bit of variety and it's all pretty good. I have tried a number of things over the years and I tend to prefer their savories to sweets. Coffee cake isn't my thing, so despite all the raves, I have never ordered it more than once. The omelets usually draw my attention and they are good and cooked to order. Service is friendly, but the restaurant gets pretty busy so be prepared to wait or arrive early on weekends.None of the dishes have stood out over the years, but if you're looking for a basic breakfast stop, this is as good a place as any, just make sure you have a coupon.In deference to the prior review of a good friend who received poor service here in 2010, I'll say that I'm hopeful that they've at least gotten rid of her terrible waitress some time in the last five years.After spending a few days in the center of the strip, we had a 1:10 flight out of McCarran to come home.  That gave us a perfect chance to have a nice leisurely breakfast.  After researching gluten-free options in the area (wife wanted more than a 'fruit cup', but didn't want eggs, yet ironically we still came her), I found The Cracked Egg mentioned at a gluten-free website we use.  A couple people had reported issues with cross-contamination, but the more recent mentions indicated less problems.  So, we thought we'd give it a shot.Wife had a craving for simple pancakes with pecans (and of course syrup), which they could accommodate here.  They used "Pamela's"-brand mix, which we also use at home.  I'm going to assume they don't have a dedicated griddle surface, so if you really are extremely sensitive (wife usually is not), that may not work for you.  They also have gluten-free bread (but not a dedicated GF toaster).  The menu clearly states all this, and even has the heading "Gluten Sensitive" and not "Gluten Free", so we knew what to expect.  I'd seen a mention of gluten free English muffins in a prior review, but those were not available (nor mentioned on the menu) when we visited.The gluten-free pancakes are quite large, and would have been $6.95 alone.  But for a little bit more, we ordered it as the "Cakes and Eggs Combo" for us to split, which added two eggs and your choice of meat (2 slices of bacon for me, obviously).  There was an additional $1 charge over the regular Combo price because of the GF pancakes, which I feel is fair, knowing the difference in cost between Pamela's and "regular" pancake ingredients.  It was plenty of food for the two of us.  We also picked up the breakfast of a coworker of hers, and even with three beverages, the bill was less than the celebrity "burger, fries, and shake" I had on the strip the night before (review to follow).  The coffee was good, and hot.  Add to that friendly and fast service (there was no wait at 11am on a Tuesday), and who am I to complain?My pro-tip:  Sure, they have the fancy "hash browns", made of cubed seasoned potatoes, with bacon, cheese, scallions and sour cream.  But if you're a purist like me, they also have the crispy shredded potato version that I prefer.This location is on the southwest portion of town, and as a tourist who had been on the strip for four days, a calm way to transition back to "reality".  Since we had a rental, it really wasn't out of our way.  Just go like you are headed to McCarran, and where I-15 hits the 215, go a couple minutes WEST to Rainbow Blvd. (instead of east to McCarran/rental car return) and it's a couple blocks north from there.  Took about five minutes to drive to the rental car return from there.3.95 stars

Restaurant name  Thai Thai Takeout

Review Text :
To give you a little background, I LOATHE carryout.  If I'm going to put on pants and leave the house, I want to be taken care of, not turn right around and drive home to eat and then have to clean up after myself.  Don't get the enjoyment of carryout.  Husband loves it.  HATE it.That said, Thai Thai is the only Thai restaurant from which I'll eat in Charlotte.  They used to have a brick and mortar in what became a sketchy section of town (which is when I started with them), so they moved to this location and are now only carryout.Their food is heaven.  We have a standard order:  lots of fresh spring rolls (vegetarian and full of noodles and vegetables and mint leaves with a peanutty dipping sauce that makes me have bad thoughts), tofu tod (deep fried tofu for the hubby with an even peanuttier dipping sauce), pad thai (no onions, no tofu, extra broccoli for me and no eggs for the hubby).  MmmmmmWhen you call, you will be talking to Pim, who is a treasure.  I'm sure her husband, the cook, is also lovely, but I don't interact with him.  Pim will remember you and the vagaries of your order (see above) and is always super perky without being annoying.  Some other reviews mention that she has sometimes been a little optimistic about wait times, but I've recently heard her tell people on the phone "be over an hour", so she's getting more realistic.  If you'd like a Thai place in Charlotte that can get you food quickly, I can recommend several, but there's a reason Thai Thai has the wait it does.  THE FOOD.LOVE THEM.  Sorry.  I'll quit yelling.  You gotta go.  If only they'd get tables...sigh...

Review Text :
I must qualify this review. I didn't make the call to China Ginger expecting Wing Lei type food. I just wanted some local chinese take out. Quick. Easy. Somewhat edible.This spot is pretty close to my house, and I always pass it on my way to and from work, so I figured I'd give it a shot one night. Not a lot of Yelp love for this place, but that's ok...it can be our little secret ;)Some dishes that are decent: chicken with black bean sauce, chicken lo mein, and anything with chow fun. All are excellent choices.I also love that the food is always hot and ready for pickup within 10 minutes. As I said in my first paragraph, this isn't five-star, hard core, authentic Chinese food. It's just easy, simple, take out. And it's good for that. Something I missed in Arizona.If you want real authentic Chinese grub, hit up the spots on Spring Mountain, or go to Wing Lei, or even Wazuzu for fine dining.Ehhh my mom was craving Chinese food so I decided to give this place a go since I had a buy 2 get 1 free entrée coupon.. Called in my order and they said it would be ready in just 10 minutes so that's a plus.. fast food! When I got there for some reason I had trouble finding the main door LOL I thought it was on the side somewhere by Nagoya.. Any ways.. they didn't seem too happy that I had a coupon.. Which, by the way, saved me $10 so yay. I wasn't really hungry but I did sample a little bite of each entrée :-Chicken Chow Fun Dry: It was ok... flat, thin, long rice noodles pan fried with soy sauce, onions, bean sprouts & chicken.-Beef & Asparagus: way too salty-Orange Chicken: It's deep fried & coated with a sweet orange glaze.. of course it's tasty but so is Panda Express haha -Steamed Rice: They gave us 3 large containers of rice which was way too much but a plus since some places don't include rice.. But the rice was a cheap quality rice.-To-go containers: I like their plastic Tupperwareish to-go containers. Prevents spilling and leakage.. AND they are re-useable haha Anywho.. This place is not really worth checking out. The prices aren't even that low for take out quality food..HOT TIP: Look in your mail for Valpack Coupons.. that's where you'll find their buy 2 get 1 free entrée coupon!

I was walking around the Miracle Mile shops at the Planet Hollywood Hotel on my way to the parking garage to get my car, and decided to grab a quick bite to eat. I happened to pass by this place so I decided to stop by and check out their menu. The pictures on their menu looked appetizing so I went with the grilled chicken wrap combo meal, which came with a side of seasoned fries and a drink. My order came and it was surprisingly good. They have a condiment flavor bar that offered various sauces from smoked bbq, ranch dressing, honey mustard, salsa, ketchup, house dressing, etc.. pretty much anything you might need to spice up your wrap or sandwich. I was looking through their menu and noticed that they also offer quesadillas, sandwiches, salads, smoothies, and mixed alcoholic drinks and beer. I was tempted to get a margarita, but I was on my way to a business meeting and decided to just skip the spirits for now and make it up later on that night.Overall, my experience here was pleasant and the employees are friendly. They really do stand by their motto of serving food that is fresh and flavorful. A good alternative to the other fancy and more expensive food places along the Miracle Mile shops..How could I forget about this place.. I know I was extremely hammered after the Wet Republic to even remember that I ate here until my friend reminded me the other day!! lolFrom what I remember I came here to Tacone in Planet Hollywood....& I ordered the great gobbler sandwhich which was shredded chicken, cheese, avocado, bacon ,& other such toppings I can't recall but it tasted quite delicious @ the time...& they had a sauce bar with a variety of sauces from chipotle bbq, cilantro ranch, honey mustard dijon, & the list goes on of deliciousness...ya this place was the most affordable thing I ate that whole weekend seeing that my friend bought me a sandwhich gave me an extra $5 to take a cab back cause I spend all my money on booze ..yes definitely will remember this place & try it againIt's located inside PH right next to the parking lot escalators. It's on the corner and you might miss it if you're thoroughly sloshed. I was planning to get manageably belligerent and wanted those yard drinks from Fat Tuesday's but seeing the long, long long line, decided to come here instead. I had purchased the Groupon deal for 2 yard drinks earlier in the day ($21 for 2) and decided that now was as good a time to get drunk as...well all the time in Vegas.1) The drinks were not strong. It was basically drinking peach slushy. I know they're probably trying to get you to purchase an extra shot, but I didn't want it.2) Rude. Holy cow. The cashier was impatient and rude as all hell. I don't know why, as there were no lines. Was I disturbing her chat time with her coworker? I don't careeeeeeee.3) They overcharged me by almost $10. This was on top of the Groupon. When I pointed that out to her, she just shrugged and said they already made the drinks for me. So what?! Ugh. FINE. At $32 for 2 it's still cheaper than buying at full price. I'm in Vegas to have a good time, not to deal with some idiot who can't do math or punch in correct totals on the cash register.I give you an extra star because the yard cup had a happy face and reminded me not to throw a temper tantrum.Rule #3 of Vegas: Buy a huge ass drink the size of your torso to carry with you as you walk The Strip.I purchased a couple of Groupon deals before coming here, something silly like 20 bucks for 2 drinks. If only I had known how sweet the drinks actually were I would have only got one of the deals as we ended up not using the 2nd. Oh well.Set up: Casual bar with the usual fried food and vast array of alcoholic drinks.With the ''Yard longs'' you pick your cup, then your flavor and any additional Alcohol shots if you want them. The drinks are already pre made in a slushy machine, I kinda wish I had got an extra shot as I couldn't taste what was in there and it might have toned down the sweetness of it all.Service was fine and the drinks were ok but way too much for both myself and my Husband as neither of us drank more than half of it. Will I ever return to use that other Groupon on another trip? Probably not.

Restaurant name  Joseph Tambellini Restaurant

Review Text :
Rick brought me here for my Valentine's Night dinner on Saturday, February 18.  Yes, four days later.  Unfortunately I had to be out of town, San Antonio to be exact for two weeks and that included Valentine's Day.  But O did he promise me a really nice dinner when I returned!  Their menu promises "Warm romantic fine dining in the true Tambellini family tradition." and they are not kidding.  We began our dinner with some antipasta--sauteed calamari.  Hey, I'm 50% Italian and my guy is 100%.  We both love a great calamari and I'd been craving it since San Antonio.  This was the sort of calamari that just slowly melts in your mouth as you eat it, it was that succulent.  For my insalate I went for the mozzarella salad--fresh mozzarella, tomato, oasted peppers and mixed greens.  Heavenly!  One thing that sets Joseph Tambellini apart from some of the others is that they make their own pasta by hand here.  And believe me, it shows folks.  Their Mafalda Caprese was like none I've ever had before.  The grilled chicken was just right, the tomatos fresh, and the garlic not overpowering.  Rick went for the veal chop which just smelled divine!  This thing was a 16-oz'er and he ended up bringing some of it home.  Ah, but what is an Italian dinner without Dolce?  They've got a butterscotch poundcake with vanilla bean ice cream, and candied pecans with butterscotch sauce.  Oh how tempting that looked, but just a bit much.  Rick and I split a wonderful cannoli though, which topped off that dinner perfectly.  The atmosphere and service here are just impeccable.  Joseph Tambellini has three floors, each with a different decor.  Rick got us a table on the first floor, which has a much more traditional setting--just the way I like it.  So my Valentine's Day was a little delayed. But with that dinner, it was s-o-o-o worth the wait.  And the night was still young too.Solid Italian.

Restaurant name  Korea Garden
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
I stopped by Korea Garden with some friends last night, since they were looking for a restaurant in Oakland, and none of us had tried this one before.  Unfortunately, I doubt any of us will return after our experience last night, as there are many better places to eat at in Oakland (and that's saying something, given the mediocrity of the Oakland dining scene), and better Korean restaurants elsewhere in PGH.Since me and one of my friends had never tried Korean BBQ before, we decided to order the pork belly version to share ($27). The waitress suggested that we get something else to ensure that there was enough food, so we ordered the chicken from the Chinese-Korean section ($16).  Finally, we ordered soju to go with our meal ($12), at the suggestion of my other friend, who's been to S. Korea.  Every one of these items, without exception, was subpar.  The pork belly, normally one of my favorite items to order, was chewy and flavorless, indicating low quality meat and overcooking.  The chicken was something straight out of an Americanized Chinese take-out place, consisting of fried and breaded pieces smothered in a thick, sweet sauce with some vegetables sprinkled in for good measure.  Some of the chicken pieces were almost completely dry, whereas others were gooey from sitting in the sauce, making for an inconsistent and undesirable texture.  The soju was sweetish and watery, despite being straight from the bottle.The service we received was equally bad. Our waitress didn't stop by our table once after our food arrived.  Our waters remained unfilled, and the banchan that came with the KBBQ weren't replenished, which should be standard, according to my friend who visited S. Korea.  Indeed, we had to ask the person who came to bus our table for the check.  As other reviewers have mentioned, this place is grossly understaffed--our waitress was the only one working, except for the person bussing tables.In the words of my friend who's visited S. Korea, we were very unimpressed with the quality of food and service we received at Korea Garden.  To add insult onto injury, the prices are quite inflated--we could have had a solid meal at the hot pot place up the street for equal or less than what I paid for this meal.  If you're in the mood for Asian food in Oakland, I strongly suggest checking out that place (Top Shabu Shabu), or one of the other Chinese restaurants nearby.  If you're in the mood for Korean, try Green Pepper in SqHill or Nakwon Garden in Shadyside.  Regardless of what you're in the mood for or how close you want to stay, I guarantee that you can find a meal with better quality, prices, and service at any number of nearby restaurants.

Restaurant name  Wing Lei

Review Text :
We made reservations at Wing Lei since it was a convenient location after seeing Spamalot at the Wynn. It sounded impressive, what with it being the only Chinese restaurant in North America to have a Michelin star, plus the Peking Duck Five Course menu sounded delicious. Things got off to a bad start when we had to wait well past our reservation time, but the manager did comp our first round of drinks as a result. When we were finally seated, we did enjoy the decor of the room, but we were really hungry after having being kept waiting, and we weren't offered appetizers or amuses or anything to hold us over. My husband was especially "hangry."Two of us opted for the Peking Duck Five Course menu, and two of us opted for the Chef's Signature Dinner. Two of us got the suggested wine pairings (which was questionable to begin with, since I don't think wine generally goes with Chinese food, but due to the so-called "French influence" they claimed on the menu, I thought maybe they could pull it off. Not so much.).  I think for all of us, the first course was our favorite. I had the duck menu, so my first course was classic Peking roasted duck served with mandarin pancakes - you can't go wrong with that dish. Things went downhill from there, though. My second dish was a duck salad, which was quite delicious, but our server didn't bring the wine pairing until about 10 minutes later. The next course was a duck soup, and they forgot to bring the wine, period. When they finally brought it, it was the wrong wine, and it took yet another long wait to finally get the right one. The fourth and fifth courses were served together, and while they were not bad at all, they were basically just slopped together on the plate like a Panda Express combo bowl. For a restaurant of this caliber, I expect much classier presentation, and frankly, more subtle and refined dishes. I should have known better, having just returned from Taiwan, where I was treated to wedding banquet food extraordinaire that was picture perfect each and every time. I think I'll have to refrain from "fine dining" Chinese from now on, as there is no way it is going to meet my expectations. We really felt cheated after our meal. The food was good, but the service was not up to par, and the overall experience was definitely not worth what we paid.It seems like the bad reviews for this place were mainly because of the pricing of the menu. The reviews with 1-2 stars seem to say that Chinese food shouldn't be expensive. It makes me sad that people have categorized Chinese food into cheap eats and that the general impression of Chinese food is that it should not be expensive. Maybe the countless Chinese take-away places popping up all over America have helped reinforced this stereotype.First of all, in terms of the price and atmosphere at Wing Lei, it is no different than if you dined at a very nice Chinese restaurant in Singapore, Hong Kong, and Malaysia. In fact, it is very common to have Chinese restaurants like these and in this price range (and sometimes even more expensive) in Asia. Chinese food does not only belong to the cheap take-away food category. If there can be an expensive steak house, the same is said for a very good Chinese restaurant. Wing Lei reminded us alot of the very good Chinese restaurants we've been to in several parts of Asia and we were impressed as to how close Wing Lei tries to execute their concept.We had the 6-course peking duck tasting menu and loved every bit of it. We also thought that for $88 per person it was quite a good deal. In fact, we imagined that doing this same tasting menu in an equally fancy restaurant in Singapore or Hong Kong would have cost us more. We had the duck meat and skin served on an incredibly soft bun, duck salad, duck wonton with broth, stir-fried duck with veg, egg noodles with duck, and mango sorbet for dessert. The amount of food was definitely more than substantial and we were already very full before dessert. The service was also good, friendly, and professional. We asked if they had Thai birds eye chilli (we love our food spicy!) and the server said they would ask the kitchen to chop some of the fresh chillis for us. Overall we were impressed with Wing Lei. It was definitely a well deserved Michelin star they received.Double the price, double the quality?  No.Double the price, double the flavor?  NopeDouble the price, double the winnings in the casino? You're kidding right.The Strip has a sprinkling of very "high end"  Chinese restaurants that cater to wealthy, gaming crazed, visitors from Asia.  Wing Lei is unusual in that it focuses on Americanized Chinese food (what you expect to find in your usual takeout place) rather than Asian delicacies.  So does spending $34 for an order of orange beef or walnut prawns make it better than your favorite dive?The food.  The walnut prawns were outstanding.  Fresh, sweet, perfectly cooked with the right balance of crispy coating and not overly sweet honey cream sauce (it's not mayo).   The orange beef is well cooked, tender.  It is dressed in a tangerine, yuzu, and garlic chili sauce that adds a nice acidic balance but lacks the flavor punch you expect.  Finally, mu shu pork, watered down, week flavor thanks to the cabbage releasing its water.  Underwhelming.A beautiful dining room.  Spotless place settings.  Excellent but very restrained service (servers serve, not converse).Special Note:  The prices on the menu do not adhere to the Asian belief that that "4" is bad luck and "8" is good luck.  (Before you get all practical on me, I firmly believe "depend on the rabbit's foot if you will, but just remember it didn't work out too well for the rabbit."By the way, the answer to the question:  No.My family and I came ages ago, sometime in the late 00's (so long ago, I can't even remember), because my dad had a $150 gift card. This review is clearly long overdue, but here's my two cents anyway.First, the decor is absolutely gorgeous. With red, gold, and black accents, the ambience is very elegant and luxurious. One of the things I remember most about our dinner was not the food, but the beautiful chairs they had at every table. There were some tables that had booth seats on one side, against the wall, and those were just as opulent.At the time, my parents didn't want to go over the $150, so there were only so many things we could order. As I'm Taiwanese, I don't see a reason to spend more than $20 (heck, even $10) on one Chinese dish. Majority of the plates here are at least $30, going as high as $90. I'm glad I'm fortunate enough to live in an area where authentic Chinese & Taiwanese food is readily available for less than $10. Anyway, between the four of us, I believe we shared 3-4 plates. Since this was awhile back, I don't remember exactly what we ordered; just that it was surprisingly tasty.I would love to come back again for dinner, even though I don't remember the specifics. Considering that Asian fusion restaurants seem to cater to non-Asians more -- I'm looking at you P.F. Chang's -- I'm just happy that I didn't find the food repulsive. Wing Lei is an upscale restaurant with tasty Chinese food that will appeal to even the harshest native Chinese food critic.Michelin: 1 star (2009)This review is for their seasonal Chinese New Year Brunch which ran for 2 weeks.  The price was $68.88 and it came with an insane amount of food.  For the seafood fans, there's 5-6 selections of sushi, shrimp cocktail, king crab claws, oysters, and whole lobsters.....And this isn't like the old Rio seafood buffet where you see asians fighting over and topping their plates full of lobster 7-8 deep.  There's so many options everyone will be pleased.The dim sum rolled around every 15 minutes or so.  There was lobster, scallop, and shark fin dumpling along with your standard dim sum fare.  The soy sauce chicken, duck, and pork belly were especially delicious.If you're still going strong, there's about a dozen hot entree items such as filet mignon tips, sea bass, two kinds of shrimp (curry and chile sauce) and yee mien.There's a huge dinosaur size tomohawk chop for the meat lovers and 3 soups to choose from.  For dessert save room for the flaky dan tat egg custard, sesame balls, or their assortment of non asian desserts.Overall everything was good but nothing really blew me away.  Having had the Mozen brunch a month ago, Wing Lei is head and shoulders above it in all areas.  Since Wing Lei is seasonal I'd take advantage and try it out once.  The one thing that was annoying was they charged $48.88 for children under 6.  I dont' have any kids but that's certainly Wing's way of telling you to leave them behind.** PS - Had their Peking Duck tasting menu and it was amazing - super expensive - i'd love to come back for dinner but i'm asian so paying 40-50 bucks for one plate of food is insane - maybe next time on someone's dime. **I wish we could have experienced this restaurant when it was truly worth a Michelin Star because it definitely would not make the cut today. We stopped by for dinner on a Sunday evening. We made reservations for 6pm and were seated right away upon arrival.The service is very cordial and the decor is very nice. We were there early in the evening, so I guess the staff felt relaxed. A cook stood outside the kitchen and rubbed his back on a doorway corner like a bear on a tree. Nice.We ordered the Peking Duck, Mapo Tofu and Cantonese Sausage Rice. The "Peking Duck" is very suspect. I can't say for certain it isn't real Peking Duck, but it certainly did not taste like it. It very much tasted like regular old roast duck. The tofu and the rice were very good, but I would certainly hope so for what they are charging their entrees for.Basically, you could have a comparable or BETTER tasting Chinese meal at any number of other good Chinese restaurants in town for a quarter of the price. Sure, the decor is very nice, but does that warrant a 300% difference in price? The experience one would like from a former one Michelin Star restaurant just isn't there.This was our second visit to Wing Lei.  The first was several years ago when I had ordered a second expensive round of small pan-fried pot stickers in order to be filled enough by my favorite Chinese appetizer.  Not this time!After a delicate amuse bouche of a Cherry Tomato & Cucumber in a ceramic dish, I was quite pleased to be presented with five large and nicely tanned Pan-Seared Pot Sticker beauties that were stuffed with minced pork, cabbage, and pickled ginger, and accompanied by Garlic-ginger Soy Sauce for dipping.  This fine starter was then followed by a hot bowl of tasty Vegetable Hot & Sour Soup with sufficient but not too much spicy heat, Woodear Mushrooms, Bamboo Shoots, and egg.For my entree I enjoyed very tender medium-rare Garlic Beef Tenderloin with Heirloom Bell Peppers, Green Cauliflower, Sugar Peas, Black Mushrooms, and a side of Yang Chow Fried Rice festooned with shrimp, BBQ pork, and scallions.  This afforded me a great juxtaposition of harmonizing flavors.Meanwhile Diane savored her entree of Walnut Prawns that sported quite large prawns, brawny glazed walnuts, and an inventive creamy mayonnaise-like Honey Cream Sauce spread over all to nicely conjoin the two principal elements. I finished with two large creamy scoops of Almond Cookie Ice Cream and Chocolate Ice Cream.  Then came complimentary chocolates and other candied confections.  Had I known they would be produced, in all likelihood I would not have ordered dessert.  But I did enjoy my ice cream as well as a few of the sweet treats.Service was exemplary, with unbidden refills of water and hot tea.  Ambiance was exceptionally elegant.  And, there was even a pursestool placed near our table to support a lady's purse.  The tariff here is high, but the dining experience we had this last time out was worth every penny.

Where to go on a Saturday night, when you are craving some good steak, but Outback is played out, wallet's too thin for Morton's or Ruth's Chris, and the line at Texas Roadhouse is out the door?Logan's Steakhouse at the Chandler Fashion Center. I'd never been here before, though it's just a few minutes from my house, but I'm glad we gave it a shot, after driving all the way to Texas Roadhouse (TR) in Gilbert only to learn we'd have to wait at least 50 minutes to be seated. Very similar to TR (or exactly like it), the place is covered in peanut shells, and there are buckets of peanuts at every table. However, unlike TR, the place was slow, and we were seated immediately. First the service... The wait staff was very friendly and attentive, our glasses were always full, and our server came by to check on us regularly. I don't think I can say the same about the kitchen staff. Not sure where the communication or the process might have broken down, but it took ridiculously long for us to get our meals, though our salads came out immediately. As for the food... The salads were alright. nothing to write home about. We just got the side salad (house salad comprised of iceberg and romaine, tomatoes, cheddar cheese, shredded carrots, and some onions). Italian dressing for me, Balsamic Vinaigrette for the boyfriend.When we finally got our food, it was darn good though! I ordered the 6 oz. filet mignon, medium well, with a grilled vegetable skewer. The  boyfriend ordered the sirloin with the veggie and shrimp skewers, and a baked sweet potato. We both really enjoyed the meals. The steaks were perfection. The vegetables could have used a tad LESS seasoning/salt, but still tasty.We wrestled with the impulse to order their little Nutter Butter dessert -a mini version of their peanut bucket, full of chocolate mousse, fudge and nutter butter filling topped with whipped cream. It's only $1.99 and TINY. But we didn't order it... ya know, we're watching our figures.The manager and our server seemed to have noticed that our order took abnormally long to come out of the kitchen, and we were comped 50% off our entire bill. We still tipped our server on the full price of the meal, as it was certainly no fault of hers, and her service was great!The food was great, the service was great, and I honestly think the issue with the delay in getting our food was an isolated incident, not the norm. We'll definitely eat there again.

So I have been lured back several times......It's such a scam they suck you in with the fancy menu and these Fab chips and salsa, trust me after eating those you'd expect to the food to be pretty damn good, but NO ,to Quote Jenn H.  it is  "Blech. Die."If and when I come back I'll stick to the chips and salsa, I also would usually order the table side gauc , but have found that they put such large chunks of onion and jalapeno it really takes away from it.......take your time chef and finely chop that shit!!I'll give 5 stars for the chips and salsaand 1.5 for the food, but you can't have both!Dang, Cantina Laredo - I wanted to like you so hard!  Like a hot date that ends in a restraining order, like an incredible hike that ends in poison oak or skunk spray - I've walked past this place for years, imagining a swanky, high-end Mexican food joint behind the dark windows and high prices; sadly, what I found was a very regular, uninspired restaurant serving up some rather meh Mexican food.  This was a 'man behind the curtain' Wizard of Oz moment for me.Good things?  Mmmmmm - the warm spicy salsa which they serve along with another milder cold one (not so good) and chips is the reason this place gets 2 very enthusiastic stars from me - SO DELICIOUS!  It was hook-me-up-to-a-feed-bag delicious.  Service was quick and pleasant.After that though, it all goes downhill.  Being vegetarian, I can 99% of the time find something meatless and tasty when I go out to eat but there were very few such options here.  I ended up selecting the Enchiladas de Espinaca and subbed in a Cheese & Onion one to shake things up a bit (I know, I'm very exciting).  When my meal came out, the waitress said she had the kitchen put zucchini alongside my Mexican rice instead of beans (wtf - who in their right mind opts out of beans for zucchini at a Mexican food restaurant?!); so began the first of my meal modifications - I might note here that while being veggie, I am a pretty low-maintenance diner.  So, just as the black beans are being brought out, I realize the sauce atop my cheese enchilada consists of red chili with beef chunks - again wtf - in my 31 years of life on this earth, no Mexican food joint I've ever visited has ever converted a cheese enchilada to a meat one via the sauce!  The waitress said they could make me a new cheese & onion with sour cream sauce atop (cringe).  The mushroom and spinach enchilada was kinda gross - something about the oil they used to sauté the spinach in gave it a strange taste and the button mushrooms looked like they had been plunked into it straight out of a can.  The zucchini and cheese & onion enchilada were nothing I would ever want to order again.  Black beans were alright - hard to mess those up though.  In defense of Cantina Laredo, if you're a big meat eater, perhaps you might have more luck here than I.  The place was clean, the workers were nice, the one aforementioned salsa is killer.  But this place is neither authentic nor new-agey Mexican, not worthy of the steeper price points, and certainly lacks any great ambience to carry the lackluster food.  Don't think I will be auditioning this place for a second date or hike - would strongly consider rolling around in poison oak or getting skunk sprayed over coming back - it was that bad.

I saw a bad review which really surprises me. I go there often, but wouldn't call myself a regular. I don't know any bartenders' names or anything. But, I've never had a bad taco, bad service or bad anything ever here. The crowd always seems chill. The patio is nice. I like the red lighting. Good for street watching too. Their food always tastes fresh and their salsa bar is very yummy! Tequilas-great selection. I believe Herradura is one of my faves. I say, can't go wrong with this spot. If you like a casual fresh Mexican kind of sporty type bar with a lot of modern touches and nice staff, don't see why you wouldn't enjoy!So when I get up on Saturday mornings I make sure my husband has started on the mile-long honey-do list I've left him, and I shake my finger at him and then say, "No Bud Light until you're finished with that list, Mister," and then I pile on a gallon of some Jessica Simpson designer imposter perfume, put on my yoga pants, a push-up bra, my most over-priced tank top, and grab my squalling 16-month-old to go meet up with my best girl, Traycee, and shop at Nordstrom Rack.  We drag my kid, Barrington, all over the store, and he's screaming the whole way, but really, who cares?  Then we head to Juan Jaime's for half a bottle of tequila and a couple of tortilla chips, and Barrington is still screaming, but again, who cares?  I  had a great time and jacked the credit card up six- or eight-hundred dollars.  I forget, but I don't pay the bill so whatever.  Man.  There is a whole other world out there, and I'm glad I don't live in it.  But sadly, sometimes I catch the effects of it.I am so glad we finally tried Juan Jaime's.  Ladena has always been our server, and she is awesome.  She makes sure those drinks don't get empty and is quick with the food and the check as well.  I have a new love.  It's their pomegranate margarita.  Delicious!  Right now I can't feel my elbows or my kneecaps and I'm pretty sure I only weigh 110 pounds.  That's a great drink!  We've also had the street dog lunch special, the carnitas and beef tacos, the nachos, and the cheese enchiladas.  Everything is tasty and reasonably priced.  Next time we'll have to try the patio where we can then be entertained by all the bad drivers on Chandler Blvd.  GREAT place!

I went to bed late the night before, and still woke up at 6:30am. I don't even actively day trade stocks right now, so that was annoying.  In spite of the less than stellar start to the day, my favorite Asian agreed to meet me for lunch and I offered her a choice between wings or ramen.  Deep down I knew she was gonna pick chicken wings, but nearly every fiber of my being was hoping she would surprise me again and go for ramen.  It was barely in the mid 50s at the time we were exchanging texts, negotiating my term of unconditional something or other.  While she casually mentioned that she wasn't at home but was at one of the mid-tier Strip hotel.  Okay, maybe the guy spent all his budget on 12 Blue Moon and 8 Red Bull (sugar free), plus the room and there was nothing left for brunch. Whatever the case, he is off to ride back to his crib on the West side or Cali or wherever.  A lot of weeds to whack to get the girl, that's just the reality and the struggle.Anyway, I will skip the tangential details and get straight down to the business of reviewing my very first ever Wingstop experience.  As you are probably already aware, there are multiple Wingstop locations dotted throughout the Las Vegas valley.  Most locations open at 11am, but this location on Tropicana wins the early bird prize by opening at 9am.  The simple menu is the same, as far as I can tell, across all locations.  You basically have wings (classic bone-in and boneless) and crispy chicken tenders to select from, with 11 wing flavors and whatever limited time promo they are offering.  The dipping sauces (ranch, honey mustard, blue cheese and spicy chipotle) are extra, unless you order their combos or family packs. Their fries are actually not bad, and a large is really more than enough.Service is swift and professional. But your order will still take up to 18 minutes, which the cashier will inform you as you place your order.  So call ahead or be prepared to wait.The wings was just okay, because my wings were on the overcooked side, and not really moist and juicy.  The Cajun sauce was spicy, but tolerable, but eat a lot and the heat will build up and surely burn you later.  Lemon Pepper was good, but damn was it salty.  Hawaiian was decent, with mild sweetness and no heat.  You also have the option to ask for your wings to be served "wet".Overall, the food was okay (3 stars).  Spending time catching up over a bunch of fried chicken wings with my fav Asian, talking about random stuff made the Wingstop excursion well worth the price of a 24 piece family pack (which was surprisingly heavy - pretty sure it is enough to split with 4 people with normal appetite).  I would do it again if she still wants wings.

Review Text :
You'd think it's hard to go wrong with a burro. Well, I've had my fair share of bad ones. But the chili rojo I got at the Original Burrito Co. was done right! Pork, rather than beef! Lots of it! Lots of the spicy sauce! Deliciousness abounds!Also, take a note from me and be sure to read before doing.Clearly, I don't pay attention as much as I should, but.......When I see a bar of salsa, my first instinct is to run...toward it. Then of course I realize that there are only paper cups without lids to put said salsas and pico in. When you've got an order to-go, this could be tricky. Then you might notice the sign that says that salsa comes prepackaged with your to-go meal. I am such a ditz sometimes.Anyway, after a few mix-ups, and me being a nervous and easily embarrassed person, we finally got home with the goods. And like I already said, everything was pretty solid. The salsa was nice and spicy with good flavor, although I thought the tomatoes in the pico were a little mushy. The tostadas looked pretty nice, too.The menu was also pretty expansive, and I'm sure any of their burritos, platters, or tacos are excellent.Despite the fact that they tell you their beans are vegetarian, and put them in the vegetarian burrito, The Original Burrito Company makes their beans with CHICKEN STOCK. This is false information they are providing to people, and when people have moral issues with consuming meat, this turns into a huge issue.I will never eat here again. I do not support businesses that are dishonest.

Review Text :
7/01/10I've had Tortas El Guero bookmarked for a couple of weeks when a friend told me of the wonderful torta she had here recently, I thought I'd visit it on my next days off.  Came in prior to 430p, and the woman manning the counter could not speak any English at all.  Good thing I still retained a little of basic Spanish to request that a few ingredients be omitted.  (Had I waited till 5p, I'd have no problem w/ the bilingual Caucasian server that arrived.)  Chose the carne asada torta, and the bread was good.  However, the filling was very sparse.  I suggest that TEG either use smaller-sized bread, or up the filling a bit!  The cost of the sandwich is definitely too high-- I wouldn't order this same sandwich for that price again (especially when I could order a huge serving that is equally as tasty, perhaps more so, at Phoenix Ranch Market-- the telera bread there is amazing!).  Indeed, I had to order two side tacos for their meat contents (pastor y carne asada) to be able to fill in the rest of the torta :(  Based on what I tried, if I were to come back, I'd order the pastor.  I don't think I'll be back, though.(I will, however, visit the Michoacan ice cream parlor again next door!!  The coffee and mango flavors I tried were delicious!  What I wouldn't do to have some of the coffee right now...)

Review Text :
Re-visited Pasqual's tonight for dinner with a co-worker, and we were seated next to the kitchen, where we had a full, un-fettered view of the kitchen works.Our server was friendly and prompt; chips and salsa were good, as usual.  A Dos Equis Amber (from the tap) was crisp and fresh.What bothered me was watching the food preparation process. Nothing is made fresh.  They have chafing dishes and refrigerated containers that contain all of the "pieces" of your meal.  Depending on your order, they scoop from various containers, assemble, plate, and then cover with a plastic lid.  From there, it's into a microwave - they have a bank of them - where your food is nuked until warm.  Or, in my case, until it's still refrigerator cold in the middle...I'm sorry, but I don't feel it's fair to pay $10 for 2 tacos that are improperly microwaved... I watched as *every single* entree was processed through the assembly line like this.  I could describe to you in perfect detail the steel-grey microwaves, the greyish-colored lids, and the workers that were cranking out the reheated food plate after plate... I saw several entrees that had sat too long after being nuked go back into the microwave for a second reheating before being presented to diners.I won't be back.  Hell, Chipotle prepares its food in-mass prior to serving, but at least it's kept warm/hot and served relatively fresh.  And, it costs about 2/3 as much.It's sad that this Pasqual's even shares the same name as the one on Monroe st, because if this were my only Pasqual's experience, I'd never go back.  I used to love the old Atwood location, and the Monroe one is good too.  This newest addition just sucks.  First off, It's big and dark, yet like an old factory.  Huh?The food selection is slightly different than the Pasqual's on Monroe street too.  Just weird stuff.  And what is with the bakery/coffee shop?  The table setup is strange too.  Every table is awkward, and the place is cold.Just do yourself a favor, and don't go here.

Review Text :
C4. I want to understand you. Like I want to understand why my neighbor wears a Members Only jacket. Like I want to understand gay Republicans. And who was the first person to put vegetables in jell-0. I do C4. But ya gotta help me. The bar decor is all about the 4 tvs. That's cool I guess. But other than that, where am I supposed to sit? My vodka cran was weak. When I asked for a remake and let's make it a double. It arrived in a pint glass. Yes a pint glass. I didn't want double the drink. Just double on the booze pour. I wanted a greyhound, but the bartender never heard of that. I'm sure he thought I was trying to book a trip to Bakersfield or something. Come to find out C4, you just don't carry grapefruit juice. The sushi rolls were actually worse than something I would pick up at the grocery store. The teriyaki wings were passable, but a little dry. I do believe someone in the group enjoyed a burger. The dining room has a big spot with nothing in it, right below the cool painting of, I believe a dragon of some sort. Hey, how about a sofa or loungey kinda area? Since I can't seem to find a seat in the bar. And since we're neighbors C4, I'm gonna stop by again. Maybe I'll bring my friend with the Member's Only jacket.I have an entire box of conversation hearts left over from Valentine's Day and these little morsels are going to be the inspiration for this review. Let the taste of cherry flavored death and pastel sidewalk chalk begin!"My man" and I decided to join a group of ten at C4 last night to enjoy the company of a quirky group of "romeo"s and "dream girl"s and sample the new Southwest inspired menu at C4.I was impressed at "how nice" the decor was in the main dining area, since I had previously only frequented the bar and sampled some of the wretched Japanese inspired bar food. It's nice to see a restaurant "wise up" and invest a little "tlc" into reworking its image, as well as its menu. I thought that the bold, colorful Mexican centerpieces and hanging crystal light pieces were "tres chic" and when I saw the same strong use of color duplicated on the chair backs it was "true love" for me. I wanted to steal all the light fixtures, knick-knacks and tall chairs for my own home.It was Valentine's Day and I had to order something to drink that was as frou frou and girly as my polka dot party dress, because when "ur a qt" you simply have to be sipping something just as ultra-femme. So I went for the Prickly (pear) Peach Martini and was not disappointed by its "sweet," pulpy, hot pink contents.For apps, we ordered two platters of the tri-colored chips with three dips and the crab cakes. When it came to the dips, there was "one I love"d, the napolito corn salsa. The other two, guacamole and pico de gallo, "I hope" get better with time because the pico was bland and the guacamole was so overpowered by lime juice that it was nigh on inedible. The crab cakes on the other hand "I'm sure" I would order again because there was a good crab to filler ratio and a pleasant spicy kick delivered by the chipotle remoulade. "Lover boy" and I split the bacon cheeseburger and the chorizo mac and cheese for dinner, both of which I wanted to be "all mine" because they were so good I didn't want to share a single bite with "my baby." I was hoping the burger would "be good" but I wasn't expecting it to be cooked to perfection and served with crisp tomatoes and a lovely pile of spring mix instead of some of the more lowly greens available. It also came with a side of fries that were more like munching on a plank of potato if you "ask me." And feel free to "call me" crazy, but they must have sprinkled "stardust" on the chorizo mac and cheese because it was out of this world good! You could ask any of the three people that ordered it at our table if that's too good to "be true" and I'm sure you'd receive the same response as mine. Spicy, tender homemade chorizo was afloat in three types of decadent cheesy bliss!We ended the night with two dessert sampler platters, and if you have more than at least three people at the table, I highly suggest you take "time out" of your evening to indulge because it was "way" good. I am in "love" with two of the desserts in specific, the frozen key lime tart and the Mexican chocolate flourless cake. The key lime tart was "cool" and citric and I let it melt in my mouth like a bite of sorbet with a graham cracker crust and tasty little candied lime zest. The "cutie pie" slice of Mexican chocolate flourless cake was rich and dense with a deep cocoa flavor and a hint of spiciness at the end that "let it be" a bit more unpredictable and memorable than regular chocolate desserts. The borracho bread pudding wasn't as drunk as its name suggested (or as pudding-y) and the 7 layer chocolate cake was the same "you & me" could get the valley over. The waitress we had was an "angel." She was extremely knowledgeable about all of the dishes on the menu and went so far as to open a dialogue with the chef when a member of our party needed a vegetarian, lactose free meal (who could that possibly be? ":)" ). I "loved her," and even though service was a little bit scattered, I attribute that more to having to deal with drink orders and food delivery at the same time (for a pretty big group) than any kind of slacking. It wasn't perfect and could definitely use some refining, but since that was the only minor hang-up in the evening, I'm going to "let it be" forgotten."I do" think C4 has the possibility of becoming a five star dining experience. It just needs a bit of polishing!Don't agree? "Fax me." (Sorry, I just had to include the most ridiculously out of date conversation heart saying in the history of Necco. The rest of them were just too ordinary.)EDIT: 3/30/08Ok, I'm downgrading to 3 stars.  Now C4 is still a good place, but recent visits have shown the restrooms to be consistent disasters.  Water overflowing with caution signs and bars of soap and lack of paper towels.  Yuck. My last visit on a Friday night, the restaurant ran out of macaroni when I was looking forward to the Chorizo Mac and Cheese.  I had to settle for a shrimp quesadilla which was ok, but nothing near the deliciousness of the mac and cheese.Review - 2/16/08My huge Elton John glasses are off to Ben, his cute dog and his team at C4 and the Clarendon Hotel. I'm impressed with how quickly C4 underwent changes to the restaurant and menu.  I'll keep this quick because Erica's awesome review covers it all.The chorizo mac and cheese was very delicious. I'm all about all things cheese and love a bit of spice, so this was an obvious choice when I saw it on the menu. It was also only $7, but should you be in a sandwich or burger mood, the California Club with the usual fixings and chipotle mayo also delivered for my friend Bobo.   The potato wedges that came with it were huge...I'm talking quarters of potatoes here.Our party of 10 got dramatically improved service from our last experience, and only toward the end did I tip off the server that we were guests of Ben's from Yelp.   Yes, one person got their appetizer tortilla soup....for dessert!  But other than that, our server was gracious, chatty and demonstrated knowledge of the new menu.  The best part of the service was after dinner when Ben and his cute dog asked us how dinner was and we gave him our feedback.The best parts of the new C4 beside the Chorizo mac and cheese?* A stunning rooftop bar and cool happy hour promotion with different DJ and comfy patio furniture to watch the glittering Central Phoenix skyline and relax in a fab setting reminiscent of the Standard Hotel in L.A.  * Desserts. The flourless Mexican chocolate cake was incredible, with the flavors of both spice and cocoa that left us all wanting more.  The key lime cheesecake had great hints of lime zest throughout.The warm Santa Fe orange paint on the walls and new Southwestern/Native art in the glass case suggested a new direction for the restaurant -- one that I'm pleased with and hope continues to be improved upon.  3.5 stars for food and service and 5 stars for effort by management.Original review - January 2008I feel like I'm being generous with the two-star rating. After coming here a few times for drinks I was waiting for a dining experience to actually rate the place, but two stars is all it gets. Quite simply, the food and the service stunk. I understand the difficulty of serving 14 people, but our server got little to no help from other servers, which is surprising because it wasn't even all that busy. There is a reason why the cocktails are more expensive than the food, it's because the drinks are better. J-man and Lauren pretty much cover it all. I will add that half of our party seemed to be ok with the food, but the other half thought it was disgusting. My mahi mahi sandwich with mango salsa was probably the driest sandwich I have ever had. I had to wait about 10 minutes to eat it though because the server had to replace the bun after she accidentally knocked the bun off the sandwich when she served me. It probably dried out from the wait. The fries were decent. The "house fries" were described as a mixture of french fries and sweet potato fries. The reality? 30 french fries and 2 sweet potato fries. I made sure to eat the sweet potato fries really slowly to make them last longer.The only saving graces here were the cocktails and the pokemons. I kinda like them! The drinks were decent, but they took forever to arrive after ordering. Do yourself a favor and don't dine here. C4 will be a drinks only place for me.I am partial to indepedent, non-chain restaurants and especially ones with a casual feel and no attitude.  And ones with great food.I've eaten at C4 four times now with its newly revised menu and have not been disappointed.  The atmosphere is cool and understately hip.  The food is terrific and reasonably priced.The food:I am addicted to the super-delicious corn & poblano chili chowder soup.  Absolute perfection.  I order it every time.Other recommended dishes:Appetizers:  tres queso quesadillo, crab cakesSoups:  the chili stewEntrees:  the tilapia dish, the pork chop dish, the chorizo mac & cheese, the burgersDesserts:  lime tart (tastes like lemon drop candy), bread pudding, apple cobblerAll of the food is prepared fresh, including the desserts.  I've had the pleasure of touring the kitchen and meeting the cook staff.  You can see the pride in their faces as they prepare and talk about the food.A great restaurant for one, for two, for four, for six, or more persons.  Be sure to check out the rest of the hotel while you're there:  the rooftop with its incredible sunset and downtown views and the jawdropping pool area.Top 3 WORST Dining Experience EVER!Saturday night my girl and I decided to check this place out, excited for the change in menu and an "Old School Mexican Food" experience.  We were thoroughly disappointed in almost every possible way.We arrived at about 9:15pm and didn't get out of there until 11:15pm... TWO hours for $9/plate Mexican food.  Did I mention we were 1 of 3 TOTAL parties in there?  No big parties, two tables of 4 and our party of 2.  Service was so poor and slow it was comical.  The waitress would disappear for LONG periods of time.  Maybe smoking weed or something, I have no idea....?  Weed would explain why it took 20minutes after ordering a scoop of sorbet before it found it's way to our table.Now the food.  Junk at best.  First, after literally 45mins-1hr after being seated, our food finally arrived.... COLD... not luke-warm, cold.  I had grilled chicken w/ rice and beans, my girl had chicken soft tacos.  We sent our plates back and the waitress said she would have the kitchen remake the meal immediately.  Well, 25minutes later the new plates arrived.  Really?  25 minutes to remake a plate of grilled chicken and soft tacos then slap a spoon of rice and beans on the plate?  Now the second time the food STILL was not hot... this time it was luke-warm.  Whatever, we were starving, so we ate it.  The food itself lacked any seasoning and frankly any taste.  I can make better Mexican food at home, shit, Filiberto's makes better Mexican food.  Interesting also, the second plates had portions about 1/2 of what was delivered initially.  I usually have left overs and don't really like huge portions, so this was fine with me, but it just goes to show the lack of consistency.The waitress was always very nice and courteous, and she did offer us a free item to make up for the cold food, so she appeared to be trying, I just don't understand what the issue was.  We were not alone in a bad experience.... one table of 4, sitting behind us, ordered a nacho appetizer with guac on the side... well she brought one out with guac all over it, explaining there was a mistake and another one was being made, but they could have this one also, instead of throwing it away.  Well their 2nd one, prepared correctly, didn't come out until AFTER they were all 4 done with their meals!  The other party of 4 who were seated before we even arrived, didn't get their food for 15 minutes after our first cold plate... meaning they waited at least 1 hour for their food and they ordered before us!  They had burritos... burritos!  How long can it possibly take to make a burrito?Dinner's over, and I decide to try a refreshing sorbet I had eyed on the menu earlier.  I don't eat dairy or wheat, so when I see a dessert item that has neither ingredient, I get excited.  There are not too many deserts around that are made without wheat or dairy.  They had a few very good sounding selections, I opted for Passion Fruit.  So 20 minutes later, when my single scoop of sorbet arrived, I dove right in...... and almost spit it out!  It was the w-o-r-s-t tasting sorbet I have ever encountered... in fact, I don't think it was prepared properly, or even sorbet.  It was the most sour, most tart thing I have ever tasted.... to the point where it was literally impossible to NOT make a face after taking a bite (like the super-sour-face).  My girl thought I was joking and being dramatic so she took a bite.... haha, you should have seen her face.  Classic.  Un-edible.  It literally had the consistency, and tasted like that frozen fruit juice concentrate you buy in the store, without ANY sugar.  It was horrible.  Horrible.Sad really... I truly wanted to like this place.  The atmosphere and decorations are very cool, chic, and modern.  It really _looks_ tight, but produced one of my 3 worst experiences ever.  Funny thing is, I had a gift certificate, so I got most of the meal and 4 martini's free..... and I still hated every second of it and would have absolutely rather gone anywhere else and paid.Well to start off there was not much I could eat considering most of the food had trans fat. The ice cream they serve has mono and diglycerides (trans fat) they use grocery brand buns with High Fructose corn syrup and partially Hydrogenated oil (Also Trans Fat) Me and Jamie ate her on NYE so maybe it is different . Jamie ate an alfredo pasta that I didn't touch (white sauces disgust me) Later that evening she started shaking and holding her stomach. On the drive home she said she felt like she was going to puke but I figured she was just expressing how bad she felt. I offered to pull over and she said she couldn't wait that long. I look over and she had grabbed a Harkins cup from the floor and started puking in it then dumping it out the window to make room for more alfredo vomit. It was smelling garlicky fresh in there. I'm sure with it being New Year it looked great throwing cups of vomit out the window, even though we don't drink. Since we don't drink we were probably the only ones who knew this was not alcohol induced vomiting. Oh something else I saw that night. The chef brought out some food in a cater style pan. As he was setting it down the dish rag he was holding was dragging all over the food, WTF?!

Review Text :
Met a colleague here for lunch the other day.  It was my first visit to Frank & Fina's.  I arrived early and was seated promptly by the hostess.  While I was browsing the menu, the owner Frank came out with Chips & Salsa and asked for my drink order suggesting a Margarita or Beer....hmmm, ok!  You don't have to ask me twice in a Mexican Restaurant if I want a Margi or Beer.  I ordered a Pacifico....what the hell, I don't have to go into an office and my afternoon was clear.While I waited for my friend, I decided I'd order the Nachos.  He arrived a few minutes later saw my Pacifico and ordered one for himself....I love how contagious Beer in a Mexican Restaurant can be!  We ordered our lunch and I like how the waitress asked me if wanted Jalapenos on my Nachos....I asked her if they could cut it fresh and put a lot on top...she said yes.We had a nice conversation while we waited for our food, which came out a short time after we ordered.  The place was packed for lunch and I expected the service to be much slower, but it wasn't.The Nachos were very good.  The proportion of Cheese, Guacamole, and Sour Cream were just right.  The proportion of Salsa and Onions were good too, relative to the amount of Chips.  The portion was on the Appetizer menu and it could easily feed two or three.  It's not a huge pile of Nachos like you find in some restaurants. For $5.50, it's not bad.  The flavor of all the ingredients were very good too.  The only complaint I have is that the Chips are too thin....they broke easily with the slightest amount of pressure....which forced me to eat most of the Nachos with a Fork.  That's sacrilegious to some Nachos aficionados...LOLWe had another Pacifico and continued our conversation for a while after lunch.  It was a pleasant experience.  As a bonus, I ran into two friends I haven't seen in 8 yrs who were sitting a the table next to us.Overall it was a good time.Will I return?  Of course!

Per the Yelp rating system, 3 stars equates to "A-OK".  That is exactly where I would drop Don Vito's.  Well, maybe not drop but place.  I would place them there.  Firmly and with authority but not in a harmful or diminutive way.  Anyway, Don Vito's is not a restaurant I would seek out but it's just fine.  If I stayed at South Point again I would probably eat here again.  Fair enough?I had basic spaghetti with meatballs.  It was tasty and filling, not spectacular by any stretch.The service was excellent throughout the meal.The atmosphere here is pretty much what you would expect for a casino Italian restaurant...maybe even a little nicer than you would expect.

Restaurant name  Intermezzo Pizzeria and Cafe

Review Text :
For some reason the first time we went to Intermezzo I wasn't really impressed.  It was right when they first opened and we sat outside in the heat with lots of traffic passing by.  We didn't even wander inside.  I wish I'd known that dining inside is a completely different experience.  This time around I loved Intermezzo!  The atmosphere was very cool and cozy and had that Plaza Midwood feel.  They have cool local art work on the brick walls and they had kind of a funky music playlist that half the time included rave/techno ish music and the rest of the time was more low key alternative.I don't know if it was just because I was starving, but I thought their pizza was amazing!  I actually ventured to say it's my new favorite pizza in Charlotte.  We had the supreme style pizza and all the veggies were so fresh and full of flavor.  Yum!  Plus they topped if off with slices of tomato which I'm not usually a big fan of but this time around I thought it was delicious.  Their menu isn't terribly extensive but it doesn't matter to me because I will always be ordering this pizza from now on.Don't be fooled by the sign reading "Pizzeria and Cafe" on the outside of Intermezzo's flavor-filled walls. There's gold in them there walls. Lovely, Serbian and Italian culinary gold. That's right. I said Serbian. You're in for a roller coaster ride of freshness and delight. The location rests off of 10th street and accessed from Central. Pull into the gravel parking lot and sit in the small dining area or on their glorious patio. Stays cool even in the summertime! Intermezzo is a small staffed joint that makes everything in house. They don't even have a freezer! They make their own phyllo, mozzarella and salad dressings. It doesn't stop there. Ask your server and they'll be able to tell you ad nauseum on how many fresh items are being churned out of that tiny kitchen. It's ridiculous. So, feeling a bit nervous about trying Serbian cuisine? Never fear! Order the Burek and thank me later. Phyllo filled with cheese and spinach or ground beef. It comes with a house salad, the balsamic reduction and small side of tzatziki-ish cucumber salad. Each bite of the Burek is tender and savory. Mix up the flavors! I take each bite with a bit of salad and the cucumber mixture. Everything swirls with happiness. Best vegetarian lasagna I've ever had. The marinara and ricotta work together like old pals. My goodness these guys make lasagna like I've never had. Out of this world fresh flavors and packed full of zucchini, squash, onions, tomatoes and other veg. Bruschetta. All I can say is GET IT. House made mozzarella and fresh bread, tomatoes, basil. Need I say more? This place packs a punch with their small bar, too. Tons of local beers and plenty of mixed drinks for you to pair with your meal. Great wine list as well. What Italian joint comes sans wine? Not this place. If you haven't made it into Intermezzo yet, you're in for a treat. One of the Charlotte gems that you'll frequent on the regular. Cheers!Intermezzo is one of those gems that didn't catch my eye from the road but word of mouth about their delicious food caught my ear!  My short reasoning for giving Intermezzo 5 stars - a) food is amazing, b) price can't be beat.  My only desire for this restaurant is to update the decor inside, and dust the wine racks.  Other than that, I had no complaints.I went with some friends around 6:30 on a Friday.  We were pleasantly surprised to get a table immediately (only 2 left inside).  The menu made my mouth water.  The selection of appetizers, pizzas and entrees sent me into sensory overload!  Since we were all so undecided, we decided to share.  I was able to sample the Mediterranean Salad, the Grilled Eggplant and the Sauteed Spinach Pizza.  The Grilled Eggplant absolutely surpassed my expectations.  It was perfectly dressed in a basil olive oil, ripe sweet tomatoes, and a dash of balsamic - I could have eaten the whole plate.  Similarly, the pizza swept me off my feet.  I'm from NY, so it's hard to find pizza that can do that!  The dough is fresh, and allows me to fold my pizza (sign of a true NY'er).  All of the ingredients blended together wonderfully.  Last on my food list was the salad.  There was a mix of baby greens, feta, black olives, and we substituted the sun-dried tomato dressing for a balsamic dressing.  It was light and a perfect fit to our meal.The added bonus to the food menu is the martini menu.  Holy freaking cow.  There must have been 20 different choices.  I opted for the Cantaloupe - a refreshing choice it was!  As most martini prices go, they ranged from $9 to $11.  However, there are much cheaper drink options.  My friends opted for the draft beer specials - $3 Stella's!We will definitely be dining in again or taking advantage of their delivery very soon!We have returned to Intermezzo a few times and the Serbian dishes are very good.  The beef burek is very good.  Think of it is a flaky calzone with perfectly seasoned ground beef.  I have also tried the stuffed cabbage (sarma) which was very good.  Additionally, the sandwiches are very good since they make their own bread.   I highly recommend this place and it is reasonably priced too.

I read the other reviews before posting & this place has been treated pretty fairly. It's better than average most of the time.Its a casino cafe with a traditional American menu, cheap prices, good service and its open 24 hrs a day.One of the few casinos cafes still doing graveyard specials @ $3.99 & under. Good steak & Eggs! If your out late this is the spot!The Courtyard Cafe at the Orleans Casino has got to be one spot that any local or tourist come to! As you all know, this city is known as a city that does not sleep, and because we do not sleep as tourists coming here for the first time, or locals who are just plain insomniacs- we come to the Courtyard Cafe to take advantage of the Graveyard Special! Yes, there is such thing! The special consists of the infamous $4.49 Steak & Eggs (with french fries or hashbrowns)!  Along with the steak & eggs, they provide bread and butter, which you also have the choice of what type of bread to eat!  There are also about 3 to 4 things on the graveyard menu, but this is what we all come for!  If you do decide to visit the cafe anytime before midnight, there is a 24 hour special on the double cheese burger, which you can customize to your liking (the rarity to how well-done the meat should be, the type of cheese, and you can also ask for a side of sauteed mushrooms with extra charge, but so worth it!)While staying at Orleans to earn Mandatory Continuing Legal Education credits at a three-day seminar on Managing Use of Force, Diane and I sampled the Courtyard Cafe for the first time.  Not knowing their portion sizes, I ordered Louisiana Style Gumbo AND Hot Roast Beef.  I quickly learned that the gumbo was a meal in itself!  Served in a giant bowl, this tasty, jumbo-sized soup was down and dirty, slow cooked and chock-full of spicy sausage, cuts of chicken, celery, and rice bobbing in the currents of a thick Brown Roux.  But not a speck of seafood was in sight.  A Dinner Salad was graced by excellent hearty French Dressing over bright red Cherry Tomatoes, two types of greens, cucumbers, and croutons.  Numerous cuts of thin Hot Roast Beef slathered in earthy Brown Gravy were good and saucy, although the gravy-topped Mashed Potatoes accompanying the meat were a bit lumpy.  Diane enjoyed her Fish and Chips, which were ample and fairly standard other than being paired with a small Corn on the Cob.    Service was friendly and very good except that a small paper container filled with mayonnaise was mistakenly presented by our server instead of requested butter.  We were both quite full and satisfied when we left our table!3-1/2 stars!My friend and fellow Yelper SueSue and I came here late one night with Piper. I had no idea what a disaster it would have been or we would have went somewhere else. It was very late so we happen to be craving breakfast and where in the neighborhood, literally passing by so we stopped. We all ordered the steak and eggs breakfast which sounded good at the time.First of all the SERVICE sucks! The waiter was as excited about his job as he was to go and have his balls waxed! We will revisit this and the reasons behind it coming up.My meal comes and my toast is burned black, I had asked when I placed my order that my toast please not be burned. Perhaps that is just one of my pet peeves, I just can't do burned toast so I always inform in advance as a courtesy to them and I.My toast is replaced 10 minutes later, sighs. My steak was tough and rubbery, had I not had a steak knife it would have been barbarian style eating this night!My scrambled eggs were overcooked and rubbery, the taste of that bite in my mouth was FOUL. That is another thing  I dislike is over cooked eggs, I am a cook and that is a No No on my list and a mistake that people often make while preparing eggs. So I asked the server if he would replace them for over easy instead. The server comes back later with a plate and fork to scrape the scrambled eggs off of my plate. This was one of the most awkward and weird things that I have encountered in my years of dining. As this is happening for what seemed an eternity, my friends are and I are looking at each other completely buffoon baffled.To make a long story short, the service sucks, the food sucks and this crap house of a café is crossed off of my list!This is by far one of the WORST breakfast meals I have had in my life! Enough said.Steak and eggs.Steak and eggs.Steak and eggs.Steak and eggs.Do you hear that chant? Steak and eggs. For breakfast. Steak? For breakfast? What?!?!?Apparently the locals love it here and they have the cheap deals for them. You can get it for $9 on a weekday. That's still an amazing price.Too bad I came here on a weekday.Located on the first floor of The Orleans Casino, in the back, Courtyard Cafe lets you take in the wonderful smells and scents of .... the casino and the cigarettes. It's not that bad haha. It's just a really wide and open area and there's no wall/barriers, so you can see your Keno bets if you really wanted :PAfter waiting in the line for 15-20 minutes, we finally got a seat in the back (or is it front LOL) and our waiter came over to ask for our drinks. Water. Yes. Water. After that, he took a while to come back to get our orders. Guacamole Bacon Cheeseburger. They have a lot of guacamole in here. Since I had asked for medium rare on the patty, the patty wasn't overdone and hard. It was actually rare and you could taste the juices. The guacamole had a kick to it that I loved (it wasn't spicy per se). The bacon was overdone a little bit more than I would have liked, but it's wasn't to the point where it was burnt and not edible. That was the inside. As an overall taste, though, it was a good size for $9.99 (pretty big) but it was still average to me. I've definitely had better burgers but as my friend would say, this was decent. More than decent. I took out the onion rings because if I hadn't, my big mouth wouldn't have gulped this down. The onion rings were eaten last but they were a bit dry without any... hmm.. BBQ sauce! Or any sauce. So I guess maybe I shouldn't have taken them out? :(You could also get a side and it was fries but definitely ask if they make substitutions! I got hash browns on the side (or potatoes I guess) and I needed ketchup with it. They were lacking saltiess if you ate them solo.I didn't get too much of a chance to eat what present company had (I was pretty filled) but as I sat up and got away the chant returned.Steak and eggs.Steak and eggs.Steak and eggs.Steak and eggs.

Review Text :
Ever since I moved to Las Vegas from California in 2004, I've been looking for Mexican food restaurants that remind me of home. Even though it has always been against my best judgement, I had to settle for the inferior Roberto's. Settle no more. I work at a school up the street from Molcasalsa and surprisingly I never ventured in until yesterday. I ordered a carne asada burrito and 3 rolled tacos with guacamole. While I waited for my order, I filled up ramekins with molcajete, red, and green salsas. My order arrived after a few minutes and I started with the burrito. The beef was tender, the pico de gallo bright and fresh, and the guacamole was silky smooth. I loved the taquitos, too, covered in creamy guacamole and cheese.What surprised me was the restaurant's namesake, the molcajete salsa, was my least favorite part of the meal. However, both the red and green salsas make up for it in the taste and spiciness categories. I'm giving this restaurant 5 stars because the food is great, and great Mexican food is rare in Las Vegas.

day 17 alreadyi think of that song. should i stay or should i go now. if i stay there will be trouble. if i go there will be double. i miss my family already and waking up to an empty house in vegas. maybe i should have stayed in portland longer. but the idea of me staying anywhere too long sounds dreadful and me leaving places seems to upset others. my dad is getting really old...damn i feel worthless today. like i haven't accomplished anything in a while. i'm hungry. i need a burrito. i came here on the recommendation of a friend i am staying with. without jiu jitsu friend and yelp friends i would be really screwed. this place is in an area thats being bulldozed and redeveloped. the inside is typical mexican taco spot. the burritos are huge and cheap! very cheap. i had a chorrizo burrito for breakfast and now i need a nap.

This is why I have stopped eating Chinese food and become a Vietnamese food addict...I have eaten here at least 15 times since they've re-opened and have become quite friendly with Sarah and Bill, the English names of the owners. Bill is a master chef and I am starting to understand why I like Vietnamese cuisine now where before, I just knew that I liked it better than Chinese.First off...the Pho. They really don't serve any seafood pho and I've come to realize by eating at other Vietnamese places that even though I love shrimp, it tends to make a rather flavorless pho and if you used a beef or a chicken base, it would overpower the seafood. So beef pho just makes sense. Their pho is terrific. I found it more useful to get one of the more standard pho rather than the 'spicy' and spice it myself. The thing I've learned is to taste the pho broth before I hit it with any of the toss-ins or sriracha. They seem to sell a lot of pho ga (chicken soup), but I haven't tried that...it would be hard for them to beat my mom's authentic penicillin. I will point out that their Sour Shrimp soup was fantastic but it's not a pho.Next - their bun...It's rather simple and plain - noodles with meat of choice (or shrimp/shrimp paste), optional peanuts and egg rolls, accompanied by the sweet fish sauce. The trick I learned here is that you put the chilies and/or sriracha and/or hoisin sauce into the fish sauce and mix it up and then dump it over the bun and toss it all with the fork and spoon. Without sriracha or chilis, bun is something any child would love. This is the absolute safe choice for anyone eating Vietnamese for the first time.Next - their broken rice...Again, it's rather simple and plain - meat of choice accompanied by rice, sliced pickled carrots and green papaya and surprises not on the menu, an egg, mushroom quiche type concoction that is called xeo (not clear on the spelling here) and some thinly sliced salt pork. The first time I got this, I just consumed and the second time, I started asking about the things I was eating. Clearly there is some genius here. Again, the trick here is to mix the chilis and/or sriracha into the fish sauce so you can distribute it more evenly throughout. There are a wide array of flavors, all very delicate and much more enthusing than any sauce drenched Chinese offering. Each time I order a broken rice dish, Sarah tries to substitute the barbecue pork which I absolutely love but it defeats my intent to try something different each time.I have since discovered that Bill makes vietnamese pancakes (quite tasty) and ox-tail pho (probably too fatty for my tastes). The pancakes are easily the most messy things to try to eat wrapped in a lettuce leaf with cilantro and dripping fish sauce. Utensils clearly don't work here.Here's a tip...sit close to the table and don't wear a new clean shirt. On the plus side, none of it is greasy so it won't permanently stain but between pho noodles, bun noodles, drippy pancakes, it's hard not to leave soiled and happy.

OK. I'm a CenPho snob. A yelp elitist. I admit it. I own it. So when I found out I was going to Peoria for an event, I had already formed my opinion. Cheesey place with cheesey people. God, I love being right! This place is HUGE. Over 14,500 square feet of restaurant, bar, stage and patio space. The event was very disorganized and it was difficult getting a server. I can't knock the restaurant so much for this. And I'll yelp the event seperately. It seems as thoug the food du jour at restaurants everywhere is an upscale macaroni and cheese. And SKYE serves there's with chunks of lobster. Dee lish. Of course you could serve mac n cheese with human toes and I'd still scrape the plate with my fingers. The steak sticks were like skewers of shoe leather. Only leather would have been tastier. The calamari was crisp and tender served with sweet and sour and marinara sauces. Rickie's filet was devoured in seconds. So I'm assuming thumbs up on that. I wasn't feeling the pinot grigio so I switched to chilled Patron and Coronas. Seemed like a good idea at the time. Probably should have stopped drinking before midnight. But. I didn't. I guess if you live out here, this could be a happening place. It just ain't happening for me.After our week in Page, we spent a few nights in Sun City with my Mom and Grandma. Since we were there in summer (which is a rarity for me) I was able to talk Grandma into going somewhere besides the Elephant Bar and a place without having a coupon! As luck would have it, she suggested Skye saying it was a wonderful place and she knew we would enjoy it as an early birthday celebration for my husband. Man oh man was this a great restaurant. Actually it seems like it is half restaurant, half night club and with our 5:30 reservation (yes, this was a "late" dinner for my Grandma), we of course only spent time in the actual restaurant. We were a party of 6 and 4 of us had a cocktail to start. My cosmo was one of the "specials" and was nice and strong for only $6.00. It was the most creative cosmo I have had as it came with a little dry ice in it. Grandma was very happy with her martini and well, no one said much as we drank and perused the menu whilst nibbling on a really good and creative bread basket. My husband and I shared mostly everything and others on the table traded bites. We started with both the Caesar salad and lobster bisque. I was highly impressed with both. The Caesar had homemade croutons and dressing and were very tasty and the lobster bisque was heavenly-not too rich and full of real lobster (even in Arizona!). My daughter had a specialty salad with Gorgonzola and strawberries and loved every morsel. Since I don't eat stinky cheese, I cannot attest to the taste but she keeps talking about the salad. For our entree, Kevin and I shared a bone-in ribeye. This was what 3 of the six(4 if you count me) ordered. My mom had the fish special which was melt in your mouth to die for and my daughter had the filet. The sides are huge and are meant for sharing (like Fleming's or Ruth Chris), so 5 of us shared baked potatoes and mushrooms while the last of our party had the twice baked that no one else got to taste (must have been good).Our steak was incredible and rivals with my memories of Durant's. I savored every cholesterol increasing bite. My Grandma enjoyed hers so much she looked over to me and thanked me for insisting we go somewhere different.Unbeknownst to me, 2 desserts were brought out with candles to celebrate the upcoming birthday of my husband and other part of our party. The desserts were delicious and beautifully presented and since they were "on the house", my Grandma was pleased. I am coming back to the Phoenix area at the end of the month for a couple of nights and am already angling for a reason to come back to Skye...I loved it, I really loved it!

I felt very fancy schmany being in here for lunch.  You definitely receive the the same fancy schmancy service you'd expect too.  I was just very impressed with the whole experience from beginning to end.Trying to stay on the healthy side, I was a little nervous about going to a steak house.  Don't get me wrong, I love me some filet mignon.  And maybe another time, some filet will be had... But for now I had to stay on the safe side.  The soup of the day was lobster bisque.  Darnnit! I love lobster bisque!  That was a hard one to avoid.  So... I ordered that and kept the rest of the meal light.  The lobster bisque was awesome!  A tomato base with a HUGE piece of lobster in the bottom.  NICE surprise!For the main course I ordered the scallops in lemon sauce instead of butter and sauteed greens.  It was a fantastic choice because it tasted yummy and was on the healthy side.  The scallops were a great size, seared and cooked perfectly, with a light lemon sauce.  The greens were also served in the lemon sauce, which made them equally as delicious and flavorful.  I had one tiny tiny bite of their creme brulee cheese cake and it was to. Die. For!  Seriously, if you're going for dessert, any choice is probably going to be a good one considering the choices I heard that day!  I must say again, the service was stellar.  From start to finish everything was taken care of.  The servers were extremely friendly too, and seriously seemed like they enjoyed their job and the food there.  So if you're looking for a fancy schmancy night out with stellar service and food, this is your place!We have dined here many times and brought a guest this time. The atmosphere in the main dining room is very nice as in a warm gentleman's clubby room kind of way. There are great paintings on all the walls including a great one of Mr. Rogers and there are several mounted animal heads high-up on some walls.  Their bread and the selection is very good including the pumpernickel and lavash. They serve butter that is some the best you can get. "European-style" Cultured Butter I would say.From the Bar we ordered a Grey Goose martini with blue cheese stuffed olives perfectly made and the olives were some of the best I have had. The apple martini was weak for some reason but had good taste. With dinner a bottle of Concha y Toro, Marques Casa de Concha 2010 Carmenere went so well with our steaks.To start I had the Wedge salad that was pretty good for sure right up there with some of the best. The lettuce was appropriately extremely cold and crisp. While the blue cheese dressing was good indeed, it could have been a little stronger of the blue for my own taste, but the tomato wedges and the bacon were outstanding. The Onion soup was tasty with a great topping of oozy melted crusty cheese.  We also had Wagyu Beef Carpaccio that I would grade outstanding.Specials of the night are always worth a review and discussion with your server. Tonight, one that sounded great was a preparation of wild pacific salmon, but we were here for the steaks tonight.My dry age strip steak was a very flavorful piece of meat and the tenderloin with porcini sauce and the poached lobster was a super combination, tender and flavorful, decadent perhaps; just great . The filet that we asked to be treated with the Kona was very good. Also at our table we had he porterhouse which was a good size, nicely done and very tasty. To reiterate a bit, we enjoyed good flavor with all the steaks and all were prepared as ordered.Service, first and last was outstanding. Our server's knowledge was just short of encyclopedic. Everything about everything on their menu and anything about all the food and perpetrations she was able to recite.  She was very professional, fast and prompt in an apparent effortless and smooth manner. Wine she knew all about, yes she did. "Oh I think you would want that wine filtered", so she decanted our wine as her own recommendation for what we had. "Not going to finish the wine; want it back in the bottle", not a problem and immediately it was done. They are very busy on the weekends and when we arrived for our 8PM reservation the dining rooms were at 95 percent full. If you arrive without a reservation you might have a chance to eat in the lounge area high tops, bar, or the few tables in the area. If you like great dining and great steak and can afford an upscale price; Capital Grill is worth the occasional experience.My boyfriend and I went here two weeks ago before seeing "Wicked" at the Benedum Center. It's not a place we would normally do dinner unless it's a special occasion. However, since our tickets to the show coincided with Pittsburgh Restaurant Week, we decided to give it a try/see how the other half lives!We were running a little late, so I called to let the restaurant know and was told they could hold the reservation for 15 minutes. When we arrived, were were seated in one of the smaller dining rooms off to the side, with only six tables in it. The atmosphere was not what I expected, with interesting art choices. A huge picture of August Wilson was basically at the table with us, while a painting of cows in a pasture hung across the way and the counter had a strange, brass statue of a falcon. It was museum-esque, almost suffocating. The room was a little too dim for my boyfriend, who doesn't have the best eyesight.  Although I did like that the tiny, battery operated lamps at each table. I wanted to take one home! The rest of the restaurant and bar area seemed more lively and upbeat, so if we go back I would request to sit in the larger, main dining area. One thing that really bothered me was what happened when we were seated. The gentleman brought us to the table and, as he presented us with the special Restaurant Week Menu, said "This menu is a great deal, we usually average over $100 per head," and then he left. His tone was condescending and it made me feel uncomfortable, like I should have felt privileged to be there. It's expensive, dude, I get it. Our server, however, was fabulous. He was knowledgeable and attentive without hovering. The server's assistant, who was also serving our room, was also very polite and kept our water glasses full the entire night--even though we didn't order the fancy cucumber Fiji water like the table across from us. However, I think the uniforms/chef coat things they have their servers and other waitstaff wear are just weird, it didn't really seem to fit the who high-class, 1% vibe they had going on.On to the food! Nom! We each started with a Caesar Salad, which was small, but delightful. The dressing was good, as were the Parmesan croutons. For the entrees, I chose the Seared Citrus Glazed Salmon and my boyfriend got the Bone-In Dry Aged Sirloin Steak (14oz). My salmon was very good, but the real star of the night was the steak. It was seasoned and cooked beautifully, and I had never been more jealous of my partner. (He was nice enough to share a few pieces, though. He's a sweetheart!) With the entrees, we were served sides family style, Sam's Mashed Potatoes and Fresh Green Beans. The green beans were just "eh," but the mashed potatoes were some of the best I've had in a long time. Seriously, so good. When it came time to get dessert, we were slightly bummed as there were only two selections (Flour-less Chocolate Espresso Cake or Cheesecake with Fresh Berries) , while the website said there would be more options. I don't know if this is the fault of the restaurant or the folks who run the Pittsburgh Restaurant Week site. We both went for the cheesecake, but it turned out they had just run out. To our delight, our server allowed us to each get an order of their Classic Crème Brulee, which was also quite delicious. Next time, I really want to try the Strawberries Capital Grille! They sound phenomenal. Wine! The wine list they have here is ridiculous. It is so long! So. Long. It's about 25 times the size of their normal dinner menu. We ordered a white blend that we shared during dinner and it was good.Overall, our experience was nice. That steak. That steak gets 5 stars! As does the service we received from our waiter. I couldn't give the restaurant 5 stars though, because I was put off my the gentleman that seated us and by the atmosphere in the small dining room. I really felt like I needed to whisper, which is hard because I cannot whisper to save my life. I would possibly come here again for a special night out. And maybe this time, I will ask about getting one of those adorable little lamps!Such a great date night!Once we arrived our jackets were taken and we were quickly taken to our reserved booth. (Thanks to the FREE Open Table Android App) Our server Melissa S was great! We told her that we were celebrating a late Valentine's Day and she brought us each a complimentary Champagne Toast. We both had the Adults Only Arnold Palmer as our cocktails. The bread basket featured some really tasty bread to hold us over until our salads came out. We shared a delicious blue cheese and bacon wedge salad. The Applewood smoked bacon really made the salad. I just wish it had a little more blue cheese in the dressing. The wife had the Dry Aged Steak au Poivre (Tender sirloin flavored with black peppercorn) with a side of creamed spinach and I had the Dry Aged Porterhouse with a side Lobster Mac & Cheese. They were both superb! My Porterhouse was cooked perfectly and was extremely tender and juicy. The mac & cheese was delicious and had a good bit of Lobster as well. We both shared the mac & cheese and creamed spinach. The creamed spinach is blended with a béchamel sauce which is good but, a little too salty for my taste.  For dessert we had the Chocolate Hazelnut Cake. So good.The place was pretty packed our entire evening there but, our service never suffered. Our glasses were always full and when finished our plates were also whisked away quickly and without any fuss. Even the valet guys are nice. I'm having my yummy leftovers for lunch as we speak. I couldn't have asked for a better evening!

that's it - I'm moving back to phoenix. All it took was for three local phoenix boys to open the perfect tavern where I can relax on a massive wooden porch with a pint of bass and wax poetic on the merits of the cure and the clash with a friend after work.Rose and Crown is a gorgeous home (formerly circa 1900) turned London pub with a warm atmosphere and *killer* music selected on the jukebox. The music I attribute to one of the owners, Chris, who, I eventually discovered, used to play in a mid-90s local punk band called Plinko. I found this tidbit of info out while eavesdropping on a conversation he was having with a couple that was sitting up at the bar. They were chatting about a 1993 punk show in Phx where Circle Jerks and Skankin Pickle played. I excitedly shouted from across the room, "Punk v. Ska?! I was at that show, too!" turns out the owner's band, the couple, and I were ALL at that show, and now ALL sitting a beautiful wood bar relaxing with our English pints (which are 20 OZ across the pond, btw, not 16)  - did I mention I LOVE THIS PLACE? Deets: It's nestled in Heritage Square - and directly across from Pizzeria Bianco - on a faux street (it was once a street but is now blocked from traffic passing through) with about five other early 19th century homes-turned-restaurant/bar. This really makes for a homey effect. Up a set of stairs and there's plenty of wooden tables and chairs on the enormous front patio (where, I might add, you can actually take your drink to - take that, Roosevelt!). inside is broken up into three rooms off of a foyer. the belly-up portion of the bar itself is kind of small - but there's plenty of high-table seating throughout the two rooms, and a pool table and dart board in the third.Food - didn't try it, but usual English fare; Shepherd's pie, bangers and mash, fish and chips. Happy hour meant $3.50 import pints (again, these are 20 ouncers) of Bass, Boddington's, Newcastle, Guinness, Stella...you get the idea.My one major complaint - the parking. There is absolutely no parking near the bar. There are of course plenty of garages nearby - this is right downtown - but on a game night you get screwed. you can try your luck finding a metered space that doesn't require money after 5 p.m. like I did. But that's not enough to deter me. The owner I mentioned before - who spotted me sitting at the bar alone while I waited for my friend and chatted me up - very much gave the impression that they're just three good friends attempting what every 20-30-somethings dreams about at one point - opening a cool bar. And they did. So go to it.Fail.They serve food till midnight, so we rolled through here at 11 PM on a First Friday. The waiter kept forgetting things we asked for... water, menus, etc. French fries - oops chips - tasted like they had been sitting out for a while. Cool and mushy... not my idea of a good chip.My clam chowder was kind of thin though it tasted OK. It was lacking potatoes. Kinda weird. Ordered a Strongbow cider on tap... and it's flat. Since the server was nowhere to be found, I went up to the bar. Bartender: "Oh the cider is usually a little flat! Don't worry about it!" (WHAAA???) Me: "No - it's really flat. I think my water is fizzier." Turns out it was the bottom of the tap and there's none left, and they aren't opening another till the next day. So no drinkey drinkey for Adam. Fail! Friend ordered some sandwich, she seemed to like it but it didn't look too thrilling to me. So whatevs.The wine list was pretty shallow. Other friend ordered some "fruity tart" type flavored white wine. She said it was "tinny" tasting and not good. Fail.The pool table takes up way too much room such that it's impossible to sit around the wall and not be poked by sticks. After being poked 3x by this daft fool I tapped the back of his cue ball and messed up his shot on purpose, because I was about to get it in the ribs. The paintings of the Queen and Churchill kind of suck, in a 7th grade kind of way. It looks like Queen E's hair is floating slightly above her head. I will not be back!every time i have been to the Rose and Crown it was a quick in and out..kinda like risky sex.the last two visits i was able to experiance this place for more then a quicky and i have to say..i kinda like it. Pros, awesome french dip slider sandwich thingy, Fish and Chips (everyone knows i hate fish, but this was tasty) average beer selection, outside Patio and wrap around seating area.Cons, bathrooms..umm no beuno. specially after a guy dumped a duece..i was forced to breath ass air and it was not a good experiance. another Con is the somewhat inexperiance bar staff. if i ask for a Beamish..i expect the first person to tell me "no we don't have it" not the third person. size..it's kinda cramped on a busy night, and not enough room around the pool table.i would have give 4 stars, but the cons kinda outweighed the pros.specially since my nose hairs are still curled from the experiance. but i doubt that is a every day occurance..

Ive been meaning to come here and finally made it out Friday night with Daniel!  I consider him the sushi expert, and was finally ready to see what all the hype was about.We came in Friday night and the place was dead.  I mean not a soul but one guy sitting in the corner.  Where was everyone?  We sat down and the server came right over and gave us our menus and took our drink orders.  They seem to have a decent drink menu here and we both ordered chocotinis.  The drinks came out and they were tasty!  YUM!!  Anyways, we ended up ordering some food, and whatever we did end up eating was delicous!  (Daniel the expert did the ordering knowing that I am new to this.  We did a few different things and they were delicious.)Place is cute and well decorated.  Being a novice to this, I was happy with the taste and display of the food that we ate.  I really had a good time here.  As the night went on, we did end up seeing more people come into the resturant,  but that wasn't for a while.Service was great, and overall I had a good experience.  Will return in the future.YAY for another good find!!! Saketini has great service, wonderful chill atmosphere and a large food/drink menu. They have seating at the sushi bar, seating at the regular bar and then also table seating. They have daily deals..yesterday (Monday) was 1/2 off sake bombers..can i get a WHOOP WHOOP?!?They have an extensive sushi menu with both cooked and raw sushi.  We tried the Firecracker and they even let us add avocado into it. It was baked to perfection and we absolutely loved them. If you're not a huge raw sushi fan there are multiple options that consist of cooked sushi and whoever is serving you will be more than happy to suggest what you might like best. They also have a full non-sushi menu as well.  Shrimp tempura and edamame were delicious as well.Four rounds of sake and three plates all for $37 duckets!Check Saketini out !. Good food, service and atmosphere. You will find a deal that will work with you.. happy hour or reverse happy hour ,you 're bound to find something that will fill your belly with deliciousness and a drink that will warm ya up!My friend and I finished a workout and realized we were hungry and craving sushi.  We were frantically trying to find a place to eat sushi that was open late.  First of all, there aren't that many great sushi places in the Valley, simply because the fish is not fresh like any of the coastal states.  We were still on a mission.Saketini's was open pretty late so we made stop over here.  We got a sashimi platter, albacore with crab roll, and a few other things.  The albacore with crab roll (forgot name) was very delicious.  Some of the sashimi peaces were good, but some were not as great.Overall, we got our fix of sushi at a very late hour.  One thing that drops the rating of the restaurant is we got an automatic 20% tip added on.  We were only a party of two.  I usually leave a pretty good tip, but I do not like it when a restaurant mandates a tip.  A tip is something I feel is up to the customer based on his experience."I think that without sushi, there would be no David Hasselhoff because sushi is like the perfect way of describing the insides of David Hasselhoff. He is like a protein, clean and easy. That's how I feel about myself." ― David HasselhoffThis place is decent.  Friendly staff, ample seating, open until 2AM, there's a karaoke room, et cetera.  They even have a generous amount of time allotted for Happy Hour and Reverse Happy Hour.  Too bad the rolls are small and mediocre for the price they're asking.  I mean $7 for barely any salmon skin?  You're kidding me, right?  And $7 for a cocktail with barely any booze makes this girl sad.  Oh well.  I only come here when out-of-state and out-of-country friends want to mingle.

Awwwhhh, I LOVE this place!Part of what I love about Yelp and being a part of the Yelpyness is discovering little places off the beaten path. Sure, I will occasionally get my McDee's Sausage McMuffin on or even crack for the Endless Shrimp deal at Red Lobster, but what I love more than anything are the little mom and pop's, the hole in the walls and places like Palatte.When we headed over here today, I honestly thought my friend got lost. Hey, it's her town and what do I know, I am just visiting, so you will hear no backseat driver antics out of me. Finally we pulled up to this little house in the middle of a residential area and voila...brunchtastic fun at its finest.I don't even want to venture a guess at how crowded this place must get on the weekends judging by how busy it was at 11:30 on a Friday, but if you have the patience, definitely stop in here. The atmosphere is great, the people working here are super cool, the cooks have tats (yay!) and the food is awesome!I ordered the Potato, which basically translates to eggs, bacon, caramelized onions, gouda cheese and fresh fruit and yummy lightly buttered sourdough toast. It was just like something you'd make at home...if you were a really good chef and awesome :) Tasty, filling, but didn't have me feeling that after breakfast lull like most brunch places can.If I lived in Phoenix this would be a must stop and quite often. Definitely check this out! You will love it!!Let's just say I am absolutely charmed and enchanted with Palatte! Can you actually have a crush on a restaurant? I have never, ever, in my entire life, loved a place so much that I actually wanted to move in to it!  That's how much I love Palatte!From the hospitality (one of the owners met us at the door and graciously pointed out the menu and ordering procedure) to the food, everything was spot on! Finding it neither pricy nor pretentious, even my husband, who was very skeptical of going on yet another Yelp inspired dining adventure, was also impressed!Arriving at 11ish on a Saturday morning, the crowd was lively and not too large, which made my husband very happy, as he hates to wait. After reviewing the very inspired and delectable menu, we got in line to place our order (short line, nice people!). The young lady who assisted us at the counter was absolutely delightful and after a few quick questions, we decided on the Lemon Crme French Toast, bacon, Tahitian vanilla yogurt, Melted Tomato Tarte, Iced Tea and Lemonade.We paid for our order and wandered out on to the expansive and inviting patio to find our place in the sun, and to my husbands delight (he hates the sun!) there was a lovely table for two on the patio with a great view of the courtyard and a pleasant distance from the guitarist who was unobtrusively entertaining the guests. We took our seats and continued to enjoy the morning.First to arrive were our beverages, which were both good, but unremarkable. After a few moments, our server appeared with our entrees. My husband really enjoyed his French Toast (coconut, lemon curd and blackberries.... yummy!) and remarked that although this was the first time he had ever had French toast without syrup, it was very, very good on it's own (with the lemon curd, of course) and didn't need any syrup. His bacon, like the beverages, was also unremarkable (we were hoping for something like they serve at Matt's) but it was tasty and not overcooked (a pet peeve of mine).My Melted Tomato Tarte was so darling, it was almost too cute to eat! The crust was light and flaky and the egg and bits that comprised the tarte were heavenly, although a few bites struck a sour note when what tasted like Dijon mustard had been mistakenly baked into the tarte. But since the rest of the tarte was awesome, and only two small bites struck that odd note, I let it pass without comment. The Tahitian vanilla yogurt was very creamy and flavorful, but had way too many sliced apples on top for my liking (a French thing, maybe?)Earlier, while waiting for our breakfast, I wandered back into the little shop that is part of the interior of the home and met a delightful young lady who was wrapping up little packets of silverware and napkins with bits of string. She was expecting and was actually past due, trying to pass the time while awaiting the arrival of her little girl, Ruby. I wished her many blessings and went back to join my husband at our table and enjoy the lovely surroundings.The guitarist was a very pleasant surprise as well. Although he looked a bit like a folky Joey Ramone, his sound and range were simply amazing! He really added to the ambiance and we found ourselves staying longer than we had planned because he was really that good! Armed with nothing more than his guitar, mic and small amp, his catalogue included smashingly good renditions of Harry Connick's Don't Get Around Much Anymore, John Mayer's Waiting for the World to Change and my favorite, the Gilberto, Jobim and Getz version of The Girl from Ipanema.... wow, that made my whole weekend!Later, as I decided to use the WC to wash my hands before we enjoyed the rest of the day, I ran in to the same young lady who took our order and mentioned how much we enjoyed our morning at Palatte and how darling everything (including the bathrooms) were and she told me that the whole place was conceived, designed and brought to life by the owner, Christine, who was trained in France and had a passion for what she did. She offered to introduce me to Christine, who she said, was just outside passing the time until her baby arrived. I told her that we had already met (even though I didn't know she was the owner at the time) and would be sure to let her know how much we enjoyed our morning. By the time we were done chatting, Christine was gone, so perhaps she was off to meet Ruby for the first time...which will give us yet another reason to go back to Palatte! Palatte was just such a pleasant surprise from the food and the servers to the atmosphere and the entertainment; I still just want to move in!! Even the toilet paper was soft!! I so heart this place and will be back again soon. Christine and Ed have done an excellent job in making their dream a reality and have created a little slice of  rustic French countryside for us to enjoy right here. They got every detail right and I will continue to call Palatte home (at least on Saturday Mornings!)Nothing like waking up at 5:30 am the day after an OYE... (not fun, and boy was I exhausted!)The good thing about taking Colleen C to the airport bright and early this morning was that I planned ahead and scheduled a breakfast meeting at Palatte.  And now, after a couple of cups of coffee and an incredible breakfast, I feel like a new person.I definitely recommend Palatte on a weekday morning - no wait, fast, attentive service, and yummy food!  I'm actually still hanging out here working as the atmosphere is perfect for just that - hanging out!  I had a chance to chat with Ed and Christine, the owners, and fell in love with Palatte even more this visit than last time.  I think they are still ironing out the kinks as it's only been 3 weeks since their transition to full table service, but they are kicking ass so far.  I can tell they get plenty of regulars, and I would be one also if I lived in the hood.  The house they are located in is fabulous - comfortable, welcoming, and homey - tons of character which is sometimes hard to find in this city.The Bev (sauteed spinach, tomato slices, and avocado) is what I ordered - and I love that they do it with egg whites for only $1 extra.  I chose whole wheat toast and fruit and it was exactly what the doctor ordered this morning!I can't wait to come back for lunch sometime soon, as their sandwiches, salads and tartes sound awesome from their menu descriptions, but it will be hard to tear myself away from the many breakfast items that are oh so amazing.  I guess I'll just have to come back again and again to make my way through the variety of selections.  A few more tidbits I noticed while hanging at Palatte today: **the bathroom is CLEAN!  So much so that I noticed... **with the check, you are given Bazooka bubble gum - who doesn't love Bazooka?!**they are planning some cool wine / cheese / live music events for upcoming first and third Fridays.****Note to self (and to all of you): Palatte is closed on Monday!  (I guess Ed and Christine need a day off also).

It's a hit or miss with this place. Sometimes you get great service and sometimes you don't. Every time we walk in the hostess usually just stares. The servers all suck at their job. I'm a server, I know what good service is. Our server was horrible! She literally walked up to our table chewing food, she stopped taking my friends order so she can yell across the patio to some friends driving pass us. Oh and don't let me forget to mention that she was playing with her hair brushing it with her fingers in front of us! Then serving us our food. This place is a joke, service is a joke. It's so bad that I know if I asked to speak to a manager the manager would have probably done nothing about it. However Unless I find a place with better wings I will be back but sitting on the bar. I always get better service from the bartenders. So heres a note to management. Retrain your servers or get a new serving staff!

Wow.  What an awesome experience we had.  We went during the middle of the week and it was pretty dead inside.  Thankfully, I didn't make a reservation for our first visit.  I would have looked like a dork.Fiamma doesn't look like much from the outside, but I had heard and read good things about it, so I wanted to give it a shot.  Once inside, it's very nicely decorated and, for lack of a better word, "quaint."We were greeted promptly at the door by the manager (I'm assuming) and then again at our table by our server.  Everyone was super-friendly.  Our server ran down the list of specials.  It took him about five minutes, there were so many.  My mouth watered more and more as he went on and on.  We ordered our wines and two appetizers.  One was a Buffalo mozzarella with tomatoes and the other was a platter of fried calamari, shrimp, and zucchini.  I liked that they had this option of a combo appetizer platter.  It allowed us to try a variety of fried goodies (covered in a light tempura batter).  The marinara sauce that accompanied it was delicious, too.  It was very thick and flavorful.  No Ragu here!The bread they brought out was fantastic, too.  It was thick, moist, and hearty, and tasted even better dipped in their homemade pesto dip.  Mmm...we couldn't stop eating the slices...and then they brought more!  After two apps and two helpings of bread, we were already full.  Then, of course, the entrees came (after a little lime/lemon sorbet to cleanse the palate!).   It was tough to choose an entree from the menu, though, because nothing was average-sounding.  Everything sounded exquisite and was a gourmet take on traditional Italian entrees.  I wanted to try them all.  I love not finding traditional spaghetti or ravioli on an Italian menu!  I finally went with the black linguine with shrimp, covered in a spicy red tomato sauce.  It was definitely spicy and definitely delicious.  My partner went with my other option, which was a linguine with a cream sauce and a variety of items sprinkled throughout it.  It, too, was very delicious; it was very creamy and flavorful.   We didn't have one disappointing food item.  Everything tasted so fresh and authentic.  And, again, the service was fantastic.  At the end, because the restaurant was so slow I think, our server even brought us a complimentary glass of their homemade limoncello drink.  I was excited since I've never had limoncello before.  It made for a tasty, sweet ending to our delicious meal and excellent experience.  We were SO full the rest of the evening, but it was SO worth it.  Fiamma was fantastic.  We can't wait to go back...but will probably eat less!  Well...maybe not.I went to Fiamma on a double date last night - and overall it was a really great time!  We were greeted immediately upon entering and the decor of the place was really quite charming.  The waitress was very on top of the specials and recommended a very good white wine for the table.  We ordered 3 appetizers and all were piled high with food and tasted amazingly good.  For the main course, I ordered a pounded chicken over potatoes and caramelized onions.  The potatoes and onions were great, but I wasn't too excited about the chicken - it was good, but it definitely wasn't mind blowing or anything like much of the rest of the meal.  Everyone at the tabled seemed to really enjoy the overall experience as well as all of the different foods that we were able to try.  This would be a great place to take someone on a date - moderately priced, quiet, low level lighting, easy to find - overall a solid 4 star experience for me.I'm surprised I haven't been here sooner. After reading the rave reviews over the past year, my husband and I finally choose to dine at Fiamma for a date night. It's tucked away in a shopping center area among a few other popular restaurants. Parking can get tight since this little area draws the hungry crowd. From the host, to the server, and the rest of the wait staff we felt truly special. I felt like the server took pride in serving. I really appreciated that. The server listed off quite a mouthful of specials...hard to keep track. Perhaps providing a nightly list with descriptions would be helpful because after the third special, I could't take it all in. Each item on the menu sounded delicious and everything is made in house. I love fresh!The only thing that made me frown was that there were no side salad prices on the menu (or we completely missed it) and when we got the bill they were near $8 each...for a side salad! Granted, the salad was delicious and the service was fantastic (that's how we made sense of why it was so pricey). The rest of the food was excellent and seemed to measure up to what we expected to pay per entree. Added bonus is not feeling rushed. In fact, they bring out sorbet to cleanse your palate before you main entree. The ambiance is dim and intimate, which allows for easy conversation (which is great for a date or if you have company). Also, the dress code may not be absolutely dressy, but I wouldn't feel comfortable wearing really casual attire. We will definitely come back!Oh Fiamma will you marry me??? Just promise to cook for us every day!! What a gem this place is, so cozy and quaint. From the homemade pesto, sorbet between courses, waiters that can barely speak English... The calamari app was so unusual with avocado (we got it sauteed instead of deep fried and it was so delish!) I had the pasta with chicken and sun-dried tomatoes and my friend got the fettuccine with mushrooms...Unreal meal. So full at the end of the meal we could not eat dessert but they brought us some complimentary homemade limoncello already cant wait to go back!!!I was a bit hesitant to write a review on Fiamma....mostly because my first (and only as of now) experience was during Charlotte Restaurant Week (CRW). But, alas, I believe CRW is a huge opportunity for restaurants to shine. And in a sink or swim kind of world, Fiamma floated. First off, hubs and I had a bit of an ordeal with our reservation. As soon as the dates of CRW were announced, I called Fiamma one early January afternoon and made a reservation. Moments later I realized the guy on the phone never took down the time. Hubs called back a few days later and confirmed the date and time - which were never written down in the first place. Because of the inconsistencies we called a few hours before our reservation to confirm the exact time (as we never received a confirmation phone call, etc) and we're pretty much told - yeah, come on in around 7 or 7:30. Um, ok. Nevertheless, we walked into a very busy restaurant and sat immediately at a table next to the door. Chilly in January, I say! It's important to note that the CRW menu had a plethora of choices for each course...lovin' the variety. Here's a breakdown of the meal and service:Bread basket & oil: 5/5: I have to mention the bread & olive oil mixture because they were slammin'. Freshly baked in house and different varieties.Delizia Contadina: 3/5: Mixed greens with pears, spicy walnuts and Tuscan pecorino cheese sticks. This lightly dressed salad was nice and refreshing but the dressing was a little tart for my taste. Regardless, it was a nice size and a decent start.Ravioli of the Day: 2/5: The CRW feature was fresh lobster and shrimp ravioli in spicy tomato sauce. I took major issue with this dish. It was so, so bland - I didn't taste any spice whatsoever. And the filling within the ravioli was pretty inconsistent - it varied from a delicious lobster mix to a fishy shrimp mix. I appreciate they make the pasta in house, but this dish let me down.Tortino Al Ciccolato: 4/5: You can always get me with chocolate. While I expected more of a baked torte, this little nugget came out as a mini lava cake. The flavors were nice and rich. I would have liked a bit more ice cream, though! Service: 3/5: It started off really well - our server was attentive, helpful and efficient. But as soon as we had our salad course, it really fell off. Now, I'm sure he was super busy considering CRW and the full restaurant we were dining in. However, we waited at least 35-40 minutes between our salad course and our main dish...and we only saw our server once in that time increment. You may think I'm being nitpicky, but when you shell out a bunch of cash (yes, well over the $30 per person), you hope for nice service. Fiamma was a fine meal, but not the great meal I was hoping for. I will absolutely give them another try when they aren't overworked during CRW. Hoping my next visit will leave me more enchanted than the last.Awful!  One of my worst restaurant experiences.  This is my first review in yelp, and I probably wouldn't be writing it if the manager would have been more professional.  But that will come later in my review.  To start, the service in general was awful.We got 3 appetizers which were ok.  but the jumbo scallops, although cooked well, were not jumbo.  The other appetizers were ok nothing to go back for.Our main courses is another story.  First, we got the lamb chops which were quickly returned for being overcooked.  It is also important to mention super tiny.  We also got a posts dish with chicken, also overcooked.  The third dish we got was the grilled seafood.  The scallops were ok, everything else overcooked and chewy.  The fourth meal was pasta with crab.  This dish was just tasteless.After returning the lamb dish they did try and make another one.  This time some random asparagus appeared on the plate with some overcooked lamb. the chicken dish was just returned and not replaced.The manager did come out to apologize when he came back from running errands.  My friends and I believe the tip is based on service.  Usually it is 20%.  But the food and service was so bad we left 5%.  The manager picked up the check on our way out and yelled to us "thanks guys, that was really nice".  Maybe instead of yelling at us he should do his job and manage his staff to ensure guests have a good experience and want to come back.I guess the good thing that came out of this is that I will start writing reviews on yelp.  Hopefully the rest of them are how great my experience was.I'm having a tough time reviewing Fiamma - I think it aspires to be more than it actually is, and despite my inherent desire to love this place, something just seems off.  Atmosphere: Fiamma is located in a rather non-descript shopping center that is also home to Ru San's and Fran's Filling Station (along with Run for your Life and a wine store).  The interior layout is kind of awkward, with many tables in a small footprint and not much privacy between parties.  The back half of the restaurant is very crowded, with tables along one hallway wall and the bathroom door basically being a 5th chair at the back table.  If one were to squint, the bathrooms might seem "quaint" or "authentic trattoria," but in reality, I think they probably deserve a good scrub and new coat of paint.Food: I wanted to like this place so badly that I went back the following night after a less-than-enthusiastic Restaurant Week meal.  Meal 1: I had the soft-shell crab appetizer and found it overly fishy and pokey (yes, pokey); the lamb shank was also disappointing, as I thought it was a bit fatty (although the side of gnocchi that came with it was downright delightful); that was followed up with the chocolate tart dessert that was more lava cake consistency than firm tart, but it was a pleasant surprise.  Meal 2: I ordered the beef carpaccio as my appetizer, and was shocked by the amount of parmesan cheese that accompanied the plate - two of the largest slices of parm I've ever seen were atop my arugula and beef.  For my entree, I ordered the black linquini with seafood and was in love with the tomato sauce kick and flavors.  Having already experienced the wonder of the chocolate tart, I knew I didn't want anything else and ordered it for the second time in 24 hours (although I had tried the tiramisu and ricotta cheesecake from others at the table and those were good as well).  So, night 1 was an unexpected letdown, but night 2 held up to my high expectations.  The breadsticks and foccacia that started the meal were like a carbohyrate dream, topped with homemade pesto olive oil.  And the one person who ordered wine received a (very) healthy-sized pour.Service: If you consider Restaurant Week an opportunity to introduce your resturant to a new clientele, I would assume you would want to represent the experience in the most normal and typical way possible.  I was shocked when we asked to see a regular menu (we'd just been given Restaurant Week menus) and were told the special menu was the only one they were doing.  However, they did fulfill a special order (doing a full entree of gnocci instead of as a meat accompaniment) when our table's vegetarian balked at only 1 veggie entree out of 9 options.  Finally, I would have expected our extra wine glasses to be removed once we declined wine, but they remained crowded on our table for a good 5+ minutes until we pushed them together and out of the way to the edge of the table (minor in the scheme of things, but an annoyance).  Price: Given that we were there during Restaurant Week, we were anchored to a $30 price point.  Especially on night 2, I was very pleased with the quality and value that I received, and a quick look at prices on their website seem incredibly reasonable for a typical meal.  Most likely, I'd return to Fiamma, but I just can't shake the doubt in the back of my mind that it's not as great as it should be.I have been to Fiamma twice and both visits were during Restaurant Week.  From the outside, I was very unimpressed.  It's located in a strip mall that offers no pzazz.  Once inside, however, the ambiance is intimate, warmly lit, and romantic.  Most of the tables are separated but there are a few that are connected by one long booth seat.  Unfortunately, this is where my party of 3 was sat.  Even more uncomfortable was that the table was actually comprised of 2 separate small tables covered by a table cloth.  It was notably a tight space.  Thankfully we overcame our discouraging seating situation by ordering wine.  The pours were generous and the prices ranged from $6.00 to $9.00 per glass.  It was quite reasonable. In addition to some wine, we also ordered food off of the restaurant week menu.  My first item was sauteed sea scallops in a cauliflower puree topped with mushrooms.  It was simply delectable.  I would order this as an entree if I could.  My second item was a pacific white fish served with two sauteed potatoes and white asparagus covered in a caper sauce.  It was a nice dish but it didn't knock me off my feet.  I felt the fish could have been a bit more moist but the flavors were tasty!  Lastly, we all ordered and sampled each others dessert.  The creme brulee took the first place ribbon.  It was a generous portion topped with delicious berries.  The ricotta cheesecake was a runner up.  It was light and did the trick to hit my sweet spot.  However, if you are a cheesecake lover and like the rich, creamy  versions - this would not be your pick!The service we received was adequate but not superb.  I had a much better waiter the first time I visited.  There were a few times I found my eyes wandering to see if I could get his attention.  Additionally, only 2 out of the 3 entrees were brought out together.  One of my friends had to wait a few minutes before hers arrived.  It certainly didn't ruin the meal but it's always nice begin eating your dinner at the same time.  Overall, Fiamma did not earn a 5 star review but I would return.  I enjoyed the atmosphere and they have some great dishes.  There are just some areas that could be tweaked to make the overall experience more enjoyable.This is the best Italian I've had outside of Little Italy in New York City.My bride and I have been regulars at Fiamma for just under four years now.  Each and every time, we request Yoshi as our server.  He's knows the food and wine menu inside and out and can easily guide you to your likings.  May I recommend the Il Poggio Sangiovese (Red Italian Wine)... It's our go-to.  The house-made pesto and focaccia bread is insanely good and is a complimentary item.If you like basic Italian, there are dishes that will keep it basic and knock your socks off.  My recommendation under this would be the Papardelle Bolognese.  It's a fantastic meat sauce featuring their housemade pasta.  It's simple yet slammed full of flavor.  Even better, it's only $13.  Why on earth would anyone go to Olive Garden or something of that nature when for a few dollars more, you can have fresh and high quality food.If you like things a little different or more authentic, there are a host of options for you.  My key favorites would be the Osso Bucco with Risotto, Tagliatelle d'Alba, or a fish special.  Great finishers would include the Panna Cotta (creamy, fresh fruit, light) or Tortino al Cioccolato if you are like me and require chocolate as a final bite!If you haven't had Fiamma, you are missing out.  I highly recommend you visit.  It's one of the best values in Charlotte.I'm not much of an Italian food fan boy, but Fiamma is definitely one of the more understated powerhouse restaurants when it comes to the well-executed Italian fare in Charlotte. Made it in on a weeknight for a semi-late dinner and had a fantastic time. We skipped the drinks this time around, but they had a rather extensive wine menu. The focaccia and pesto they start you with is phenomenal. I'm a huge proponent of good focaccia and Fiamma's recipe is perfect. I barely have words for how good that pesto was. Fresh, aromatic, and strong. The smaller breadsticks in the bread basket were a nice touch as well. Entrees were stellar. I stepped out on a limb and ordered the veal chop, which was the special for the evening. Side of gnocchi and a killer red wine reduction. The veal chop was tender and packed with flavor. Stuffed with spinach and onions and each bite was better than the last. While hugely different than what my typical order would be, I was very pleased. The gnocchi....man. So good. Subtle, chewy, sweet with the tomato sauce and fresh herbs, and a perfect combo with the chop. I'd order that as a side dish again in a heartbeat. What really set this place apart from other eateries was the service. Our server was one of the most professional I've had in a long time. He knew the menu like a second language and offered great input. Also, being served some comp limon cello at the end of a meal is always a nice touch! Great flavor and super strong. They also had live music while we were there. The guy had some serious talent and really set the mood. Really looking forward to heading back in for a special occasion or date night.Ecuadorian on Italian (I think)... Today I wanted Itailian Food without the Italian 'tude, if you know what I mean and knew I would be safe here... This was my first Lunch here, I've been a few times for Dinner and it is always a five star experience... Really I never think of this as a Lunch place... NOW I will remember it is a Lunch place, it's a Deal, it's a Steal, if fact I do not want to tell you so I can keep my table! Most of the pasta is made In-House and you can tell...This Bread Tastes like it is made In-House!  The Sauce I Chose today was Bolognese, their version has Beef, Veal and Pork and is NOT Creamy YAY!!!  Lasagna - I'm unable to read menus more than a few words long... Cheese Browned on top, thin layers on flat Pasta, thin layers of Cheese and MEATY Bolognese!Sit down and they bring you the most unique version of Pesto I have seen... More than half Olive Oil the rest you know about : Pinenuts, Basil, Parmesan and maybe some Garlic, though just a little... Thin Bread sticks and Thick DENSE Bread that makes me want to visit a Bakery that makes it like this!!! (Yelpers tell me of a Bakery that does Bread like this - PLEASE)!Lemon Sorbet for Dessert!  Very Nice!  Wish I knew how to photograph it!Zagat Rated 2012, 2013Service is always GREAT!!! No Italian 'tude!!!Three Italian places left to review before I move to Raleigh... Today it was Fiamma

I'm not the type of person who lets one bad experience ruin a restaurant, I know that sometimes people make mistakes and running a restaurant can't be easy.I went here 3 TIMES, and every time something bad happened.First time I went here, food was good if not expensive, but immediately afterwards I felt a sharp pain of sickness to my stomach. Let's end the story there.Second time, food was alright with no "incidents" until my friend discovered a long black hair in his food. That's flavour country!  OK, so it's one hair - NOPE, there's another friendly hair in his food! The guy working there refuses to give a refund, only offering more of the same food that had made my friend feel like throwing up after his nice discovery. Good business!OK, Basil Thai - you get one more try. I go there and my other friend orders Basil Chicken which is made with "ground chicken." Upon receiving the order, we notice the chicken is "ground" into pieces of the size of bacon bits, not to mention there was barely any of these "chicken bits." So, we ask for more chicken, since it's a chicken dish, and the same douchebag refuses, saying we should pay for more chicken and that it's "our fault" for not reading the description. He refuses to give a refund because "we already paid for it." What the fuck? How exactly would you get a refund if you haven't paid for something in the first place? Genius! No reason to go here, if you crave Thai food - make it yourself and save yourself assholish service and high prices.

Had lunch with my Mom here last week.  It has been over a year since our last visit.  It is a restaurant/video poker bar.  The restaurant is on the left side of the building.  We were pleased to see that it was still kept well and clean.  Many video poker bars in Vegas go downhill rapidly.After taking our drink orders, the server told us the Lunch Special was Buy One Burger, Get One FREE.  We decided to go for the Special and ordered a BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger and a Montana Peppercorn Burger.After a short wait the server brought out our food.  I should have paid closer attention to the menu because the Montana Peppercorn Burger was served open-face with Gravy smothered all over the Burger & Fries.....not exactly what I wanted, but that was my bad.  Mom wasn't that hungry, so she was nice enough to trade with me....so I had the BBQ Bacon Burger.  The Burger was pretty good, not great....the Onion Rings that were served as toppings for the Burger were great.  The Steak Fries that came with the Burger were awesome.....they were cooked just right so that they weren't too soft or soggy.....which happens a lot with Steak Fries....they made it just right.Mom couldn't finish the Gravy smothered Burger, so I had a couple of bites....I didn't really care for it....I'm not a fan of Gravy unless it's with Turkey & Stuffing.  I could barely taste the Peppercorn Burger under that Gravy and Grilled Onions.Overall, it  was an ok lunch.  Will I return?  Yes, but not for the Gravy Burger.Did I ever mention I love this place so much?????----- maybe NOT because I couldn't find my reviews here. However, Yes, I do. I do love MMC 100% for sure ( I mean their lunch special )!What I still remember is that they provide LUNCH SPECIAL for ALL burgers, salads, sandwiches and wraps $5.95 $5.95 $5.95.What I still remember is that I usually order:1. Filet mignon salads2. Turkey wrap3. Chicken caesar wrapAlso my co-workers always have:1. Walnut chicken salads2. French dip3. Burger --- sorry! I'm not a really real burger fan, so I couldn't remember their names, but you can ask for it :)One one one thing I need to mention: PLEASE DO NOT GO DURING 12:00-1:00PM because it's going to wait at least half hour for just order your food. Their service is kind of slow. Oops! Do I say their slow? Yes, they are..... but Filet mignon salads without onion is my best dish. I'm here just for it.... worth it! P.S.: you will meet many of G4s during lunch hour  :)I used to come here all the time, and it was awesome. Then they changed bartenders... Here's what happened.Came in with a few friends around 3AM on a Friday night. We were all a little tipsy but wanted to stay close to home so we made this our choice of bar. The bartender took about 15 minutes to come over, my friend actually had to shout out "excuse me" to get his attention. Normally i would make an excuse for a bartender not noticing someone sit at the bar, but he had to literally buzz us in since it was after midnight. When we ordered our drinks he then went over to the group he was chatting up prior to us "interrupting" him. 15 minutes later he brings us over our beers. No reason this should have taken so long. But we were gaming so my other two friends didn't really notice.It then took us several attempts at getting another round. when we finally succeeded we decided we would go somewhere else. We had gamed a total of 280$ between the 3 of us and each had 2 drinks. We asked for our bill and when we received it we noticed not a single drink was comped. I'm not one for complaining when i don't received something comped but that is ridiculous. We paid our bill and still left a 10$ tip. My friend also asked the bartender for a pack of cigarettes but we noticed it wasn't on the bill so we figured he just didn't charge her. When we were leaving we walked out the door and out comes the shouting bartender. "Excuse me!!! You guys didn't pay for those cigarettes." My friends laughed, threw him a 20$ and we left.The only reason I'm giving 2 stars instead of one is because I hope to return to this bar and see another bartender. But until then... this will be my review.I'll start by noting that a big part of this relatively positive review is because of the excellent service by our waiter. Aside from that the food was nothing to write home about.My friend and I came in around 7 craving burgers. We decided to split a pastrami patty melt and a BBQ bacon burger, one with fries and the other with onion rings for good measure. I sampled the BBQ bacon burger first and was not excited in the least. I commented to my friend that it tasted just like a bacon western burger only four times the price. A few seconds later our server came by to check on us and commented about how much she likes the BBQ bacon burger because it tastes like a western bacon cheeseburger. Guess I was right! I didn't care for the BBQ said very much so I stuck with the pastrami patty melt, which was decent. The fries and onion rings were a lackluster way to round out our meal.Service was excellent and friendly, but there wasn't much else to make me want to return.

Holy God, I should have checked the reviews before eating here. Because of my tragic inability to read a map, I apparently walked to the completely wrong end of the Atrium in search of Salsaritas. Near some other unsavory selections, this seemed to be the quick & easy choice.I'm no stranger to food court Chinese. In fact, I used to look forward to stopping in the mall with mom and brother to cheaply nibble on the toothpicked free samples of sweet & sour chicken before buying a plate and splitting it three-ways. Americanized Chinese food is comfort food in a way. Dependable, affordable, tasty.This was none of those things. I went for the two-item dish which comes with rice (no white rice or brown rice option; only fried). I chose General Tso's and Beef & Broccoli. Both were dished up in IDENTICAL sauces. Let's call it Brown Sauce. Brown Sauce has no flavor. And it's cornstarched to hell, so it's thick and blubbery like day-old gravy. Brown Sauce has no business being on General Tso's Chicken. Brown Sauce made me embarrassed FOR my food. I ended up dumping half my meal... and I never do that.I love CLT's classy atrium, but can't recommend this dining option. If you need me, I'm brushing up on my cartography.

Review Text :
I have eaten lunch at August Henry's several times while working downtown.  The food was always pretty tasty.  I never had an issue of not liking what I ate, but I seemed to always have an issue with getting my food in time to make my hour lunch break not run over.  Even going during off lunch hours (like after 2pm) we have waited 30+ minutes for our fare.  This part I have never been a fan of, especially when several times I was there with a friends and there was literally no one else in the dining area.  The servers though I have never had any particular issues with rudeness or anything, have a very lax perspective to urgency.  I went before with a friend and the bartender/waitress came over to our table about 5 minutes after we sat down for drink orders and disappeared for 25+ minutes after that.  No one at the bar, no one in the dining/bar area.  It felt odd.  When she finally came back our food was still not in sight.  We had to yell across the empty restaurant to get refills.  When she came we asked how long until or food, she said a few minutes.  When she finally did bring our food, sandwiches mind you, about 40+ minutes had passed and we needed to book it back to work.  We asked for our bill and boxes.  So there is that, I don't really recommend coming here if you are on a strict time limit.My last visit here was just for drinks.  My one friend is moving to Houston so we did one slightly crazy night bar hopping and August Henry's was second on the list due to one member of our party holding strong that they have an abundance of beers on tap.  When we got there it was pretty busy.  We luckily found a few seats at the bar and sat down.  It took a while to get anyone to wait on us.  I know it was busy but here is the weird thing.  Me and my husband order while he is getting our drinks my friends are talking about what they want.  He took my card brought our drinks and disappeared!  My other two friends sat without a drink for several minutes before he returned.  Thought that was really not cool, but whatever they weren't upset but I probably would've been if it was me.  So I guess the strangest thing about our short visit that Friday night was that the Pittsburgh Opera Performers were there doing improv opera... :/  Just as we start to drink they begin to belt out some sort of story line, I don't know what it was, it was loud and not enjoyable for me or my friends so we were one and done and onto the next place to continue our night.  I would go back to August Henry's but only if I had a lot of time and probably not for Happy Hour.

101 Bistro. It sounds like a class in culinary school. Or a cafe off the freeway. But. It's not. It's downtown, close to the Dodge Theatre, so we picked it as our pre Margaret Cho chow place. It's a nice big room with lots of windows. Nice. It was filling up quickly and had a fun, urban energy. I was bummed when I ordered a beer and was told their liquor license was suspended and she can't serve any alcohol. Damn! No worries. We'll order, eat and walk around before the show and find a bar. I point to what looks like a bar across the street and ask our server what it is. "I don't know. I don't live down here. I just work here." Nice. What charm school did you graduate from? Bitch Academy? Rickie had a Philadelphia Cheesesteak - like pita sandwich while I had a roast beef panini. Both came with a small greek salad. Not great. Just. Well. Nice. The Caprese appetizer, while tasty, looked as though it had been assembled by a nervous monkey. It was also strange when little miss sunshine dropped a full glass of ice for Rickie's ice tea with no explanation as to why and without refilling his ice tea. Oh. Such a charmer. 101 Bistro, I give you a C minus. Average food. And a minus for the oh so helpful server and the unusually uncomfortable chairs. I still have the wicker imprint on my ass.I don't know if this qualifies as an update. However 101 Bistro is now closed. Eighty sixed. Nada here anymora. Adios. Hasta la pasta.RIP 101 B!

** If you are a parent that thinks it is acceptable to allow your child to run amuck, please stop reading now **I really like sushi.  I love sitting at the sushi bar, enjoying some good food and conversation.  So, when my friend suggested that we go to Pure I was looking forward to trying this new-to-me sushi spot.  What can go wrong?  A lot.Upon arrival we were seated at the sushi bar, and immediately noticed that a boy around the age of 10 was seated alone next to us.  I wondered where his parents were (this was at night, and I thought it was strange to leave a child alone where liquor was being served), but really didn't think it would be an issue.  Mistake.  It quickly became obvious that he could not be unsupervised.  Disruptive.  Food everywhere.  Impossible to ignore.  I am not exaggerating.  Ick.  This is not McDonalds - where are his parents!?  My friend mentions this to our waitress not once, but twice.  This is when I expect one of two things to occur:   1) we would be offered different seating, or 2) a manager would ask the parents (who I realized were dining separately at the complete other end of the sushi bar - WTF?) to bring him to sit with them so as not to disturb others.  Neither of these things happened. In the meantime, we have a pear martini (excellent), yellowtail sashimi (OK, not great) and attempted to enjoy a crabcake (blegh).  It was not fresh at all.  It tasted metallic.  Inedible.  I know what crab should taste like, and this isn't it.  Back to our young diner - my friend, realizing that this kid is a nightmare, approaches the parents to explain the situation.  Why did he have to do this?  Because nobody on the Pure staff would step up to deal with it.  At this point I am very irritated (and hungry!).  Oh, it gets better.  My exasperation is interpreted by my friend as annoyance or maybe embarrassment that he spoke with the kid's parents.  No, no, no.  I cannot explain this for some reason and now everyone is aggravated.  Oh joy.  The waitress chooses this moment to offer to bring us something else to replace the crabcake, but I was pretty much over the whole experience at that point.  Scary kid, creepy food, my friend is annoyed with me and I really just want to leave.  I cannot get my credit card out quickly enough.  Get me out of here - that year-old hot pocket that is lingering somewhere in the back of my freezer is sounding pretty good right now.Our waitress was extremely apologetic, and didn't charge me which I thought was nice (thus additional star).  However, some things you can't make up for.  Pure, you left a bad taste in my mouth.

This is the first time for me at Big Al's... Believe it or not, I've passed by many, many times and little did I know what I was missing! Opted to sit at the bar and have my lunch. They have really friendly service here and that makes a lot of difference! I ordered the combination pan roast which has crab and shrimp in it. They are very generous with the shrimp. The broth was really smooth, although I would have preferred it to be a bit thicker. It was very tasty and it is served with rice pilaf. They also give you a basket of bread with your meal. Warning: don't fill yourself up on the bread because the portions are good sized!

Review Text :
I had another BBQ attack & decided to find a new place to try in the neighborhood. After a little searching I found Longhorn's BBQ on N. Rancho.After a little looking around I found it in a little strip mall but it had just closed up at 8pm. Damn it.Still hankering for some BBQ I recalled Buzz BBQ being somewhere of the 95 Hwy in this area and went off in search of some BBQ.Buzz BBQ was voted #1 BBQ joint in Las Vegas 2008 and there business is proudly displaying all their new banners and even had it painted on the front doors.It is not a small place-it actually a regualr size restaurant with lots of boothes and flat screen tv's for the sports fans. Most of the decor is Western.The hostess was very friendly and helpful describing all the different meats and her favorites. We settled on a 3meat family meal with 2 sides & rolls. I ordered ribs(3), beef brisket and chopped pork with mac-n-cheese  & baked beans plus rolls.We only waited 5 minutes and it was ready to go. The damage $20!All the meats were very moist & quite smoky but not overpowering. You could not really taste any rub but it was decent meat.The ribs were large and tender but a little fatty. The chopped pork was the best thing but it had no crunchy pork skin in it. The brisket was very tender but really fatty too.  The sauce was sweet but came on the side. The mac-n-cheese wasnt very good and the baked beans were canned. Overall it was a little disappointing considering it's suppossedly the BEST. For the same 3 meat 2 side combo I could have got it at CJ's for $12.99 & it was alot better there.Went here for the first time tonight. And all I got to say is, WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH ME? I've been going to that shitty sushi restaurant next door for the longest time and never once gave this place a second glance. In fact, that was where I was going tonight buuut I was in for a new adventure. And I'm glad I took it!I walk in and I'm seated, I'm the only one there besides a group of 4 or so. I ordered the 3 meat combo, picking the brisket, the pulled pork, and the ribs. (I know, my new years resolution to be a vegetarian took a dump on me) For the sides, i got the sweet potatoes and the BBQ baked beans.First though, the waitress brought me out sweet rolls, which were warm, squishy, and awesome. Pretty surprising, seeing as it was already closing time.Oh yeah, Yelp needs to change this page, it closes at 7 now, not 9 pm. I walked in there at 8 like the jackass I am. I awkwardly saw it was empty and asked if they were open, she said no, but they'd still serve me anyway since the other group was there and they were still waiting for people to pick up their to-go orders. Talk about service! (Calm down bleeding hearts, I left a good tip)The lady didn't even have an attitude about serving me. I know some places you walk in an hour before closing and they act like you just ended their world or something.The food was great. The brisket was tender, pretty lean, and the ribs were fall-off-the-bone juicyness! Pulled pork was also a winner-winner. I dug into this meal with such fervor that about 1/4 the way through it, the waitress apologized for not bringing me the BBQ sauces sooner. WHAT? Sauce? Sauce-smosh, this dead cow/pig is so good, I didn't even notice that I didn't have any, or needed it. I accepted it just to give the tasting-a-testing. The mild sauce is your typical BBQ sauce, and the hot one has a little spice to it, almost teriyaki like. I preferred the hot one.The beans were pretty good, I did mix alittle BBQ sauce in them to get that "BBQ backed bean" taste, they seemed more just baked beans. The sweet potato fries were delicious, it was interesting that they seasoned it with sugar, I've never had that before. I'm used to the olive and rosemary type seasoning for sweet potatoes, but this was a pleasant surprise.I couldn't skip on the cobbler, so I got a blackberry one to-go, and I wasn't trying to stay too long either.But enough of that posh-posh, the whole reason I gave this place a 5 star is cause on the way out, the teenage girl at the front counter told me "sweet dreams!" HAHA! YES!I said "....you too" and drove all the way home laughing so hard, tears were running down my face, that was the most ADORABLE thing I've ever heard in my entire life and it totally made my crappy day a +100.I expect a "sweet dreams" everytime I leave this place now! ;)

Review Text :
I'm continuing with my downtown streak of reviews... I finally made it to Switch!  This review is for my experience at lunchtime... and let me warn you, it gets busy during the weekday lunch hours, so go early or go late, but arrive at noon, and more than likely you will have to wait.  However, the community table is an option if you go solo or with a small group.Another warning - the parking situation at noon - I think I lucked out and got the last spot in the lot; I happened to see a truck leaving when I came in, but there didn't seem to be any other open spots.  I noticed that Durant's next door offered 'humble valet parking' (interesting signage), but not sure if you are dining at Switch where you would park in this scenario.I walked in through the back, and I liked the atmosphere and vibe immediately.  I was told there was a 20 minute wait for my party of 3, so I found myself a seat and did some work while I waited.  Pretty sure they have WiFi although I was using my Verizon card.  Great people watching was distracting me too; enough so that I missed when the rest of my party walked in!  Anyways, I caught up with them and enjoyed a great lunch...Service was right on, and it was an overall delightful dining experience.  I had the 'Super Chop' salad - it had a little bit of everything in it (artichokes, olives, tomatoes, cucumbers, corn, sunflower seeds, sun-dried tomatoes, spinach & field greens) - and I added turkey for a small extra charge... it was a huge serving and the perfect healthy lunch!  (Note to self and to anyone else that may be interested in adding protein to your salad in the future - go with something other than the turkey... I hate to sound picky, but it wasn't amazing).  Anyways, my two new friends (Kate and Angie) are regulars at Switch, so they ordered the hummus and lamb apps and shared - good idea!  I tried the hummus and it was tasty - I like how they served it with pita and sides of artichokes and peppers.  It was a tad different than the hummus at Fez, or at least that is what we all decided.We were all very satisfied and too full for dessert... I guess I'll have to come back to try that another time.  Dessert and a bunch of other menu items that sounded good.  I also noticed that Switch serves breakfast all day on Saturday and Sundays, and does catering - good to know!We took the train from Mill to downtown Monday night, and heard that Switch does half-priced sangria, sooo, had to check that out. Pretty cute place.The sangria was indeed special, and on special. We also got the hummus plate, which was really good, and I wish it came with more roasted red peppers, they were addicting! Yum. A couple little weird things though, the host stand is at the back, or middle if you consider the patio, which I guess makes sense for them, but was kinda confusing for a first timer and there was nobody manning the stand there which didn't help. We also had a total of three servers, maybe we should consider that special treatment :) But I'll be back, gotta try the brunch still!i like Switch, the long European style bar is great for a large group of friends or making new friends. the food is pretty good. happy hour is awesome with the 2 for 1 Sangrias and glasses of wine.plus they make a really good Caipirinha. which i believe to be a better version of the Mojito.atmosphere is cute and friendly. inviting. staff is usually attentive. only had one bad experiance..but i just notch it up to how busy it was. no foul. i will keep coming back.Lame joke alert :Okay, I think I have switched over to Switch , I am finally making a switch to Switch  whew almost over , after you try Switch you'll never switch.  And done.Thanks for letting me get that out of my system.Lunch today was delightful. Mom and I were downtown playing around and we tried Switch for something new.  Glad we did.  Our server Matthew was helpful, courteous and efficient. He really made the good food stand out .  For being at the peak of lunchtime it was nice to see the restaurant wasn't packed but they were well prepared for the lunchtime crowd.Food was served fast without feeling rushed. Drinks were filled promptly without hovering.We had the Beef Galletta , a puff pastry with mushrooms, tender beef, brie , onions and a light sauce. Great size not too much but definitely filling.  Mom had chicken chop salad that looked fresh and tasty.  She really enjoyed it.   I look forward  to coming back and trying other items here.I will never give this restaurant another dime as long as i live. I have spent countless hours and dollars here as well as refered many family members and friends here. The food is great, but the recent visits have been inexcusable. Friday night the place was semi busy but had 3-5 empty tables and about 8 open seats at the bar. We asked for a table and were told it was a 45 minute wait so we opted to sit at the bar, but were told there was a wait there as well. I told the hostess there were empty seats all over and asked if we should go somewhere else. She told me very annoyed that we could sit at the bar. Through out whole meal nobody else sat at the bar. I wonder who was waiting. Today i just returned for sunday brunch and was told there is a wait for a table, again plenty of seats open. So i said can i sit at the bar? She replied she was trying to keep those seats open "incase a large party comes in." i asked ok where can i sit prior to being told "just wait for a table." again i askes should i just go spend my money somewhere else? She then fumbled and said let me see what i can do. What can she do im thinking? What the hell there are open seats everywhere and nobody waiting and one of your best regulars wants ONE seat. Needless to say I walked right out.In an economy where places are shutting down and losing their lease, id think you would hire nice and intelligent people. There are lots of over qualified people who need any job they can get. I dont know why i would spend my money somewhere where people are rude to me and incompetent. You lose, switch.dear switch,  thank you. from the bottom of my heart. for hosting a crowd of rowdy drunken and often shouting yelpers to your oh so generous weekend brunches.i hope to make this a weekly ritual, wherein i pay my respects to the patron god of the aztecs and their sacred drink the bloody mary; poured into a massive carafe, garnished with celery and made from the fresh innocent virgin blood of pubescent spanish girls. on behalf of my yelp crew and im gonna go ahead and say all of the phoenix yelp community: thank you, you make sunday/saturday mornings a happy blurry drunk driving fun day that i cherish!Dropped by for lunch with a friend.  I love the vibe an decor here....it's very modern and chic.  I ordered a Triple Grilled Cheese Sandwich (Provolone, American, and Cheddar Cheese on Griddled Texas Toast, $7.95 & Tomatoes, $.95).  It comes with a complimentary side of Caesar Salad....bonus!The Grilled Cheese Sandwich was awesome!  The thick Texas Toast was griddled perfectly....not too burnt, but not too soft....and the combination of Cheeses was just right.....the Tomato provided a nice, juicy & sweet flavor to the Sammie!  Next time, I'll also add Avocado to the Sammie for $.95 more.Our server was great too.....patient with us as we talked and browsed the menu.Overall, it was an awesome dining experience.Return Factor - 100%For pure delight, I have to give this place 5 stars. YOU MUST TRY: Very Berry Turkey Sandwich, Thai Braised Beef Tacos, Apricot BBQ Chicken Skewers, and the Red Sangria! I also highly recommend the Sunday Brunch Drink Specials; the mimosas and bloody Mary drinks are $3. They fill one glass up and bring you the rest of your drink in a carafe. They're strong and after just one you'll be pretty happy :D Other items worth noting: Margarita Sunrise, Blueberry Cosmo, Drunk Italian SodaWe had a reservation for 18, but our other 7 friends wimped out at the last min.  The 11 of us enjoyed Switch.  We had the high table by the bar and kitchen.  Tim was our server and he was awesome!!!  The weekend brunch menu looks so yummy.  I ordered the Breakfast Gallette (large puffy pasty topped 2 eggs, sausage, jack cheese & cheddar cheese, & served with breakfast potatoes. Everything tasted so so good, one minor thing I did not know the eggs were over easy.   The rest of the group polished off their food too!  Some of us ordered off the regular menu.  OMG, the burger looks and smells delicious!  I so need to be back to order another things off the regular menu!!!!Wow...I don't even know where to start.  (The beginning...that's usually a good place)So, the little lady and I had just finished up with yoga, and Switch was in the very near vicinity,  so we figured it'd be a good choice.  Wrong.  We were greeted in a somewhat timely fashion and seated.  Then we waited for a while...and then a little more.  The hostess was wiping off a nearby table and asked if we had been helped yet, and when we said no, she went to find our server.  Apparently he didn't know we were his table.  Ok, it's happened to me before, I'm willing to forgive.  Our server, Chris, came over and we ordered our food and drinks.  He came back with our bevs and then he didn't stop by again until food came out, meanwhile we had pushed both of our empty water glasses and my empty coffee mug to the end of the table...hoping that he would get the hint.  Nope.  Then the food came and he finally asked if we wanted more to drink.  He dropped off water and coffee and was gone until the END of our meal (which wasn't even good).  Was this a joke?  He comes over and says "So, how is everything guys?" My woman replied with "I've had better, can we please get the check?" and he didn't even ask what was wrong.  He brought the check and we were going to split it down the middle, and he said they were having system issues and couldn't split it.  Fine, one card...just get us the eff outta here!  When he brought the card back he literally tossed it on the table and told us to have a good day as he was walking away.Yeah, where's the manager?  I told the manager all about our sucky experience and our even suckier server.  I was given some excuse that their computer systems were down due to a hacking of sorts and blah blah blah...give me a break.  I understand things running a bit slow due to a computer problem, but NEVER coming to check on our meal and us having to ask a different server to please get us condiments and then to not even acknowledge when we tell you we've had better...that's not a computer issue.  That's a server who doesn't care about good business and doesn't know how to do his job.  We were given a comp card for the next time we come in, but really I doubt that will happen.   It's a shame, because I really do love supporting local gay businesses.  But they make it so damn hard with their declining service and mediocre food.Switch, our relationship must come to an end, because when it comes down to it...it's not me, it's you.Unbelievably rude service. I came here on a Sunday with two friends and we were the first people in the restaurant. We waited at the front for a while and the servers were too busy chatting with each other to acknowledge us so we sat ourselves. Once our server realized we had sat ourselves she had the audacity to tell us to in a very condescending tone to "wait for the hostess in the future". Again, we were the only people there. Do you really think you can be that rude to people when they sit down and expect them to stay?We got up and left, and I will not return. Switch has been officially scratched off my list of Sunday brunches for this ridiculous behavior and I will be sure to tell anyone who suggests we visit in the future.Came here for a fabulous lunch with ten other people.  Understandably, the wait time was a little long since they wanted to bring out all eleven dishes at once but it was worth it!I got the Chicken Pot Pie Gallette, Crème brûlée for dessert, and a Caipirinha to wash it all down.  That chicken pot pie was flaky buttery goodness!  The non-tradition pie and crust with a delicious savory cream gravy was some good old comfort food eating.  Even after offering bites to some of my lunch patrons, I still ate it all up with a happy smile.  The green beans were also really fresh and crisp.  Although I was content with my dish, I gotta say I loved my friend's Mac N' Cheese Plate even more.  Oh man, how I wish I got the same.  Yum!  Their fish and chips were also pretty tasty.  I especially like the dill tartar sauce accompaniment. Although I was full, I couldn't pass up on getting a crème brûlée.  Let me indulge a little!  It was a decent brûlée with the perfect caramelized crust and creamy custard goodness.  I ate it all, my dress was feeling a little tight, but I have no regrets.  The Caipirinha cocktail is a delicious mojito drink so no complaints there.  It was a bit light on the booze though but at 11:30AM in the morning, I shouldn't be out getting wasted anyways!Switch is a swanky place with a cozy simplistic atmosphere.  I like it!  I would love to come back again.I enjoyed a delicious meal here for a UYE lunch event. The restaurant was very accommodating for our party of 11 and provided excellent service - keeping our water glasses filled and ensuring all of our meals arrived at the same time. I enjoyed the Thai Braised Beef Tacos ($11.95) during a previous visit and they were just as delicious this time as I remembered! The 4 tacos have the perfect combination of spicy and sweet braised beef rib meat on corn tortillas with Asian hot sauce and tangy slaw. The tacos are accompanied by jalapeño slices and sweet pickles for those who want to "kick it up a notch." All of my dining companions seemed equally pleased with the mac 'n cheese, burger, salad, and lobster & seafood crepes. I will definitely return to Switch for the variety of entree options, cocktails, and great service. This is a great restaurant for a number of occasions - a birthday lunch, romantic brunch on the patio, or dinner with friends.I heard tons of positive reviews on this restaurant particularly their famous 'Switch burger' so I thought I'd give them a try.Location & Aesthetics - Located in Phoenix and on my initial drive to the restaurant I sadly missed it even though the GPS said we had reached.  The facade of the restaurant looks unassuming and, in my opinion, the signage could've been a little better.  When I turned around, I didn't miss it the second time.  Apparently parking is in the rear and you can also choose to enter in the rear or in the front.  To me it was easier to enter in the rear as I parked there.Lots of parking when we arrived which was around 1630-1700 for dinner.  Our initial thoughts was we were going to be the only ones there as the parking lot was empty.  My advice, if you're going for dinner, get there early because as we were leaving, the parking lot was full with no spots left.  In fact, when we pulled out, another potential customer took our spot immediately.The restaurant itself is snazzy, chic, superbly clean, uncluttered, lots of space between tables/chairs, and well decorated.  One can chose to sit outside with what looked like comfortable chairs and tables, and even fans attached to the wall to keep folks cool.  We chose to sit inside where the A/C was on but wasn't blasting, just comfortable enough.Menu - Well laid out, self-explanatory, and wasn't overwhelmingly 2-5 pages/leafs long.Service - The staff was really nice, friendly, warm, welcoming, and accommodating.  Any questions (about the menu) were answered promptly.  Our waitress checked on us several times throughout the meal to ask if everything was good, asked about drinks/refills, and asked about our appetizers.  Food - For my drink, I ordered the sweet tea vodka lemonade which was positively addicting!  I wanted more but since I was the designated driver, one was where I drew the line.For appetizers we ordered the onion rings.  Initially we were told it was just going to be around 8 but instead was greeted with much more plus given 2 dips - ketchup and another whose name eludes me now.  The onion rings was hot, fresh, crunchy and very tasty with not too much batter surrounding the onion itself (not overly fried).For the main course, I ordered the 'Switch House Burger' which was out of this world.  The beef was well seasoned and cooked to perfection, mouth watering, and juicy, and cooked exactly how I asked -- medium-to-well done.  Many of the ingredients it contained balanced each other out, e.g., the tartness from the goat cheese was balanced by the Switch fig dressing; and the zesty taste of the Arugula was balanced out by the onion strings....everything was perfect!The only reason they lost a star was because toward the end of the meal, we felt rushed as the waitress asked if we wanted to order any dessert, we declined, and immediately presented with us with the check.  Not a big deal in my book but the gesture was noticed by another in my party.This place really some nice looking tasting items on their menu and, for me, it's definitely worth coming back to try some of them.

Review Text :
Went to see My Doll tonight and walked from The Sets.  This is an awesome place to see live music, especially if you are a punk like me!It's really well-lit for a bar!  Never a cover charge, which is always a plus.The shows are always fun and tonight I almost got wiped out in the pit.  500 cool points for that!Takes awhile to get a drink from the bar, but that's a good and bad thing.  Good - you know there's a crowd.  Nothing like a dead place with bands playing.Bad - well, if you're really jonesin' for a drink, you have to wait.  Suckas!Oh great, just what I needed, another strong beer and craft liquor bar bar full of great people, nice pool tables and next door to my favorite music venue in the city of Tempe.They've done a great job with this place.  You could still smell a bit of the varnish from the new bar and walls when I went in, very cleanly done in greens and wood to reflect the three pool tables.  They have a nice selection of taps and a huge selection of bottled beer.  The owner said that they've got local artists bringing in rotating art starting next week.The liquor selection is a thing of beauty.  Rodney has sought out the best micro-distilled spirits he can find.  He poured us a little sip of the Dry Fly vodka and gin, both amazing, beyond your normal liquor for quality and smoothness.What I like best about this place is that it isn't trying to hard.  The crowd was still a Yucca crowd, the music was still rock, nothing loungey about it. Though my wallet dies every time I say it, Long Live Yucca.If I had to choose between sex and another visit to Yucca Tap, women everywhere would be bracing themselves for disappointment.While many bars aim to boast the LARGEST beer selection, Yucca keeps it cool, with a nice ratio of staples like PBR and Red Stripe for $3 to obscure drafts for as low as $6. Many of them come in 10-12 oz. glasses, and that's so they don't completely kick your ass. I had:Deschutes Hop Henge Experimental IPA (8.5% ABV)Mission Shipwrecked Double IPA (9.3%)And some other ale from Goose Island Brewery I was too buzzed to bother noting details on. Also, the liquor selection. Just do it.You don't even have to drink to enjoy this place. There's a good bar menu, a Foosball table, pool, some casino game I don't recognize, and A WHOLE OTHER BAR FOR MORE LIQUOR AND LIVE MUSIC. And they don't even charge a cover.Just writing this review makes me wanna race out there right now, and it takes a lot to get this excited about a dive.Serves food until 2AM!Saturday specials: $4 red headed slut shots... I think we are tempted. Too bad we didn't see the 3rd red head who walked by us as we all agreed to take it on the 3rd one that walks by. :(I've been eyeing this place for the longest time since I've been seeing my two friends from Arizona checking into this place. Finally got to try it out and....I only liked the drinks, atmosphere and the pool table. Totally did NOT like the food that night. On their menu, there is a bar snacks and entree section. I decided to eat something small since I know I cannot finish a burger or a taco by myself, so I got the chicken and beef kabobs. Some of you should know how a kabobs look like right? If you don't, they look like this http://yieatn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/kabobs-719954.jpg and what yucca gave me was only meat and no veggies. Disappointed...I wished they at least listed on the menu somewhere 'just meat' When I got the kabobs, my chicken tasted fine, but my beef tasted like it got dipped into salt at least 5x... Ugh. I hope the food only tasted that yucks because of not having enough people in the kitchen. I mean... if you're going to serve bar snacks, it shouldn't take 40-50 mins. Gah....Pool table entertained us the most throughout the night. $1 quarters a game. Plus there's a live band in the other room if you're interested in listening. By the way, there's also another bar in the same room where the band places but only a couple of tables to sit down. maybe it's a bad night that we went...I guess we'll have to find out the next time I visit! Until then...this place was OKAY.

Just as I nestled my tired butt into our booth, two cute elderly ladies were getting up from their table right next to us. As one helped the other into her walker, well, how do I put this delicately? Hmmm....as one helped the other into her walker, the lady with the walker, she, umm. Ok. Well, she ripped one. Ok. She farted. Yes I said it. And everyone heard it. But, unfortunately for me, my face was a foot from her polyester crack. Welcome to the Village Inn. As we awaited our food I noticed one employee at the counter chewing her nails. Really going to town. Like trying to break the Guiness Book of World Records. It was distracting. And disgusting. That said. We had a wonderful server with a nativity scene apron. Wow. Hmmm....I believe Mary has mustard on her forehead.  I enjoyed the basic eggs over medium, hash browns (perfectly crisp on top) and my buttermilk cakes. So the food was actually tastey. The flatulence and nail biting I guess were just a bonus.

Ended up eating here on 3 occasions while at the GVR. This is a small space, with only a few tables, but plenty of seating at the sushi bar. Lots of creative and traditional rolls on the menu. I pretty good selection of nigiri, and a nice variety of sake. My favorite was Sparkling Blueberry Sake, very refreshing and you can taste the berry flavor.They offer an all-you-can eat option from 5-7 pm for $28.95. This is a very cost effective way to go when you are hungry and the all-you-can eat menu has almost everything on it. Beware, they will always serve rolls first to fill you up, so if you order nigiri make sure to specifically ask to have it brought out first.P.S. You have to try the steamed chicken dumplings off the fresh sheet.

Review Text :
We came came for a schmoozing from a corporate client. It worked. We had the Mediterranean Calamari for apps. They were really good, I like the deep fried artichoke. I had lobster bisque, it was really creamy and had great flavor. The lunch was a halibut fillet sandwich and dirty rice. The rice was perfectly seasoned and fluffy. The halibut was cooked perfectly and was a very nice size. It was flaky and not dry at all. The building was really neat, I think a nice outside happy hour would be great in mid to late October. The service was perfect, not over pretentious or up on you the whole time.I really love this place!! Nothinglike a fun Sunday meal with my family to make me love it even more. We stuffed ourselves with delish catfish, fried shrimp , and tasty hazelnut Mahi. Service from Rocky was really fast , effiecient without that fake cloying attitude. Felt like we werethe center of the restaurant. Funny how things like fast drink refills, quick service and welltime plate removal can do that.  And here is the kicker of the evening ..I know have ordered or tasted every dessert on thier dessert tray, scary but true. Did you know that three of their desserts are made fresh there the rest including cheesecakes are made in Texas and brought in. I got the fresh Brulee  . yummy.   Can't wait to go back.$6 for a dozen Texas Gulf oysters Mon-Thur.  We ordered 8.Waitress was slick and upsold us on alligator, which contrary to popular belief, does not taste like chicken.  Get the spinach dip with real crab meat - it's fantastic.My first visit to Pappadeaux was in Houston in the early 80's. Living in the dessert now I miss the great tasting flavors of living on the Gulf Coast and then some. This is the place we migrate to when we are looking for a that type of feel good food.Both outside and inside is fixed up so that you feel like you are in New Orleans or nearby. Service is exceptionable. Just let them know what you need and / or want and they will make it happen. Grandpa Mark says so. Trust me!Food is always very good and tasty. We like to start off with a  large portion of fried alligator with an extra side of their special Creole dipping sauce. The complimentary French Bead with butter definitely take it to the next level. Dip Me Baby!Some of our favorites are anything deep fried of coarse, the blackened fish, all the items they grill, as well as the gumbos, salads, all the etouffees dishes and the dirty rice. Tally ho! The menu is just too big to go over it all.  Yummo!Last visit with the extended family we ordered the Ginger Salmon, Blackened Mahi, Blackened Catfish. Sampler Seafood Platter, Shrimp and Catfish, and of course some Alligator to get things rolling.Mention a special occasion like a B-Day celebration for an extra special treat. Hmmm? This is not a Long John's Pete's type fish place so prepare to enjoy. Place gets really busy and loud at peak times. Recommend going there for an early lunch to get the extra attention. Mr. Mark ........ table ready.Ah-YEE!Spend your money elsewhere!First time at Pappadeaux we had a bad experience with 1 staff member, brought it to the attention of management and were given a $50 gift card to make things right (was a pretty bad experience, not normally complainers)When returned for a 2nd time, to use the gift card, the hostess sat our party of 3 in between 2-10+ person parties.  Our 4 person table was squished in between the 2 parties that when the server went to take people's orders at the big party she was literally standing over top of me, shouting to the people on the other side of the table.  We asked to move as they clearly had open tables in other areas that were not so cramped - it was such an ordeal to allow us to move 30 ft to a new table.We get a new table and it takes 15-20 minutes before anyone comes over.  By this time it's about 6:15pm and we know happy hour is only until 6:30pm.  We asked for a round of drinks and are told happy hour is only available in the bar area.  WTF.We decline ordering drinks at the table and one of use walks to the bar, orders happy hour priced drinks and brings them back to our table.  Genius!  Apparently this is frowned upon though, oh well.  And the happy hour drink prices are laughable, a sweet tea...whatever its called was $8 - what the hell does it cost non-happy hour.  Their food is horribly over priced for what you get, its on par with Red Lobster and almost twice as expensive.  My friend ordered the stuffed crab and the server lets her know there is no crab in this dish, its 2 empty crab shells stuffed with breading, shrimp and fish bits.  12 shrimp cost about $17, I did not see any evidence that they had been dipped in gold prior to the fryer.  My friends Caesar salad has ONE lone crouton floating in the soggy, limp lettuce.  Our server, Jimmy was empathetic that we were having a rough experience and he gave us a creme brulee on the house.  Not to sound unappreciative, but I'm glad we didn't pay for it, was just meh.Time to pay.  Our bill comes to $72.  We have the $50 gift card and throw in $40 in cash and decide to let Jimmy keep the difference which is a pretty nice tip, since he had given us dessert.  He picks up the check book and we tell him we are good, no change needed.  We start to get ready to leave and another server/manager perhaps comes over w/ a receipt showing we owe $18 after the gift card was charged.  The $40 has disappeared, did Jimmy think we gave him a $40 tip??  To avoid any further annoyance we just leave and leave the $18 DUE receipt on the table.  Go to Red Lobster :)oh nom nom nom nom here. I've been to the one in New Mexico - but for some reason, it didn't stand out as much there. I think it might have been the Lunch course.THIS was definitely a much better experience.We got here a little after 8 pm, a bit early for our 8:30 pm reservations. They had our table ready and whenever we were ready to go. They were uber accommodating - even when our party of 10 became a party of 8.Brook was our server. AWESOME MAN. Fantastic suggestions, substitution, and all over awesomeness. Wished I lived closer to have this place all the time.Wine cellar for our private party. You should ask - it fits about 10-12 people comfortably. What we ordered-* Mississippi Catfish Opelousas - Blackened catfish with shrimp, oysters & jumbo lump crabmeat in a lemon garlic butter sauce with dirty rice ... It was so light, so flavorful. OH my. I totally understand why my friend LOVES this dish. $29.99*Atlantic Salmon Yvette (11 oz. 26.95 .. 7 oz. 22.95) Char-grilled salmon with shrimp, crawfish, mushrooms & spinach, in a sherry white wine sauce, with dirty rice.* Pappadeaux sampler - Fried fish filets (choice of catfish, tilapia or both), shrimp, blue crab cake, stuffed shrimp & stuffed crab with extra fried shrimp & crawfish)... the extra is what separates the seafood platter vs pappadeaux sampler. ($32.99)*Oyster sampler appetizer - with both of their baked oysters (Oysters Pappadeaux - Baked oysters on the half shell with crabmeat, spinach & hollandaise and Oysters Baton Rouge - Oysters on the half shell baked with a Parmesan Romano cheese sauce) - $13.95, with three of each oyster.*Appetizer Trio - Mini shrimp & crawfish fondeaux, fried alligator & hot smoked salmon* (we switched the salmon for Coconut shrimp) OH nom nom nom. This was one fantastic appetizer - can be shared or ordered as an entree - $22.99Somewhat disappointed in their section of raw oysters - Gulf Coast and Blue point only.Lobster tank in front, with their prices per pound. Will definitely come back especially now i know what I ordered. Pretty pricey, but totally worth the flavors and food. OH nom nom nom indeedHoo, boy..these are some good eats!We stopped in for lunch to find a bustling crowd in a massive restaurant, though the attentive staff more than made up for the lunch rush.We were seated quickly and had little trouble finding something on the seafood heavy, Cajun-inspired menu. Kicking off the meal was an order of the alligator bites: spiced, fried chunks of alligator with a zesty red sauce for dipping and a heap of crispy potato straws. The gator was cooked perfectly, neither mushy nor rubbery with a noticeable punch. Figuring it would be awhile before I saw alligator on a menu again, I went for the half po boy/gumbo lunch combo. The baguette was stuffed with fried alligator, lettuce, and pickles covered with tartar and cocktail sauces. Topped with a squeeze of lemon, it was hearty, delicious, and paired nicely with a cup of fiery andouille and seafood gumbo, packed with crab meat, sausage, shrimp, and that holy trinity of bell pepper, celery, and onions.Worth the trek from lower Phoenix (or the suburbs).Several years ago, when business travel to Houston was regular, I became a big fan of the Pappas family restaurants-- Pappadeaux Seafood Kitchen in particular.  As we drove north from Phoenix airport to Sedona I noticed a sign for Pappadeaux, and knew that this would be a lunch stop when the final portion of our vacation brought us back to Phoenix.The restaurant is large, attractively appointed and comfortable, with an encyclopedic menu of fish and seafood offerings.  Although best known for their Cajun preparations, there are abundant choices for everyone who enjoys well-prepared fish and seafood.Our server, Nicholaus, effortlessly navigated a crowded lunchtime dining room with our order.  Although a bit distant, he was a consummate professional.Brought first to the table was a large platter of crispy fried alligator nuggets, served with a full-bodied spicy sauce.  I ordered a platter of fried oysters, one of my favorites, while my family selected po boy sandwiches of shrimp or alligator.  We each had a cup of their Andouille, Crab, and Shrimp Gumbo.  The sandwiches were bountiful, and from what I was told, absolutely delicious.  The same could be said for the fried oysters.  A tartar sauce whose consistency was a bit less obvious as a packaged commercial product is all that separated this lunch from greatness.  The seafood was all fried just to the point of presenting a crispy coating surrounding tender, moist and flavorful protein.Hardly an inexpensive lunch, Pappadeaux Seafood Kitchen is in that class of restaurant that I would seek out wherever they operate.I prefer my food from the land and not the sea so seafood is not a dining favorite of mine. My picky style has never resisted me for taking up an opportunity to dine at Pappadeux as they have on shore tasty items on the menu. I always seem to dive into the crispy chicken fingers along with the wide variety of sides, however my last visited I was tempted to try the broiled half chicken. Boy was I impressed. It was so flavorful and fell right off the bone. Not only was it not dry but it was juicy. Matter of fact those seafood eaters who dined with me tasted a sample and wanted to clean my plate. Too bad and so sad for them they will have to come back because I ate it all. Along with the spaghetti squash and a bed of white rice. The great thing about this restaurant is they have a wide variety of options to choose from. A large dining area for larger parties and even a private room. You can dine casually to a romantic date or even have a party the whole crew will be impressed. They even have a full size bar with the same great menu. Pappadeaux the place to go!Always a fan of Pappadeux.  The last time I was here was for a group Valentine's date with two other couples.  Love was in the air that night especially since the couple at the table next to us got engaged.  Not exactly what I would call a romantic intimate setting but hey, it worked for them because the lady said yes!I love their crawfish, the fried alligator, and the Pappadeux oysters.  I haven't really ventured out to try anything else besides those three items.  The crawfish they serve up here has good flavor and are big but not exactly the best with all the new crawfish boil shops popping up.  I do think their fried alligator is still the best in town especially with their dipping sauce.  As for the Pappadeux oysters, what's not to love?  It's a dressed up oyster!This place gets packed fast, it's always super loud in here, and the decor is kind of tacky and gimmicky but it's a seafood restaurant so what do you really expect?  Come to Pappadeux for a fun night out with some decent eats!

For those looking for a decent teriyaki place, this is it.Skip all the fast food places that surround this place. These guys are kind of hidden in the back. But once you find it, your taste buds and stomach will thank you later. For those that are familiar with Flame Broiler in So Cal, these guys are pretty similar.What I got was the #11 Chicken and Beef Combo Plate with Vegetables and Brown Rice. Right away I am liking the fact that they don't charge you extra for the brown rice. The vegetables, which they give you good portions of, are consisted of broccoli, cabbage, and sliced carrots. The teriyaki sauce they have there are in big squeeze bottles. They also have sriracha for you spice heads. They have many other choices besides chicken and beef like short ribs, fish, tempura, miso soup, and California rolls.Prices are a bit cheaper than Teriyaki Madness and their customer service is very good.Too bad this is the only location they have because I live over by Aliante and this is kind of a drive for me so im jealous of those that work and/or live around this area.

Once upon a time, this place rocked.....always packed with people and had a great vibe.  Then, inexplicably, it became a topless strip club....wth?  Where were all the partiers who wanted to sing along with Tommy and his band go?  Who knows.Now, it's no longer a topless strip club, but it's lost the momentum it once had.  Which is too bad because it was a really fun place to go to meet up with friends, have a few drinks, shoot some pool, have some food, and sing along with the band.  Well, not really sing along, but the bands were so much fun (think Jimmy Buffet style) that you couldn't help but sing along with your drunk friends.I recently stopped by the joint to see what it was like now.  I walked into the place and it just didn't feel the same.  It's the same building and not much as changed inside the bar, but it was missing the people that made it fun.  It was replaced with other people, but it just didn't seem right.  I had a Beer and left.Despite losing it's luster and momentum, this place is one of the best places to be during a weekend that Jimmy Buffet is performing in Vegas.  Although Jimmy has opened up a joint at the Flamingo, many Parrot Heads still come here.  Before Margaritaville opened up, this was Parrot Head heaven during those weekends.Will I return?  Only during a Jimmy Buffet concert weekend.I purchased the Groupon for this place when it became available. Despite the good deal, I didn't have high expectations for this place. We came here this evening and decided to share several appetizers and a we each got a drink. The prices were pretty good. We shared buffalo wings, nachos with chicken and some sliders. Our waitress was beyond amazing. I was really impressed by how personable and attentive. She was friendly and always made sure our drinks were filled and had everything we needed. The food was surprisingly good as well. It wasn't gourmet by any stretch of the imagination was it was very tasty and affordable. I look forward to coming here again for some affordable drinks and grub. Their happy hour specials look really good as well and they last until 7 daily.

Restaurant name  Fellini's Ristorante
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Frederico Fellini was a brillant and enigmatic Italian director of films in the 50's, 60's and 70's. 4 of his films won an Oscar for best foreign film.If you talk to any film afficianado, they would recognize his titles, like La Dolce Vita, 8 1/2, La Strada, le notti de cabaria, and Amarcord . His movies were known for their psychological content, influenced by the famous Swiss psychologist Carl Jung, and their clever sexual innuendos (i.e. train entering a tunnel). He enjoyed the great Japanese Director, Akira Kurosawa, because they were both inspired by their own dream worlds, and Fellini influenced, by their own admissions, great international directors like Ingmar Bergman, Stanley Kubrick, Martin Scorcese and Bernado Bertolucci. He is considered by many one of the 10 best directors of all time. One of his characters in La Dolce Vita, named Paparazzo, who took pictures, inspired the term Paparazzi.This Fellini's isn't a legend like Frederico was, but it is a solid Italian restaurant in the Stratosphere Hotel and Casino. The prices, for Vegas, are reasonable, and the food is tasty and well done if not extraordinary and memorable. The Carpaccio ($12.95) was nice, with capers, dry cheese, olive oil and arugula; the Angel Hair pasta with Rapini ($18.95) was very good and a lot of food; the Fettucine Capri was enough for 2 with a nice sauce that was in between a cream and a tomato base. Garden Salad was $6.95.  A nice Ruffino Reserve red wine ($37.00) added to the enjoyment of the food, and the Tira Misu ($6.95) was classic and light.Service was good, although Steve, the best server, was off that day. Inside this Fellini's, you can get a good reliable Italian meal, unlike an unpredictable, wild and crazy, sexually charged Fellini Film. For something more like that, just step back out onto the Strip!TIPS: Free valet parking at the stratosphere. After walking in to the building from valet parking, head towards the CASHIER sign and make a right. Go all the way down, pass the poker room and you'll find it tucked away on the left. Also, TravelZoo coupon online, deal ends 9/30/2014.So I may be slightly biased because we bought the travel zoo coupon and everybody knows that a good deal always seems to make food taste better. Well at least in my family haha Despite the voucher's fine print that limits one coupon per table, the restaurant was more than happy to let us use 2 coupons for our party of four. For $49 you get a soup/salad (specialty salads too, like shrimp caesar, caprese, etc.), an entree up to $32.95 in value (which is basically everything but 2 dishes on the menu), and a dessert to share (any of the desserts on the list.) They automatically added the gratuity which is a percentage of the actual bill price but it still is a pretty sweet deal. First they bring out fresh bread and butter that is sitting on a bed of minced roasted garlic with olive oil. Really yummy. We also ordered some chardonnay- a liter was only $20 so each of use had about 2 glasses which I thought was a good deal.  I ordered the mozzarella caprese (large slices of fresh cheese!), my aunt's chicken caesar was pretty big, and two other had the tomato salad. For our entrees, my dad's linguine with clams was overflowing with shellfish, I had the gnocchi with filet mignon, my step moms lamb shanks comes with about 5 shanks, and my aunt's rib eye was huge. We all were pleasantly surprised. Lastly, we picked the tiramisu and godiva chocolate mousse cake. Yum and yum.Service was a little slow at first but once we told them we had a show to catch shortly after dinner, they were much more attentive and told the chef so that we could get out of there on time. Overall I think we still saved quite a bit of money, so if you're unsure at least check it out with the coupon to see if ya dig it as much as we did.

Restaurant name  King's Fish House

Review Text :
Tried this for the first time Saturday night.We got there around 9pm and it was still really busy - we waited in the bar and enjoyed bloody marys and popcorn shrimp. Both were excellent.Once we got seated (about :30min later) we ordered the breaded halibut and the crab legs. I was impressed by the excellent service and overall food quality. I will definitely return and recommend Kings Fish House.Hungry ? Want something to eat , like maybe fish?  Well this place has fish. This is the kind of place to go when you want food but not really caring how good it COULD be .  Service was great and very prompt. The host  , bartender, and wait staff seemed very into their jobs.  But the fish itself was not memorable.    A bit pricey , but offered many kinds of fish which seemed to be flown in?   I wouldn't go back unless a group of people were meeting there and it was what everybody else wanted. Enough said.3.5 starsAfter a failed attempt to dine elsewhere, we ended up at King's.  Unlike Maria Maria, King's was more than happy to promptly seat us without an unnecessary wait.There is quite an extensive menu, and a lot of complaints on Yelp about price.  I didn't think it was all that expensive.  Most of the entrees were under $20 and that includes two sides.I had the crab cakes with french fries and mac 'n cheese.  The crab cakes were good even if not the best I've had.  Mac 'n cheese fell a little short for me.  Not much cheese.  More like mac 'n bread crumbs.  My husband had the king crab legs.  Expensive ($43) but 1 1/2 lbs and tons of crab meat.  I tried and it was delicious.We had excellent service.  Could not have asked for better!  My one suggestion would be to serve the sourdough bread warm!  At least until June!WOW... being from New England area "Mass-hole" , i usually am pretty lenient to places since we are "land locked"..Sourdough bread to start.. hard exterior, did not taste anything close to fresh,, anyways,, looking over the menu, and was a little shocked.. prices higher than "pappadeaux" n thinking the food quality better match..Appetizer PEI mussels - decent flavor , but 1/3 look over dehydrated, almost as if they were dead way before cooking time. or recooked or something,, those we un-edible.Wife got the clam chowder which was actually really good..  hence 2 starsI thought, 22 bucks for some scallops,, hmm, let me try that out.. huge plate came out with these little marble sized scallops, 12 of them.. thats almost 2 dollars a piece for each lil scallop, Side zuchini was ok, but the cole slaw definitely not great,, some bites had that sour weird rubberband taste,,Waitress, awesome, always smiling, refilling our drinks,, Finished with a $60 bill,, not even close to satisfied and never going back..If you want seafood on the east valley, go ahead n hit up red lobster, if you want some great seafood, hit up n. phoenix to pappadeaux(worth the drive and time, will never be dissatisfied)Lesson Learned. :-(I've been driving by this place for a long time every time I go into Tempe Marketplace and was always curious about this place. So today I decided at the last minute to give this place a try. The place is very modern looking and my son commented that it was something like a boat house. I could somewhat see that with lots of wood and pictures of fish. Anyways, they started us off with  sour dough bread and butter. I always love sour dough bread and it was very good. For appetizers we had fried calamari and a few cups of clam chowder. The calamari were huge pieces with a very flakey batter on it. Excellent. Really enjoyed it. The clam chowder was gobbled up by my wife without no complaints. I tried it and was pretty good. For our main course, I had the Ono fish with rosemary potatoes and mac and cheese. Ono fish is somewhat like the swordfish which is a little dry so overall I thought my meal was good. Loved the Mac and cheese with the rosemary potatoes. My wife had the Mahi-Mahi with spinach and carrots. Her meal was really good. This fish was very tender and juicy. Cooked perfect. She enjoyed it. My son had the linguini with clams and he gobbled it up so he really enjoyed it. My mom ordered the full fried catfish and when they say full. They mean full. Head and tail included. Huge catfish which was bigger than the plate but she ate it all and thought it was really good. So overall, we had a good meal. Service was good. Our server kept filling our water cups up all the time and the food came out in a timely manner. All I can say is huge portions, good food, good service and we will be back again. Enjoy.I came here for "easy hour" a while back with my ladies and what can I say...At 5pm on a Friday, business was crazy busy!  We waited around for about 30 minutes before we were seated.  The wait time isn't so bad when you're guzzling pina colados and bloody marys with great company.  When we finally were seated, we ordered two oyster samplers, the baja ceviche fish cocktail, a garden salad with Caesar dressing on the side[my friend is quirky like that], a hot seafood combo, and the macadamia nut crusted Alaskan halibut.  The oysters were delicious and the ceviche was refreshing.  The salad had ranch dressing poured all over it even though we had asked for Caesar dressing on the side.  When we asked our waitress about this, she apologized and said she'll bring us a new salad in 5mins which actually came out 20mins later after a reminder from my friend.  Oh well.  It's just salad and it *was* pretty busy.  The seafood combo was very flavorful and delicious but the biggest disappointment was the overcooked halibut.  I was most excited for the halibut so when I ate a fork full of dried fish, I was pretty sullen.My overall experience with King's Fish House wasn't too bad but I think I'll just stick with drinks and oysters the next time I stop by.

Restaurant name  Island Sushi & Grill
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
The search continues to find a good AYCE sushi restaurant in Vegas...and Island Sushi and Grill has been getting quite a lot of attention as of late.We had to see what the fuss was all about as well, so we came on a Monday night to enjoy their $24.95/pp AYCE sushi dinner.  (Lunch is $20.99/pp.)  When you first walk through the doors, you'll find yourself at a walk up counter.  This is just the 'grill' part of the restaurant serving up lots of Hawaiian plate options.  If you make a right, you'll enter the 'sushi' part of Island Sushi and Grill and if you want AYCE, this is where you want to be.After being seated and our beverage orders were taken, the waitress came by to ask if we wanted to start with any appetizers.  She also gave us a sheet and pen to fill out for our nigiri and sushi roll options.  Appetizers: * Ahi Belly, Garlic Pepper Sauce (limit one order per person) - A small portion, but tasty!* Ahi Poki - Pretty good!* Deep Fried Geso - Our favorite was the deep fried baby octopus.  It comes in an order of three with a dipping sauce.  Pretty good stuff!* Edamame* Garlic Chicken* Hamachi Kama (limit one order per person)* Pork Gyoza* Raw Crab Poke (limit one order per person)* Tako Kim Chee Poke (limit one order per person)Nigiri - They do give you small pieces of fish on small mounds of rice, which is a good thing. It's AYCE after all, so you can order more.  But it can be discouraging when you first see it.* Albacore* Amaebi (limit one order per person)* Garlic Tuna* Hamachi * Hirame* Ika* Ikura* Saba* Sake* Scallop Mayo* Tai* Uni (limit one order per person)Things we forgot to order because we were so full: Eggplant Fries, Fried Tofu Poke, Lomi Salmon, Mochiko Chicken, and Salmon Kama.Everyone seems to rave about their rolls, but we're not big on rolls with just the two of us.  So, we didn't have any.  But if we were with a larger party, there were definitely a few that we would consider.I wouldn't say their sushi is the highest quality, but I think people come because they do have a few other items like mochiko chicken, garlic chicken deep friend baby octopus, ahi poke, raw crab, tako kim chee poke, etc.  Like many AYCE sushi joints in Vegas, it's about what appetizers and cooked items are offered as well.They are quite specific about any charges for leftover food - $1 for nigiri and $3 for an 8 piece roll.  So take you time when ordering, especially if you're ordering rolls.   You are limited on one dessert option per person.  Everyone talks about the 808 Special, so we got one of those.  It's a deep-fried banana, ice cream, fresh strawberries, whipped cream, and chocolate sauce.  But our favorite was the Malasada Sundae.  One very delicious malasada cut into four pieces, ice cream, whipped cream, and guava(?) sauce.Service was quite efficient and the waitresses were friendly.  We didn't have to wait long at all for any of our orders, which is definitely a plus.  Beverages were refilled without having to ask and any empty plates were cleared quickly as well, so no complaints about service at all.They also offer a frequent eater card, ten AYCE and you get one free.What makes this place a real locals' place is all the specials they offer.  You can tell there are a lot of regulars here - families, couples, singles, etc.  Some are here for the grill menu to go or the sit down sushi.  Happy Hour: 50% off all sushi rolls + drinks specialsMondays to Saturdays: 3:00 PM - 5:00 PM, 9:00 PM - CloseSunday: 3:00 PM - 5:00 PM, 8:00 PM - CloseLadies' Night: Drink Specials OnlyWednesdays: 3:00 PM - CloseDrink Specials: $3.00 Large Beer$2.25 Hot Sake$4.00 Saketini$1.50 Small Beer$2.00 Sake BombSushi & Pupu (Appetizer) Brunch: AYCE sushi plus Hawaiian pupu menu for $20.95Sundays: 11:30 AM - 3:00 PMToday we wanted to take a trek to Henderson area to visit a friend. I've been wanting to try this and it's right by their house (lucky them!). With so many AYCE places, it's hard to pick and choose. Even having tried many, I couldn't really pick a "best", but had more of they're all good, but here's the pros and cons of each particular place kind of answer (IE- some have bomb apps but meh sushi, great nigiri but rolls and apps are boring). I'll go on a limb that this is the best that I've had since it meets a lot of points. First point- appetizers are interesting, and have a wide variety. Sure, sure. Come for nigiri to get "moneys worth" but it gets a bit repetitive that way. I think I get my worth through the variety of foods I get to eat. Ahi Belly with Pepper Garlic- the sauce was light but not overwhelming that you can't taste the fish melty, fatty yumminess or the nice char.Deep Fried Geso- delicious!! perfectly cooked baby octopus is always a favorite for me.Salmon Lomi- it was just okay. It was more tomatos than anything.Ahi Poke- very nice version. ordered 2!Tako Kimchee- nice thin sliced octopus stirred in with kimchee.Hamachi Kama- I love kama and theirs had such a good char and perfectly crispy skinNigiri- the fish was fresh. The plus to me was that they do nigiri smaller than average (dont worry- the rice to fish ratio is very fairly proportional). Now some people might be taken aback since were all used to largesse given in cuts but, the smaller cut is perfectly bite sized and gives the opportunity to sample more variety. Some of these restaurants serve a two bite nigiri and with the BFs braces and jaw he dislikes how he has to bite in half and break it to eat. Standouts:Escolar/Super White Tuna- pretty good. Cajun Albacore- very nice seasoning and ponzu sauceCajun Tuna- this has the seasoning and then has a wasabi aioli which was quite unique and goodYellowtail- this is one of my favorite fish and it was very freshAll the rest were good too. Only one that was just okay was the mackerel which had a bit of a salty quality to it that isn't the norm.  We also got a special chef creation which was also a highlight of the night- it was a thin slab of rice on nori that was toasted to a crispy cake and topped with spicy chunks of tuna, thin slab of avocado, a dot of siracha, and a sweet sauce- probably eel sauce. It was very nice textures and flavors together. Rolls- not usually into rolls but only because most places its 90% california roll with different toppings and sauce. Boring. They had some interesting rolls. We tried The Croc which combined a few favorite elements- it has some spice, it has soft shell crab, sweetness from some unagi. Pretty good. I would have gotten more, but between just the two of us, whole rolls is a lot to eat and we wanted variety. Next time when we bring our friends to share with. They don't do half rolls, except on your very last roll you want to order.  I kept getting my favorite handroll though- salmon skin which is lovely here. Dessert- not just the standard ice cream or mochi, though they do offer that too. They have a malasada sundae, the 808 special and creme brulee. We got the malasada which was yummy and the creme brulee had nice flavors but it wasnt so solid as it should, more runny, but it was still good. I like that this place can satisfy appetizer people, nigiri people, roll people and even dessert people. It's that reason why I think this is my favorite that we can bring all types of ayce people and their needs can be met. It's $24.95, cheaper by a few bucks than most dinner ayce and I think has better quality than those that hit the $30 mark. They give you 90 minutes which I don't really need, but I just like places where they're not timing you....I think here they realize people like to pace and sometimes, you're just waiting for food since it's all made-to-order stuff. Did I mention the hospitality? The sushi chef/owner was very attentive, talkative and seems very cool. The staff never even let our ice teas hit halfway and came to check on us a few times to see if we want more appetizers from the kitchen. Oooh if I lived on this side of town I will come by all the time! Since I don't, we just have to make day trips to Henderson more often! Onolicious food, Hawaiian hospitality- whats not to love?!  ALOHA!Aloha LV Yelpers!Came to Island Sushi about 3 years ago when I was visiting Vegas... stopped by to pick up a plate lunch to go... 3 years later... I'm back at Island Sushi as a Las Vegas resident! Came here the other night... AYCE!!!I'm a huge fan! Everything I love from seaweed salad, poke, lomi salmon, mochiko chicken, garlic chicken, teri beef, malasada, coco puffs, unique rolls with fun names... I'm sold!I wish I.S. was closer to me... I would be there weekly for sure! If you're looking for Hawaiian food and sushi with a local twist... Island Sushi is the hot spot!I feel at home when I'm here... locals everywhere... Big Island pictures on the wall... including Hilo my hometown... one of the girls working there as a server is from Hilo... I love being around Hawaii people!I'll be back for my Hawaiian fix... AYCE works for me! A must while in Vegas!Mahalo Island Sushi!-Miss Yelp 2011My Island Sushi cherry has officially been popped! My cousins have been telling me to try this place out for months, and finally we all got together to feast!! (I was the only newbie).WHERE: Located on Eastern & Serene.WHAT: As a first-timer, I had to do AYCE!! Wouldn't it be a waste if I didn't eat all I could?!! Ok so back to my experience.  I am in love with baked rolls, and the only downside to this place was that AYCE did not have ANY baked rolls whatsoever! I was bummed at first, but when I tried what they did have, my "bummness level" decreased.WHAT I HAD:The appetizers I had were: ahi poke (I might have to say that this is one of the best I've tasted in town! It was very fresh and tasty), mochiko chicken (ahh, I fell in love after the first bite!), seaweed salad (sweet & delishhhh), and baked mussels (always one of my favorites when on any menu).Special Sushi rolls I had:-Mt. Charleston roll; Since they didn't have baked rolls, they did have baked scallops on this roll.  I had to take advantage because this was the closest thing to baked that I'd be getting that night. Haha, when I did get my roll, I was very pleased!-Ahi Poke roll; I apparently couldn't get enough of the tuna in my system, I needed more! Kudos to this roll though =).-Island Special roll; this roll was my all time favorite! Everyone must have this! It hit the spot indeed.*NOTE: if you do decide to do AYCE, you get to choose a free dessert! I always have room for dessert in my tummy =D. There were malasada&icecream, brownie&icecream, just plain icecream, mochi, and I believe there were a couple more.  I settled for my mango mochi of course.WHY: A lot of people have been comparing Island Sushi to 808 Sushi (because of the whole owner/chef switch, I actually am not so clear of it myself), but I have personally come to conclude that Island Sushi defeats 808 Sushi in my book."Whoa, do all the ladies from Hawaii look like this?" my poker buddy ask while showing me his phone."ummmm....what?" I say, lost, looking past the beautiful wahine and trying to see the food on the website."Maybe she works there.  If the next flop is red, you're buying lunch" my bud says excitedly."Book it." I say and the rest is history.It's the usual, great Vegas AYCE place.  Super creative rolls filled with lots of deep fried stuff (soft shell crab, shrimp tempura), stuff mixed with spicy mayo, usually coated with a sweet, teriyaki eel sauce.   Most of the fish taste previously frozen or gassed.  All good though if you skip the nigiri.What sets this place apart is the local Hawaiian style flavors.  Paniolo roll (teri beef inside, miso sauce, outside) and the poke roll (as its name implies).  Only disappointment, the Maui Wowie. Dang it. (You're a better person if you don't get it.)Oh yeah, plate lunches are as good as back home.  Local style mochiko chicken, teri beef, mixed plates, and fried noodle combos.  Usual AYCE prices.  Lunch $21, Dinner $25.  All day happy hour with 50% off all rolls (not the AYCE) Mon - Wed. for the lighter eater.  Plate lunches are very reasonable averaging $7.50.Great place when you're jonesing for a taste of Hawaii.This review is for the sushi portion of dinner. The restaurant is located on Eastern past Serene, but before Richmar. If you get up to BJs, you've gone too far. Inside of the restaurant is sectioned off in to two areas. Entrance area seems to be designated for traditional Hawaiian grilled dishes, and the area thru the door on the right is the sit down sushi area. We came here on a Friday night and it was packed. They do have a wide selection of AYCE sushi and many sides to choose from (although the sides appear to be half of what you'd get if you were ordering a la carte).The AYCE menu has two symbols that denote different things. Chopsticks next to the item indicate it is a dinner only item, while the sushi icon indicates it is one order per person.  The rolls were fine and fish relatively fresh. One thing to note is their speciality rolls were in fact not drenched in Yum sauce or mayo concoctions of any sort. A lot of what we ordered had their garlic sauce on the roll itself, and I wasn't a fan. It tasted like gin ...I know strange.  We sample several rolls: Joe's Special, Black Widow, Spicy Mexican, Lava Lover, Lasagna, Surf and Turf. I also had their scallop mayo and salmon nigiri. The salmon was fresh, the scallop mayo was very bland and forgettable. My favorite roll of the group was Spicy Mexican, the rest were decent, but nothing I would rush to eat again.The service was fine, minus the initial hiccup. It took a little over 20 minutes to get our first three rolls to the table. I know that it wasn't our servers fault, and it was pretty packed in there. They didn't bring it out roll by roll so we had food coming throughout, instead they waited for all rolls to be made before they brought them out. I guess it makes more sense that way, especially with being so packed.  So although, famished by the time we got the food, I won't hold it against them.I would recommend this place is you want more simple, non yum sauce heavy rolls with fresh fish and friendly service.3 star service but I actually like this place! I've eaten next door multiple times for the Hawaiian food and came with friends to get poke but never got around trying the AYCE here..Looks run down and outdated which had me iffy about the place before .. But it was the closes sushi joint from the gym so I gave them a chance.We ordered..Puhi Maki Roll (daily special) - spicy soft shell crab, assorted fish on top with garlic ponzu sauce (Very Tasty!)Salmon Skin Handrolls - crispy salmon skin, just enough sauce and not too much rice wrapped in seaweed (DELICIOUS!)Raw Crab Poke - fiancé got this, looked appetizing and plentiful but I wasn't daring enough to try it..Eggplant Fries - crispy, sliced, battered eggplant came with Spicy Miso Sauce, which I think didn't really compliment it, but I'm one who doesn't really care for dipping sauces.Baked Salmon Roll - it was good but nothing special about it, loved that it didn't have so much rice nor cheese on top! Tofu Poke - so simple, yet sooo good! Fried tofu in their poke sauce with onions! (SOOO GOOD! Lol)Malasada Sundae - the malasada (aka Hawaiian donut) tasted like cardboard, was dry and seemed like it's been sitting there for days.. Strawberries were sweet and the vanilla ice cream.. Was just ice cream.. Not a fan.Sushi chefs were attentive but the waiters/waitresses were not.. Service was slow from the waiters, i.e. took almost an hour to get my eggplant fries.. Bit of a turn off..Overall satisfied with my meal and will def come back for the salmon skin handroll and tofu poke!I remember when this place used to be my favorite sushi restaurant in town, Koto. I've given this place a few tries. The food has improved but the service has not. AYCE susi with a taste of Hawaii. Hawaiians are known for being laidback and friendly. There were plenty of empty tables when we got there yet, we had to wait for a table. Really? We placed out order. Some items took forever but some we never got. I guess our previous server was finishing up his shift but didn't notify us. We tried a few nigiri, rolls, teri beef sliders, garlic edamame, ahi poke, salmon katsu and malassadas. We didn't order that much but we spent 2 hours total here.Lunch AYCE is from 11:30am-4pm for $21.95 and dinner AYCE is from 4pm-close for $26.95. There are certain items that are only available for dinner, limit 1/person, 2 desserts/person and there's a 90-minute limitfor AYCE. With service slower than molasses, you'll easily go over 90 minutes! The food was good but the service really turned us off. My boyfriend is very calm and laidback and for him to even say something about the service says a lot. The female server was borderline rude. No smile on her face, no nothing. The servers don't even look up to see if anyone in the restaurant needs something. They walk around with their head down or pretending to be busy. 3 servers and 5 tables, c'mon!Solid place to get local Hawaiian food and poke!I've been coming here quite often to get my sweet taste of home here in Henderson and I do approve! I mean nothing beats some of the joints back at home, but this place is great!If you are every craving poke or Hawaiian or local food (yes, there is a difference between Hawaiian and local food), then this is a wonderful spot to go to. I've been to both the plate lunch side and the sushi side and both are great dining options. The sushi side is especially good during happy hour where all of the rolls are 50% off! I believe happy hour is Mon-Wed all day! It's a great deal for delicious sushi. They also have an AYCE option but I've never tried it yet since I usually just go for happy hour!As for the plate lunch side, I've had the bento boxes (which are really filling) and the spicy tuna bowl which I am a fan of, especially the taro chips inside.The poke is also not bad. I really enjoyed the spicy tuna avocado one. The fish was good quality and had a nice texture but I wished there were more fish/avocado and less of the spicy mayo. The parking lot can sometimes get crowded as can the restaurant so try and come early or later in the evening. Also, the sushi side of the restaurant does take reservations so call ahead if you can and know that you have a big party!I've heard mixed things about this sushi spot over the years, so I finally ventured over with my OG for some all you can eat sushi action and see for myself.The wait was pretty long but they were able to seat us quickly if we sat at the bar. The restaurant is very small and cramped. The seating was especially tight at the bar. I figured sitting at the bar, service would be better since we had direct access to the sushi chef, but I was wrong. It was hard to get his attention to order anything and there was a number of items we ordered and never received. The service from the kitchen was the same. Slow and on several occasions they brought out what we ordered to another table only to let us know and we were forced to wait a little longer for our items. The service issues were enough to make me not interested in returning, but the food didn't really do it for me either. No standouts and almost every dish was something I've had better versions of at other sushi restaurants.I've had this place bookmarked for a few weeks now and decided to try it yesterday. My friend just got back in town and we wanted to catch up over sushi and sake. I Love Sushi (also on Eastern) is our usual go to but I suggested to be adventurous and try somewhere new!When you first walk in I believe you're in Poke Express, a separate quick service restaurant inside Island Sushi. There is a place to order to the left and casual seating straight ahead. To the right is an entrance that opens up to Island Sushi which is a pretty small restaurant. We waited to be seated and the host said it would be about 30 min for a table. We decided to get started on sake at the bar and was seated at a table shortly after. We weren't starving so we ordered a la carte rather than AYCE. I had the spicy garlic edamame, tuna poke, and a spicy tuna hand roll. The tuna wasn't very fresh in either of my tuna entrees. Hand roll was pretty tasteless, so I doused it in soy sauce/wasabi. The tuna poke was highly disappointing!! It wasn't flavorful and the texture of the tuna honestly felt like it sat out for a few hours. Some pieces were dry and chewier than the norm. The tuna was on a bed of seaweed salad, which was also dry. SO dry that when I tried to gather some seaweed salad with my chopsticks, I picked up ALL of the seaweed salad in an large chunk instead. The spicy garlic edamame wasn't bad, but didn't taste extraordinary enough to make me want to come back to this place...No complaints with the service, however, the dishes I tried here weren't memorable or enjoyable. Doubtful I'll return.Superb Sushi!It's pretty ridiculous how much I enjoyed their sushi.  We decided to try them for lunch since it was recommended by friends. The right side of the restaurant opens at 11:30.  We chose to sit at the sushi counter in front of chef Jason.  He was friendly and quick in preparation.  We had a great lunch thanks to him! Since they have AYCE, it worked best for us to try several different creations.  Jason suggested the Hamachi which is yellowtail.  In the first bite there was a unique flavor.  We asked him what it was.  They combine orange and lemon into the yellowtail for this distinct flavor.  We immediately loved it.  The 007 was our second choice.  Crab and cucumber topped with shrimp, avocado and eel sauce certainly made this a winner.  The Island Special with soft shell crab topped with spicy tuna, spicy aioli and eel sauce did not disappoint.  Incredible flavors from each roll this far! The cherry on top was our final order of the Baked Salmon.  This is a California roll topped with cream cheese, salmon and dynamite.  It just melted in your mouth.  I cannot wait to come back and try some of their other choices.  I have a feeling I'm going to enjoy every bite.Recently I have been an adventurous eater set out to explore the Hawaiian restaurants in the ninth island of Las Vegas. It all started with a few visits to L&L Barbecue that got me hooked on the Hawaiian plate lunch. On a couple of recent weekends, my adventures in dining led me to Island Sushi and Grill.    Island Sushi and Grill is located along the thriving Eastern Avenue Corridor south of Interstate 215 between the signalized Serene and Richmar intersections on the east side. It is in a small shopping center that doesn't draw much attention to the business. The first impression of Island Sushi and Grill from the outside is that it is a fancy sushi restaurant. It is a false impression because inside Island Sushi and Grill is a diverse dining experience.    Island Sushi and Grill is really two different restaurants that are divided into two rooms. The first room when you enter is a Hawaiin restaurant with pastries and take out sushi. There are a few long tables and two counters. The counter close to the door is where you order the Hawaiin food. The counter toward the back by the condiments and beverage machine is the sushi counter. The room to the right is a full service restaurant offering sushi and other entrees. In summary Island Sushi and Grill is a restaurant specializing in two areas of food: sushi and Hawaiin food. Pertaining to my experiences I experienced the plate lunch dinners on my two visits prior to penning this review/reporting of experiences.    On visit number one, I exchanged around $10 for a garlic chicken plate lunch with fountain beverage then a week later on visit number two, I exchanged around $10 on a chicken with eggplant plate lunch with fountain beverage. Being that they are plate lunches they included white rice and macaroni salad. The food was served in a styrofoam box that I brought to the table after they called my order. On both visits the chicken met my expectations. For safe measure, I added schirachi sauce to it just as I added soy sauce to the rice. L&L has far better macaroni salad and Ross J's  Aloha Hawaiian Barbecue serves far larger portions. This is the first restaurant that my food adventures led me that offered chicken with eggplant. It seemed to be chicken over eggplant with a lot of white rice around it and a little cup of macaroni salad nearby.    Being an adventurous eater, I foresee many more restaurants to explore. Before I set sail for further dining adventures, my report on dining two times in Island Sushi and Grill is that it is a three star  experience.

Restaurant name  Penn's Thai House
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Sunset Thai House has taken first place in my heart for Thai in Las Vegas and Henderson. This quaint restaurant is nestled in a spot which most would overlook. Not for long cause  the mutha effin Goonies just discovered the cave of Thai treasures! Do the Truffle Shuffle! Every dish I've had here has been golden.The restaurant is nicely decorated and kept clean and pristine by the friendly staff. I have dined in, but now prefer to order takeout so I can enjoy the flavorgasms in the comfort of my flannel pjs parked in front of the telly. Both ways my orders have been handled quickly and accurately. Now to the good part. The food.FIVE GOLDEN RINGS!!! Or Golden Stars in the Yelp World. FYI- For you Heat Lovers like moi just know if you say HOT it's gonna be H-O-T. If you say Firecracker Hot you will be shootin' fireworks out of your bungholio after. No joke. Also they are closed on Sundays.*Egg rolls-  Bangin' with flavor. I can thank these bad boys for that added inch to my waistline this month, but it's the holiday season so who's counting?*Panang with Beef- The best Panang I've ever had! Blows those other places in Commercial Center out of the water. If Sunset was in a knife fight with my ex Archi, Archi would leave in a body bag. Just sayin'. If you come here and you like curry this dish is a MUST.*Spicy Chili Chicken- On point with heat from the sliced peppers and complexity of flavor in the sauce. Me like. *Chicken Pad Thai- A simple dish done very well. In the future this might be added to all of our orders.*Crispy Garlic Chicken- I refer to this beauty as Funnel Cake Chicken with a kick. The chicken is almost candied and oh so crisp. I have craved it's goodness hourly since I killed the last of it Saturday morning. This dish is my Precious and satisfies both my need for heat and sweet.If I was wealthy enough to employ a private chef it would be the talented owner/chef of Sunset Thai House without a doubt. Five Stars all the way. Now race your Yelpy butts down here and get your Thai on!First things first, I gotta give a shout out to my girl Jaime W. for telling me about Penn's Thai House! It's not our #1 pick for thai food in Vegas (nothing beats Komol for my hubby!!) but it's really close to our house and the Penn (the owner) is fabulous. The location isn't the best, but that can be said about some of the other fantastic thai places in town, like those in Commercial Center. This isn't a fine dining establishment by any means. Aesthetically, the place could use a little work.  But for people that like take out, Penn's is fab! Unlike some places in town, when you request your meal hot at Penn's, you are going to get it hot... regardless of your ethnic background. My husband likes his food HOT, to the extent that he will break out in a sweat halfway thru his meal if it was done right.. Not only has he always been happy with the heat factor on the food he has ordered from Penn's, but the owner goes above and beyond and will package up containers of the different spices and chilis so if he needs a little extra OOMPH, he can add it. She does this without us asking, just because she remembers his request for hot food from the very first time we went in.I am not a big fan of spicy foods, in fact I'd go as far as to say I am a wussy when it comes to the heat. Penn's still keeps me happy with their delicious egg rolls, tasty stir fries and, mmm is there thai tea ever good! If you find yourself out in Henderson, craving some spicy thai grub, give Penn's a try.Penn's you are that pair of jeans that just seems to get better and better with every wash. Thai masterpieces keep consistently coming out of this kitchen.FACTS: I have taken over fifteen close friends to Penn's and every single one of them have been back two or more times. I've also never been disappointed with the spice level or overall delivery of anything I've been served here. That being said, the past two months most times I have gotten takeout and it's still on point.Latest faves here are the Cashew Chicken, Tom Kha, Pad Thai and as of this evening the Pad Woon Sen. That dish actually inspired me to write an update. The balance of spice level HOT with the coolness of mass amounts of veggies like baby corns, celery and tomatoes mixed with glass noodles and seasoned eggs rocked my freakin world tonight and has been added into the rotation. Pad Woon Senhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sUXs9ATmb423TcxgtMalzQ?select=rQ7FSaL5ggQupO_DAD7LQg#MyzsS1JQ39DVzYJQWSRxlAPenn's has only gotten better with time. Read the press or read my reviews, but I am not the only one throwing props to this place. They even take the time now to make designs out of the straws. For a small fee or a Nordstroms gift card I will gladly show you how she does it. (Mine come out like Special Olympics straw art a lil' bit, but I'm working on it.) The service and food are FIVE STARS every time for me. Tip: If you have been here ONCE and maybe not had a five star experience, please give them another shot. This place is a treasure from every angle and I personally cannot find fault. If you don't feel the same than just take your ass back to Applebees for a REAL meal. I take zero credit for discovering this treasure. I will forever be grateful to the foodie who turned me on to Penn's and also to Penn for letting me explore the incredible world of Thai cuisine through her dishes.I don't how to really write this one, but here goes. Have you ever had food that was so good that it literally made you forget about everything else? Have you ever left a restaurant smiling from ear to ear and feeling like you're floating on air because it was so damn good? I did that today at Penn's. Just when I thought it couldn't get any better I followed Jaime W's advice and tried the Pad Woon Sen. In the past I've had bad experiences with noodle dishes and it's been almost 9 years since I ate my last one that was similar to this one. The wait was worth it because this dish truly exceeded any and all expectations I had. Screw this nice writing crap, it was totally freakin awesome. Ok, these are supposed to be fair and balanced reviews and after today, any chance of being fair and balanced towards Penn's is hopelessly gone. I'm flat out in love with this place and their food. Resistance is stupid and leaves you hungry, I give in, I'm hooked, and this case is closed. 5 Stars earned, re-earned, and validated over and over again. It's at the point I take family here. I'll pay for their dinner just to get them to try it. I'll need to become a reverend so I can preach about how good this place is. While YMMV: Your mileage may vary, for me, this is truly as good as it gets. I have never had a food experience that comes close to what I've experienced here. Yeah, seriously, I really think it's worthy of the praise.I've had this place bookmarked for a while. After trying it this past week, I'm already looking forward to going back for more wonderful Thai food.We ordered pad see ew with shrimp, cashew nut with chicken, and their crispy garlic chicken, along with a Thai iced tea. They had a copy of a newspaper feature at the entrance that was done on their restaurant. They raved about their food, and I know why. The pad see ew wasn't like many noodle dishes you get from, where the noodles are either very greasy with oil, or the noodles are just stuck together with a bland sauce. The crispy garlic chicken - I try not to eat much fried food, but it was so delicious, I gobbled this chicken up! I think the only thing I didn't particularly care for was the chicken cashew nut. It was tasty, yet the sauce was watery and the serving was quite small, made with more cashew nuts than chicken. However, their menu has good selections to choose from and very decent lunch specials.This place is definitely off-the-beaten path, in a corner of a deserted strip mall close to Gibson. But if you're in Henderson close to the 95 or Sunset, I'd highly recommend coming here for Thai food. Our server was very personable and patient, even when I was very indecisive about what to order, which happens to me a lot! I'll come back for their panang curry soon...I got greedy.  I monopolized the duchess Jaime W. at Penn's Thai!  We met today for a girl's night out spicy food style, and this was quite the satisfier.  Jaime was sportin' a new 'do and of course the server and the owner greeted her like family.  Apparently her a/c in her car is shifty and Penn's husband, owner of the car joint next door, came for her keys to check out her car while we dined.  Now that's service!Jaime W. suggested trying the beef nam tok salad, pad woon sen (we got tofu), and panang curry (chicken) - though she had good word to say about everything on the menu she had already tried.  It made narrowing our options hard.  I really want to try the spicy eggplant next time!The beef salad was very delicious, thinly sliced beef and red onions on lettuce with tomatoes, carrot strands, cilantro, cucumbers, and a spicy lime dressing.  The pad woon sen included glass noodles, fried tofu triangles, baby corn, tomato, green onion, and other veggies - deliciously spicy.  Our panang had a thickness that was sooo good (too many watery curries being served these days)  and great peanut taste, and was served with plenty of steaming hot rice.I also enjoyed a Thai iced tea which was tasty.  We had just the right amount of heat in all of the dishes (an assortment of hot and medium) and also had plenty of spicy condiments already on the table if needed.  The service was great and I talked to Penn about my trip to Thailand last year, especially about Chiang Rai near her family.In the end, we had so many leftovers.  Jaime W. took the salad and I got the curry and noodles (load me on those carbs baby!) so I have my lunches covered for the next 2 days.  Best advice: try this place if you haven't.  Even better advice: dine with Jaime!  Lunch specials M-F, but the prices are right for dinner and there are many dishes to try!  I will be back, and hopefully with Jaime!I can't say I was as blown away by the food as many of the reviewers were, but the food was well above average. We got there a little bit before they were going to close, so my experience may have been lessened by the fact that i had to rush and shove the food in my face as quickly as possible. The girl working there was super nice and genuinely interested in feedback and our experience at the restaurant. I had the pad woon sen and boyfriend had pad kee mao. His dish was a lot better. Mine was good but fell a bit short in the flavor department -- it was plain and the chicken was dry and tasteless. The pad kee mao was good with just the right amount of heat. I did not care to try the curries because after making my own, I realized how idiot proof making a delicious curry really is. In flavor department Naga wins out by a high margin, but service wise Penns definitely wins. I will go back and sample more of their dishes.Many restaurants can crank out good food for customers who sit down to eat. But the equation changes dramatically when it comes to carryout food as horror stories abound. Once again Penns hit a grand slam in my book with a carryout order of Cashew Nut Chicken and Thai Iced Tea that even after making the 20 min ride home was absolutely perfect in every way. The container was foil lined and wrapped in plastic to prevent spills too. It's the little things that make the difference. Service....for a Sunday night was a little aloof. I asked about egg rolls and the lady working kind of had an attitude so I skipped ordering any. Still Penn's placement on my Best of Las Vegas list and at 5 Stars is in no danger of changing anytime soon.Cold Food = A Cardinal Sin. And Penn's committed that today around lunch time. I went in for lunch at about 12:30 and ordered Chili Mint Chicken off the lunch menu and Thai Iced Tea. The tea was good...as always. The eggdrop soup was hot and very good as it typically is. Then they bring out my main plate...and it's barely lukewarm. By the time I put some soy sauce on my rice and mix everything up it's cold. And by the time I finished the plate as I had to eat something, it was definitely cold. I said something about this to the staff and at first they were like you could have added more heat from the spices they brought to the table. That much is true, but that's not the heat I wanted. I want something that has some physical heat...the kind that comes from an open flame under an open pot or wok of what is normally some of the best Thai food in Vegas without question. My disappointment is expressed in a 2 Star drop...There's a lot of things for a place to get wrong but if you can't even properly cook the food and serve it at an appropriate temperature you've got a fundamental problem that must be addressed.First off, thanks to Yelpers in the recent Thai Talk threads for this find!  This Thai restaurant is listed among the top of several Yelpers who's opinion I trust.  Once again, I was not steered wrong!  I managed to get a few friends to eat family style at this Thai restaurant  this afternoon (is there any other way to eat Thai food?).  We ordered Thai Iced Tea, Tom Kha Khi, Pineapple Fried Rice, Panang with Beef, Lad Na with Pork, Garlic Chicken, and Papaya Salad.  All dishes ranged a 4-4.5 for me!The Thai Iced Tea was not that sweet, and very bold in herbal tea flavor.  Yum.  The Tom Kha was really, really good.  While not the best in town, it was probably the dish I enjoyed the most.   It was creamy, yet savory and lightly sour at the same time.  The complexity of the flavors played off of one another brilliantly.  The mushrooms and chicken were excellently prepared as well.  My second favorite dish was the Beef Panang (thanks, Jade!).  It had a strong, bold flavor for a Panang, with just the tiniest hint of peanut.  It was rather thick as well, and very hardy.  Mixed with the minced Garlic Chicken, it really made the lunch.  The flavor profile was one of the most complex (yet balanced) I have had for a Panang!    The Papaya Salad and Pineapple Fried Rice were pretty good, but not completely mind blowing to me.  The Papaya Salad had an excellent balance of flavor, but both dishes were a little lack luster.  The Pineapple Fried Rice was a tad bit on the soggy side, and was just a little bit boring.  No worries though, everything else rocked!The Lad Nah with Pork, while again not the best in town, was expertly prepared.  The gravy had a nice thick consistency with beautiful savory flavors.  With added chili peppers and fresh Chinese Broccoli, it was also one of my favorites of the meal.  Overall, this is probably the best Thai restaurant on this side of town.  Not all of the dishes wow'ed me enough to give it a 5 though, and I thought the portions were a little small.  However, if I am on this side of town and am in need of good Thai food, this will be my spot!Oh what a difference a year makes. One year ago I loved Penn's Thai House. The awesome Jaime W. recommended this place, and she was right in recommending them. Penn's was good, so good that I went outside of my comfort zone to try different textures and flavors that I never thought I'd try. Lunch, dinner, persuading my family to pay a bit more and give them a try, I had Penn's at 5 stars and showed my support with my feet walking in the door and spending $50 minimum on my night orders and giving 25% tips for lunch.That was then. The love I had for Penn's has been crushed. I visited about 2 months ago hoping to rekindle the love and happy Thai food experience I missed. Instead the food made my family sick and my sister in law said never again. I would pass over Sunset on the 95 and look over at the green neon at night...And wish for the old days. Then came word of Penn's making it onto the dreaded Channel 13 Dirty Dining segment. I read the story, SNHD said Penn's hired a top food safety expert to clean them up. I found myself craving good spicy Thai...and through strange circumstances I found myself with 45 minutes to spare and I'm 3 blocks away. Off I went...would I be able to find happiness again? Had the expert done his job? This is Vegas, sometimes you gotta take a chance....The building is the same, but the soulless lunch plate of chili mint chicken and boring egg roll and circa 1980 school cafeteria grade egg drop soup left no doubt in my mind that the Penn's I loved was gone. Tack on the extra $1 for using a debit card under $10 and service that was cold and aloof and when I walked out the door I said I was done. I believe in redemption and giving second chances. Penn's got that opportunity...and they blew it. When it was good, it warranted placement on my Mythical 6th Star list. Now it's just a waste of commercial space. Better alternatives are less than 15 minutes away. You would be better off to use the Yelp app and find them. 1 Star, under protest....what a shame.How has a review not been written about this place? Thai food is not one of the cuisines that I will go out of my way for. Yet when I do crave it or think about it, Penn's is one of the restaurants that sticks out in my mind the most. I tend to get the same thing every time. The crispy garlic chicken is crack. The crisp and light outer shell does not get soggy in the tangy and sweet garlic sauce. I could eat this for days. I wish that I could justify doing so. The pad thai is good. I like that it is not super sweet. The massaman curry is delicious. I try to vary my ordering habits, but it is so difficult to change from certain items. I keep wanting to save room for these famous green tea buns, but I tend to be out of luck. The two times that I have been here, they have always ran out. Maybe I should just elevate my chances of success by going more often.More like 3.5 stars rounded up based on my experience. First of of all, they are located in kind of an obscure place alongside other businesses. If you werent actually looking for this place you will have never known these guys were here. When you come in the place does not look like a typical Thai setting. You know like some kind of Buddhist doll statue or painting of some sort. I do admit though their menu is nicely organized and has pictures for your visual reference.I came for lunch so specials for this time frame is what I look for. They have a decent section on the menu for 6.95. Your choice of entree whether its pad thai, chow mein, chili mint, etc. Then you choose the type of meat whether its pork, beef, chicken, or tofu. Comes with eggdrop soup, eggroll, and steamed rice. Refer to my pic for the complete details.What I got was Mongolian Chicken. The Eggdrop Soup came in a standard small cup. It was hot and flavorful. Would of been even better if it was my soup of choice which is Hot n Sour. The Eggroll was really good. Crispy on the outside with accompanied by the semi crispiness of the veggies inside. Dipped in the sweet chili sauce it comes in only makes it taste better. As for the main course, I thought it had good flavor to it. The carrots were cooked just right where it's still a bit crispy but soft enough to chew easily. Only thing lacking I thought was the portion size.Since I had my eye on the tofu appetizer, I ended up getting that because I was not yet quite full and my love for tofu will always be there. When it came out I was very pleased with how the tofu was cut into perfect small squares and cooked to golden crispy perfection. Of course you gotta have the sweet chili sauce with crushed peanuts to dip in. You can eat it by itself but the sauce is the Ying to its Yang so dont be afraid to drown those suckers in that bad boy!Service was very good. From the moment I was greeted all the way to the moment I paid, I didnt really have to ask for anything except order the tofu.In closing, this is a solid place for that Thai food craving any time you are in the area. Just dont forget how they are situated in this weird plaza/strip area. Next time, I am getting the Garlic Chicken for sure. Oh, and paying for your meal with plastic there is a 15 dollar minimum. You can still pay with plastic still even though its under 15. They just throw in a dollar fee for the convenience of you not carrying cash.Yelp 2014 365 Review Challenge #104 "Thai Me Up!"This is a reason for people to get on Yelp or else they would never find this hidden Henderson hole in the wall restaurant located near our auto body shop.Special thanks to my Yelpers for their great reviews on Penn's...even moreso for their recommendation on the CRISPY GARLIC CHICKEN and GREEN TEA BUNS (Not on the menu and I would appreciate you keeping it a secret as well ;)Green Tea Buns...deep sigh. I never tried them but saw they were a popular Yelp item so I wanted to see for myself. I almost made the mistake of getting only 6, but quickly rectified my order to 12 when I imagined my voracious family gobbling them up like Pac Man pellets. I am so glad I did. As soon as I brought home the dozen of these cold little buns, popped them in the microwave under a damp paper towel for about 25 seconds (did 2 at a time), they were gone! These fluffy buns are so light and the green tea filling is so delicately sweet with a slight coconuty taste that melts in your mouth. I LOVE these and will be back for more.The Crispy Garlic Chicken is perfect. Crunchy, deep fried battered white meat chicken with the best crust in a sticky, sweet, salty, tangy sauce that is perfectly balanced. This is another favorite that I will come back for.Ambiance is nothing special but who cares...the food is great and service is friendly. But keep your hands off my buns!My favorite Thai place near my house! The owner makes her own sauces and even makes Green Tea Buns on occasion. All of the waitresses are really friendly and the quality of food is great whether dining in or taking to-go! My go-to's are the Pad Thai of course, Panang Curry, Pad See Ew, and Tom Kha. It's pretty funny cause anytime I go with my mom, they already know my mom is going to have the Pad Thai and that I'm going to have the Panang Curry lol It's hard to try something else when you're always craving those certain items! Their Pad Thai isn't as sweet as some places like Archi's, and also their Panang Curry is a bit thicker than other places as well.  Which I prefer for both. Everything is always super fresh and really flavorful.They have great lunch specials for $6.95 Monday-Friday from 11am-3pm:-Pad Thai-Chow Mein-Mixed Vegetables-Beef Broccoli-Chili Mint-Red Curry-Yellow Curry-Green Curry-Spicy Chili Pepper-MongolianThey all come with Egg Drop soup, Egg Roll, and steamed rice.Next time I swear I have to try their Crispy Garlic Chicken, Green Tea Buns, and Beef Salad!Sticky, sticky, oh so sticky crispy garlic chicken!I don't know exactly what goes on in this dish at Penn's but I like it. There is something in that sauce that makes you want to lick the entire foil plate clean. (Not even kidding) That sauce goes great with everythingggg and the chicken is so crispy and tender that it just makes for a delight in your mouth :OOther than the chicken, the other Thai dishes are really tasty and good quality. I've have the pad thai and fried rice from here and I can definitely taste the difference here compared to other Thai establishments in Henderson. But that chicken though!I have to admit that the first time I came to Penn's was not what I expected. It is located in... a less desirable? side of town and you wouldn't even think there would be a Thai restaurant in this plaza but behold!Parking has never been a problem here so that's another plus. Have I mentioned the chicken yet?A Thai place with "Beef Jerky" on the menu? Penn's Thai House is truly the restaurant that time forgot. Old school vinyl booths, plain walls, and a large fish tank to most likely distract you from the plain surroundings. I sat down and was greeted with water and a menu. Looking around, there are only about eight booths total with a few tables in the middle of the restaurant and manning all of these tables is one server, the co-owner maybe? She took my order and within about seven minutes I had my first item ordered, Beef Jerky. These aren't the road favorite you're thinking of, but are strips of skirt steak, marinated and flash fried. These are delicious with a slightly crispy outside and tender, but chewy inside, hence an elevated style of beef jerky, very good and great meal starter. These also come with a bizarre spicy dipping sauce that I couldn't quite my finger one. Sriracha with something else? I also ordered one of the five lunch specials. Yellow Curry plate with chicken. This comes with egg drop soup, tossed salad, white rice, and a single egg roll for under seven dollars. The curry was delicious, great flavor; color and I really enjoyed the egg drop soup. The soup had a great consistency with a unique homemade flavor. The egg roll was ok, but lacked flavor and was pretty greasy. The service here was quick and the food was great. I wanted to try their famous green tea rolls, but unfortunately they were out. I'll get you next time... next time. Can Yelp talk Thai? Yes. Quite well in fact"Yay! I'm a fan." Thanks to fellow Yelpers who highly recommended Penn's Thai House, I finally can remove this from my bookmarks list as I dined here last night. Tried to find Penn's a couple months ago and that turned into a failed search & rescue mission, so we ate elsewhere that night.Mission #2...Last night, I found it! +Convenient Parking.++Devoured the authentic foods.+++Appreciated the exceptional customer service.++++and dining solo, I really enjoyed the intimate ambience.Tucked away in a neon lit commercial strip center off Sunset, between Eastgate & Gibson, on the north side of the street.+A-Rated by So. NV Health District.++Dine-In or Take-Out.+++Six comfortable booths and two rectangular tables. ++++Capacity 36 patrons. +++++Open every night til 9pm. ++++++Cash, Visa, Mastercard.+++++++Lunch Specials $6.95, Mon-Fri, 11am-3pm.The Pad Thai w/ chicken was excellent at a spicy level 8. (see photo)Kra Pow (Basil) w/ pork at a spicy level 8 was a bit too hot for my taste buds, considering the green chili peppers; but still managed to empty the plate into my stomach. (see photo)Hot Jasmine tea was good. Served by the cup w/ teabag.They were out of their $1 green buns until Monday and sweet mango is not in season. Coconut ice cream was available, but I passed. Next time I hope to try all three of these desserts, along w/ their crispy garlic chicken, beef jerky, and chicken satay.My waitress was a very friendly and service oriented Thai lady who checked on me every 5 minutes or so. She even took the time to explain to me a bit about the wall decor I was admiring that I took several photos of. She deservedly earned a 30% tip!Walls were adorned w/ beautiful artwork of ancient Thai royalty and warriors. (see photos)I've been to several Thai restaurants throughout the Las Vegas Valley and after last night's dining experience, Penn's Thai House is now included among "My Yelp Favorites" list!YELP 250 CHALLENGE 2015: #200We really like Thai and wanted to try a place we had not been to yet.  In looking for places and reading reviews, I came across this place that had a review written by Nate M. about 3 months ago.  It was a decent review, he gave it 4 stars so it had to be a decent place.The place is tucked in the corner of this L shaped shopping center on Sunset east of the 95.  The Penn was a little hard to see but the Thai House is very prominent.They have 8 booths and a few tables which where put together as two long tables going down the center.  There was one other booth with 3 people and one table was taken with 4 people.  It seemed liked there was only one lady working the room and from time to time another lady brought out food, she looked like she was in the back cooking.I ordered the Egg Rolls to start and even though the were very crispy in the outside, the were soggy on the inside and obviously not made there, they all looked identical.  These were not really to my liking so I won't order those again.  We also ordered the green papaya salad which was very good and almost identical to a place in Oceanside we love.  We also got the mixed vegetable with chicken and the Pad Thai.  Both dishes were excellent.  The sauce on the mixed vegetable was AMAZING, it was not a heavy sauce and was very week made.  The Pad Thai was very good as well.This is a place we will go back to, everything tasted fresh, the vegetables were crispy and overall the price was very reasonable.

So... where are all the slot machines, poker tables and cocktail waitresses? I swear I just walked into a hotel restaurant off of the Vegas Strip... not even keno at the table. What?? No, wait... where are the 4,000 flavors of cheesecake? This IS the Cheesecake Factory, right??? No??? Okay, Grand Lux Cafe is so confusing. I think it is going through an identity crisis because it looks like a cross between a casino hotel lobby and The Cheesecake Factory, but without any personality. For dinner on a Wednesday night, in this great of a location, I was shocked to see this place so empty. Maybe everyone was across the street at Pink Taco. Or, maybe people just do not like being served by a wait staff with a perma-fake smile on their face all night. The one thing I will say for GLC is they have a LOT of options. However, I find restaurants that provide such a variety generally have anything exceptional to offer as far as the meal is concerned. I believe this is true for this establishment, as well. The waitress recommended the Vegetarian Chopped Salad saying she thought it was the best thing on the menu. I found it to be pretty bland and uninspiring. I guess I'm spoiled by the Cowboy Ciao Chopped Salad. But I digress. I would have gotten the tofu dish they have (orange glaze with sesame seeds, I believe) but I was informed that they cook it with a fish sauce. At least the waitress knew it was a non-veggie friendly option, but why serve a tofu dish that is not veggie? My dinner date ordered the BLT with fries. I think she ate about five bites and a couple of fries. She was equally unimpressed. I snuck a fry and they certainly are nothing to write home about. Limp and soggy, just the way nobody likes em. They did have a good Riesling a good selection of coffee drinks as well as an expansive dessert menu. We did not try a dessert (they have baked items that take about 30 minutes to cook.. probably pretty good, but I'm on a diet) but my gal pal did order a Mocha Coffee which she seemed relatively pleased with. We ended up sitting around chatting for 3.5 hours and they never kicked us out or made us feel bad about not ordering anything else, so I would give them an extra half star if I could (Gabi, are we EVER going to get half stars?!?!?). Grand Lux ... I am going to sum you up into one word: Uninspiring12/29/09(Disclaimer: Originally a four-star, but had to take one down.  Details below.)Checked in for another happy hour (HH)!  This time, I thought I'd try the Tuesday daily drink special, a Mango Sling ($5), along w/ a glass of red ($6 and up).  For nutritional sustenance, I ordered the Warm Goat Cheese Salad ($3.95 HH); the Stacked Chicken Quesadilla (around $6 HH); and the Warm Rustic Apple Pie (around $7 or $8).I really liked the Mango Sling!  Cool and refreshing, not too sweet and just the right tartness!  Don't quote me on the ingredients used, but I seem to recall mango puree and rum were involved.  Be careful, as the alcohol content is potent!  But then again, I was having wine AND a cocktail!  :)The goat cheese salad was divine!  A definite go-to item, but I'm a sucker for goat cheese, and if you aren't, you are SO missing out!  Just sayin'.  [Before I proceed, I'd like to posit, why is anything deep-fried just so so yummy, yet so so bad for you?  Why must the universe/powers-that-be be so perverted like that??]   (Ahem...)  6 pcs. of slightly sweet and not too salty, yet crispy goat cheese on a bed of perfectly-dressed greens and a few roasted red pepper slices for garnish made for quite an appetizer!  If I ever am at a quandary as to what to have the next time I visit Grand Lux for happy hour, I know I can always order one or three of these starters, along w/ wine or a daily cocktail special, and I'll be happy!  (I don't think I can order just one, bec., well, for 1) it's just so delicious not to have more!, and 2) the few sips of wine AND the Mango sling were really powerful!)  I loved the presentation of the initial Stacked chicken quesadilla, but, unfortunately, I had to return the dish; Unbeknownst to me, it contained an allergen that was not included in the veggie description on the menu (why this is so, since everything else was on the description, I'll never know.  The manager said there were so many ingredients in that dish, so they can't list everything.  I just wonder why list all but ONE veggie, and an ever-increasing in popularity allergen at that??)  But no worries, he was glad to re-do the order and bring me a new one.  A few minutes later, I was handed a sparse-looking plate, sans the lavishness of the initial dish.  Where were the veggies?  I only had a complaint w/ the one!  And the ooey-gooey cheese?  Oh, well.  I'll survive :)  Especially after what came next... the warm rustic apple pie!  I politely asked if I could have the whiskey creme anglaise sauce substituted for the vanilla ice cream since the brand GL uses is made w/ corn syrup.  Management obliged, but not too happily.  [He gave me the eye-roll.  I think I'll take a star down just for that (as well as the allergen not being noted down on the menu).  I wasn't born yesterday, and I know that many have cursed me in the past BOH, but why let a paying customer see that unprofessionalism?  But overall, management complied, and I'm grateful for the good food had that day.]  The apple pie was hot, spiced just right, and not too sweet!  The creme anglaise really balanced out the dish.  Perfect!I'd go back, and I hope that management here, as well as in other venues, will consider adding all veggies used in their menu items, especially those known to be allergens, just so that customers may request these be omitted.  In the end, it'll save the restaurant money AND will make the staff shine even more brightly in their clientele's minds for such great service, for after all, what is The Cheesecake Factory, and its affiliates, known for but their excellent customer service, right?Welcome,ome,ome,ome to,to,to the,he,he Grand,and,and,and Lux,ux,ux,ux:)The Grand Lux Cafe does not occupy a small, cozy space...the echoes, the click, click, click of shoes on concrete, the reflected din of conversations, even quiet discussions reverberate throughout the place:)The hard edged, high arched ceilings don't help...they seem to actually redirect and amplify the noise.Grand Lux has concert hall acoustics in one sense...the back rows can hear every syllable of the play, even the whispers...but the quality of the sound you hear is marred by the fact that there are generally 137 individual plays being staged at any one time...the result is cacophony (one of my favorite words, BTW, the word sounds exactly like what it is:)How's the food and service you ask?Sorry, I couldn't hear you clearly, even though you are right across the table:)Well, the food isn't half bad:)In fact, it's pretty decent...the meals I've had have been tasty, well prepared and well presented and the service...the service is everything you would expect at the Cheesecake Factory (oh, come on, you already knew that GLC was the slightly awkward stepchild of TCF...didn't you?:)GLC is to TCF as the Pink Taco was to Morton's:)...a little Stanford/Binet reference:)The menu is almost pure TCF, just pared down to a manageable size (from the novel that you're normally presented with at TCF) and reconfigured (with a few additional "GLC signature items":)Surprisingly, some of those items are worth your consideration!Sure, you can get their burger or chicken sandwich or omelet or  chopped cobb salad...the same one that you can get pretty much anywhere (and maybe a better version in a number of places)...but you can't get their braised short rib sloppy joe's or three cheese and short rib grilled cheese sandwiches just anyplace:)Those two bad boys alone are almost worth the ringing in my ears that usually persists for 48 hours after a visit to GLC at lunchtime:)On the plus side, GLC is nearby and safe (in the sense the a Mickey D's is safe) for the inevitable business lunches...I can say "meet me at GLC" and everybody knows what to expect, just like they do with TCF, Houstons, and the rest:)And they can have their favorites...the things they always order...the chicken sandwich...the chopped cobb salad...the burger...oh well:)As for me, I just try to meet people after the lunch rush so I can hear what they are saying and enjoy my grilled cheese with braised short ribs:)The last time I tried to have a meeting here during the noon hour, I almost agreed to become a marketing rep for the National Association of Fur Lined Toilet Seat Cover Manufacturers...I thought we were talking about something much different:)

Took the family here to celebrate my Son's Birthday.  He likes Buca because of the large portions of food.  Even though it's a chain, I don't mind coming here....as long as the family is happy, I'm happy.We ordered:Gnocchi w/tons of Gorgonzola Cheesehttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jO3ikdNbF_TGGv87izTkEg?select=3qVOP1NznI8rb9uw84uXBgFour Cheese Pizzahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jO3ikdNbF_TGGv87izTkEg?select=7KaVTCG5abfIpQWIuWsK2QGnocchihttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jO3ikdNbF_TGGv87izTkEg?select=PrqdCTcI_HIpPzo3S7JxGwRigatoni w/Spicy Chickenhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jO3ikdNbF_TGGv87izTkEg?select=5jiuqfiAmQqm6ISEG67_OwThe food was good and the service was OK.  We didn't have any issues all evening.  Of course kiddo got a nice Dessert and serenade for his Birthday....http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jO3ikdNbF_TGGv87izTkEg?select=tepqp9VLKDixAnmyVhpNyQOverall, it was a fun time had by all.Return Factor - 60%So it's a restaurant chain. That doesn't matter to me I'm a fan. I admit that I don't ever eat at Buca unless I have a coupon, but come on they send them in the mail all of the time! I'm also signed up on the e-mail list so they send offers that way too. I received a $20 off with purchase of 2 entrees and wanted to take advantage of it since I hadn't had Buca in a while, and it was better then the $10 off they generally send.  We arrived just after 5 pm. The parking lot was pretty empty and when we got inside we were able to have our pick of where to sit since they weren't busy. We must have just beat the dinner rush coming in because the restaurant soon filled up. Our server brought some complimentary bread that I had to force myself to put down to save room for my meal that was coming. I could have eaten the bread all to myself! Since Buca serves family style meals the portions are big. They have small and large sizes, but don't let the small size trick you into thinking it isn't much because it is plentiful. I ordered the "Penne Arrabbiata" priced at $19.99 for the small. It had spicy Italian sausage on top of the pasta as well in the sauce. I wasn't crazy about this dish simply because it had too much sausage flavor. I like sausage, but don't like it overpowering certain dishes. The sausage that was on the pasta also was a bit dry. The other dish I ordered was the "Baked Lasagna" priced at $19.99 for the small. This is so good! The meat sauce it tasty and the cheesy goodness it what makes it! There is ricotta, mozzarella, provolone and parmesan cheese in this lasagna. Very comforting and delicious! You can phone your order for pick-up if you don't feel like eating inside. Buca has several options as far as catering goes. You can pick up "Party Pans" (they have a menu for this) if you are having a gathering at your house and don't want the fuss of cooking. They offer different sizes and menu options broken down to how many people you are entertaining. They also offer a catering service where you can have Buca deliver the food along with tablecloths, plates, utensils, etc. so this is probably a great choice for a corporate party. They also have banquet rooms (some themed) and offer group menu options. When the server told me about the themed rooms I wondered what they could be like since there are pictures of naked people hanging on the regular dining walls. I crack up every time wondering how they get away with that since Buca is supposed to be a place to bring the familia, but it is just part of the character and I guess it works!We have stayed away from Buca di Beppo because of their reputation for huge portions.  We would be in the area for an appointment and decided to go here after for an early dinner.  As form the portions, we're at the age where early dinners and take home boxes rule!  :)I had checked the menu online and knew pretty much what we wanted before going there.  Our server, Casey, was a gem!  She asked us if we had been there before and answered questions and gave advice as we asked.We ended up ordering a small portion of their summer tricolore salad.  It was a good starter of sliced tomatoes, mozzarella, and avocado rings topped with fresh basil and olive oil.  A very summery kind of salad.For our main course, we chose the spicy chicken rigatoni described on the menu as chicken breast, garlic, crushed red pepper and peas in a spicy rosa sauce.  This came with a recommendation from a friend and it was a good suggestion.  (Thanks Shawn H.)  The bowl of rigatoni was huge.  Note that the menu states that a small order is meant for 2 or more and a large order is meant for 4 or more.  We had generous servings at the restaurant, not overdoing it though, and we brought home a container for an additional meal.  The take home packaging even had a reheating instruction sticker on it.  Since we didn't overdo the main course, we had room for dessert.  They have a couple of desserts that have single serving versions (well actually they're also for 2 people in reality).  We got their single serving version of the colossal brownie sundae.  It came with two brownie pieces, two scoops of ice cream and some whipped cream.  A very nice dessert for two people to share.I was very pleased with this first visit to a Buca.  Considering the amount of food, the price is reasonable.  Service was outstanding.  Thanks, Casey!  We'll be back to try some other things.  And, by bringing home a box, it saves me from having to cook a meal on a future day.  Score!

Review Text :
People, the reviews don't lie, this place isn't good...it's AMAZING!!From start to finish I had a perfect experience here.  The ambiance is so romantical and intimate.  I felt like I was on a dreamy date, with two other good girlfriends (although, side note, it would be a a great date night spot for your lova!).  First off my drink was awesome!  For only having a bar for 2 or so months in the new location, they've got it goin' on!  I had the Papa Dobé, which had Mt Gay Eclipse Rum, Maraschino Liqueur, grapefruit and lime.  I love grapefruit juice, but only the bitter tasting kind....not the sugary sweet kind.  This had the right amount of grapefruit, not too sweet, with a hint of lime...I was in love!  I started off with a beet salad.  I am FOREVER criticizing restaurants for skimping on the beets.  I buy them, I know they're not an expensive veggie, spare me some large slices....or even, gasp, the whole beet!  What I got MAY have been one or maybe two beets.  It was the perfect size beet salad, with delicious creamy goat cheese, candied walnuts and a hint of oil.  Perfecto!For the main course I had the Lobster Ravioli.  It was a hard decision with all the amazing looking choices, but a soon as I dug in, I knew it was the right decision!  It was incredible!  Tons of lobster stuffed into 4 large ravioli in a wonderfully light reduction sauce.  That bowl may look small, but it really fills you up!  I love me some super sized American food...but this was thee perfect amount!  My dates and I decided to just go all the way and get dessert as well, since again, they all looked so good.  I ordered the Gingerbread with pears and whipped cream.  It was warm, cinnamon-y and delish!  With warm pears and a fluffy dollop of whipped cream to top it off.  Great end to a fantastic meal!The service was also excellent from start to finish.  The server was incredibly knowledgeable about the food choices and described very item perfectly (and convincingly since I wanted every item!).  This place will definitely be put on my fav "fine dining" restaurants in the Burgh.  It's a little pricey, but worth every dollar!Actually about 2.5 stars.Why?Greeters were confused and confused the few groups (3 couples) that were all entering at the same time.Wine list has nice variety, finally decided to just order a bottle.After over 10 minutes, waiter comes back and said they were out of that bottle.  No other recommendations.Decided to go with wine by the glass because some nice selections and could have different wine with app. and meal. Ordered wine. Ordered dinner.She: "Why has it taken over 15 minutes to get our wine?"Apps. are delivered to table.  Then wine shows up.Apps. are good.Salads are delivered to the table.  More wine ordered.Salads are good. She: "Why has it taken over 15 minutes to get our wine?"Entrees are delivered.  Wine finally appears. She: "Very good meal."Me: "Eh, OK meal."She:  "Let's go to Coffee Tree for desert and coffee."Conclusion:  Food is good, service sub-par, not really worth the price! OMG!I know it might be super lame to write another 5 star update... BUT in my defense it's been 2 years since I wrote my last review here and they're now serving lunch!!You heard it here first (maybe not first), their lunch is a matching 5 stars to their dinner. And Butterjoint. And pretty much anything they do! But the thing that impressed me, maybe most, is when a place is packed during lunch! AND, it's not as if they're in a really busy area of Oakland. People WANT to come here. They know what's up! Let's face it, lunch can be the most boring meal of the day, I'd eat eggs and toast and a meatloaf for dinner and love them all. But lunch, yuck. I hate it. I don't hate it when I have lunch here! The tomato soup? So delicious! My yellowtail tuna melt. Incredible! I think the bread underneath may have been brioche and it was incredible. I also liked that it was open faced so I could eat it with a fork. Scrumptious! And you get a side of potato salad! All for $15. That's a steal!I could come here everyday for lunch. Then my afternoons would never be boring!I think my husband summed it up when he said, "It feels like the chef won a restaurant on a reality tv show and just didn't know what to do with it."  We went here for a special occasion but nothing, nothing made us want to stay.  * Service - awkward, inattentive, slow* Food - tasteless salads, excellent entrees, dessert missed the mark* Atmosphere - loud off putting music, empty strange decor, beat up bathroomsI had higher hopes based on yelp reviews.  We had a 9:15 reservation and were not seated until 9:30, even though we could see empty tables.  Others who were waiting just decided to leave.Our waitress should be fired.  She described the food in the most unappealing way possible: "We don't have a lamb chop, instead we are substituting a lamb leg, it is cut in half at the bone, it has lots of sinew, tendons, connective tissue, so it is pretty chewy and tough, and it looks worse than a chop but it is still really good tasting."  And, "Monkfish is really good like lobster, but it is a super gross looking, ugly fish."  Way to turn our stomachs.Many different people waited on us.  The person clearing our salads put our dirty knives straight on the table.  At this price restaurant they should bring new silverware with each course, and if not, then at least don't put it straight on the wood top table.  They also cleared things too early, placed things awkwardly, didn't ask if we wanted drink refills.  Did anybody train this staff?Menu: I understand seasonal cooking doesn't leave many options in January.  But I also think there is a real lack of invention here.  75% of all the dishes had escarole and fingerling potatoes.  It all just sounded the same.  Get more creative with what you have at this time of year.  Mussel salad was utterly flavorless.  I don't know how you can make a salad that has mussels, fennel, and caper berries that has no flavor.  It sounds impossible, but true.The monkfish was delicious.  Well seasoned, big piece, tender, lovely tomato accompaniment.  Spanish mackerel was good.  Small.  Could have used a bit more sauce or flavoring.Warm gingerbread came with ice cold quinces on top and was so slathered in whipped cream it looked like a three year old plated it.  The gingerbread was fine but the fruit should have been warm and saucy.  The whipped cream tasted like cool whip and was about 8 times too much.At an odd moment, the music started blaring, the Smiths, which I love, and strange dance party music.  Just too off for this type of restaurant.  We had a strange oil lamp on our table that had a tiny blue flame.  There was a big empty wall behind us with a picture hook and no picture on it.  The bathroom has a strange shelf right when you walk in with q-tips and OB tampons in a tray.  Just so odd.****UPDATE: The owner of the restaurant contacted me via yelp and addressed the above concerns point by point.  She did so very respectfully and with tact, which I appreciate.  They are sending me a gift certificate and the next time I am in Pittsburgh I will give this place another try and can hopefully leave a more positive review.  I am very impressed with how they handled this and am updating my 2 stars to 3 stars for the time being.We had a great dinner at Legume last evening. This was a very pleasant evening in North Oakland with just a hint of rain in the air with the pre-summer weather being some the best in recent years. One thing for everyone to be cognizant about is, Legume does has Valet parking across the street which is vital in this part of Oakland.The hostess greeted us with a great smile and we were seated immediately at our reservation time and given a four top for a party of two because all the others were occupied. Some restaurants will not do this and make you wait. Legume was very generous and hospitable in this aspect. The menu here changes frequently, actually daily, so you can come and enjoy the revelations when you arrive or visit the menu online which they post each day after 5 P.M.For our meal we started with a sharing plate of Goot Essa Blue Cheese with Oat Biscuits, Honey, Candied Walnuts and Apples. This was an excellent Blue and the Oat Biscuits were delicious and unique. We finished every morsel and were happy to be left want for more, since we had two more courses to come.The service at this point was very good: water glasses filled; drinks promptly arrived; silverware efficiently exchanged. Speaking of drinks, we had the house cocktail 'full stop' which was expertly made at the Butterjoint, which is Legumes connected lounge. You will love this drink if you as we like Boyd & Blair vodka; green Chartreuse; St. Germaine; and lemon.Next course we had a house salad Mixed Greens with Bistro Vinaigrette, Radish and Croutons which was just so light and delicious. The radish was sliced so thin as to be light as the greens and the croutons were also so thin, light and crunchy and matched perfectly.  Also we enjoyed today's soup which was Chilled Asparagus Soup with Buttermilk Panna Cotta, Preserved Lemon and Dill. This soup was remarkable, unique, outstanding and delicious enough to rave about it. Service, again remains outstanding at this point with team service, refilling water, clearing and replacing utensils and always unobtrusive but very attentive.Training here is obviously a key part of the business.  For my companion we asked for a wine recommendation to match her next course. Our server was extremely informed and trained on the wine list and recommend two that would match. One of her recommendations I had also considered as appropriate so we chose that one. There are somewhere around eighteen wines by the glass all well chosen to have a high likelihood of matching anything you may be having for dinner. The list is quite international with sparkling, whites and reds from around the world.  So what did we choose, well the Villa Pillo, Sangiovese/Cabernet Sauvignon/Merlot from Tuscany which was perfectly delicious.For our entre course I chose the Salmon and Linda decided to have an appetizer size and whet with the Chicken Livers. I will explain each preparation a little more so it may make your mouth water like it did ours. Linda's was Chicken Livers with Polenta Croutons, Bacon, Pickled Cherries and Spring Onion   Linda just kept saying,, oh this is good; oh this is delicious; oh this is wonderful between complementing this dish with a sip of the great Tuscan wine to go with it. Tender, altogether delicious, unique, and great culinary talent from the kitchen best describes this dish in the fewest words.Mine was the Wild King Salmon with Crispy Potatoes, Asparagus, Nettle Salsa Verde and Spruce Tip Hollandaise. With salmon, I can only eat it 'wild and king'. King is called king for good reason. The salmon was cooked a nice medium rare that maintained its soft unctuous wild salmon flavor with skin so crispy that it crunched and melted in our mouth. All the ingredients on the plate were a great complement to the salmon and to each other. This dish was very well matched and beautifully plated. The asparagus was favorable and tender. The hollandaise was light and a perfect example of how it should be made. This sauce performed its role well by being just perfect on its own, deliciously complementing the other components without taking over, and being very memorable. The crispy potatoes were small pieces that were light with a nice crisp on the outside with a tender wonderful potato flavor on the inside.  That was pretty much one outstanding meal, prepared and plated perfectly with numerous excellent service interactions and darn, no room for dessert.

I hate to admit it, but I'm guilty of being a bit of a sushi fan. I was planning to wait until I got back home to New York but my cousin recommended this restaurant to us. I've been spoiled since I went to Narita, Japan for the summer. For those of you who are as obsessed with finding some good fancy none AYCE sushi places with class, this is the place to bring someone if you got the pockets. What you get here is 5 star atmosphere with a  2.5 star food and 3.5 stars for service. Amazing is just a word, and it really can't describe the design of the restaurant. Teru Sushi is located within LVH along with 888 Noodle Bar and a Hibachi restaurant. They have a myojin torii (japanese spiritual architecture) along with a waterfall and pond display as the center piece of the restaurants. What we ordered and the price!Salad: $4 Miso Soup: $4Sushi/Sashimi Plate $24Lobster Roll: $19Shrimp Crunchy Roll: $12Las Vegas Roll: $12The salad is crisp green, carrots, tomatoes in ginger dressing with A LOT of salt! The salad seem to have been washed with salt water. I love my food to be salty but this was a overstatement for the salad. Will avoid this when coming here. The miso soup was nothing special and was pretty standard. The Sushi/Sashimi plate differ depending on the chief. According to the menu "chef selection of fresh sushi and sashimi served with rice." Since I worked in the restaurant business this means fish that are about to go bad or is bad and that need to be served ASAP. The sushi/sashimi plate was not the freshest sushi but it was not bad. The Lobster Roll was very decent but had very little lobster and a lot of crabmeat. Probably not worth the money to order this roll again. The  Las Vegas roll was spicy because of the large amount spicy mayo and sriracha that was on the sushi. Once you get some of the sauce off it is a decent roll to try. The roll that I will order again will be Shrimp Crunchy Roll. It also something for the none raw fish lovers. I will recommend the Shrimp Crunchy Roll and the Las Vegas Roll. Local (Nevada Residents get a discount) get a discount.

Review Text :
I swear this place is a cover for some type of organized crime (Russian, maybe?) but hot damn if they don't have the best home fries in all of our fair land (that includes Matt's Big Breakfast... I know, right?) They always cook everything to perfection and it tastes really fresh. It's also the location of the original Mel's Diner TV show (EDIT: Korina and Pierre have brought some conflicting facts about this statement to my attention. So when I say "Really!" in the next sentence, I actually mean "Not Really!"). Really!Okay, here's what blows:-Disgusting carpet.-Awful bathrooms-Let's just say the waitresses (all are remarkably sexy in a scrappy exotic gangster kind of way... I guess you really have to see for yourself) are less than happy to be serving you. That goes for the "busboy" who, with the way he barks at the servers and talks shit about customers, is probably the owner. Actually, this guy kind of rules. So, back to the bitchy server girls. They never wear any clothing that could possibly be misconstrued as appropriate. Always teeny tiny jeans and shirts to match. So strange.-The decor is ridiculous. It's overly patriotic.-The clientele is a mixed bag of cops (cool), tweakers (uncool... but they get booted pretty fast), grizzled old men (intimidating, but cool), and aging republicans, complete with anti-everythingelsebutamerica sentiments emblazoned across greasy shirts (SO obviously not something I like). All in all, this place is about food and people watching. And, if you like those games where you make up stories about random passersby, you will have a field day with these people.I stopped in Phoenix to have lunch with a friend and he brought me here to Mel's.He told me Mel's Diner was used for the exterior shots of the '76 to '85 TV sitcom, Alice.APPEARANCE:  Mel's has seen better days.   The food was still good, but.... let's just say the place is looking and feeling a bit tired.   I went to wash my hands and the restrooms were... basic restrooms, older like the restaurant.   The soap dispenser was empty so I stepped in the woman's to get some soap.   Also when I sat down back at the booth I bottomed out on the springs and the boards supporting them underneath.  2 stars.SERVICE: It felt like a small local "diner" where they are very friendly and everyone knows everyone.   They're always smiling and happy to take care of most any request.  4 stars.FOOD:  I ordered the pork loin sandwich and my friend had the BBQ pulled pork sandwich.   Both my friend and our server told me the sandwich I ordered was really big and boy they weren't kidding!    Check out my photos, it could have used 2 buns!   After having a cup of chicken soup, fries and that sandwich, I'd have to say the food is pretty good, yes diner food, but still pretty good none-the-less.   On the plus side, the prices are EXTREMELY reasonable!   3.5 stars.OVERALL:  The food is good, the service is very good and the prices are LOW.   But the building and decor is old and out dated.  I suppose that's how they keep the prices down............  I bet if anyone tells the owner they should remodel, they'll just say "Kiss My Grits!"   ;-)

I am a hummus fiend. I have made tabbouleh so delicious that the heavens parted and rained down tears of joy upon its consumption. I will cut a bitch over the last dollop of garlic dip. Don't even get me started on baba ghanoush.So it's almost a guarantee that I will like anything that draws upon a Mediterranean flavor palate. Med Fresh is no exception.It's technically Turkish, but I don't split hairs when it comes to Mediterranean. The pitas are fresh and flavorful, the tzatziki is kickin' and the gyro meat (beef and chicken) are always moist and delicious. Everything is prepared as you order it and you have a clear view of the goings-on in the sunken kitchen. The staff can be a bit terse at times but they're always professional and quick to disperse a busy lunch rush. The platters are priced well for the mound of food you receive, and while I have had some tonsil-scraping dry chicken on occasion, the majority of the time the kabobs and koftas are moist and tender. If you simply can't be pressed to make up your mind, go with the mixed grill and get a bit of a variety. The pita sammich special (#16) is the best bang for your buck on the menu. Pita, meat, tomato, lettuce, weird pickles and secret sauce. Served with tzatziki and their killer spicy red sauce. Salad or fries on the side. $6.95. Oh yeah.

The Charcoal Room at Santa Fe Station: Cutting to the Chase  The pretzel bread sticks are fabulous, arriving at the table piping hot, soft and salty.  I ate the two that were in the bread basket.    None for my boyfriend.  There was other bread in the basket, though.  The Caesar salad is good, with small pieces of crusty bread as the crouton-like accompaniments.  A generous helping, I didn't finish it because I wanted to leave room for the main course.  The half roasted chicken is tasty.  I ate the breast and took the leg/thigh home.  That sounds a little strange.  The baked sweet potato is huge!  Regular butter and cinnamon butter are provided; put them on the spud, watch them melt, and consume. I ate half there and took the other half home, too.  This is a great place for date night, which we had the night we went.  The service is attentive. The manager came by our table and checked on us.  Sunday night was so steady for them that there were no booths available, so we were seated at a round table that sat four.  I always prefer booths unless with a large group of friends. Not that we are the type of couple to sit side by side in a booth when it's just us, because that's weird, but I didn't feel like waiting. Reservations are suggested just in case, which we had.   Caesar salad+ lobster corn chowder + half chicken + petit filet mignon + sweet potato + asparagus + sauteed mushrooms = $85.00  We were very full when we left with our doggie bag.  The end.Finally!! I've had the Charcoal Room on my list of eats since I moved out here a few years ago.  My neighbor, some co-workers, and even friends/family from California even recommended the Charcoal Room to me. But when it came to other Yelpers, most haven't been here or reviewed them.  The Charcoal Room has a lot of pros and very little cons.  You don't get what you pay for here, you get more.  And if you're having steak, you get a lot more.  I got their petite filet and it was delicious.  Their petite is about 6 oz, juicy, and most importantly, very tasty. Don't let the price fool you.  For less than $30, I had a steak that rivals some of the 5 star steak houses out here.  My filet was so tender that I think I used a butter knife to cut through it.  I had my steak with a side of their Caesar salad, lobster corn chowder, sautéed mushrooms, and asparagus.  All portions were huge and I ended up with leftovers. My GF opted for their roasted chicken and baked sweet potato.  Her meal was hooked up too.  I swear she was served half a chicken and a football sized sweet potato.  She said her meal was good as well.  I have no complaints about the service.  We were seated right away, our orders were taken, and our food was served in a timely manner.  I left the Charcoal Room very satisfied and my only regret is not coming here sooner.  We got a lot of food and paid less than $100 for it.  Yes...I'm sure I will be back.PS: No pictures of their steak and no pictures of their fabulous forks.  I was focused the night I ate here....focused on my beautiful date.  1OAK!I'm a bigger fan of the location at Palace Station- this one has similar dishes, but they're not as well executed. Came here with a large group for a birthday reservation, and service was very polite but spotty- timing of dishes was off and a couple of orders were mixed up.I opted for the seared ahi app and the heirloom tomato and mozzarella salad. The ahi was a generous portion for $10, perfectly seared, and I enjoyed the tamari soy sauce but did not care at all for the wasabi cream. The salad was a disappointing mess of underripe tomatoes and flavorless "mozzarella"- it didn't even seem to be that cheese, the texture was crumbly and it was dry and flavorless rather than soft and mild. This location does not have a private room, but they were able to place us toward the back for some privacy. We were informed from the start that they were unable to do separate checks, which was a bit frustrating and led to several of our party using the $4/fee ATM outside. However, we were given a $40 discount card after being seated, which offset that inconvenience.

I love BBQ, and am new to the scene in regards to dining out at different locations trying to figure out who's BBQ makes me the happiest. Lucilles definitely has it going on. Its a large restaurant and its well decorated. PLENTY of seating for all different sized parties.   Blues music playing in the background.  Remarkably, Patrick (my Sunday date guy) and I had no wait whatsoever.  Usually, when I see this place, theres always people waiting outside.  Not this time!they served us a basket of biskets.  um, but only 2 biskets were in there.  um, WHY?  WHY ONLY 2 AT A TIME?  That was annoying.   We didnt like that!!  Why couldnt they have given us at least 4?  They also served us our drinks in Mason jars.  I think thats a southern thing?  I liked it!  Eventually our food came out and I got the brisket sandwich with garlic potatoes and Patrick got the shreded chicken sandwich with Macaroni and cheese as a side.  We passed on desert.Anyways, I would come back here.  It was a decent time had by all.Mind-boggling rhetorical question of the day: Who on earth chooses to have their bachlorette party dinner at Lucille's? My down home girlie girl, who, bless her sweet heart and wonderbread palate, absolutely adores this joint. To start, the service was absolutely atrocious. Party of eight on a Friday night. Annoying? I can see how it could be. More annoying? Losing the reservation and shoving us into a corner designed to seat five, maybe six max. A bunch of elbow bumping, scantily clad chicks all dolled, sipping fruity ass hurricanes and the like. Probably pretty humorous to observe. Not so humorous to navigate.Put on your woo-girl face though because this is a par-tay! Woo!Bring out the mildly scandalous goodie bags filled with penis lollipops, dirty fortune cookies and flavored lube (i.e. the tame stuff). Just scandalous enough send your Great Aunt Esther into a conniption fit. Seriously, if this was the genuine highlight of this meal, it really does not speak highly of the hot garbage being slopped on a plate at Lucille's. Woo!And we wait, and wait, and wait. Bread, finally! Woo!Wait, are you sure you didn't confuse biscuits with hard tack? Because not even the scrumptious honey butter you've got is worth the dental bills incurred from teething this rock. Again we wait, and wait, and wait. Pulled pork! Woo!Hold up. How does a pulled pork sandwich manage to be incredibly greasy and dry as a bone at the same time? Have I slipped into some alternative dimension? Is it opposite day? Because if so, this shit is finger-lickin' good. You best slop on that BBQ sauce to add some semblance of flavor to the sandwich and hope it doesn't soak through the bun in 2.5 seconds flat. Worst pulled pork sandwich I have ever eaten. Hands down. The garlicky mashed potatoes as a side were the only saving grace of the meal.I seriously have no idea how this place stays in business. If it were not for the over abundance of low swingin' crotch fruit I brought to the party, dinner here would have tanked, hard and fast. It was awkward, drawn out (3 hours!) and ridiculously expensive. The best part about the experience was walking out the door. Woo!SO disappointed.My husband and I went last night with our infant daughter (asleep in her carrier) and here is a rundown of how it went:We were promptly greeted and asked by the hostess if we needed a carrier sling.  I declined and said I'd just tuck her carrier under the table by my leg.  The hostess then had a sub-hostess (?) come over and take us to our table.  She also asked if we needed a sling.  Again, I declined.  Minor annoyance.  What wasn't minor what that she took us over and seated us with 80% of the other patrons in the mostly empty place!!  We were almost all grouped into the same corner of the restaurant.  Nobody wants to go out to dinner and listen to all the conversations of everyone around them when there is room all over the restaurant.  Spread out your diners; give people some elbow room and privacy!So then our waitress comes up and takes our drink order and that's when I saw that they are asking almost $5 for a mason jar full of strawberry lemonade.  I almost laughed out loud.  Seriously, who the hell thinks that $5 is a fair price for a mason jar of strawberry lemonade? *raises eyebrow*  Uh huh, that's what I thought too.  Absurd!So I ordered the 'bargain' $4 plain old lemonade.  (I'm definitely not a cheap ass, but I'm also not an idiot.)The lemonade price actually made me think of the $5 milkshake scene from Pulp Fiction.  And if you don't know what the hell I'm talking about then stop reading this review right NOW and go rent get Pulp Fiction on streaming Netflix.    I'll wait for you to come back...*drumming fingers*Okay, done watching the movie?  That scene was good, right?  Okay, back to the review...Anyway, the drinks were prompt and I'll just say it, "That's a pretty fucking good lemonade. I don't know if it's worth five dollars but it's pretty fucking good."So the waitress then asks if if we'd like an appetizer so we order a $4 'half order' (the full order was $7) of fried green tomatoes which, by the way, is also an OUTSTANDING movie.   What???  You've never seen that either??  *gasp*Go on, I'll wait.  Again.*taps foot*Back?  Outstanding film!!  Amiright?Back to the review.  Again.  The half order of fried green tomatoes was a complete fucking joke.  There were TWO (yes, I said 2) fried green tomatoes.  Not only was I flabbergasted at the utter lack of value for the $4 I just paid for that tiny plate with 2 pitiful tomato slices but they were impossibly hot, mushy, and utterly tasteless.  Even the shitty red pepper sauce they were swimming in was completely bland.  Unbelievable.  Should I even bother adding that it was delivered to our table by a different server who walked by us with two plates, looked confused, turned around muttered something under her breath that sounded like "they ordered the wrong tomatoes", put it down and walked away with the other plate; still looking utterly lost.So when we ordered the 'World's Biggest Rip Off Of for an Appetizer', we also placed or dinner orders.  I asked for the BBQ Shrimp dinner ($20) and I substituted mashed potatoes for the cheesy grits (sounds yuck) and I decided to stick with the greens that it comes with originally.  My husband ordered the beef ribs and corn on the cob, I have no idea what that cost, but our final bill was almost $60, you sort that shit out because 'I can't math' very good.Our food came right away which was good.  What was VERY bad was that my plate was utterly covered in some parsley and dry rub garnish that had been liberally sprinkled around (and over) the whole plate by someone I'm assuming must've had a grand mal seizure right as they were holding a handful of this stuff.  My food and plate was COVERED in this crap.  I scraped it off as best I could and easily came up with 1/4 of a cup of this sprinkled garbage all over everything.  It was awful.Adding to that the greens were horrendous.  Bitter, cold and tasteless. The shrimp were drowning in this ghastly BBQ sauce that was an unappetizing blend of too spicy and not quite BBQ'y sauce.  I can't put my finger on it, but I didn't care for it one bit.  So I sat there and choked down my $20 worth of shrimp and picked at my mashed red potatoes, which were the only thing decent on my plate.  I even complained to my waitress that my plate was covered in this nasty crap and had ruined my food all she could do was look at me and say "Oh, I'm sorry."Really that's it?  No offer to get the manager, or replace my food, anything?Worthless.In comparison the husband's food looked pretty good, as I looked on mournfully at his plate and looked back in disgust at mine.I wanted to like this place, I really, really did.  The decor is fabulous and the place is uber cute, but the bizarre seating patterns, the ridiculous pricing for things like lemonade and 2 inedible FUCKING tomatoes, and the overzealous garnishments of inedible, chopped parsley and dry rub were too just much.Came here for the first time to meet some friends for lunch.It is located in Tempe Market place but, has its own parking lot,which makes going here much easier than a lot of other places here.We sat on the back patio which was so nice. It is a nicely decorated place, Very Southern. It reminds me of a place in Florida or in the South.Well ,it was a lovely day outside,not too hot or cool so it was great for sitting outside.We got fried green tomatoes for appetizer, which was really good and the first time I had ever had them.I had the BBQ chicken Salad, Sue got the breaded and fried cat fish with shrimp ,it also came with Sweet potatoes fries. She said it was fantastic, my other friend Alan got the fried Chicken and he is from Mississippi and it was very true to how they do it there.Bathrooms are nice and clean.Nice Hot water to wash off all the sticky BBQ.Staff is a little frazzled at times, there seems to be a bit of disorganization going on.2 of us received our food and Sue waited quite a while to get hers as well.She did have the Strawberry Lemonade which she thought was Heaven.This is a pretty good place and very busy. We came in on a week night, I was surprised how really busy it was.  We sat on the Porch, which is just an addition made to look like an old Southern style home.  It is nice. Nice old 50's style furniture. I like it!I had some Watermelon flavored Ice Tea.  It was truly good. Even had a slice of watermelon with it.  We had green fried tomatoes as an appetizer. So so on that not too good.  Dinner was quite good though. BBQ chicken, some ribs and briskestWe had enough to bring home for yet another dinnerOur server was very good, her name was Allison. She went into a lot of detail about the menu items. I did appreciate that certainly.Dinner was good and the side BBQ sauces are an added plus.

Review Text :
Several members of my family and friends are completely obsessed with this place.  Ob. Sessed.  And so - I go.  Ya walk in, pay the lady and pick your drink.  Someone leads you to a table.  Shortly someone will be over with plates and rolls.  At that point - the feeding begins.  And when it ends is all up to you.  As long as you're there they'll keep bringing on the plates and more of their really good warm rolls with honeybutter.  Their steaks are surprisingly good.  You walk up to the window and tell the guy how you want yours cooked - he pokes around at a few and hands you a steak.  There are sauteed mushrooms and onions on the side for you to serve yourself.  Nice.  To give you an idea of the variety and the general immenseness of the place, I'm going to name of just a few of the things I saw there on just our last visit: BBQ Beef w/ opt Buns on the side, Tacos, Black-eyed peas, fried okra, pork & potatoes, steak, spinach salad, mixed green salad, chicken salad, fruit salad, ice milk, brownies, cookies, cakes, blueberry pie, bread pudding, chocolate pudding, cottage cheese, fresh melon (you can see them cutting it putting fresh stuff into containers), Fried clams, Fried shrimp, fried rice, fried chicken, mashed potatoes, and several soups.  It's so much larger than that sounds.Servers are great at  offering new plates (dang food pushers) and refilling your drinks.  The place is also surprisingly clean.  It's nice to be able to see so much going on behind the counters - slicing the fruit, mixing things in bowls, decorating the cakes - it's all done right there where it's visible to everyone.  I've been told several locations out of state are much larger than this one - but I certainly can't imagine the need.  For about $10 a pop it is quite a deal for a great range of food that actually tastes good.  Come hungry.Next time I want to feast like a queen on a budget I will go to one of those Taco Bell/KFC/Pizza Hut/Long John Silver locations and buy one of everything. That would be better than eating at Golden Corral.-PARKING: plenty-DECOR: what is with the BRIGHT fluorescent lights during dinner? Most places have softer lighting during dinner. Plus, it smelled like dirty carpets and felt like some kind of church hall meeting with the strange lighting.-RESTROOM: Smelled like sewage and needed to be cleaned, like someone just had a toilet paper party in the ladies restroom.-SERVICE: all of the employees that I encountered were friendly.-PRICE: Not too bad for dinner, like $10 bucks and change.-FOOD: Pretty good. The Chinese was not good, but all of the American "comfort" foods were pretty tasty. Decent selection.-BEVERAGE: They give you your beverage when you pay and the waitress gives you refills. No access to coffee or your own refills. Reminds me of the Vegas buffets where you are at the mercy of the Food Server for refills.****Four Stars for good food and friendly service.To Serve or Not Serve Hello Yelpers Recently,  I had a experience at a Golden Corral Restaurant that concerned me enough to write to their corporate office not once but twice.  After receiving "no response" I thought I might as well add this to my " Yelp" reviews".  I believe it's incumbent upon management to put things right for any and all concerns a guest may have while dining at their establishment. I have never experienced Management at a corporate level fail to respond in a timely manner when a guest addressed a concern. With the vast amount of establishments to dine at one would think that the last thing management at any restaurant would want is to have a guest  leave unhappy or, in my case to never come back again.  Rather then writing a strategic rant, I have decided to attach the letter I sent to corporate headquarters. September 23, 2013 Corporate Office of Golden Corral I am writing this letter to discuss a recent experience I had at your Golden Corral restaurant located at 420 N Dysart Rd, Goodyear, Arizona (623) 925-9075.  I have visited this location many times and have always enjoyed the quality of food and superior service.  However, my latest visit to Golden Corral has me very concerned as a guest.   On Saturday, September 21 around 1130 A.M. I visited your restaurant to purchase a dozen rolls for a BBQ I was having later that day.  When I returned home and opened the box of rolls I noticed that the rolls were hard and somewhat overcooked.  I realize this has happened to us all at one time or another. Each of us has ordered food at a restaurant and gotten something that differs from our expectations to some degree. I appreciate that restaurant work is a very challenging business, and sometimes cooks and chefs can get caught up in a multitude of orders, all at the same time and the quality of a product can suffer.  I usually do not return food but I really wanted to serve the rolls at the BBQ so I went back to have the rolls replaced. I arrived at the restaurant around 1:25 p.m and asked to speak with a manager (whose name I do not recall).  To be fair, the manager came over apologized and he offered a replacement dozen of rolls fresh out of the oven and advised it would be about 6 minutes. That was nice; my concern lies in the statement the manager made after he took the dozen rolls I brought back.  The manager asked if I had "touched the rolls" because if I had not touched the rolls they could be used to make "bread pudding".  At that moment I wanted to leave the restaurant and I would have left had the replacement rolls not came fresh out of the oven. My concern lies in the area of food, health, and safety issues.  Is taking returned food from guest and reusing it standard operating procedure for Golden Corral? I am not an expert by any means in the area of food preparation.  However, I do realize that food safety is a scientific discipline and the proper handling, preparation, and storage of food is the only way  to prevent foodborne illness. Food can transmit disease from person to person and standard precautions should always be adhered to.  When you are a guest at any food establishment your thought is; the food ought to be safe, and the preparation of the food should be such as to avoid potentially severe health hazards, such as taking returned food from a guest and reusing that product. I am not sure if I will ever revisit Golden Coral again but I know without a doubt that  I will never go back to your Avondale location.  The thought of reusing food that a guest returned is enough to keep me from coming back to that location. Thanks Dxxxx Gxxxxxxx 1xxxx W Xxxxxxxxx Ave Xxxxxxxx,  Arizona xxx-xxx-xxxx

2ND Annual Rib Giveaway. 1st 100 customer got a t-shirt, 1/2 rack of ribs and a coke.When I arrived at 9:45 for the 10 o'clock openiong I expected to be 70-80 people back but I made it at #23/#24!!Las Vegas is so spoiled people just don't get out to these things.We are not a city where people camp out overnite or even plan ahead for anything.By the seat of the pants thats how we roll.So they brought out numbered shirts and cups for free drinks then let 10 people in at a tim eto get their ribs & order sides if they wanted.I went in the 3rd group which I only had to wait 5-10 minutes and I was sitting in the A/C chowing down.Despite the turnout being kinda lazy it was fun & I will be out next year to take advantage of their hospitality.

Review Text :
The new Mario Batali restaurant in the venetian, much more casual than B&B, yet still very cozy and gorgeous.  They are conscious about keeping it portion controlled, so i didn't get too full, which was good.  We had the carne grande appetizer, which was 5 different italian handmade meats (such as prosciutto and finocchiona) and different cheeses such as parmigiano and gorgonzola.  Very good, very light.  They brought apricots to add on and made it extra tasty.  Also had a margherita pizza and a pennette pasta with eggplant.  All quite good.  For dessert, try the salted caramel gelato...after the strange initial salt burst, it's a nice taste (if you can get past salt on gelato).on a side note - the menu is in italian and the staff is more than happy to explain everything to you.  Our waiter explained everything to us and was extremly helpful and courteous...check this place out when you need a light lunch!Long overdue review. We went here 1.5 months ago. With a $25 restaurant.com certificate. I wanted to like this place. I really did. The wine was fantastic, the service was fabulous. Wish I could say the same about the food. They don't seat people early. So we were seated a few minutes after 8. No problem, we were hanging out at the bar anyways. We were greeted with a smile and individually packed crunchy bread sticks. Awesome. We ordered a cheese plate with five varieties. It came with three dipping sauces. I prefer the cheese without the sauce. Maybe that's just me. We've heard great things about the prosciutto balls. An order comes with six. It's salty. Very salty. Didn't go down well at all. Then we had the crispy duck. More like burnt, overcooked duck with no flavor except charred meat. And there was barely any meat. The goat cheese pizza did little to salvage the meal. But it was the better of the three dishes. Overall, I was thoroughly disappointed. How did Mario Batali become an Iron Chef if these are the products that his restaurant comes out with?I originally wanted to do brunch at Bouchon but they are closed on Mondays for brunch. BOO! We ended up wondering around for a while and ended up here. (Lots of the nicer restaurants are not open at 11am on Mondays.) Sitting "outside" in the Canal area at the Venetian is beautiful, the people watching and the performers are fun too.  To start off they gave us this bread but it was burnt?? The waiter tells us that "the crust is suppose to be that way." hmmm?? okay? I didn't get it, it tasted like burnt bread to me. We ordered an Insalate- grilled radicchio with smoked mozzarella. This was good the cheese was baked on top with the crispy radicchio at the bottom. Yummy!As the main entrees we had the Gemelli - house sausage and broccoli rabe. I love the gemelli noodles they were cooked perfectly, texture was just right and they had a unique shape. The other dish was the Bavette Cacio e Pepe- black pepper and percorino. A very simple dish however, full a flavor you can really taste the noodles but it was a salty. The portions seem small when you look at them compared to how much pasta you get at other restaurants but, I was stuffed by the end of lunch. And you should be with a $50 lunch tab. I wonder how B&B would be??? (A lot more expensive, I know that much) :P

Review Text :
OMG!  The BEST French fries in town!  Real, fresh-cut fries with the skin still on. The perfect crispness and greasiness!  Their burgers are to die for.  Freshly cooked, pure beef.The place has been around for 57 years.  It's had a total of 4 owners in that entire time.Really nice people and service, too!I finally convinced Hubby to give Lucky Boy a try, based on all the rave reviews by trusted Yelpers. We almost didn't get out of the car, however, when we pulled into the back, only to see a group of apparent drug addicts huddled at the side of the Circle K. One woman (?) was alternately pounding a man in the chest, snapping back his head by means of his hair, and then spooning him. Ah, meth. You are truly a showman.Anyway, when we decided to brave it, it was well worth the risk. The burgers were made from fresh, great quality beef, cooked to almost crispy on the outside, and yet still magically juicy on the inside. Fresh bun and toppings, and absolutely awesome fries. Super hot and wonderfully seasoned. I usually get some heartburn after eating fried foods, but had zero issues with Lucky Boy. We got some shakes to go- I had strawberry and Hubby had peanut butter. They were good, and very thick, but we both agreed that we prefer the more intense flavors of the shakes at the Chicago Hamburger Company.Will we be back? You betcha. And not just for the "scared straight" factor.Think In-N-Out burger on steroids before it became a chain. That's this place. I officially 'heart' Lucky Boy Burger Shop. I really can't imagine anything bad to say about the food, prices, or service at Lucky Boy. Some people might be offended by the location or the decor, they definitely didn't splurg on interior design. But, it's part of the charm and it keeps prices low. Where else can you get a 1 lb burger and fried mushrooms for less than $5? I just wish they were open on Sundays.I had to make the Great Circle trip to DoPho and CenPho, although I always think of it as GoPho (going to Phoenix...it seems like a long journey).Today I got to take a baseball bat to the temple twice in one day!I had to spend quality time with my accountant and more of the same with my health insurance agent...just one of those mornings.I needed to treat myself, although after a visit with my business friends, I somehow felt it needed to be an inexpensive treat.My insurance agent is just north of Lucky Boy and that's where I went for my late lunch. I needed a scotch, and a Lucky Boy burger may not be the next best thing, but it's pretty damn good.I had not been here since last fall, but it really never changes (at least not since I came to AZ). They just make a good, simple burger. There aren't any tricks (no butter flavored whatever on the buns). The fries are crunchy outside and fluffy inside. The buns are soft, but hold together well and the meat is charred, but not crusty and overdone.Are there better burgers in the Phoenix area?...I'd have to say yes. Are there better drive-thru burgers in Phoenix?...I don't think so. Lucky boy is terrific...fresh, tasty, inexpensive (my meal was under $5.00), fast and the people at Lucky Boy are just extremely nice folks. Let's all do our  part and make them busier!I recently had one of the worst days of my life and that's not an exaggeration. I received some really bad news mid day, mid week and kinda walked around in a fog until I get off work at 5:00pm. In a Xanax induced coma; tired and starving due to skipping lunch I happened upon Lucky Boy. I've been meaning to stop in for awhile but just never made it happen.Now, I'm not one of those chicks that drowns her sorrows in french fries and ice cream, quite the opposite actually so I figured I'd take advantage of my appetite. I ordered an "international burger" and fries and some sort of large carbonated beverage. It was wonderful. The fries were crispy and perfectly salted and the burger was one of the best I've had in a very long time. The ingredients were fresh and the price was right. I'm sure there are better burgers out there, but I can't think of any. I ate the whole fucking thing and was actually sad when the experience was over. I'll be back soon to gorge myself on some other menu items. Maybe I'll wait for PMS to kick in, maybe I wont. All I have to say is this- there is something comforting about smothering your insides in cheese and oil. Lucky Boy may not solve all of your problems, but it fills the void in your tummy without having to prepare a meal when you are out of your flippin mind.And that's something....I would say my husband is the "Lucky Boy" with a wife who is more than happy to dine at such a fine establishment.  You won't find kobe beef or antelope on the menu, nor some crazy topping like foie gras.  And brace yourself, no sweet potato fries either.  But you will find a pretty damn good burger and fries for under $4!  Who knew they still even existed?The burger is everything an old-fashioned burger should be, standard with mustard, ketchup, chopped lettuce, tomato, and onion.  And just so you don't forget we're in Arizona, they offer pepper jack cheese and green chilies.  The fries are thick cut and crisp, and they mix a mean milkshake, too.  We ate inside, and yes, it is kind of a dive, but a clean one.  It reminded me of the kind of burger joints that were around when I was a kid.  Yes, they had burgers back then.A nondescript little place off 16th Street that is light on ambiance but heavy on tasty old- fashioned hamburgers.  The thousand-island combo was a tri-monthly ritual when I lived in that part of town.  This is the type of place that cable channel "hole in the wall food showcase shows" are made for.

Review Text :
why is this place so far away??we ordered a burger, the grilled chicken sandwich, fries and onion rings. we topped it off w a fresh strawberry shake since it was the special for the day. we split everything and boy oh boy was it great! I have also heard that their pizza is awesome and their breakfast. I need to go back and get both.also, don't forget to check out the bathroom. i think i spent like 15 minutes in there. lol jk. it is pretty entertaining though.9/11Finally made it out here!  While they were offering up their "Dog Days of Summer" (everyday in September offered two different gourmet hot dog selections, most of which sounded divine even though I rarely consume them nowadays) and fresh lemonade, I decided to try their bacon blue cheese burger with sweet potato fries.While I waited for my order, I decided to check out the restroom facility to wash my hands and found, to my slight discomfort, an animation film classic "Stingray" playing on a 13" television console inside (along with showcases of Barbie and Ken on the walls).  While novel to see, as I said, this blast-from-the-past just made me want to leave the facility as fast as I could.  Something about those faces creeps me out!This burger was SUPERB!   I cannot find fault in any of the components, from the grilled bun and perfectly-grilled patty, to the tasty homemade BBQ (a popular offering from JFG's sister company, Joe's Real BBQ) smothered on huge and crispy bacon and onion rings, to the heavenly chunky blue cheese dressing!  (Oh, that blue cheese dressing... Just give me a cup of this dressing and a straw to slurp it all up and I'm a happy camper!).  The sweet potato fries were amazing!!  Yes, I'd gladly drive 70 miles RT to order this platter of food again and again.  But, let's not forget to make room for dessert!  Hot fudge sundae lovers must try the mud sundae, a twist on the classic hot fudge sundae with malt added.  Mmmm....It was a little busy when I arrived at 11a, and thankful I was to arrive then for the lunch time crowd was ridiculous!  Patio-seating (shaded by trees) was crowded, and indoors soon mirrored the patio, with a line threatening to extend beyond the doors (and it was so hot that day, too!)It's confession time: I love a man and his name is Joe Johnston. Not in the way you might think, but in an admiration and respect kind of way. Johnston owns some of my favorite southeast Valley eateries, like Joe's Real BBQ and Liberty Market. He also has another place, Joe's Farm Grill, that's been featured on Diners Drive-ins and Dives.Built out of his childhood home, Joe's Farm Grill is at Agritopia, a neighborhood being built around a farm in Gilbert. Many of the vegetables and herbs come directly from the farm and right into Joe's kitchen. It doesn't get more local than this.You'd have to squint really hard to figure out what the house may have looked like before it was converted into a restaurant. The place has a retro-modern flair with a nod to the 1960s. The lighting fixtures are groovy, baby.The ordering process is as straightforward as the menu approach the window and place your order. You're given an electronic buzzer that gives you a good scare when your food is ready. I swear, I jump every time.The interior is relaxed and comfortable with plenty of open seating, though the best seats are actually outdoors under giant shade trees.Also outdoors is the condiment bar with ranch dressing on tap. Any place that has one of my favorite dips for French fries on tap is a winner in my book.The mainstream menu of burgers, pizzas and salads caters to the stroller pushing set that frequents Joe's as well as anyone who enjoys fresh, well-prepared food.My mouth started watering instantly when I saw how good the food looked. I quickly sank a bite into the Farm Burger ($7.99), which was well seasoned and perfectly juicy. Weighing in at 6 ounces, then covered with a choice of cheese and grilled onions, this is one tasty burger.The Thai Chicken Salad ($8.99 small/$9.99 large) takes local greens and veggies, crispy rice noodles and peanuts, then tosses them in spicy Thai vinaigrette. This one was a disappointment because I felt that the dressing was unbalanced with too much sweet and sour and not enough spice.Joe's pizzas take on a slightly crisp char from being grilled rather than baked. Knowing that Joe does barbecue right at another of his restaurants, ordering the BBQ Chicken Pizza ($8.99) was a no brainer. Smoked chicken breast, bacon, blue cheese, fresh tomato, red onion and with Joe's Real BBQ sauce sounded like a lot of ingredients, but they worked surprisingly well together. The tangy bleu cheese and smoky sweet BBQ sauce created a yin and yang of flavors, a great combination.For dessert, Joe's has milk shakes ($3.99) including vanilla, chocolate and seasonal fruit.So it's with much love that I say I'm looking forward to visiting again soon.I've run the gamut on onion rings... from two days ago experiencing the worst at Pete's, to today experiencing the best at Joe's.These people were on their A-game tonight. The pulled pork & baby backs had such a flavorful smokey essence, while the chicken strips were an amazing taste combination between chicken parm and BBQ sauce.  Did I mention they have the best onion rings ever?A great example of a restaurant that doesn't skimp, rather display an eye for detail. It takes more prep time, but it's worth it, and it shows.The shrimp basket was very good, and the homemade cocktail sauce was the crowning jewel.What's better than a surry with a fringe on top?  Howz about a hot dog with an egg on top.  Delectable!Dear Mr. Johnston,The trifecta that is Liberty Market, Joe's Real BBQ and Joe's Farm Grill are bad for my diet.  I'm not saying it's your fault but if the food at your fine establishments were not so darm fresh and tasty, I would be thinner.  I crave your food.  And when I went to Joe's Farm Grill for the first time it was so good, I went back the very next day!!  Obviously you love what you do and we reap the benefits so thank you!  But my waistline does not thank you.  Sincerely, Lynn W.7/07/10Don't get me wrong, I still love JFG; I just didn't care for its BBQ pulled pork sandwich and fries.  The coleslaw was good, but not so fantastic that it's worth the pain after.  I thought that the pork had too much of the cloyingly-sweet sauce.  Wasn't so sweet when paired w/ the garlic toast points.  However, if you look at the included photo, you'll see that the two pieces of bread were under the pork, and therefore completely saturated w/ sauce.  I like accompanying bread to be crispy/crusty (love that crunch!), so all I had to enjoy that afternoon w/ the pork was the part that stuck out from under all that sauced meat!  What a waste (tsk, tsk)!  The boat of fries was just a complete soggy mess.  I should've asked them to sub sweet potato fries instead, but why must I pay extra to get a perfectly crisped product?  Then again, one (wo)man's treasure is another (wo)man's trash, and vice-versa, eh?Today wasn't a great day for me w/ regards to Mr. Johnston's two restaurants (see my "recent" Coffee Shop review).  I hope my next visit to a Johnston concept yields a happier adventure!Is there anything better than eating outdoors on a nice sunny day with temps in the low 80's on green grass among plenty of citrus trees and evergreens  in Phoenix Arizona??  Well this is the setting everyday throughout the fall and spring at Joe's Farm Grill!!I can't believe I haven't written a review on Joe's Farm Grill already.  It's an awesome place to take the family and friends for breakfast or lunch.  Their menu is built around things people love to eat now a days and it starts in their garden rather than in their restaurant.  They actually grow most of not all of the produce they use in their dishes on site. They will offer some seasonal sides, dishes and deserts based on the seasonality of their fruits and veggies.  There are loads of reviews already written about specific dishes that are favorites at Joe's Farm Grill, so I wont go into a lot of details concerning their menu.  Some of my favorites at Joe's Farm Grill ~ BBQ smoked chicken pizza which is grilled with some char, topped with plenty of blue cheese, some veggies and BBQ sauce.  It is DELISH and the perfect app to share with friends. Some of my fav's: ~Fontina Burger, Chicken Pesto sandwich,~Sonoran Dogs ~ get the X2 for $9.99 with either their tasty onion rings or sweet potato fries with their Pineapple-serrano dipping sauce,~Ahi Tuna and the grilled peanut butter and banana sandwiches~Thai Ahi Salad and Chicken Caesar Salad All of these are a flavor-fest your mouth and tummy will thank you for later :^) Don't forget to leave room for desert at "The Coffee Shop" or a tasty shank/malt!  Everything at Joe's Farm Grill is is well prepared and they are consistent in delivering quality, fresh tasting food.  This place can get insanely busy on the weekends especially when the weather is nice.  You may want to plan your visit to Joe's either early lunch or late breakfast during the week.  Bring your dog and kiddos so they can play on the green grass and enjoy a meal outside.  I hope to see you at Joe's soon!I wanted to move to Agritopia when my ex and I were looking for a big old house in east Gilbert.  I urged him to consider Agritopia.  I extolled the virtues of the charming neighborhoods, tree lined streets, real front porches, alley accessed garages, the centrally located elementary school for our son, the availability of fresh produce raised within the subdivision, and I went on and on but he wasn't having it.  I think he secretly suspected that I was trying to indoctrinate him into some new fangled 21st century commune or something.  Now I realize exactly what I did wrong.  I didn't force him to come get a meal at Joe's Farm Grill, which just happens to be within a stone's throw to Agritopia and also uses Agritopia's produce garden.  (Or maybe it's Joe's Farm Grill garden and Agritopia uses it?  I dunno, but I do know the two are somehow linked.)    If I had only dragged him into Joe's Farm Grill I could have sealed the deal, I'm sure of it.Joe's is a really neat little place, surrounded by towering Tamarack trees that have been there forever.  The structure was originally the late 1950's to early 1960's ranch style family home (and former farm) of the same family that now owns Joe's.  Also the family has two other top-notch restaurants, Joe's Real BBQ and Liberty Grill.  The house has since been professionally and radically retrofitted into be a sleek, yet still somehow retro, restaurant, with bathrooms that are so fun and funky that you just have to go there and see for yourself what I mean.  (Trust me.)  The restaurant still retains the old front room of the original house, including the fire place, and it is now a dining room.  It's not hard at all to imagine Joe's family settled around their Christmas tree in their pajamas in the mid-1960's opening presents, completely oblivious to the fact that someday their front room would be a seating area for one of the best places to eat in the whole damn Valley.  Yep, I said it: One of the best places to eat in the whole damn Valley; that is NO exaggeration.The food here is amazing.  It's wildly flavorful, perfectly cooked, and deliciously paired with different sides and it's all reasonably priced to boot.  They know what they do here, and they do it perfectly.  My personal favorite here is the seared Ahi Tuna sandwich with a Wasabi dressing.  I can't even describe how good it is.  It's just a flat out flavor bomb.  (Tip: I will reiterate that the tuna is seared, so if you get it and are expecting a fully cooked tuna steak you will be confused and perhaps even disappointed; don't be, just eat it and savor the deliciousness of a perfectly seared tuna steak on a toasted bun with a wonderful Wasabi dressing and a zesty Asian slaw.)  It is my favorite sandwich from anywhere, ever.  I have also tasted their pizzas, burgers, hot dogs, shakes (come topped with a green cherry!) and French fries and all have been outstanding.  I really cannot find a single criticism for this place.Oh wait, I just thought of one criticism; that there isn't a Joe's Farm Grill closer to my home, since my ex refused to let us buy a house there.   *pout*Fast food quality, with high end restaurant wait times.My wife and I live near downtown Phoenix/Mid Town, so when people give us restaurant recommendations to trendy spots, we love to check them out. This place was horrendous. First of all the wait, when we went, there was a line, we later discovered the reason for the line was they had one person on the register. Even though the owner was out shaking hands and getting ready to leave, the second register was never opened. By the time we got to order, 50 minutes had passed and we got to the point of where "maybe" the food quality may make up for the horrible wait.Nope! It took about 5 minutes to actually get our food, so the issue wasn't food prep, it was just the horrible logistics of this business. I ordered a farm burger, medium with bacon and cheese. What I got resembled something that had been marinated in grease for about 12 years then under cooked and served on a delicious bun, but 2 minutes into the meal the bun resembled a soggy rag. The fries had a weird taste to them, I ended up not eating my meal. My wife got through about half of her burger before she complained about the greasiness.I put the burger quality on par with an in-and-out, smash burger, five guys style burger. However, would you wait 30+ minutes for one of those? No, so I will never return here and I will chalk up all of the recommendations for this place to, suburb folks that have never experienced real dining.This is one of those local restaurants where you know you can bring out-of-towners to that is sure to impress!  The restaurant is built out of the owner Joe Johnston's 1960's childhood home (renovated of course!).  The bathrooms feature kitschy glass box displays of vintage Barbies and GI Joes.  It's a really cool space!  You order at the register, are given a vibrating pager, and can choose to sit inside or outside under the trees overlooking the Agritopia urban farming fields.  The vibe is super relaxed, patio dog friendly, and most of the vegetables are freshly picked from the aforementioned Agritopia fields -- as fresh and local as produce could possibly get!  The place has even been featured on the Food Network.Food-wise, everything here is good.  Great pizzas (I love the veggie one), burgers, (once again, I'm a fan of the veggie burger), fries (regular, garlic, and sweet potato -- yum!), salads, strawberry lemonade, date shakes...the list goes on.Side Note: Come here on your birthday and get $10 towards your meal (you can also do this at Joe's other 2 local restaurants -- Liberty Market and Joe's Real BBQ if you're up for the challenge!).

Restaurant name  Z'Tejas Southwestern Grill

Review Text :
As far as location and overall vibe of Z'Tejas goes- it's a hit. It seems to serve alot of young, attractive people... The outdoor eating and bar is fun- and the big screen TV's are a cool... but the food and service was just a total miss for me. Unfortunately, the food just didn't have much going on. First, the cornbread is a fun idea and is a nice change to free appetizers- but it was super thick and lacked any real cornbread flavor or consistency. The Catfish Tacos were a whole lot of cabbage and not much else... i literally could not taste the meat flavor hidden under the amount of cabbage stuffed in. And sadly, the Baked Seafood Enchiladas were another miss- it appeared to be two tortillas covered in sauce and rice with two shrimp inside... i couldn't taste much else and felt i could have taken a better stab at making this meal at home myself =/ (See my pictures to get a better idea)On top of this, the service was a bit lackluster. There seemed to be a waiter and waitress simultaneously serving us- one taking the order, one getting our drinks, the other bringing out our food, the other with our check-  As confusing as this was, it was difficult for me to get my water refilled and had to flag down the waiters 2-3 times to get their attention.I'd like to add that during my stay in Phoenix i saw the hottest girls of my entire vacation at Z'Tejas(which was a plus, lol) But seriously, If you're cruising the mall and looking for a quick bite to eat- it wouldn't be a bad idea to check out Z'Tejas, just don't expect to much... i'm sure this place does it's drinks much better =)L.W. and I stopped here for a quick HH bite before a Yelp Shop Local event.  We were greeted immediately and seated in the back.  It was nice!  Our server came to greet us quickly and took our drink orders.  The drinks came quick and we placed our food order of many appetizers.  Catfish Beignets - They are catfish crusted with cornmeal and fried crisp served with jalapeno tartar sauce.  WOW, these little fried strips of heaven were so so SO GOOD!  Smoked Chicken Quesadilla - Grilled chicken with onions and green peppers, cheese, and salsa stuff.   I am not sure what but both L and I thought it was ah, ok.  Green Chile Shredded Pork Nachos - OMG... These are SO SO good.  Only minor con:  The server had to be reminded to refills our drinks.If I am at Scottsdale Fashion Square this is my go-to place to eat, and I happen to usually end up there during happy hour!  The Raw Ahi Chipotle bites are fantastic!  But, it is not a lot of food to fill you up, so I recommend getting it half price during happy hour.  The pork nachos are good (but my favorite are at Fuego), and the street tacos hit the spot.  It is always pretty busy in here due to it being attached to the mall, and the servers always seem to deal with it in stride.  Their margaritas are fabulous and they have a great variety.  The sampler is always a good way to start if you have never been to ZTejas.  The only reason it gets 3 stars is I never seem to crave ZTejas; it is simply my go to place at the mall that has good food and a great happy hour... No complaints, it just doesn't wow me either.

Restaurant name  Mrs White's Golden Rule Cafe

Review Text :
We have been going to Mrs Whites for years now. We would go there as a treat every so often because there food was fantastic. Unfortunately it has really gotten pretty bad in the last year or so. Its really sad to, we loved Mrs Whites but not anymore.     The last couple times we went the food was pretty sub par. The portions were much smaller and the quality and taste was rather poor. A couple of times ago we went with myself, my mother and my brother. I dont want this to sound racist but I feel it needs to said. I felt like we were definitely the wrong color to be eating there.    The service was ok but i noticed it was much better for the "locals" who were there at the same time. We ordered and sat and waited for our meal. I watched as some of the people around me were brought the same thing I had ordered and it looked fantastic. Nice big pieces of chicken with large portions of sides.     Well finally our food came and what a disappointment. Our portions were MUCH smaller then everyone elses and the sides were about half the size. My mother ordered catfish, (her favorite thing there) and it looked like it was half a filet. My smothered chicken was 2 very small wings and one small breast, (I had ordered all white meat) and there was very little gravy and cabbage.      I went ahead and tried Mrs Whites one last time a couple weeks ago and it was more of the same thing. I ordered the smothered chicken again and when it arrived I received 2 small wings and a back bone with no meat. The table right behind me had the same thing and received 2 large breasts and a nice sized wing. After attempting to eat the skin off the back bone I gave up and ate what little else there was on the plate. My mother did get a nice sized catfish filet but both our sides were very small.     I no longer recommend Mrs Whites. It looks like the kids have taken over running the place and I think thats the problem. The gentleman who was always in the kitchen did a wonderful job of making the place a great choice for fantastic food but i dont see him there much anymore.    Stay away from Mrs Whites unless you happen to be the right color. Very sad.I'm not sure what is worse; ordering my food to go, eating fried chicken, eating fried chicken in the heat, or all of the above. Well, rain or shine, I love eating Fried Chicken and nobody can take that away from me. So I saw this little bungalow-like restaurant, which is located a block away from Chase Field and also not far from my hotel, that serve authentic Southern and Soul food. But my dining experience and decision-making has costed me my hopeful solid meal.I ordered the Fried Chicken dinner-combo for $12.00. The combo includes two sides with a slice of cornbread and I chose Rice and Mixed Collard Greens. I made a big mistake and opted to take my meal to-go to stuff my face with the fried chicken like a barbarian in my hotel room. My side of Collard Greens were very tasty and full of flavor, but a bit too watery, in which caused my side of rice to taste like a soup-like side and my monster-pieces of fried chicken's crispy skin and piece of cornbread were soggy. The fried chicken were very tasty, but it would've tasted a lot better if it wasn't for my misfortune. This restaurant accepts only cash. I should've ate in the restaurant, because the friendly workers treated me very well and strongly convinced me to eat in. I'll definitely will eat in the restaurant  next time.The restaurant has numerous awards from various sources including having the famous Yelp-sticker posted on the front door. The restaurant is also a favorite of the NFL's Arizona Cardinals, and NBA's Phoenix Suns with numerous pictures posted all over the facility.He confidently pushed the menu to the edge of the table with a hand calloused, wrinkled and bent by time and years of hard work fixing cars and pushing brooms. "I don't need the menu. I have been coming here for 30 years and they have the best chicken fried steak I have had in my life.""Hey, I know better than to doubt you, grandpa." replied the young man with the same face, minus 40 years and 30 lbs but with the benefit of an extra 4 inches in height.The old man ordered a lemonade to wash it down and the kid took a sweet tea, both ariving in giant plastic cups that reminded the kid, now nearly 30 of his childhood summers spent with his family in El Paso,Texas with his father's family who had moved with the army from Mississippi many years before he was born but brought the traditions of cooking for taste and comfort and damned be anyone for telling them it wasn't healthy.They sat quietly, tired from a morning of moving furniture into the young man's new home, reading the signatures on the wall. The old man pointed out and explained who some of the old-timers were, mostly polititians and actors who, while big in their day, were not legendary enough to cary into the vernacular of pop culture 30 years later, and the young man pointing out and explaining the athletes and musicians of his era.The waiter dropped off their chicken fried steaks along with their sides: Red beans, rice with gravy, greens and potatoes. They grinned in acknowledement of having made the right choices and began to eat."You know, her son opened a chicken and waffle place not too far from here." ther kid said, "but you are right; this place is better. Thanks for your help today grandpa."First off I would like to punch the dip Shit on the food network who said this was the best chicken he ever ate. Yeah the place is filthy, but how they operate their business is redicolus. Service sucks, 49 minute wait for the food sucks, waiting 20 minutes from the first  entree being dropped off until the last person luckily receives their food sucks, being told on the 59th minute of a hour wait for your food, that they are out of your side dishes, sucks, spending my hard earned money at a place that is Ass backwards in any kind of business sense, sucks. At first our group thought it was a joke, then the reverse racism theory was brought up, then we noticed that every table was experiencing the same lack of service. Black, white, purple,orange. They just sucked.So I admit I am a food network junkie and I honestly only went to this place because I saw it on best I ever ate fried chicken episode but come on best I ever ate fried chicken in Phoenix I had to see for myself.  Well Mrs. White backed it up with some amazing chicken and I don't know what previous reviewers were talking about with the sides because my grandma from North Carolina was in town and her and I both liked the red beans and macaroni salad.  The staff was friendly and even sent me home with two extra pieces of chicken for later.  This place is awesome and I will for sure be a repeat customer.Also whoever said KFC has chicken as good and it's cheaper well keep going back to KFC and stay outta places like this cause you don't belong.  Just sayin'.  KFC aint got nothin on Mrs. White.I have vascillated on Mrs. White's for a few years now. Today's visit sealed the deal for me on why I won't return. I got a to-go order of fried chicken, black eye peas and rice with gravy (since they were out of mac & cheese at 11:30 am). As I waited for my order, I watched several plates of chicken being delivered to customers eating in. The pieces were so huge they were half falling off the plates and towering above them. I looked forward to the same as I drove home, especially since I paid $14.81 for my lunch- and that did not include a beverage. Imagine my dismay as I opened my box at home and discovered three tiny pieces of underseasoned not-so-fresh tasting chicken. What the hell? You give the sit down customers the best you have to offer because they might complain otherwise? You give me some bullshit chicken because I am doing carryout? The peas were mush, the rice & gravy was bland, and the cornbread was overdone on the outside and heavy and underdone inside. I guess you're overcharging your customers to bank-roll your retirement, which will surely come sooner rather than later since I can't imagine how you're keeping customers.Where to start? Let's start by addressing the false advertising on their website.  After hearing a few people talk about how good the food is there , we wanted to give it a try.  We viewed their website and if you look under Entrees, you will see the meals are all priced at $10.18 per plate.  Good deal! We arrive at the place and our first impressions are, the place needs cleaning and a paint job.  Most anyone can look past how a place looks if the service is great and the food is really good.  Most dive places I've been to have both... so the decor isn't something I get hung up on. Service...  marginal at best.  Some guy... guessing the owner... arguing with the staff, singing... just doing whatever.  I guess this is acceptable since he owns/runs the place?  Not the best thing to do in front of customers. (again... it's a dive... not expecting 5 star services)Server---  stops my wife in front of the bathroom door to ask if she knows what she wants to order.  Maybe wait until we are all seated and ready to order?  Thought this was pretty strange! Now the food comes out.  Chicken wasn't horrible, wasn't great.  The canned mac-n-cheese... right up there with the best High School cafeteria mac-n-cheese.... not good!  Right from a box or can... no flavor... not homemade.   Very disappointing to say the least.  The greens... again... from a can... maybe some additional seasoning added... but.. odds are... if they were too lazy to make real mac-n-cheese... then they were too lazy to make real greens.  Gravy on the chicken... same sad story... from a box/can.... just not good or great. Dessert--- sweet potato pie   not bad... probably one of the better things ordered.  What was crazy... if you can imaging this... take a normal/decent size slice of pie... now cut that in half and this was the serving size we got.  All for $4.99 a slice. NUTS!  $10 for two slivers of pie. A joke! Remember I mentioned the FALSE ADVERTISING at the beginning of this review.  All meals $10.18.  NOT TRUE!  The site hasn't been updated in who knows how long? You sit down and the menu does not show the pricing... only mention of pricing is the Ox tales for $15.00.  So... you would assume from the website the meals are $10.18 each.  WRONG....  for  two meals, two very sad/small slices of pie.... $41.00 No breakdown of the pricing ... the owner/manager just punched up some numbers on the calculator and that was the bill. All in all... this place needs new management... some passion put back in to  the kitchen... and they need to update/clean the place.  Not to mention... in this day and age... no excuses to not having an updated website.... to properly reflect your business and pricing.  I have a feeling when Mrs White was running this place... it was awesome... not anymore. Bad experience.. not even close to being worth the money spent. Avoid this place...save your money....Will not be going back... will not recommend this place to anyone I know.Went back today and took out another 10 vehicles as I rammed into the left lane to make the turn into the lot...I meant to try pork chops, or catfish...nope, I couldn't get past the chicken.Once again, this chicken did not disappoint.  I had an annoying end to this long work day when I got home with this chicken.  But as soon as I picked up the drumstick and took a bite, it ALL washed away...seriously.Let's back up.  When I opened my styrofoam container, I noticed that the chicken had gotten slightly moist from the being closed up for almost an hour after I got it.  I thought the experience was going to be lessened.  No.  The drumstick was a bit soggy on the bottom from sitting so long, but like I said, I bit into it and all the annoyances of life went elsewhere and bothered some other guy.Perfection.Even when soggy.Even when sitting for over an hour.If fried chicken remains absolutely delicious even after all that, you know you've got some special stuff.What gets me is that I saw some young folks in the kitchen, I don't know if either of them fried the chicken, but if so - someone has been teaching them the real deal.  This tastes like some old woman who has been through years of hurt and pain but also joy and love has cooked this.  Someone who KNEW what bad chicken was and KNEW how to avoid that at all costs.  Someone who cared what their food tastes like.  And if youngens' are producing this kind of fare, that deserves proper kudos.I notice there is not a 'professional' atmosphere here.  Like another reviewer said, anything seems to go.  Honestly?  So what.The food is too friggin good.  Yes, we are entitled to good customer service as customers.  But like I said before, you get what you put in with the people here.  You come in with an attitude, that is what you get.I know some people put a high high value on customer service and how staff presents themselves; I do, too.  But chicken THIS good, and I mean specifically THIS chicken that is THIS good...I can accept the very casual atmosphere here.Yes, I wish they would put a bit more pride in their professionalism.  But I promise you, this chicken will make lovers of fried chicken not give a flying flea's fanny about anything else.  In each experience I've had with it, the chicken is THAT good.When you go to Mrs. White's you will get down home food. You will also get down home service, which means prepare to be ignored while the staff talks and laugh among themselves.The food was good but the only problem is if you go two hours before closing time they will be out of most (if not all) of the side dishes and desserts, which is very odd. You rarely find it crowded (except maybe on Sundays after church) so it seems as if they would rather have less sides or just enough than too much. I can't imagine a restaurant constantly "running out of food" all the time.It took us about 45 minutes to get our food and only after the waitress told us every 15 minutes they had no more mac and cheese, then no more sweet potatoes, then no more greens. The chicken was very good and so was the cornbread, but I've been here several times and the service is the same.As we were looking to pay our bill the owner (or someone related to Mrs. White I assume) was on the phone talking to someone about going out that night, over charged us, swore we owed more than we did (all the while he's still having a conversation on the phone) and when we finally told him he over charged us he just said "oh".The food isn't enough to make up for the service and vanishing dessert and sides options, so I think I won't be going back.Whoever's got the Gold makes the rules and Mrs. White makes gold in that kitchen.While I'm pretty sure that's not the golden rule Mrs. White is talking about, I think this one is more fitting! Her Smothered Chicken Fried Steak, dripping in gravy might as well have been dripping in gold, it tasted awesome! I ordered mine up with Mac N Cheese and Sweet Potatoes, deciding on those over the okra and the collard greens was tough, but worth it.Unless you're on one of those reverse diet plans eating a minimum number of calories like an Olympic swimmer, you had better check you diets at the door; this ain't no place for calorie countin'. I told mine I was going out for a light jog on my lunch that day; "You really don't need to come along." I told her; I hope she bought it! The ambiance here is likened more to a waffle house experience than 5 star dining, with old school fast food type booths and seating. While you're here, read the wall closely enough, and you will find many Cool signatures penned right on to it. Famous musical entertainers, local and nationally accomplished athletes, and other famed diners can all be found to have dined here once upon a time.Our waitress was surprisingly fit and trim for someone who serves food at a Soul Food spot. I had to ask, "Just how do you keep that girlish figure while working and dining here?" which she replied with "running back and forth with orders all day" and "hiking my favorite trails" on her off days. I have to note that she is now my new inspiration. Maybe I need to get a job here. I wonder how that would go over for my diet plan? Hmmmm.Happy Yelping Phoenix, it's time to go for gold!This place has been around since I was born and critics seem to love this place. I am a big fan of Lolo's so this place should be even better right? I brought two of my foodie friends and we were excited about trying this place. Our high expectations were shattered with the worst service I've ever had and just downright lame food. The "world famous fried chicken" (which took 20 minutes to bring) tasted like Banquet frozen chicken. The server brought our cornbread 10 minutes after our lousy chicken. We had no silverware for a while.  My other colleague ordered the special ribs. He compared them to the McRib sandwich which I thought was an insult to Mickey D's. The men's bathroom didn't have hand towels to add to our misery. The coup de gras was we paid $16 for a crappy chicken plate and an iced tea. Everybody has a bad day but if you've been around for 48 years, you have no excuses.I honestly don't know how anyone can rate this restaurant more than 1 star.  We saw this restaurant featured on Check Please Arizona and being from the south, we were excited to try it.  I decided to take my husband there for his birthday.  Let me start off with the review of the food - it was terrible.  The chicken was greasy, and had no flavor.  The sides were as bad as a school cafeteria.  But the service is even worse!  We arrived around 1:30 on a Saturday.  There were 2 large tables of people and a few other tables but still lots of empty tables (the place is pretty small).  We chose a table in the back - huge mistake, because it reeked of the smells from the bathroom.  But I wanted to try to stay positive since it was my husband's birthday.  We waited only a few minutes before a waiter came by to give us menus and get our drink order.  We ordered non-sweet tea - however, we got one sweet and one non-sweet, we were able to get that remedied, but when the waiter came back to give us the tea, he wouldn't take our order even though we said we were ready.  He said he had to get a pencil and paper and would be back. Well, he didn't come back for almost 45 minutes!  That's not to say he wasn't around, when the large table's food was ready, the brought out the plates one by one - several minutes apart.  Several other tables came in during this time, while we were still waiting to order, he actually took he new tables orders before ours!  Finally, I spoke up next time he was in our vicinity and told him we still hadn't ordered.  Even after this, it took him about 10 minutes to come back!  We should have walked out, but now it was a mission to see how long it would take.  After we ordered, we waited again.  At some point, a man came out and asked a table near us, but who had came in well after us, how long they had been waiting, and this nice lady told him that our table had been waiting longer than hers.  Turns out, they got their food before we did!  In fact several tables that came in after us got food before us.  Finally, we got our food and let me say that I have had better fried chicken from KFC - I actually think they might have gotten the chicken from KFC, because I don't remember the smell of chicken frying in the restaurant.  And of course they got our sides wrong.  At the end of our meal, a lady came by again to the table near us and apologized for the delay and asked if she could provide a dessert on the house, again the nice lady customer informed the employee that in fact we had been there much longer than them, The employee then just looked at us and reluctantly came to our table and asked us if we wanted dessert.  Having lived in the south, I am familiar with racial tensions, and I have read the other Yelpers mentioning the disparity of service for non-dark customers, this place is worse than anything I have ever experienced.  Two hours waiting for a lunchtime meal!  That's CRAZY!  I felt unwelcome and unimportant to the business.  I will never go there again.  And after all of that, it was $34.00!!  Maybe they charge by the number of minutes you occupy the table?  I think I owe my husband another birthday dinner....

Review Text :
Sacks is where the beautiful people live at lunchtime. The menu board is mind boggling for the newbie. Step back and absorb. I got the Dali (all of the sandwiches are named for arteests) For me, it was my way of paying edible tribute to Subs by Jim, who went out of business recently. I even bowed my head for a little moment of silence before my first bite,... tear...I always got egg salad there.The Dali is Egg Salad, bacon, lettuce tomato, cream cheese and mayo. I held off the mayo, because my rule is if the filling has mayo, it is a sin to add more. Cream cheese was a little weird on egg salad, but it grew on me. Lightning quick service, but it should be with about 8 people behind the counter. Little cookie in the bag was a sweet bonus...haha, puns.Poore brothers chips, holla! Sweet Maui onion, yeah baby. Has anyone seen Parmesean and Garlic anywhere lately? That is my favorite, and according to the bag they still make it,  but I can't find them.Like this place. Will be back.

Restaurant name  Primanti Bros

Review Text :
Local dining icons deserve their own criteria for recognition.  That said, adding sliced tomato, coleslaw and a pile of fries to a deli sandwich defines the Primanti as a Pittsburgh-area institution.  Their cheesesteaks will never threaten the best of Philly's, nor will their pastrami or corned beef be mistaken for New York deli; this only serves to make the Primanti style unique.  I find their meats to be generally good, and reasonably generous.  Tomato on a corned beef sandwich can only be regarded as an acquired taste.  Personally, I'm not a fan of loading a sandwich with fries, but again, this is a matter of preference.  The assembled work is a massive sandwich which invites a machismo-driven, face-first dive into its mismatched imperfection.  After the second or third surfacing-for-air, the conclusion I've always had was of an enjoyable adventure.  Prices are downright cheap.

The gf and I continue to hit OSC on the weekends before or after our work out at the neighboring Las Vegas Athletic Club.Since my last review, the service continues to excel, the food is above average and overall, we enjoy the experience.  Slight ding - seems like the hash brown servings ( and they make very good hash browns ) are shrinking.I continue to order Jacobs  Slammin' Platter ( two eggs, slice of Canadian ham, bacon, sausage, 4-5 dollar pancakes, hash browns and bread with no charge option of a bagel ) three out of four visits.  The gf orders her egg white veggie omelet EVERY TIME.  Her dings - occasionally they put onions in the omelet even though she orders without.  She prefers a mixed fruit option instead of their banana slice only option.We will continue to visit OSC.attached pic of the slamming platterA friend recommended the Cafe as being one of the best places to have breakfast and I decided to check it out and see if he was correct.  Yes, he was!The place was very busy when I got here about 10 AM on a Tuesday morning.  The hostess asked me if I wanted a table and I asked if they had a counter.  They do and she took me there immediately.  The counter area was relatively empty.  From where I sat, it  looked like the place was once a pizza joint because of the oven along the wall there.Regardless, I was given a menu and brought a mug of coffee very quickly.  I then checked out the pancake/waffle section but they all seemed like they'd be larger breakfasts that I wanted to get.I settled on the Brooklyn Benedict which consists of two basted eggs on an open faced bagel with turkey cubes, spinach, and melted Swiss cheese all topped with Hollandaise.  It was excellent!  You are given a choice of bagel and I opted for the sesame bagel.  The combination of flavors--the turkey, Swiss cheese, and spinach--was wonderful!  The bene also came with potatoes.  I could have had fruit but why spoil a good breakfast?Coffee was refilled often and I was asked if I wanted a cup to go at no charge.  The staff was very accommodating and service was top notch.I wouldn't hesitate to return for breakfast here.  It is very good and they have a large variety of breakfast dishes.The OG. This place is your classic diner spot located in a strip mall. Sadly this is the norm in Vegas, but it doesn't take away from the fact that this place is actually a great option for breakfast and brunch.I highly recommend the snowcaps. Bagels cut into small pieces, pan fried in butter and topped with powdered sugar. These little sugar bombs will definitely shattered any diet plan you had going for you, so I would share these with your brunching buddy. Trust me, they give you plenty. The omelets and benedict's here are very good and satisfying, no small portions at the Sunrise, but my favorite is the Fiesta Benedict. An open-faced bagel with jalapeno bacon, pepper jack cheese, two eggs and a spicy hollandaise sauce, this meal is amazing and really has a great kick of heat. The hollandaise sauce is rich and creamy and the eggs are cooked to that perfect point of soft/medium yolk. I would avoid Sunday mornings and come right around 12:30pm, right as the crowds start to disband and there's no wait for a seat. Brunch proper my friends.Absolutely love this place. The interior may throw you off a bit as it is religious, but you can tell they put their heart in their food. My first impression was it was sort of a diner setting with (delicious) diner food, but respectfully, I'll call it a café.I came around 10am on a Saturday and the place was packed, both bar and tables. However, the wait was fairly short, which is appreciated. I ordered the eggs benedict over a sesame bagel. The hollandaise sauce is on the thin side and not super acidic (woohoo!). The hash browns are thinly cut, crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside. Their sausage pancake wrap is pretty bomb too. It is both savory and sweet so if you're in the mood for sausage, yet want the sweetness of maple syrup, I'd recommend this.Service is quick, efficient, and a GREAT place for breakfast!

Restaurant name  Thai Style Noodle House
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
5 stars for hole-in-the-wall Thai - great food, bargain prices, basic atmosphere...often that's just what I'm looking for as a foodie.I've tried a number of Thai places in Vegas and this is the best by far.  Thai Style Noodle House could hold it's own in the Bay area...and that's saying something!As any good Thai restaurant should - TSNH brings the heat so aficionados can rest assured they will get the goods.  Thai newbies - I wouldn't order above a 5 (they do 1-10 on the heat scale).This will be one of my go-to spots in Vegas from now on!Thanks to Misti Y's review tipping me off to the vegan-friendliness of this place, I have expanded my realm of Las Vegas Thai food! Important note: do no use google maps to find this place, because you will end up at a XXX bookstore.  Which is cool if you need some porn to read over lunch, I guess, but annoying if you're just hungry.  The map shown here is correct (why didn't I just trust Yelp??) - it's two doors down from Veggie Delight.So, yes, they are very accommodating with the vegetarian/vegan requests and happy to oblige.  I went at lunch, but ordered off the dinner menu.  Now, this may have been a mistake simply because they have an awesome lunch special! You can choose an appetizer (fried tofu, soup, or spring roll, I believe - the fried tofu looked awesome!) and one entree (~$5.45) or two (~$7.25).  That's a lot of food for cheap!We shared a papaya salad, green curry with tofu and vegetables, and chili basil fried rice with tofu and veg.  We ordered everything a 7 out of 10 spicy, and it was perfect (I do like pretty spicy food!).  First, let me give these folks some love for NOT putting the much-maligned baby corn in any of our food.  The mere appearance of those mutants is always a buzzkill when I'm about to dig into a dish.  Second, the portions were very generous.  I'm a hearty eater as is my friend, and we had enough leftovers for at least one of us to stuff ourselves again.  Third, everything was very tasty.  Maybe not the best I've ever had, but delicious enough for me to eat til I hurt.  Four, the prices! Cheeeeeaaaaaaaap! $6.95 for a huge entree? yes please!The ambiance was nil, but the service was friendly and fast, and I don't got to a tiny Thai place for lunch because of the ambiance.  This place is definitely going in the rotation, and next time hopefully I won't forget to order brown rice!I crave Tom Yum Soup every time I get sick... and so I went out in my quest to find it. Not only did I discover a new hole in a wall place, but I have to say is my new favorite place for this particular soup.The location is a hit and miss.. You can barely read anything that says Thai Restaurant, but instead look for Noodle House... you'll have a better chance in finding it. Even parking was bizarre to me... you can park in the back alley, but I prefer somewhat of a parking lot... so I parked a few blocks down and walked over.The place itself is tiny.. nothing fancy, maybe a bit run down, but they had a flat screen to watch some T.V. and posted up new items specials on the wall to read. I ordered their Thai Style Tom Yum House Soup ($6.50) which had slices of fish cake, fish balls, ground and slice pork, shrimp and chose flat noodles which I love!!! Something about the thin fat noodles that makes it so much more enjoyable.. Absolutely loved this combination. I also requested to add extra sliced garlic... and even though the server looked at me like whoa are you serious... I told her I was sick and needed the extra garlic to help me get well. Then she understood and added it on. She even sprinkled fried bits of garlic on top to finish it off. How sweeeeet!!!When the soup came... boy was it in a huge bowl. I was so delighted and happy to see such a generous portion given to little ol' me. Yes I blinked a few times out of excitement and joy to see this beauty of Tom Yum unfold before my very own eyes... the colors were beautiful and vibrant. Almost like looking through a warm sunset in Laguna Beach... Okay okay enough of day dreaming... but this soup was enticing to just look at and the aroma of sourness and spiciness just flowed all through my senses.. giving me this watery gulp of happiness. One sip and I was in LOooove. I literally said Aaaaaaaaaaaah. *sighed on how good this tasted. I mean the elements of tangy and spicy hit the right notes and everything blended ever so nicely. The pork meat was tender, fish cake and balls were soft and fluffy, and the flat noodles I can't stop raving about. I literally took half of the soup home and ate it twice throughout my day. It was still delicious and the flavor was still consistent to how it tasted at the restaurant. The only thing I would point out.. especially if you love shrimp... I only had one in my entire soup. Maybe it wasn't suppose to be in there... or it only comes with one lol Oh and I ordered some hot tea... which was Jasmine Tea and it was gooooood!!! I mean it almost had a light vanilla hint to it, but right when I was down to my last cup... the kind, attentive server asked if I would like more... and so I finished two tea pots of that delicious tea. I enjoyed sitting there by myself... drinking this tea for the enjoyment of having it. Great stuff....Overall, I will definitely recommend anybody to check this place out.. I was very pleased and felt 100x better after eating there. I even thought about eating there the next day!!! I'm going to be a regular... since this is my new Thai/Chinese restaurant that I can't get enough of. Maybe I'll even see you there :)*11/10/10I actually did eat there the next day LOL (Today) Lily I hope I spelled her name right.. served me again and this time it was for takeout. She recognized me on the spot and said... OOooh you're back!!! I told her I loved the soup and my body wanted more. Ordered the same as yesterday... Tom Yum House Soup... with extra sliced garlic. She even asked me if I wanted some hot tea to go while I wait... that tea was so good so of course I said yes!!! She even asked if I wanted it refilled before I go... how nice is that?!??! I told her I was sick and their soup was the cure for me... She sked me what my name was and before leaving suggest next time to order the original Tom Yum to help my sickness since it's more stronger. Lily wanted to introduce me to the lady chef that made my soup for me... and not me but She wanted to thank me for enjoying the soup she made. I thanked her for making it sooooo good!!! So good I had to come back the next day!! And that never happens... sometimes when you're sick... your body tells you what it needs... and sometimes you have to be your own bf/gf to your soul and feed it. I literally drove myself down there in traffic hours to get that soup. Yes my soul was determined :)  Great service, food, and price. It's a must try!!!*11/15/10Went for lunch and had their Spicy Eggplant and sticky rice w/ mango dessert which completed my meal. Lily, my favorite server... greeted me by name and welcomed me back. She was so attentive and remembered my request of extra garlic and put some fresh garlic slices on the side for me and got me my favorite hot tea in a flash. The Spicy Eggplant was delicious.. it's sauteed with bell pepper, white onion, Thai chili, and basil with the choice of pork, chicken, or beef... I chose chicken which was tender and juicyWe've been frequenting the Thai Style Noodle House's Fort Apache location quite a bit lately, and I wasn't even sure if I had been to their Wynn location yet.  I looked all over for my review of the place confirming whether or not I had been, and lo and behold, I find it in my "Unfinished Reviews" section.  So, here it is...finally.Thai Style Noodle House offers both Chinese and Thai food, but mostly Thai.  Our party of four ordered a few dishes to share so we could sample a bit of everything.* Beef / Pork Jerky "Beef / pork marinated in special Thai herb, dried in one sun and deep fried" ($6.95) - We chose the beef option and the Husband is the real expert on this since he tends to get it a lot.  I found it to be just okay though, it was a bit too dry for me.  (Whereas other places make their variation a bit more moist.)* Grill (Chicken, Pork, or Beef) Salad "Your choice of sliced meat cooked with red and green onions, mint leaves, ground roasted rice, chili, and lime dressing." ($6.95) - We chose the beef option and the Husband loved it.  I thought it was just okay and lacked something - a bit more sauce and zest would have been nice.  Then again, this is something that the Husband has had a lot of.* Roasted Duck Noodle Soup "Noodle with boneless sliced roasted duck and Yao Choy in Thai herb duck broth." ($6.95) - This wasn't my top choice to order, and it was just okay.  There was nothing special about the roast duck at all.* Pad See-eu "Stir fried flat rice noodle and egg, Chinese broccoli in sweet black soy sauce." ($6.75) - This was okay with chicken and greens, although it was a bit flat.* Red Curry "Thai red curry with your choice of chicken, pork, beef mixed with bell pepper, bamboo shoot and basil served over steamed rice." ($6.75) - We chose vegetarian with soft tofu and I'm always a big fan of Thai curries.  They didn't disappoint here - good flavor and spice.  This was the real winner for me and I definitely would be back to try out their other curries.We also had Thai iced teas all around.* Mango with Sweet Sticky Rice ($3.50)* Fried Ice Cream ($3.50) - It had a nice crunchy batter with little ruby-like things in condense milk.Things I do appreciate about Thai Style Noodle House is that there are a lot of vegan and vegetarian choices, and they don't charge for brown rice.  I also like when they offer you a choice on the tofu - soft or fried.Service - it was busy the evening we went and with one waitress, she was kept on her toes.  She was friendly and on the top of her game, but then again, Bobby Y. (a regular) was dining with us.  So I think that may have helped us there.3.5 stars(I'm confident that I would give them a four star if I go back and try out their other curry dishes.  But since I've been having them at their Fort Apache location, I can definitely say their curries are yum!)Small little Thai restaurant in Chinatown! When we arrived right before lunch time on a Sunday, it wasn't too crowded, just one other table. We ordered and by the time our food arrived all the tables were full. I ordered the yen to fo noodles:http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=h4o8e_Xbca2kXQO_vzOqgg&select=KnaYT5QPzf1s79FqVfIg5QFlavor was good and I really liked that they added the fried wonton. I haven't had this soup for years, so it was nice to see it on the menu. And speaking of menu, they had such an extensive menu with lots of Thai dishes that you usually don't see. Everything we ordered was great. So if your in Vegas and your craving Thai food then this place is a great little Thai restaurant. By the time we headed off, there was a line next out the door waiting. After getting Thai food, make sure you also check out the poke place next door!Before I hit my errands, I need some fuel for my mind and body. So what better way to fill my tank up with my favorite Thai restaurant. I actually drove down the street to drop off my clothes to the dry cleaners and next to it was a Thai place to eat, but even that couldn't stop me from driving another three miles to eat where my heart tells me.I was greeted ever so kindly when I walked in and it wasn't surprising that almost every seat was taken. Luckily it was only me, myself, and oh yea I that wanted to dine here this day. The server asked what I wanted to drink, unfortunately they didn't have the Chrysanthemum tea, so I did my usual hot tea, but even that is soothing and delicious... tasted like a light caramel tea, but it's really jasmine tea. I was debating on the Duck Fried Rice, since Lily (server) recommended it when I ate there a couple of months ago. But I wanted some soup for my soul, because today was a very chilly and windy day. I ordered the Chicken Tom Yum Noodle Soup, Flat (fat shoe lace) Noodles, since it just makes it more delicious to me... mild (5) for how spicy I want it and this time I didn't want to torture myself as I usually do ha! and extra diced garlic.. what??!? I love garlic ok it does the body good! The soup came out in zero time and I loved the way it smelled. The steam evaporated in the air in slow motion, made it looks so heavenly fresh and I had to take a snapshot of it against the sun.. it just looked so Food Digest front cover magazine-ish. I sipped the soup broth first, it was like liquid nitrous for my engine.. my eyes lit up and made my facial muscles break a happy smile. I literally said Mmmmm gulping it down... Yea tell me about it... sound good right??!? It tasted so good, my own body melted. It had bits of cilantro, diced green onion, bean sprouts, and TONS of chunky sliced white chicken meat. Loved the flat fat noodles... it was just the right amount to make me a full bear, where I could hibernate right then and there. But all that time I was enjoying my soup, I was also craving their Mango with Sweet Sticky Rice. I ordered that dessert right after and when it came out.. I heard from the table across from me whispering.. that dessert looks so good!! And then all this time, two guys watched me devour my lunch and then this delicious dessert... I heard him say to his friend.. Dayam that girl can eat!!! Dayam right I can!??!! I'm not shy when it comes to eating and definitely will eat to my heart's content, bet your butt I will! So I just smiled at the guys and kept on eating. I'm enjoying my meal, so let it be! The dessert was the icing on the cake... the finishing touches of a great phenomenal meal. The mango was riped and perfect to eat. Every bite of the sticky rice was warm, soft, and soothing. Loved the coconut milk that drizzled down every time I took a slice from it. The ratio between the mango slices and sticky rice was even to every single bite I took. Absolutely loved this dessert. It's my favorite Thai dessert from any other. Their food has been consistent every single time I have gone here and the service is always very attentive and friendly. Refilled my tea without being asked and always came back to see how I'm doing. Loved the fact that after I finished my dessert, the server asked if there was anything else I would like haha I could possibly go for another dessert, but no I'll definitely be hibernating in that restaurant if I did. I always leave so happy and satisfied... No joke. And off I went to do my errands... it was a great day for another great Thai food experience.I really am a Lotus of Siam devotee, but this is food, not religion, so we're allowed open relationships.  If Lotus is my classier and more diverse wife, Thai Style Noodle House is my down-to-Earth and no BS mistress.  There are times when I just want to be taken care of, I don't want frills, just delicious, authentic, straight-up Thai goodness.  Those are the times I go to Thai Style.  She's all content, inexpensive, gives more than receives, and I love her.Everyone loves the noodle soup for a good reason, it's probably the best and cheapest you'll get in Vegas.  But don't forget to try other things, like the ginger snapper or the duck pad kee mao, both yummy!  The squid salad is not as good as Lotus, but it's half the price so there you go.  I'm sure there are things Lotus doesn't do as well as Thai Style.  Oh, am I defending my mistress over my wife?  I'm sorry, sometimes I can't control myself.Well, there's another thing with my mistress.  She surprises me with how thoughtful she can be.  There's a waitress at Thai Style that has an amazing memory.  I've been there three times, and she already has my preferences tattooed into her memory.  Yep, come on in to Thai Style.  She doesn't have to just be mine.One of my favorite Thai places in Vegas, and they fixed my one complaint about the place, they remodeled it so it looks way better!!!!Grilled beef salad, pineapple fried rice, pad se ew with shrimp *shoves face into food*One of my Vegas top 10 for sure!!!!  Don't expect to get the greatest service because you are not paying that much for the food.  But don't get me wrong, everyone is really nice and courteous, just don't expect a sommelier (I googled the spelling of that) to explain their wine list to you.  The place is packed, sometimes you gotta wait a while to get a table, sometimes you will be ignored when you want someone to take your order, sometimes you may feel rushed.  But you know what?  It's still THAT good, and everyone comes back.  Speaking of thai food, can someone invent a somewhat healthier version of Thai Iced Tea?!?  We have invented cellular phones, we send space ships to the moon, but we can't make a healthy Thai Iced Tea???!!!!!!  I was excited earlier, but now I am upset!!I've got a serious addiction to Thai Style Noodle House.  I've been here an embarrassing number of times and I don't think that I will be letting up any time soon.I can't say I would have ever tried this place if it wasn't for Yelp.  It's tucked away from the main road and is just a tiny little space with only a few tables.  And, let's face it, Chinatown isn't exactly vegetarian-friendly.  Luckily I have Yelp to fill me in - not only is this place good but it has a separate vegetarian menu as well! With a ton of items to pick from!! I really enjoy the Panang Curry but I have a spot in my heart for Spicy String Beans.  I don't know why I love it so much and I'm starting to question if they load it with nicotine before they give it to me.  It has a lot of flavor and the veggies are always fresh.  My husband switches between Yellow Curry, Spicy Noodles, and Thai Fried Rice and loves them all.  We've also had the Tom Kha soup and Vegetarian Dumplings and they were great as well.  Don't worry, my non-vegetarian friends, there are plenty of choices for you and everyone I've seen dining at the restaurant seems to enjoy their meals.Things to keep in mind: The place is very small so expect a wait during lunch and dinner rush.  Also, the tables can be a little tight so if you don't like eating close to strangers you may want to come at an off-time.  Finally, and most importantly, they are not joking around with the spice here.  I usually order a "medium" everywhere I go and am fine with it and can usually go spicier.  Here, I get a 3 out of 10.  And there have been a handful of times where it was still too spicy for me.  I say to err on the side of caution- you can always add more chili to your food later.So, vegetarians, rejoice!  There is another restaurant for you to add to your arsenal.  Just make sure to specify "no fish sauce."  While they are usually good about it without needing to say anything, we did have one experience where fish sauce added to our meals.If you ever find yourself in Chinatown looking for a new place to try, get your butt on over to Thai Style.  Just don't be hogging my table during the lunch rush!Small little mom & pop restaurant; if you're going to come here with a big group then you might have to wait. Great place to come after a night of partying & clubbing on the LV strip where you know you're trying to get over a hangover hahaha.. =)Noodles were very tasty & Yummy...5 starsPad keep Mao: Not greasy / oily but yummy 4 starsPad Thai so so yummy & tatsty noodles were awesome 5 starsPapaya Salad yummy & had a spicy kick to it. 4 starsThai Tea: yummy & thirst quenching 4 starsFood: A - (Portions are generous, but to go orders are very small) Don't order to go because the portions that they give in their to go orders are so so much smaller than when you sit down & eat inside the restaurant. -1Service: B-  (can be a bit slow)Decor: A - (interesting giant mural on the wall for you to check out while you eat) =)1/5 for the interior.5/5 for the food.Average: 3 stars. Seems a little unfair because I loved the food that I got here! The law of small numbers sucks and that's math for you.Okay so upon walking in, you can see clearly that it is just a hole in the wall kind of restaurant. I will go as far as saying that if I were to sit down and eat here, it is like eating in the bathroom of a gas station. I'm truly sorry if I just ruined your appetite. Instead, I asked for a to-go order of a papaya salad and a red curry with tofu. The papaya salad was extremely fresh because the vegetables were very nice and crunchy. Love it!!! Similarly, the red curry had just the right amount of viscosity while being flavorful and delicious and full of fresh ingredients. So good that I ate half the container without even realizing it. I plan on coming back for more as I'm now a  huge fan of the food here!Having read the reviews for Thai Style Noodle House I was really downhearted by the results. I found this location on yelp after some grocery shopping. The picture that are posted will tell the short version of this long tale!Thai Style Noodle House is small and can only sit a very limited amount of people. This is not the best place for a party greater than 4-6 people. The table are usually set for two people and if a table with 4 shows they will combine a table for you. They only have two racks of hot sauce  holders which you must share with all the table in the restaurant. My table of two ordered Chicken Pad Thai, Chu Chee Salmon, and Duck Fried Rice. I also had the Thai Style Ice Tea. The place would have received four stars but some error occurred on the waitress side. I placed an order for Thai Style Ice Tea in the beginning when they ask for drinks. She returns with water for my guest and nothing for me. She places our three orders and I start to wait. Once the chicken pad thai and duck fried rice has arrived I informed her about my miss drink. She recalls and bring me the Thai Style Ice Tea. I highly recommend the pad thai because it was delicious and the thai style ice tea. I was a little disappointed in the duck fried rice since it seem to have more pork than duck. We informed the waitress that we have not gotten the Chu Chee Salmon and she informed us it was coming. By the time we finish the pad thai and was almost done with the duck fried rice the Chu Chee Salmon has arrived. I am guess she has forgot about the order until the reminder. As the two star states: "Meh. I've Experienced better."Consistently bomb Thai food is in a tiny hole-in-the-wall spot in Chinatown. When you want solid staple dishes like pad thai, pad see eiu, tom yum soup (best with chicken), or green curry rice (love it with shrimp!), TSNH has you covered. But I think their specialty dishes are even better- especially the panang curry with avocado and salmon (so creamy!) and the pad ped snapper (maybe order a little lower on the spice scale than usual). Portions are generous, prices are low (rarely over $10 unless it's a seafood special), $30 can easily get a couple a takeout feast dinner with leftovers.

Burgers and fries...oh my!   Surf videos.  Wipeouts.  It's always good, consistent, and family-oriented.Burgers:=======My fav burgers are the: Hula (sauteed mushroooms), Hawaiian (pineapple, teriyaki), and the Point Break (Gruyère & bleu cheeses, caramelized bacon & onion relish). About 12 kinds to choose from, all burgers can be made with beef, turkey, or veggie.  Price ~ $10.50, but carb heaven --- fries (all you can eat come with each burger!). Salads/more:==========The salads are large, the nachos are a monster (and great), and I also like the soft tacos with chicken (a lot!).Desserts:=======Kona pie is one of the best things in the world.  Mocha almond fudge ice cream, oreo cookie crust, topped w/chocolate fudge, whipped cream.  C'mon now!  Seriously, just pop in for one of these things (and don't share!).Happy Hour:==========Served 4pm-7pm, Monday-Friday --- with good options!  Chips/salsa ($1, made fresh, thin, and served warm), cheese quesadilla ($2.95), 4 sliders ($3.95), among other items. Drinks featured: drafts ($2.95-$3.95), wines ($3.95), and mixed drinks ($4.25).What's unique about this location?:===========================* service: nice, fun, and responsive* lots of parking, but busy busy lot...making it not as easy as it looks

I  have tell you I am just Enchanted every time I go back!Thank You Glynis you are such a Gracious Host!**UPDATED**I went back for lunch today and all I can say is WOW and WOW!!!So Wonderfully Delicious!! I'm home now and want to go back and eat again!This is now my New Favorite place, I want to try everything they have!Have a look at my pics from lunch :) I Got the special=Turkey chowder in a bread bowl, mixed salad and dessert for $10. And Trust that it tasted even better than it looks, I wish it would have never ended!+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++As I was strolling along in downtown chandler enjoying the weather I had stopped at each restaurant to look at the menus they had posted outside hoping to scope out my next lunch spot.I stopped to read the menu here and a friendly girl approached and asked if I would like to be seated, unfortunately I had already ate but went instead to grab and iced tea anyway.I was greeted with a friendly face from behind the bar who offered to whip me up some suga! Sounds good to me.As she whipped, I browsed the wall of tea ,two of the most helpful girls were telling me all I need to know about loose leaf tea and so on.Suga's ready, Jasmine citrus tea with pureed strawberries shaken up with club soda on the rocks and on the house!....I'm in Tea Heaven! Then I'm offered a sample of tea leaves in bag to take home and make myself.I'm gonna have lunch there tomorrow!5 Stars for Amazing customer service and Hospitality and the Most Delicious Food Ever! And I do Believe the Sweetest Owner/Manager I've ever met!A funny thing happened on the way to the bathroom.  We were dining at Latitude 8 with some other yelpers.  I excused myself and headed to the restroom.  It is in a shared hall in the back of the building, so when I entered the hall from the restaurant I was facing a door labeled "Urban Tea Loft."I poked my head in and decided we should pay a visit as we were wrapping up our meal at latitude.What a gem!  We met the owners Eric and Glynis and they were charming!  Service was outstanding and Eric took the time to explain all about the teas - flavors, health benefits, etc.  He also explained how to operate the tea pot which is good because we would have had a mess otherwise.We shared a large pot of jasmine tea.  It was good but a little flowery for my taste.  The strawberry lemonade was excellent.  The atmosphere is both warm and hip.  They have two private rooms as well as outdoor seating.  They offer wine, beer and bar drinks.  I'm not sure how extensive the drink selection is but they looked to have a fairly complete if basic bar selection.All in all an excellent addition to any neighborhood dining area and a great place to come after meals to hang and have a drink.  I'll be back to try the food and update later.Admittedly, I had prepared to hate this place with a passion you only see in the movies.The name just screamed "flax seed and watercress salad".Not that I'm hating, mind you. I'm sure the same people that just had a foodgasm thinking of flax seed and watercress will look right back at me and go "raw fish? chinese-mexican fusion? GROSS". I just realized that's the first time I've ever used the word "fusion" to describe a restaurant. I finally feel like I'm grasping the intricacies of foodie lingo. The next test is to say the word "shi shi" in a sentence with a straight face. When we sat down in the purgatory of warm, earthy tone-laced interior design that was the restaurant, the waiter informed us it was "soul food night". Normally, when some restaurants say it's "blank blank night" that usually mean that's what the special is or that it's a bargain. No, at Urban Tea Loft, "Soul Food Night" means that's all they're serving. We all ordered what we thought would be amusing forays into "Chandler nightlife with a hint of elegance" or some nonsense. After browsing the extensive tea menu, we settled on a pot of Rooibos Chai, iced. The waiter brought out a pot of lukewarm tea and three glasses with ice in them.Kay......I realize, in retrospect, that serving the ice separately was the wiser move, but I remember feeling really confused at first.It'd be like saying "I'd like that on the rocks, please" and the bartender gives you your drink in a martini glass and a shooter full of ice cubes and lets you at it.Actually, that's not "like what happened" at all. That's EXACTLY what they did.In its defense, the tea was magnificent. Fantastic, really. It was spicy, creamy, and smooth. I almost wish we could've afforded to order more of it, but we just had to try the food. Stupid hunger.For 13 dollars I got a meager filet of shake and bake catfish, a cup of watery coleslaw, and a cornbread muffin. And not even the puffy, scrumptious muffins you find in grocery stores.No, that was not to be my fate. The muffin was barely poking out of its holder. I remember being upset that for 13 dollars they couldn't even be bothered to take it OUT OF THE FUCKING PAPER, but I realized that was for the better; the moment I took it out of the paper, the muffin disintegrated into crumbs, and I spent the rest of my meal spooning it up.The coleslaw was soggy. Yes. I said it. Soggy. I know, right? How can something that sits in mayonnaise all day be soggy?I DON'T KNOW EITHER!Perhaps I've been spoiled on British and German cole slaw, but I expect it to have a bit of a crunch to it. It's not boiled cabbage, after all. It's not wrong to expect some life in  your slaw. And not to call a "tea loft" that serves soul food unimaginative, but c'mon, where's the creativity? Where's the apple or pineapple chunks? Usually with such a pretentious atmosphere you get a little "experimentation" with the menu to make it seem "urbanized".Oh well. The catfish, while crunchy and delicious, just wasn't filling. Again, in their defense, most places that serve fish try to gip (sic) you on it.No wonder people stick to Red Lobster. It's corporate and soulless but at least you don't have to hit a drive-thru on the way home.Look, I know we live in a land-locked state, but it's not like you're fishing for the damn thing yourself. I don't see you out there with a harpoon. Don't try to fucking fool me.Misty S got the vegetable plate for 9.75. By far I think the best deal. Sure, it's just a bunch of little trays of sides and is even less filling than the aforementioned meat entree, but you get twice as much of the "New American" feel and flavor.Fun Fact: Having spent my childhood in Europe, I was raised to believe that fish does not count as meat, and I still have a hard time remembering NOT to suggest sushi to my vegetarian friends.So, come for the tea, and stay to pay for the bill. BUT ONLY FOR THE TEA.Anything else and you're just wasting your money.Which can't be that bad. Everyone's doing it these days.Amirite, GMC?As a SF Bay transplant taking another SF Bay transplant out for dinner, there is a certain level of one-ups-manship to our dinner plans. What, you thought the whole "everything with me is a competition" bit was just talk? With both of us coming from the land of non-chains I was desperate to find a venue that was quirky, urban, hip and made me seem a lot cooler than I am. Urban Tea Loft, that's your cue.The yelp reviews swayed me, the charming interior lulled me, the super polite staff put me at ease. The seating was a modern blend of "I'm a couch, no, I'm a booth!" mixed with tables and chairs. Buddy, Jetta R. and I decided to order a pot of Rooibos Chai to start. It was the last smart decision we made.Weekends are "soul food" only. That's cool, I like collard greens. You're allowed to chose your "meat" and one or two sides. Vegetarians can chose three sides. The menu leads you to believe you'll be getting a meal. Don't be fooled. While Jetta R.'s catfish was exquisite and a decent portion size, the sides are served in tiny little cups. My "three meatless sides and we'll call it a vegetarian option" dinner was...not enough. When have you ever seen "soul food" in tiny portions? Doesn't that defy the cuisine? That's like non-fat Indian. See also: Bombay Spice.Everything we tried was delicious, and it's a damn shame the portions are barely large enough for you to figure that out. TL;DR version: Visit this spot to relax, bring your own company or a lap top, and stick to the fare this place is named for - the tea. You won't be disappointed.As a Chandlerite, I've been here several times. Every time has been stellar. My sister and I went for tea and noms last Friday, and we split the Bruschetta and a Caprese tower. My mouth was in rapture! The apple pear green tea was tasty and even better after the second steep. We left stuffed but satisfied.They've really made the space beautiful, and I found myself thinking of reasons to rent out that awesome back room with the rad, artsy chandelier. Maybe for my next birthday.I give this place two enthusiastic thumbs up.

Review Text :
Boy I was hungry for lunch! I wanted Vietnamese sandwich and someplace new. So, I called Dakao to see if they had a vegetarian sandwich. Check! I asked if they accept credit card! Check! I asked if there is a minimum! $8! Ouch....all I wanted is one vegetarian sandwich. The gentleman said that he will process the transaction with 1 sandwich for $3. So, I jumped in my bat mobile and off to Dakao I go!!Once I arrived it was all wrapped and ready to go. I did a squeeze test and it felt a little hard. With an open mind, I proceeded back to the office with my Dakao Veggie sandwich. A las! Back in the office and a bite I go! Indeed and which I was afraid of...bread was hard and crispy, I prefer my bread Fresh as in a hint of crisp on the outside, soft and warm in the inside! Although I was disappointed with the not so fresh bread and they didn't have any hoisin or siracha sauce, the inside of the sandwich tasted yummy and fresh. Tofu was sauteed with veggie soy sauce, Cilantro, carrots, daikon and cucumber was organically fresh and crispy. I will give Daikao a chance and next time will request for a fresh bread by expressing my last experience to the gentleman.All of the Vietnamese sandwich shops that my family went to when I was young have long closed, or sold off to people who let their quality decline. So my mom and I ventured to try this place next to her hairdresser after the owner suggested this place. The young cashier speaks Vietnamese and English, so you do not need to fear the language barrier. I saw many people of all different ethnicity enter and order without issues. They are also patient enough if you are like me and get into fights with your family about who gets to pay. There is one table inside the restaurant and two outside. This place is more of a take out venue for a quick grab and go lunch. Although it does not provide places to lounge about, it offers a wide range of excellent Vietnamese options. We ordered five special sandwiches, one meat stuffed bun, a plate of ground pork and mushroom rolled noodles, and a plate of red pork bites. The sandwiches were everything a good banh mi should be; crunchy, savory, sweet, complex, with a bite from the green peppers. The noodles are a favorite since childhood and I recommend getting some Vietnamese sausage to go with them. The steamed meat bun, after reheating, is the perfect breakfast with a cup of strong coffee.It doesn't look like much from the outside... Actually, it doesn't look like much from the inside either. But this poorly decorated, seemingly run-down little shop is home to my 'Holy Grail' banh-mi.There's no seating; unless you count the rickety plastic patio furniture out front. There's a single table and 2 chairs. Don't expect to claim it yourself. Its usually taken by patrons of the nail salon next door or little old Vietnamese grandpas. The meat tastes better here. The veggies fresher. And the bread softer and more delicious than any other banh mi bread I've ever had. As much as I'd prefer to stop at Dakao, I find it an epic struggle to make it during business hours. They close at 8pm during the week and 6pm on the weekends. I generally don't work at 9-5 schedule so I consider those hours a little limited for me. Regardless, when I come I'll order a variety of edibles  and can't forget a refreshing Vietnamese Iced Coffee. If available, I'll stock up on the rolled noodles with pork, sesame balls, and any other good-looking sides they have available.There's also deli case filled with things I cannot actually identify. In my years of patronage, I've never asked nor purchased anything from said case. There are meat looking items and jellied things in there that I've found a little intimidating and downright unappetizing. I suspect the contents to be more popular with the authentic Vietnamese customer.And like many Asian owned establishments on Spring Mt -- cash Only.This is a very unassuming little shop. I have had them bookmarked for some time, but finally got the chance to pick up a little something for lunch. I tried the BBQ pork banh mi. They take credit Visa and Mastercard with a minimum $8 purchase. They advertise that their bread is baked fresh every 45 minutes and you can tell. It's crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. The sandwich is quite large as well, compared to some of the other banh mi places I've been to, the prices are really great as well. Just $3 for every sandwich on their menu. Definitely a great deal, I'll be coming back again soon to get my banh mi fix on.NO TABLESNot long ago, we use to get our haircuts at Ann Salon and it was uniquely convenient to pick up a Dakao sandwich to carry us over to dinner. We would experiment with different selections but we would always resort back to either Dac Biet, Bbq Pork or Grilled Pork. Yu-go loved the pate but It was just too pungent for me.Besides the banh mi, the Vietnamese coffee is Yu-go's favorite. It's equivalent to drinking jet fuel. LoL Dakao also sells prepackaged desserts and cold soft drinks.Unfortunately there is no place to sit and consume the sandwiches on site. Given the ambience, you might be better off taking it back to the office or apartment.

Thanks Trish for planning tonight's UYE (Unofficial Yelp Event) at Centro Paninoteca, and thanks Casey, Steve, and Jody for taking such great care of our group!What a pleasure to sit outside and enjoy wine and live music (from David "Axis of Ebel" E) and to hang with a good sized group of yelpers!I wasn't feeling 100% so I didn't partake in the appetizers or panini sandwiches but based on the appearance of the plates and delighted expressions from those who did, I'll have to return for sure!I'll update my review at that point... if you didn't make it tonight, it seems that every Wednesday is Wino Wednesday at CP - you can't beat the unpretentious atmosphere and $5 glasses of wine!What a cute little place! I never would've found it without a Yelp UYE (tiny little thing next to Handlebar J's) but glad I did. It's so cozy and truly unpretentious in spite of a pretty good wine selection! A highlight was the turkey and green chile pannini (I sorta built my own... a twist on the ham offering which they graciously obliged.) and the sweet potato chips were a nice compliment.Cute Cute Cute! I really like this little place! I'm a big fan of wine bars that are small and unpretentious. I attended the UYE organized by Trish and I was so happy I did! For dinner, I ordered the Caprese Panini that boasted a LARGE tomato, basil, and mozzarella. I asked to add prosciutto and they were very happy to oblige. Each and every person that I spoke to on the staff was friendly and conversational. I really like that. I will certainly visit Centro again! I would love to try some of their other paninis!4.5: The only thing keeping this place from 5 stars is the location. The view from the patio is pretty much parking lot and the backs of buildings. But, holy cow! The wine selection is VERY good. The staff are friendly and helpful and make excellent suggestions (thanks for the zinfandel tip! YUMMM). The prices are fair too!And, as much as I love green chile, my new fave is the fig and gorgonzola app. Still a pannini... I didn't know blue cheese could get that creamy when it melted!Man, I wish this place was closer... I'll still be back!

WOW. What a disaster today was!First off, you walk in, and it is overwhelmingly warm.We ordered, I had the asiago roast beef, with tomato soup, and a baguette.My aunt had a turkey sandwich, but she asked them told hold the onion, and instead of the chipotle mayo, if they could substitute it for regular mayo,...(she doesn't do spicy very well), and ordered a bag of chips with her lunch.We find a place to sit, and our plates come.The chips and the baguette weren't on the right plate, but okay. I guess that's an easy switch.But you could clearly see the huge slices of red onion, and the huge glob of chipotle mayo on my aunt's sandwich. She takes it up to the counter to have it remade.I'm sitting with my daughter, and before I take a bite out of my sandwich, I see a stand of plastic wrap hanging out of it. It is VERY noticeable, and I am beginning to wonder how no one saw it....I then take my plate up to be remade.The manager informed me that it was "from the cheese".Girlfriend, I do not care where it is from. I don't want it in my sandwich.She came by with our new plates afterwards, and offered us a free cookie, but we declined.The food was Ok. The soup was the savior of it all for me.Yikes.WHERE'S THE BEEF?   It amazes me how restaurants could mess up such a simple sandwich like a BLT. A BLT is not exactly a culinary work of art. It is beacon, lettuce, and tomatoes with mayonnaise on bread. Yet, some restaurants mess it up. When I set eyes on my Panera Bread BLT, or more like LT; I was asking the exact question that the old lady asked in the 80s Wendy's commercial "Where's the beef?" In this case the beef was beacon. What I saw was a few pieces of ordinary beacon with lettuce and tomato on bread.  The bread was comparable to Wonder bread which is ironic considering that this is Panera Bread. I was unimpressed that there was not a choice of bread and that it was untoasted. The potato chips that I picked as the side was actually better than the sandwich.    This is my second time at this Panera Bread. A few weeks ago, I dined here with Shirley. B. The roasted turkey & avocados BLT that I ordered then was a tasty sandwich. And I know that Shirley liked her soup. But that doesn't make up for the atrocity of a sandwich that I had tonight and for the record, a good amount of it was leftover bread.  The restaurant itself, which is in the Paseo Verde Parkway side of The District, is a clean and attractive dining environment. The noise level is average with some rock playing in the background. And there is sufficient seating and lighting. Panera Bread is on the dining level between fast-food and casual dining. You step in line then order off the menu board. After paying, you bring a number to a table. They bring you the food, but you serve your beverage. When your done they bus the table.  A BLT gives me an impression of a restaurant. And when a BLT is so short of the beacon that it becomes a LT it is leaves me with a poor impression.   I never say never. I could return to Panera Bread. Maybe their speciality is bagel sandwiches. Who knows! If I cross that bridge and return to Panera Bread, and leave satisfied with a different sandwich, I can always update my review with a reference to this one. After tonight's sandwich, color me unsatisfied.Panera has been a consistent chain in my life.  This location in the District has a constant stream of customers.  They do a good job of keeping tables clean and cleared for the next guest.  The service has been polite and helpful.  They also make it easy to call in or order from the app.  The Panera menu updates just like many other chains.  Pick two is still available for your choice of soup, salad or sandwich.  The menu boards show the calories for each size item.  That is always helpful! I have always enjoyed their various salads.  Recently I tried the BBQ chicken salad.  Yum! The sauce has a great smokey flavor.  There is plenty of grilled chicken with corn and fried onions.  It's surely a winner! If you sign up for the free Panera card, you get a free treat in your birthday.  During the year they will also load coupons or specials.  Thanks Panera!This is a great spot to pick up lunch. A newer location opened up closer to my home but I just feel comfy and familiar at this PB. Being a bakery and cafe, they offer lunch and breakfast. They have some tasty options when it comes to breakfast you can choose from bagels, pastries, souffles, breakfast sandwiches and fresh baked bread. It wouldn't be breakfast if coffee wasn't offered so they do have a nice variety of options for that too. The lunch menu is my favorite. I love that they introduce new salads & sandwiches, but also love that they bring back old seasonal favorites. The "You Pick 2" option is great. I love that I can switch it up between soup, salad, and sandwiches. I have eaten inside this location a couple times, but usually just phone my order in and pick it up. They have a program called "My Panera" that you should look into if you plan on eating here more then once. You can earn free food and other cool stuff. I am able to log in online and check the status of my rewards. Please note that currently if you have a freebie and don't use it for 60 days that it will expire. This last visit I saw a sign that they offer catering. I never thought of PB for catering needs, but I bet it is a big hit at most offices. My absolute favorite sandwich from PB is the "Roasted Turkey Artichoke Panini"and it really hit the spot last night it is so good! I get the "Broccoli Cheddar Soup" and love dipping my panini into it. Such a nice combo and a comforting meal no matter what time of year it is. I'm glad we have PB!This location is in a small strip mall with other popular places and the parking lot can be packed. Patience is key!I think of Panera Bread as comfort food for me.  The food here reminds me of food you'd get at a Bed & Breakfast.  Or, food your neighbor's cousin's sister's mom use to make when you were a kid.  The menu is basically sandwiches, soups, and salads. But there's enough on the menu to satisfy almost everyone.  One thing about Panera Bread is that their food is always fresh and price is even better.  You can even getaway with a sandwich and soup for less than $10.  My order is usually the same...turkey something.  Either I'm getting a turkey in a panini or their smoked turkey sandwich.  Also don't be surprised if I get my turkey with extra meat.  The restaurant itself, along with their service, is always right on.  I tend to frequent Panera Breads that are located inside shopping malls, which tend to be smaller. So you can imagine the shock when I walk into a freestanding or strip mall PB.  I had a great time on my last visit, more of those great times to come.

Yay, celebrities love new american cuisine as much as we do! Forget about the ridiculosity of the investors (Nick Lachey & Nicky Hilton & Wilmer Valderrama!) - the food here is actually excellent.  It's super trendy & you will be surrounded by people who think The Hills is a documentary but you will feel better after you have some complimentary warm pretzels, a few bottles of Vosse water, some freshly fried felafel, a fancied up Big Mac & some chicken and waffles. 5 stars is probably a little too much, but it was a pleasant surprise and you get to go into LAX for free, which is still paying too much, but it's very easy to make a night out of coming here, which I can appreciate.

Review Text :
I always make a point to stop by Shrimp Bar & Deli at the Golden Gate for a shrimp cocktail (or two) and a French dip sandwich before we leave Vegas. Plus, I'm usually broke by then and a $10 meal is much needed. Do: Order either the Big Shimp Cocktail or a couple of the regular ones.Don't: Order the combo one with krab - it's no good.Do: Order a French Dip or the Gold Rush sandwich.Don't: Order the Gold Rush with the au jus already on it, get it on the side.Do: Listen politely to the piano player.Don't: Try and play the piano. The folks at the counter get mighty upset.Thumbs Up:-Cheap!-Live entertainment!-Tasty!Thumbs Down:-Long lines and sometimes no seating.-A greasy French dip isn't the best thing to have directly before a four hour drive home.

I have never left a sushi bar so angry and exasperated in my life!Koi has more rules than a elementary school cafeteria at lunchtime!They don't let you go outside for ANYTHING once food is on your table... not until you pay the check. They tack on a 15-18% gratuity even if the service is sub-par, and normally at places where gratuity is automatically tacked on to the bill it is. I was included in a party of 15 for my friend's birthday party and part of the desire to give our patronage to Koi was the All-U-Can-Eat Sushi (which a portion of this party has indulged in on a previous visit). When we were seated the waitress told us that a portion of our party couldn't order the All-U-Can-Eat Sushi, it had to be all 15 of us or none of us. We were contemplating just getting up and leaving, and we should have. I had a feeling this wasn't going to end well and it didn't. The birthday girl decided to stay and we ordered. Then we were informed that they wouldn't accept certain coupons from the Arrowhead Koi... this is like a disenfranchised franchise. The owner seemed to be creating his own rules. It didn't even say Arrowhead on the coupon... it just looked like one they didn't take... according to the waitress. The service was slow... very slow and we waited to get drink refills. Then the waitress came back to tell the birthday girl that someone took her order... so she had to wait for it to be remade. All the sushi rolls looked the same. There was no artistic value to the food. I couldn't tell the spicy tuna tempura apart from the tempura calamari roll, and the taste reflected sameness. Quite disappointing since sushi is an art form when done correctly (or just done better).The waitress left dishes and empty glasses on our table for the entirety of the meal, and when she did finally clear things away she dropped dirty soy sauce chop sticks right on the birthday girls lap. Yes there was an apology on the part of the waitress, but it shouldn't have happened.According to the friends that have come to Koi before they raised their prices... and they don't take American Express and they don't have a Happy Hour - the large beers were $6 - at Yen I could get the same for $3. We ALL decided that we are not going to Koi ever again, tonight they just lost 15 customers. Pretty pathetic.

Review Text :
Ladies if you're looking for a sugar daddy, you're bound to find him at this Scottsdale steakhouse. While there's no denying that the steaks are tops. I'm more of a fan of the bar atmosphere. My friend and I cruised into the see-and-be-seen restaurant for a drink recently and within in a matter of minutes, we were approached by a group of  sharply-dressed guys in their late 40s. We politely declined their invitation for dinner and drinks, but their next target group -- three buxom blondes who appeared to be in their early 20s -- took them up on the offer. If you're planning to come for simply cocktails, be sure to bring some extra cash because drinks are pricey. And if you order a martini, try the fruity flirtini, it's my favorite.The steak was so good I started having heart palpitations.  Oh my god, I don't even know where to begin.  The dining room is beautiful.  The service was flawless.  And the food was out of this world.  Really tremendous.  The ahi tuna tartar?  Amazing.  The bone-in-fillet? Amazing.  Lobster mashed potatoes?  Are you kidding me?  Ridiculous.  By far, the best steak I have ever had.  Better than Flemings, Capital Grill, Morton's, Ruth Chris, Durant's, El Chorro...  Seriously.  You are looking at about $100/head including drinks (not wine) and it is worth every penny.  I'm going to go pass out now.Ok so us 5 hot chix got all dolled up for dinner at City Hall it was about 7 when we arrived on Saturday. The service was top notch from the get go starting with the valet. We were seated by a pleasant hostess in the large main room. Our waiter was an entertaining gentleman, that's one huge plus I have to say about Mastro's is they "usually" have seasoned wait staff they really know their product.They brought us the great basket of warm breads, we ordered bottled water for all and a bottle of some 06 Sauv Blanc that was mighty tasty. It was impossible to have an empty glass this night!Everyone had fillet's but me of course, I mainly had apps, side's, wine and desert ;) I did try the seared ahi tuna it was ok I wasn't too impressed with it though. Beefsteak tomato & mozz (see pics) very yummy! The creamed corn, sauteed asparagus and mash were all very good!! I couldn't talk anyone into the lobster mash or any caviar boohoo me. =(  Everyone loved their meal!!My g/f was coming back from the bathroom and missed a step or something somehow she lost her shoe but there was a busser or someone right behind her he picked it up for her and even put it back on for her! Now that is what I call 5 Star Service!!We had creme brle they served it with various fresh berries and a huge bowl of their fresh made whip cream yum-gasm's were had all around. While Mastro's is not my top choice since I am not a "Steakhouse kinda girl" it was all good stuff. They always play some  Michael Bubl and who doesn't just love him!?! It was about 3 bills total and we went home with doggy bags and full tummy's.P.S.  I had their sweet potato fries they were good but I like the ones at Fez better....just sayin. (O_o)To celebrate our anniversary, the boyfriend and I ventured out to Mastro's City Hall for dinner.  Do not let the businesslike exterior fool you...this is a beautiful, fine dining restaurant.  Upon entering the restaurant, we were greeted by the hostess and escorted to our table.  Didn't have a chance to check out the patio or bar, but I will say the dining room is gorgeous.  Low, but not dark, lighting.  Music piped in from the piano in the lounge, I believe??  Tables that seem packed in the room but have plenty of room between to allow you to move around.  We were seated at a two top, which I usually do not like, especially when there are fours available.  I understand why restaurants do this, but the tables are usually so small that we run out of room quickly.  This table, however, had more than enough space.  As the hostess seated us, she asked us what color napkin we'd prefer, black or white.  Never experienced that before.  I'm sure there is some sort of fancy-schmancy etiquette rule about which napkin is better, but we aren't really fancy-schmancy people.  We stuck with the white napkins that were already on the table.  Next we were given menus and greeted by the server who asked about a drink order.  I asked for water while I perused the wine list and the bf had a jack and coke.  What the waiter returned with was a water and a glass of jack (nearly full) and a bottle of coke.  A jack with a splash of coke just like he likes them.  The bf was happy.  Let me cover the service aspect of our evening.  Our server was awesome.  Very professional, educated and willing to educate us first timers on the menu and specials.  He made an excellent wine recommendation and helped us choose the apps for our seafood tower.  Additionally, it was also election night and we debated even going out as opposed to staying in and watching the returns.  But, the server kept us updated with results on a regular basis from the bar tv.  Yay!  Back up staff was generally good about filling water, clearing tables, etc.  But sometimes it felt like we were being rushed.  Staff approached the table to see if we were finished when we were obviously still eating.  Like actually chewing with food still on the plate.  Nothing too major, but I would expect better here.Ok, food...We had the seafood tower (shrimp, oysters, lobster), filets, asparagus and....wait for it, wait for it....the lobster mashed potatoes!  The seafood tower made a dramatic entrance complete with dry ice.  Again the server was very accommodating and helpful.  He made great recommendations and basically was able to create this dish as we wanted it.  Everything was delicious and the creamy mustard sauce was phenomenal.  I would choose that over cocktail sauce anytime.  I had the petite filet and the bf had the regular.  Both were cooked perfectly and melted in our mouths.  Also, the bf's steak seemed much larger than 12 oz.  Asparagus was bright green, firm but tender.  If you read the reviews here, people are raving about the potatoes.  With good reason...they are delectable.  Ridiculously good.  Seriously, my mouth is watering right now.  Do not fret if you don't see them on the menu.  They are a special item that they almost always have.  We paired a bottle of Cab with our entree which was very nice as well.  After dinner was cleared, we gladly boxed up our leftover mashers (seriously it could serve 4 easily).  I thought we were ready to go, but out came a slice of delicious chocolate cake as a treat for our anniversary.  We didn't order this, they just brought it out.  Regardless of what kind of restaurant you are at, this is always a nice touch.  Even with our best efforts there was no way we were going to finish the cake so after a few bites that went in a box as well.  In spite of the earlier rushed feeling, once we finished our meal we were left alone to finish our drinks.  This was easily one of the best meals I've ever had.  It is spendy, so we won't be back often.  But we will be back again and be recommending it to all our friends.  ps...the bf paid so I can't really complain, but those take home boxes??  They made it home, but I've never seen them again. :)The Beautiful Carin and I ventured out for steak a couple of nights ago and ended up walking over to Drinkwater's.We hadn't been there for several months, but I love the fact that it's walking distance (so I can have a couple of single malts and not have to worry about the drive home).We sat out on the patio and the fire was going and the weather was cool, but not cold, really pleasant (although I would like for things to get a touch warmer...but, that's a quibble). The ambiance is nice both inside the restaurant and out on the patio (nice fireplace!).We started with scotch and martini's and they do pour a nice drink! I was pleasantly buzzing by the time we got our salads. The steaks were very good, and we always stick to the simple steak and salad formula when we go to Drinkwater's (BTW, is there really any other cut besides a bone in Rib-eye? Honestly, I was born and raised on a cattle ranch and there just isn't a better cut for steak, IMHO:).The service was very good, as always, and the drinks, salads, steaks and sides arrived hot (or cold as necessary), and on time.Drinkwater's ( I know, it's Mastro's now, but old habits are hard to break) is good place for a simple steak and salad. The do it very well. A little on the expensive side (approx. $250 for the 2 of us), and as always, for that kind of dough, I need to be thinking "foodgasm" for 4-5 stars, but a very credible steakhouse.Three words... bone-in-filet or is that really two? I'll leave it to the more talented wordsmiths to do the math. Last Friday I had one of the better filets of my life. Cooked to medium-rare perfection you can't really get a better steak. Also watch out.. their pretzel bread is insanely addictive, just say no (actually say yes, eat a couple, then have them take the rest away). I'm a steak purist and it's worth noting they do add some butter to the steaks after they're cooked, if you're like me just ask to opt out. Service was good, but know the ambiance is a little old school. The musical act in lounge reminded me of that two person band in the movie Swingers... cheesy, but you don't really hear it in the main dining room.I'll start off by saying that the meal itself was 5 star all the way. I mean hello!?! Butter poached, bone in Filet Mignon!?!  Need I say more?Indeed...Based on the previous few experiences I've had at City Hall I would have happily given both the experience and the food 5 stars. This time however I cannot, but I can give 4. We had a 8:00(pm) reservation on a considerably busy night. Upon arrival, we were sat immediately at a booth in the bar. Normally, this wouldn't bother me at all except that when the reservation was taken, we specifically requested the dining room. We were looking for a  level of ambiance that is difficult to obtain surrounded by fairly raucous bar goers on a Friday night. Clearly we were squeezed in at the last minute. There was no room for us in the dining area so we say screw it, we'll just eat some amazing food, drink way too much and join the 'party' in the bar area. We're not pretentious assholes, we're flexible, we know how to get the fuck dowwwwn, no big deal right...wrong. While being seated I notice the rather close proximity of the patio door. I take my coat off and within minutes I'm frozen. I know what you're thinking...'well, maybe you shouldn't have been dressed like a $3 hooker Kristi', but you would be wrong. I pulled out all the stops for this one. Needless to say, we notified the server and were promptly moved to another booth. Annoying, but certainly not night altering. Our server seemed a bit distracted and it all felt a bit rushed at first but  seemed to mellow out when we made it clear that we were indeed camping out for the next 3 hours. There is not much that can be said about the food other than 'it's amazing'. I had a perfectly mixed dry Kettle martini to start of with. (Must get buzz going before food consumption) We shared a bottle of Cab with our meals which consisted of the Petite Filet, (MR) the NY Strip, (R) the out of this world Lobster Mashed Potatoes,  and steamed asparagus. Perfection! This is what a steak should taste like. The Lobster Mashed was divine and trust me, I don't throw the word 'divine' around EVER. We shared the Creme Brulee for dessert as well as a chocolate martini. I was sufficiently liquored up at this point not to mention fat and happy. Don't ask me what happened after dessert because I don't remember. There was some champagne involved, maybe a creepy cab driver....the details are fuzzy. All I know there was enough food left over to make a delicious breakfast of steak and eggs in the morning, which paired well with the Advil, Alka-Seltzer and gray face of death I was wearing. Whoo-Haa Mastro's! I am no match for your sexiness. U.N.C.L.E.Yes, it's true that I would have been happy eating anywhere on the night of my birthday while getting wined and dined by my bf, but it just so happened that I was taken to City Hall, so it was a delightfully tasty night!The minute I stepped into City Hall, it felt like I had left Old Town Scottsdale and entered a city steakhouse in a Chicago or SF. It was cozy, dark and smelled absolutely delectable. We began the night with some cocktails at the bar. I ordered a delicious fruity beverage and enjoyed it as as the evening air blew through the open doors of the patio. Following our cocktails, we were seated in the dining room and the birthday feast began! We enjoyed delicious pretzel bread, crunchy Cesar salad, filet, macaroni and cheese and Lobster mashed potatoes. That's right. Lobster mashed potatoes! Every bite was bliss and I ate until I couldn't psychically take another bite. The mac and cheese has got to have about five different cheeses in it and each bite is filled with gooey cheese that melts in the mouth. The Lobster mashed potatoes are just as delicious as they sound and are filled with butter garlic and plenty of Lobster meat. The portions are hefty and we luckily had leftovers to enjoy tonight! The food is delicious, the atmosphere is cozy and the staff is friendly and helpful. I'm not sure there's much more than I can add, but if you're in the mood for delicious steak and complimentary sides, I suggest keeping a Mastro's in mind.Looking for an incredible steakhouse in AZ and not concerned about the damage you'll do to your wallet?  City Hall is the way to go!I've been to City Hall more than a handful of times through the years as well as it's sister concepts: Ocean Club and Mastro's in North Scottsdale.  You cannot go wrong with any of them.  I just happen to prefer City Hall because of the convenient location to where I live and work!I've been to meet a friend or two for happy hour at the bar, I've been for a bachelorette party, and I often go for celebratory date nights with my husband... as we did on this past Wednesday evening to celebrate my birthday!  If you're up for a bit of a scene, some live music and great people watching, I highly recommend sitting in the bar.Let me reiterate: this is a high end steakhouse.  Expect to valet your car and bring cash for the bathroom attendant as well.  But you get what you pay for.  Service is top notch and the food is the best quality I've found in the state and beyond.Starting with drinks, there are plenty to choose from.  I am a dirty martini girl and they make a mean one here.  It's actually two for the price of one, since they bring you the entire shaker and refill it when necessary.  Awesome wine list as well.In addition to the complimentary bread bowl which comes with my favorite pretzel rolls in town, my fave appetizers are their oysters, calamari, and seafood tower if you're with a group.Next up, I am a huge proponent of the Mastro's House Salad.  Tip: it's large, so my recommendation is to share it with someone.  If not, you could easily make a meal of the salad, the bread bowl, and a drink!And for the main course, if you're going with steak, go for the Bone-In Ribeye, and if you're more in the mood for fish, I say Chilean Seabass all the way... you can split either of these also.  Both arrive on Mastro's signature hot plates, and they've always been cooked and seasoned to perfection.  Pair 'em with your favorite sides - you really can't go wrong here although my top picks would be sweet potato fries, creamed spinach, steamed broccoli, and grilled asparagus.  I've never heard anyone complain about the signature lobster mashed potatoes either.By now, you're definitely full, but keep drinking or hanging out digesting until you make room for dessert.  Don't miss the Mastro's Signature Warm Butter Cake.  Thank me later!  You can't go wrong with the Key Lime Pie or Cheesecake either, but again, that butter cake is to die for!On my recent birthday visit, I enjoyed many of the items mentioned above except for the dirty martini and oysters... I'm prego at the moment, so sadly, I had to pass on both.  But after this baby comes, I can't wait to go back for another incredible meal.  Who wants to join me?!It kills me to give such a low rating to a Mastro's Steakhouse...I've been to most of the Mastro's around the country, and the food at the Scottsdale location does not disappoint. The factor that DID disappoint was their hostess staff. Here's a quick summery of what occured:I called early in the day to make reservations, was informed that 9:30pm was the earliest for that evening. No problem, it was a last minute reservation, I could understand. We show up around 8:45 to try and grab drinks at the bar (was overcrowded so decided against that), I checked in with the hostess just to inform her that we were there. She rudely snapped at me saying that they were behind, and that they might be caught up by my reservation time. Again, no problem, I wasn't expecting to be seated early. We waited patiently in the front lobby, along with other groups of guests...9:30 came and went....10:00 came and went. At 10:15pm, I begin to notice that there were groups who arrived after us who were being seated. I approach the hostess and ask when we might be able to get our 9:30 reservation, and she starts yelling saying that they were busy. By 10:30, we are the only people left standing in the lobby. So I again ask if we were going to be seated, especially since everyone who arrived after us was already seated at this point. She starts yelling, again, saying that it is impossible that they would seat anyone who arrived after us. I turned around and pointed out that there was no one left in the lobby...except us...where did they all go if they weren't seated? Surely we were not the last people to arrive on a Saturday night...since we arrived 1hr 45min ago. She proceeded to rudely call another hostess over and said "fine, seat them," and rolls her eyes at me. Thanks Alexis...for a night I will never forget. Low and behold, once we were seated, there were plenty of empty tables. Anyways, that was the end of the horrible part of the evening. Many thanks to our wonderful server, Bobby, who picked up on the vibe that we were upset and really made our dining experience enjoyable. Gratitude to the GM as well, who personally came to apologize for the long wait. Those two individuals were the reason I gave this Mastro's 3-stars...one star for each of them and one for the ever-delicious food. (Recommendations: Shrimp cocktail appetizer, bone-in ribeye, butter cake desert)I really hope that the hostess staff was just having a bad day and that they don't normally treat their patrons like the way they did that evening. Will I eat at a Mastro's again? You bet...Will I ever eat at the Mastro's in Scottsdale? Never againThis was the 2nd Mastro's I've been to in the city.  My 1st experience was with their Pinnacle Peak location.  I was curious to see if the quality of the food and experience would hold up.....and yes it did!We joined a group of friends here for dinner and they accommodated 10 of us near the bar area.  We were able to enjoy the live music throughout dinner.  Of course, I had to order my fav dishes here:Wedge SaladBone-In FiletGorgonzola Mac 'n CheeseThe food was phenomenal, just like the other location.  The Wedge Salad is fresh and crisp....very refreshing.  The Bone-In Filet is simply out of this world....the Bone just adds so much flavor to it....yum!  The Gorgonzola Mac 'n Cheese is addicting and is worth the nuclear explosion of calories....I just can't say no to ordering it.The service is outstanding and we were well taken care of.  Our party of 10 felt like we were at home because we were so comfortable and didn't have to worry about anything all night.  We put away 5 bottles of Wine and the server ensured that we didn't have an empty glass until we were ready.Tip: The food prices are not cheap here...if you can't fade a large dinner bill, I don't recommend coming here.Can't wait for the next time!Return Factor - 100%I surrender to the Carnivore Food Gods!Made sure I was not late for my reservation. Got there and suddenly felt under attired! Asked the valet what he thought and he said "oh! very casual...no need to worry..." And so begins my story.Decided to dine at the bar (my favorite place most of the time) rather than at a table already reserved for us. Dining at the bar in itself was a great decision. Ambiance? outdoor fire place for the wintery days and the patio dining. Main Dining Room sexy and well laid out (for those of you from Hawaii, the dining room is similar to Morton's and how Morton's is laid out) and the bar is huge! a rectangle surrounding the bar with at least 40 seats and high tops surrounding the bar area (nice touch). Regardless of where you sit; the table is set for a perfect 5 star meal!  Mastro's house salad- iceberg lettuce and freshly chopped tomatoes with shrimp floating around the salad chased my Bone In Ribeye OMG!  The King Crab and Truffle Gnocchi was absolutely amazing which was broiled but still creamy and the hint of truffle JUST THE RIGHT AMOUNT...Crème brulee for desert and it was served with a scoop of fresh tossed fruits laced in some sweet liquor and a bowl of FRESH WHIPPED CREAM..... Oh! they did give us a basket of breads to chase our bottle of champagneA perfectly prepared meal and the service? 6 stars! from the valet, to the hostess, to the bartender (our server) and the ladie's room attendant! Who could ask for more service!My plan is to try the other Mastro's locations in the PHX area.... If I had to rate the PHX City Hall location to the other Mastro's in OC, CA, I'd have to give the thumb's up to PHX City Hall.Oh! One more thing! Live entertainment; pianist and singer with perfect selection of music to fit the fare!

Good food and actually good customer service!This is a new ownership compared to the last incarnation under a different name, and they are much improved!The food is varied and of decent quality; my Discard Pile* was very small.  There was an assortment of seafood, pork, beef, chicken, and vegetable dishes.  Nothing I had was too greasy, either.  The only item I'm used to that I missed was bean sprouts.  I dug the honey chicken and orange chicken, the pork spare ribs were nice even though the sauce was too sweet, but the beef short ribs tasted too much like plain old roast beef.  I don't like mushrooms but would bet that most folks would appreciate their unusual addition to the inside of the springroll style eggrolls.  The real standout for me that day was the customer service.  In a boofay? I know!My experience at Fuji Boofay was the exact opposite of China Star http://www.yelp.com/biz/china-star-super-buffet-phoenix-2#hrid:CjQqXNGlBOFi-aVdY6VWIw Allow me to briefly elaborate (ooh nice oxymoron)I walked in and had already noticed the quite clear signage stating that lunch lasted until 3:30pm and dinner began at 3:35pm.  It was 3:32pm. [dun dun DUUUHHHNNNN]  I braced myself for the worse (see China Star review), when the smiley young lady at the counter asked, "Do you want lunch or dinner?""I get to choose!?  Well, I don't eat any seafood.""Okay, lunch then.  You'll pay later."   ...and I'm led to my seat.Yea_eah.I think I like that kind of service very much.I will come back when ever I get my vehicle serviced next door.* I measure the quality of a boofay, especially its meat items, by the size of the pile of grisle, fat, and ? that is uneaten and cut off or spit out onto the plate.  Of course, smaller is better when it comes to the Discard Pile!

This McDonald's in Viva Las Vegas is particularly nice and clean.  The parking lot is pretty easy to navigate in and out of with the busy traffic on W Charleston and the restaurant's close proximity to the freeway.Great place to grab your morning coffee and breakfast and take a lil break and relax.  The food has consistently been quality and fresh tasting, the service very good.Nice plus?  Close proximity to the hospital. Bring your own coffee and nosh when you're headed over to visit a friend in the hospital.  Bring 'me a little breakfast danish or cookie as a treat!

Review Text :
This Cheesecake Factory sucks. Ain't no other way to say it. Let me explain why.I pull into the parking lot and am waiting on my wife to show up as she's on her way. I call and speak to "Frank" who tells me the wait list is only 5 minutes. I'm only 5 spaces from the front door and can see both front doors so...I'm thinking we're going to be good to go. Well 4 min later we're walking in the door and I get told the wait is now 20 minutes. Wow, that's quite a jump in only 4 minutes and there wasn't a horde of people rushing the door. Either someone can't count or someone was lying...got a hunch the counting ability is just fine....So we get on the list, get our pager and then cool our heels outside. And outside stinks. Literally stinks. Like has anyone emptied the trash by the benches? Finally after a 25 min wait someone comes out and calls for us by name...the pager never did go off. I got the excuse that it doesn't work outside. Hmm, I guess having equipment with a range of 100 ft from the base station is asking too much. So we finally get seated. And service...well, it was slow. You wait for bread. You wait for drinks. You wonder if the waiter went to the bar to watch the baseball game on TV. You wonder if there will ever be peace in the Middle East. And then you get to place an order.When you finally get your food well quite frankly it sucks. My soon to be 3 year old wanted chicken strips and he wanted apple juice. He picks up the juice, starts to move the straw to his mouth and is rewarded with an apple juice shower as the lid was not snapped all the way down on the cup. Nice...now I got a soggy kid. And that soggy kid ate some of the french fries but spit out the chicken. As for my wife, she ordered Spicy Chipotle Chicken Pasta. She ate about 5 bites before she pushed it away. And I ordered a Mexico City Chicken dish that was marginally passable, but after a couple of bites it left my mouth feeling...well it's starchy...or like it's powdery..it's just weird. 2 hours after leaving the place my wife and I still have this strange aftertaste from their food. I've never really had an aftertaste like this before. Again it's just weird. From walking in the front door until we left took almost 2 full hours. We spent $80 and ended up leaving well over 3/4 of our food for Republic Services to send to the Apex landfill. I can write that it sucked, but quite frankly that's understating just how bad it was. My wife said to show mercy and give 2 Stars? Not a chance. If it sucks it sucks. Call it as I experience it and be done with it. 1 Star. And when you see penquins inside the gates to Hades, you might see me darken their doors again. Until such time...oh no Boo-Boo. Ain't going back here even if you tried to drag me in. (With apologies to my wife who had a rough day and I thought a good meal with cheesecake might brighten her day, but instead these jackasses made it even worse! I waited a while to write this one so I could cool off but needless to say I was not happy when I left).This location is in Green Valley just off the 215 freeway.TOTAL meltdown in service. Slow and non apologetic about the service from the management. Wasn't just me, it was all tables and they keep filling em up no matter what. Was there 1 1/2 hours and couldn't even get dessert. CRAZY!Huge food portions, blah nothing to taste but presentation of the food was nice.Lack of leadership with excuses. Didn't really care too much about excuses as I'm the customer and went with an expectation of quality food and professional service.Neither was delivered on this visit.I may or may not go there againYou'd think that clean eating and the Cheesecake Factory would not compute, but you can find clean eats most anywhere, even here at this chain restaurant.  Yes, it's a bummer not to indulge in their red velvet cheesecake at the end of the meal, but you don't always have to eat cheesecake just because it's the name of the place.  The Skinnylicious menu has many items to choose from that can be made even cleaner.  I'm a big fan of the turkey burger, ordering it protein-style (without the bread), hold the mayo.  The side salad it comes with is good with its balsamic vinaigrette dressing, too.  The b/f and I had lunch there today and he had grilled chicken breast with brown rice and broccoli, also very clean.  I'm a fan of being able to order our meals the way we want to here with no fuss from the staff.  Major kudos and it keeps us coming back!Staying in Henderson this Cheesecake Factory was the first I've visited which I didn't have to wait for seating at dinner. I was seated at a booth which I requested and was comfy.My friendly waitress greeted me asap and gave me a menu with the large variety of choices to choose from. I ended up going with the Salmon Miso which was topped on steamed rice and served with pea pods. The fish was fresh & moist and the miso sauce went good when combined with the rice and pods. Instead of going with a fancy cheesecake I chose the original which was served with whipped cream. The cheesecake was silky smooth and creamy and not overly rich but filling.Overall for me - the large variety of choices, good quality in a pleasant atmosphere make Cheescake Factory a solid choice to dine.This particular location brings back the first time I ate here:I am down with the swirl, have jungle fever, a checkerboard chick, and all other silly names people come up with to express that they are open to all types of races. I love all guys--black, white, Asian, Hispanic, Middle Eastern, European, tall, short, skinny, heavy, muscular, etc. I have no specific type. If you're hot, you're hot! RIGHT?So, one of my friends started this interracial meetup group and at the time I was NOT interested in dating. I am happiest being a loner. She talked me into accompanying her to the Cheescake Factory with the rest of the group that signed up. Now, I have enough common sense that groups like this rarely turn out the way you want because for one thing people in their 30s just don't sign up for stuff like that. This was a Monday evening (happy hour) and it was fairly crowded. We were waiting for the RSVP's to show up and it was starting to crowd. While waiting a few males showed up and I could tell they were NOT her type. She was looking extremely irritated and I was having a blast, watching it all go down. LOL.... This man in his late 40's showed up and without any kind of greeting she jumped up from her seat and said, "How old are you?!" After he reluctantly said 47, she made it clear that this group was for no one over 40. I felt bad for him as he walked away and I secretly hoped he didn't return to shoot up the restaurant.Another male approached us wearing coke bottle glasses, a striped stained polo shirt, dirty, baggy bum jeans, and velcro snapper shoes. He looked just like Robin Williams in "ONE HOUR PHOTO." To make matters worse, he was hoarding several overused Walmart bags full of personal property! Maybe he thought he was gonna get lucky and have a place to stay tonight?!She tried to eliminate him by asking his age. He was a smart man, and he lied. Haha..... Out of no where, I could see her hopes rising when two extrememly tall white males entered the restaurant. The kind of lads you see posing in an Abercrombie ad. She jumped up immediately and said, "Are you here for the meetup group?!" They looked surprised and said no. She slumped down like she had just completely given up. Inside, I was cracking up! The happy hour menu is extremely cheap, nearly half off so I ordered a few appetizers. I got the calamari which is lightly breaded and extremely tender and juicy. It comes with 2 different dipping sauces, but the calamari is so good it can stand on its own with a little lemon juice. I like ordering off of their SKINNYLICIOUS menu which are items that are healthy and less calorie. The Arugula Salad containing Arugula, Marcona Almonds, Golden Raisins, Parmesan, Lemon and Olive Oil.....is sooooooo light and refreshing and is a great accompaniment to something that is fried. So I sat there, watching some people make a connection and others look like they were ready to go. I chose to sit in a nuetral seat, meaning I sat between two females so that no one assumed I wanted to pair up. I wasn't there for a love connection--just a really yummy meal. This evening turned out to be hilarious--at my friends' expense. She didn't find anyone that fit her type. Oh well! I left with a delicious OREO COOKIE CHEESECAKE! That's the ultimate love connection!Walking into The Cheesecake Factory (at night) reminds me of a Las Vegas Casino.  Not the downtown casinos that are all closed in and almost claustrophobic, mind you, but the expansive Steve Wynn casinos on the strip.  It's huge.  It borders on gaudy, but in a nice way.  You also can't really tell what time of day it is - probably so you don't mind how long you wait for your server to come back to you (though we did).I'd imagine that during the day, the monstrous windows in the front of the place give it a ton of light, and it would be a completely different feel, but at night, it just gave that vibe.  The noise is pretty incredible too - like the old noise of casinos (they don't have noise any more, sad to say).As to the food - pretty impressive overall.  I just wish that they didn't have 300 items on the menu.  And I didn't count, the server gave that number when I asked for a suggestion since I didn't feel like opening the tome of selections.  I eventually settled on one of the items from the specials list (Caramel Chicken).We also had some crab cake appetizers, a massive double BBQ burger, a chicken sandwich and an order of popcorn shrimp.  The fried food overall was the worst.  The burger was good, but huge.  The crab cakes were surprisingly good.   It was really the service that did them in, but to their credit the manager (or someone doing an imitation of a manger) came out to tell us that the food would be out some time.  Then we had to also wait on the bill, and to pay the bill, and so on...If I had any suggestions, it would be for them to go on "Kitchen Nightmares" with Gordon Ramsay.  Not because the place isn't clean - it's immaculate.  But the size of the menu, coupled with the portion size, is insane.  Cut the menu in half (or quarters), and do the same with the portions.  They could even shave something off the price at the same time.That way every person wouldn't be walking out with leftovers and they wouldn't have to spend so much time at every table trying to help diners navigate the menu.  Not to mention, there would be room for dessert.  You know, the cheesecake?

One of the best things about living in the 'burbs is Gallery at Ballantyne Hotel.  I love this place for a lot of reasons, great service, wonderul bar menu and atmosphere.  During my most recent visit I enjoyed a beer and wonderful cheddar cheese and bacon sliders.  My friend had a great berry martini and fish tacos.  Her two generous fish tacos were more than enough for a meal and got two thumbs way up!The bar has the best atmosphere and the most comfortable seating. Even when it's crowded, you can always converse without having to raise you voice while continuing to sink back in comfy chairs.  They have wine and other drink specials and don't forget the great patio that overlooks the golf course when weather is great and the sky is Carolina Blue!

Over the past few weeks this has become my neighborhood bar.  Probably because it's in my neighborhood, and is also a bar.  And, the employees remember who I am!  Sure, they all call me "Mr. Manhattan" because I order that drink most often, but still.  They recognize me!Happy Hour occurs on weekdays from 4pm-7pm, making it the perfect after-work pitstop.  Long day at work?  No worries, BJ's has 50% off drinks and $5 appetizers to keep you going.  I've had their Tempura Calamari and one of their chicken sandwiches, and both have been tasty.  A step above average bar food.  Be sure to try their herb-infused fries, they're an addicting side to have while enjoying a few drinks.  The decor, staff, food, and friendly atmosphere have kept this spot in regular rotation for me recently, and I don't see that changing any time soon.  I'm a fan!

Review Text :
What qualifies them to call themselves "Native New Yorker"?What does peddling cheap batches of taste-impaired wings, crunchy pizza and nacho platters have to do with New York?Or even "New Yorker"? Where's the man in the fancy hat that serves me my wings? What, you don't have one? Then again, I ask, what's "New York" about you?A checkered tablecloth and some black and white photographs? Oh wow, a picture of an old automobile. Get the fuck out of town..50 extra for a cup of ranch? Have you the brain worms? What, has there been a ranch dressing famine? And not to be picky here, but usually, you're supposed to wait for the cheese to melt before you serve the smothered fries. Is that why I'm paying the .50 per ranch? Is your "shredded cheese heating machine" broken? Does New York know you're up to this?My yelp review for the missing dozen wings got the Manager's attention back in December 20, 2012, so I thought I would write an update.  Message from the Manager:I have put you in my manager log for a dozen wings on us.  Please let us know immediately if there is ever a problem and we will happily correct it. If you wouldn't mind updating your yelp review stating that this has been resolved, we would greatly appreciate it.That is nice that they really read the reviews.  I just have not had time to go back since December.  Thanks for reaching out to your customers.

I'm gonna take some heat for this, but I really don't care.  I LOVE Claim Jumper.  Say what you will about chain this and chain that, but I hold this restaurant higher than your average chain and with reason.It takes everything bad about American dining - huge portions, over-the-top decor incl impressive old-school ceiling fans, fattening desserts and huge tedious menus and unabashedly flaunts it.  I call it the Sierra Nevada version of Cheesecake Factory.I've been going here for years - so I may be blinded by the nostalgia value, but I think the food is of better quality than your typical chain.  I very rarely come here anymore because every location is far-flung since Claim Jumper is adored by suburban soccer parents from here to Chicago, but my buddy out in South Tempe got me to make the trek last week for his birthday.My favorites here are:* Tri-tip french dip, which is delicious and classically Californian.  * Rotisserie chicken with red skinned mashed potatoes or cheese potatocakes as an option.* Country Fried Steak - with the mashed potatoes adorned with a red apple. :)* Parmesan crusted chicken with angel hair marinara.* Meatball calzone which is bigger than your face.If you can finish dinner here AND leave room for the gluttonous Chocolate Mother Lode cake or Mud Pie for dessert, I would like to meet you and shake your hand just to be sure you are human.So out of the blue our Boss who was celebrating a birthday along with two other coworkers within the same week says were all going out to lunch, he didn't get any arguements from me! I figured it would be one of are usual spots, but to my surprise he said  we were going to Claim Jumpers.From the moment were walked in we were quickly greated by the hostest with the mostest, he was funny & friendly and laughed at my inability to count to 4.Mike our waiter was friendly, and took great care of our table. I ordered their infamous pot pie and was not disappointed. It was way too much food but tasted so good it was difficult to resist pushing myself into a food coma. I snuck by the counter and quietly mentioned it was a three people bday lunch and before crazy birthday surprises could commence my team decided it was time to go. Before we could get out the door the hostess with the mostest and waiter were bagging up baked birthday to go treats. Great customer service goes a long way.... thanks for helping us celebrate! We'll definitely be back!I have been here a few times now. Each time we had a different server,and each time they were good. Every time we came for Lunch we try to get there around 11:30am,  because, by 12 noon the joint is Jumping!The Clam Chowder is good, not great . Salad ,just OK. The food is good,but my friend likes to go there all the time. I think It is a place you could visit once and awhile and be good with it.I have never had Desert here. But, they display them in the Showcase and they look amazing. I should of taken a photo,but I did not. They have the largest slice of cake I have ever seen. From one of the Tallest cakes I have ever seen.It is decorated very Rustic, as if you are in a hunting lodge. It is very clean and parking is all around the building. So there is a lot.it is worth a visit. They are very friendly. The greeters in the front are very happy to see you. I like it.

Can I give ZERO here?!?!What an awful place for sushi and I literally cannot believe this is so-called "best sushi" place in Madison!One of the sushi we ordered was Inari sushi (bean curd). The first second I saw it I know it might not taste good. But I put in my mouth anyway. What a bad idea! It tasted like they put cooking wine in the bean curd, which is absolutely not right becoz the bean curd tastes either sweet or sour but nothing like wine!!! I don't think they were fresh! It tasted like the bean curd had been kept for way too long and it fermented!!! I had to spit it out bcoz I didn't want to get food poisoning!! The waiter came but denied immediately anything wrong with the bean curd. No apology or anything. I heard the guy behind the sushi bar even asked the waiter whether we are Chinese. They were talking in a dialect from China. But unfortunately, I happened to know that dialect. They came back and denied any bad food again but still no apology for anything. The guy behind the sushi bar also had a weird smile on his face and was looking directly at me. Some kind of provocation?!?!Didnt touch anything else, I left. Def NO COMING BACK!!!

Restaurant name  Andreoli Italian Grocer
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Andreoli's Grocer is a little expensive but the ambiance alone is worth paying for. The Italian and European groceries - pastas, grains, baked goods, olive oils, wine- and the Italian conversations you hear while sitting at their antique tables and chairs, makes you feel as if you were in Italy. On the other hand I have mixed reviews on their food. I was disappointed in my cheese and cured meat platter. Their menu claims that their antipasto will "take your breath away." I ordered the il tagliere del maresciallo and it was kinda boring. I expected the dish to be simple but not poorly crafted. I was expecting a variety of firm and soft Italian cheeses and a variety of smoky, spicy, and salty cured meats but got nothing more than a few flavorful meats, a handful of briny olives, and a glob of mild gorgonzola cheese. It would have been really good with one or two more cheeses.I also ordered a panino forza Italia that was really good. The panino, English translation for sandwich, had a wonderful paring of proscuitto, gorgonzola, mascarpone, and arugula that was served between a perfectly golden crusted and soft baguette. I plan on going back to try a couple of other things on their menu. Until then I'm going to give them a three. Ciao!Gimmee an A...Gimme a T....Gimme a T...Gimme an I...Gimme a T...Gimme a U...Gimme a D....Gimme an E...what does it spell?  ATTITUDE!This review is not for the food, but for the attitude we experienced at Andreoli's.  As visitors to Scottsdale we were looking for a place to pick up talian specialty and deli items and two options, Andreoli's' being one, popped to the top of our list.  Since my hubby is Italian American and grew up in an Italian neighborhood in Brooklyn, he has more than a passing acquaintance with good italian deli's and "attitude".  Loves the former and the latter doesn't phase him a bit.  Usually.  But at Andreoli's he walked out without making a purchase.  Here's why...We were the only customers in the store at about 6pm on a weeknight, so it's not as if they were too busy or we were too impatient.  But we waited for some time before a staff person, who had just been complaining - loudly - to someone else about a rude customer - asked "You know what you want?"  When we said we were new to the store and trying to decide the response was roughly, "When you figure out what you want call me, I'll be in the back."You know that old comic phrase, "This job would be great if it weren't for our damned customers"...well, we wonder if that' might be the slogan at Andreoli's based on this single experience.   That said, it seems as if Andreoli's has a decent selection of deli items (although not as good as  one of their competitors perhaps) and a great selection of imported Italian specialty items, like taralles, capers packed in salt, nougats and so on, and a freezer case full of ravioli with different fillings that looked pretty darned intriguing. So, we wondered, why was the place empty at about 6:00 on a weeknight when one might think people should be coming and going to pick things up to take home or eat in?   Maybe we're not the only ones who decided the attitude wasn't worth it?We left without making a purchase.  But given all the great Yelp reviews, maybe we just hit this on a bad day.  Still, we'd echo Jan S's observation in her review from her experience in December that there is a sense the staff doesn't care.  And in this economy in particular, we want to do business with people who do.Andreoli, you disappoint me. Here's why...After not visiting you for nearly a year, I craved your food. Either you are resting on your laurels or stopped caring or both.With crummy weather that we had today, a friend suggested your restaurant. Well other than the coffee that is consistently excellent, the pasta dish I ordered left everything to be desired...I ate because I was hungry but there was nothing in that dish worth recommending - dried pasta, uninteresting ragu - no sauce whatsoever....blah! So much for driving 20 minutes to come see you, I'll stay home next time thinking of you and make my own meal and not spend $ 13 for a dish that's not even worth two bucks.On top of that, you are too busy talking on the phone instead of taking care of your customers. Not even one person bothered to ask us how our food was.First and foremost Andreoli's is an overpriced Italian grocery store.  As it is a grocery store, visitors should not expect table cloths or good service,   Many of the unusual items it carries can be found for less at nearby AJs, but not the broad selection of cheeses or salumi.  The homemade hot lunches can be very good, but this is not the place to bring the boss.  Because the food is homemade, it varies in consistency from day to day.  I will say, as one who lived in Italy for many years, the dishes are indeed authentic and worth a try, if not worth the price.  One warning: Don't order the pizza and expect an ordinary pizza.  It's a rustic pizza, made with bread dough.  We did not like it.  Andreoli himself, incidentally, can be quite grumpy to those he does not know.It was a Monday and there's nothing too great about Mondays. It was lunchtime and it was hot outside. I didn't bring my lunch into work so I had to go somewhere. I sat and pondered about where to go. I started driving and kept driving and it then hit me...I'd been wanting to try Andreoli for years and this Monday lunchtime was going to be the day! Would it be everything I dreamed of? Would I silently thank the owners for making me happy on this hot and miserable Monday? Would it feel like I stepped into Italy in the desert? Would I gorge not one both both halves of my sandwich? Would I leave with chocolate in my hand? The answer to each question above is yes; a thousand times yes! I parked my car and walked through a game of two patrons playing Foosball. It felt very much like Italy and it felt even more like Italy once I stepped through the doors. The grocer is open in the middle with plenty of homey tables and chairs and different types of Italian groceries line the walls. I immediately noticed the tasty dishes in the glass refrigerator at the counter and most importantly, the rows of desserts tempting my taste buds. The menu is lengthy and everything sounded delicious. From pasta to sandwiches, this Italian grocer has it all. Experiencing my typical menu anxiety, I stared anxiously at the menu and finally, asked the man behind the counter what he suggested. He said to go for the # 3 named the sempronio which had prosciutto, mozzarella and pepper sandwich on sourdough. It sounded delicious so I said "sold!" and moved my way to the cash register. Before I could escape though, chocolate caught my eye. Yes, I was coming off of an eating binge in Chicago but I couldn't resist so I asked for a little slice of the chocolate with marzipan in the middle. I lunched alone and I felt just fine doing so here. Everyone is very friendly and everything is very casual, so I sat at my table and waited for my meal to arrive. And now let me tell you about the Italian goodness known as my sandwich. The sourdough bread was soft, crunchy and blissful with every bite. I read in one of the reviews that the prosciutto was so good it was almost a sin to eat it with bread. That is exactly how this prosciutto was. It was salty and moist and very lean. Absolutely delicious with every bite. The peppers complimented it perfectly and I didn't even mind the biteful of garlic clove I discovered. I asked for a to-go box. I did, and I had every intention of wrapping up half of the sandwich and saving it for later. But how could I do so to something so delicious? So, the other half stayed in the to-go box all of five minutes before I consumed the remainder. I was full and satisfied. Here's a very important note: do not ask to change anything on the menu. What they offer is what you get and not only is it delicious as-is and shouldn't be changed, they will also refuse you if you request any substitutes. Hey, it's the Italian way and as a fellow Italian, I can honestly say: that's how we role!I cannot wait to visit again and again. I also can't wait to buy products from their and have an Italian feast of my own at home!I'd been hearing about Andreoli for quite some time, but it took me until last Thursday to go for my first visit.  That first visit was so good that I returned for dinner tonight (just a few days later).On that first visit, I was with three other people and we shared a large mixed salad, oilves, and two different kinds of focaccia.  I had the minestrone soup for dinner that night and then we all shared several desserts.  My favorite was a merengue dessert with frosting - delicious!Tonight's visit was just as good.  My husband once again had homemade pasta with veal meat sauce (their version of Bolognese).  I shared the fettucine with lobster in a light red tomato sauce with my mom.  My brother and dad both ordered the pork sandwich, and we again started the meal by sharing a large mixed green salad, fresh bread, and an antipasti platter.  Once again, we couldn't end our meal without something sweet, so my dad chose a nutty nuget for us to share.While it's a casual atmosphere / grocer, and you place your order at the front counter, the service is attentive and the food is as authentic as I've found in the Valley.  We will for sure be back with the bambino in the future... Bellisimo!Ok this is hard for me beause the food is 6 stars.  I take my friends, family, clients here and everybody raves about it ..... but.  The smart ass kids at the counter have got to go.  I don't know their names but  one in particular should retire and become a lawyer because when you ask if you can have your sandwich on Italian (roll) instead of focaccia he says "Focaccia is Italian" and then looks at you smugly.  I took the high road and neglected to point out to him that a baguette he offered was French.  He should  pay less attention to geography and work on his note taking skills because after all that, the sandwich still came on a focaccia.So I hope the owner hears this, your front line of sales at the counter makes me want to go somewhere else.  Your six star food, averaged with your zero star staff puts you at a 3.  And yes Guiseppe, I want to drink diet coke and I don't need a lecture on how it has "echemica that is a bad for your brain". If you feel so strongly about it, then don't sell it !  I'm sure your meats contribute to heart disease but you're not grimacing when I order a porchetta sandwich (which is unbelievably good by the way)So Andreloi, please get someone up front with a smile and who, at a minimum, has read a pamphlet on the basics of customer service.Hate having to write this one.Not a fan. Today Vermont Sandwich Company was packed, so my girlfriend and I thought we would walk over and give this place a try. Big BIG Mistake. Now I've been to Italy, hell ...I grew up in Nice, France. Not 'old world' enough for me, I ordered the Maresciallo Italian antipasto with their meats & cheese which took forever to get and charged me over $10 (big rip off) and my friend ordered a Bastard baguette (dis-appointing). This place is too over-priced in their offerings.The main reason for this yelp is the rudeness of the staff here, the woman behind the counter had a chip on her shoulder and treated not only us but others in line with arrogance. Also the old man, possibly the owner had the same air about him.Granted there were many off duty scottsdale police hanging around, but the whole scenario reminded me of a mafia 'front', just like back home. I guess this is a hit or miss from reading all the reviews, maybe its just from others low standards?I can't believe I have not reviewed Andreoli's before.  I have been having their sandwiches and Chocolate croissants since the twins were born.  Andreoli is so close to the Scottsdale Shea Hospital.  When I delivered the twins I had to stay there for I think 4 or 5 days.  I sent my hubby everyday for chocolate croissants and sandwiches.  Hospital food is yuck compared to it.  I went back again today, I needed some comfort food after the stress of my little girls surgery, hey I need an excuse for the carb overload. I ordered the Porchetta and the Forza Italia, plus of course a couple of chocolate croissants, 1/3 of a pound of salami and some Zuppa inglese for an additional dessert.The food here is amazing, yes, the customer service is not the best.  They remind me of my Zio Aldo.  Always with his smug smile and always telling everyone around how "stupido" they are.  I miss him.  You need to think like George Costanza, not make any sudden moves or comments for fear you will get "No croissant for you, one year!"If you are not one of their paisans (part of the Italian family or go there every week) they treat you like crap.  Food was good but would not go back. We waited 15 minutes for a seat and when the owner finally got up from taking up a table of 4 to sign papers for a car he was buying....... they tried to give the table to one of their good customers.  We bought a bottle of wine and finished it at the restaurant and was charged $5 for a corking fee.  please explain that ......................The owner and I'm guessing  his daughter who was behind the counter was real rude........... When we left I commented on a dish that someone was eating (it looked real good) the patron said you can get one to if you come here often........WOW -I guess I don't look ItalianFull review blogged:Crostini di Fegatini alla Fiorentina:  $5. Nothing complicated here, just rough ground chicken liver pate over homemade toasted bread with a bit of parsley.  Served chilled and ample in portion, no complaints.Maialino:  $18.  The most limited item on the menu this spit-roast baby piglet was gone by the time we left and although the skin could have been crispier the flavors were spot on - the pork supple and rife with notes of garlic, rosemary, coriander, and pepper while the skin was slightly sweet and plenty smoky.Panino con Porchetta: $8.95. Much like the Maialino this could have used a bit more crackle on the surface but all things being equal it would be pretty hard to complain about crusty Italian bread wrapped around warm pork roast with plenty of black pepper, fennel and light citrus notes.Baccala` in Umido con Polenta: $18. One of my primary reasons for wanting to visit Andreoli in the first place was this dish and thankfully it did not disappoint one bit.  Big in portion, huge in flavor, and in my opinion the most well executed dish of the afternoon I figured going into it that the cod would be excellent and as good as it was, the biggest shocker of the dish was perfect execution of the polenta - toothsome, dense, and a veritable sponge for both the tomatoes and the briny fish.Caponata Sicula: $5. Simple, savory, and perhaps the deal of the day this plate of tender eggplant, briny capers, pine nuts, tomatoes, balsamic, and olive oil with hints of basil and onion was plenty to share and would have only been better with some warm bread for dipping.Trippa alla Toscanaccia: $14. With almost half of our table having never eaten tripe and another not really a fan of the dish I figured I'd be doing most of the legwork on this dish and although everyone took a taste my suspicions fortuitously proved correct - an acquired taste for sure, this was really good.  Thin like soup and plenty fatty despite being loaded with meat with notes of onion, tomato, and vinegar at the fore while mint and garlic came through on the palate this was another place that some extra bread would have been welcomed as far too much broth remained at the end.Mille Feuille: $7. While I contest this should have been referred to as a Napoleon I guess it really doesn't matter because regardless of nationality what we received was flaky pastry wrapped around lightly sweetened pastry cream.  Clearly not as transcendent as some of the a la minute options being turned out elsewhere as this one had been stored in the chiller all day I have to say I was largely impressed by the separation of the layers and lack of sogginess.Rhum Baba: $2 each.  Also straight from the chilled case these traditional baba were everything one could hope from the classic dish - a buttery ball of pastry drown in rum; a sledgehammer of flavor up front with a buttery sweet finish; at one bite each I'm pretty sure I'd have been tipsy with a half dozen.Struffoli: $4.  Another very traditional selection you don't really see all that often at Italian markets or bakeries these marble sized pastry balls were crisp on the outside, soft on the inside, and absolutely dredged in honey.  A stark textural juxtaposition to the baba which was soft throughout I personally enjoyed these a lot, though having sat for a while the honey had begun to harden which made them a bit difficult to extract from the small dish.Cornetti: $2.50.  Golden crisp on the outside, buttery caverns within, and fortunately a brand new batch when I ran back in to make my purchase this warm nutella croissant was the highlight of the sweets for me - a strong contender for best croissant in town that remained fluffy despite the chocolate-hazenut filling while the exterior shattered to the tooth.Sfogliatelle: $3.  Lightly citrus thanks to the use of candied lemon peel, even crispier than the cornetti on the outside, and a pillow of ricotta smoothness within - if you go to Andreoli and don't order one of these you're missing out...as a matter of fact, I'd go so far as to suggest that this item alone is worth a visit to Andreoli as it was every bit as good as any I've ever tasted on either coast (admittedly having not yet been to Italy.) Schiacciata uva: $4.  I'd never tried this prior to Andreoli's and, as a matter of fact, I'd never even seen it.  Quite simply a focaccia base with fresh grapes placed at the center prior to baking thus allowing the juices to infuse the dough as it cooked this was sweet, light, and full of flavor - the sort of dish that would be easy to whip up for a party and equally easy to dress up in any number of variations.The Verdict:  Fresh, rustic, and very authentic this one definitely goes on the 'under the radar' list and while I'm unable to speak to Andreoli's quality during normal business hours I can only say that based on what I experienced at the Christmas festival I'm eager to return.I agree with the other reviewers.  The girl working at the counter was not friendly.  I ordered one of their sandwiches and I asked if they could please add prosciutto to it.  She replied with "no, we don't mix meats".  Really?  Pretty sure I'm the customer and if you're not willing to give me what I want, I won't be back.  Hence, I'm never going back.  The sandwich would have been much better if they made it the way I requested it.  An Italian sandwich with just one meat?!?  It was bland.  Bread was hard and flavorless.  My friend loves Italian food and he got the Rigatoni Bolognese, which he thought was OK but nothing special.  DeFalco's is better, especially for sandwiches.  Oh, and do not order the tripe, I think the reason is self explanatory.Mamma Mia! That's my best Italian impression... Take it for what it's worth. The only thing that matters is that I had the best sandwich I've ever had in my life at Andreoli's Italian Grocer. Yes... in my life (or at least as far back as last week, I have a horrible memory)Before I get to the sandwich, I have to touch on the environment. When I saw a sign next to the register saying "We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone," I knew this place was going to be a treat. That said, I've been here two days in a row and had two completely different customer service experiences. My first day, the atmosphere was tense. I went up to give my order to a young lady. She was pretty girl, but I'm not sure if she had teeth because she never smiled. Order was taken, then on to the next task she went.  The man at the register was cordial but obviously annoyed. It was Obvious because he outwardly made the irritated comment that he didn't know how he was supposed to run the register and also make, I think he said cake, but I'm not sure because I was looking around for the closest exit in case one of these two lost it. On the second day, there was a different young lady and a different gentleman. Both were welcoming and friendly. Completely different attitudes from these two. The service seems to be luck of the draw.You want to know who was pleasant both visits? The guy who runs the dining room with the burly mustache. He brightens my day. He's delightful and he has an unapologetic mustache. I can't say enough about that mustache. It's wonderful.The dining area is not very big and it's filled with a number of old world-antique looking furnishings. Cookware hangs from the ceiling, old photos on the walls among other random looking antiquey stuff. It's pretty sweet. Sitting at one of the old wooden tables for two made me feel like I was at on old time pub or eatery in a small Italian village. If the floor was made of cobblestone, it would be perfect.Both times, I ordered the Caio sandwich. Sliced beef with cheese and grilled onions on the greatest bread I've had in Phoenix. It's served with a simple salad and is so good. It's a great lunch. I may go get it again today. If you have some room left after your meal, they have a case of delicious looking dessert items. I tried the tiramisu, and I didn't hate it. This place is one of my new Phoenix favorites... even though it's in Scottsdale. I don't care what kind of service I get. As long as the food stays amazing, this will be my little Italy.My coworker and I stopped in here for a quick lunch recently and while part of me really enjoyed it, the the rest of me really didn't. The food was delicious, the atmosphere is pleasant and the workers were friendly.The issue I have is they don't allow any customization of any kind to their sandwiches. I was looking for an 'italian' kind of sandwich with a bunch of different meats and peppers but they didn't have anything like that on their list of sandwiches. When i asked if they could do that, the woman said no. They make their sandwiches a certain way because 'he' (the owner?) says they're best that way. Ok. I guess. There was also about a 15 minute wait for the two sandwiches to arrive. So the food was good, but don't expect to customize your sandwich.Super disappointed on a Saturday afternoon.We absolutely loved going to Andreoli's and sincerely hope that yesterday was just a off day for a favorite restaurant of ours.We literally drive 24 miles (one way) to get our Italian fix and we had planned for yesterday.We ordered the gnocchi as a primi, and secondi was to be bistecca fiorentina ala Sangue. We had to ask for our waters, our wine, and other things we just sloughed it off, as that is typical and italian. Nothing rushed. We certainly were not in a hurry but it seemed like our order was forgotten.Everything arrived at once which when we ordered we indicated pasta first, steak second.The Steak arrived medium well to well. We expressed that while we were not trying to be difficult, we ordered our steak specifically rare. That the steak presented was near well done. When you are paying $22 or more a pound, you kind of want it the way requested. So the server took it back. Rather than fix the issue, our order taker returned. Expressed that she looked at it, and found it to be lightly pink in the center. That it was only the edges that were well done. Now I don't know if she though we were youngsters or what, but trying to convince guests a nearly well steak is rare, and presenting it to us again and asking us to accept it twice really killed the whole meal. We stated that we were sorry, but we could not accept the steak the way it was cooked.No offer of a re-do.Our wine went to waste, and we left hungry.We were absolutely sad, wasted an afternoon and fuel. Though things happen at times where people forget, and we are forgiving, the fact that it was pushed upon us to feel bad about a cooking error should not be placed on guests ever.I'm a true believer that Andreoli has some of the most authentic Italian food in the Valley! Their food is SO fresh and delicious and I completely recommend sharing the dishes family style so that you can get a little taste of everything. And their bread, Oh-Em-Gee, their bread. I could eat it all day, every day and be a happy camper (Ask for some balsamic to go along with their fabulous EOO)! A few of my favorites are the maresciallo (meat and cheese board), fratelli d'italia (caprese-like salad) and their pasta options change frequently but they are all amazing!  Last but certainly not least, their sweet treats are off of the charts. I love their Nutella cookies and chocolate cake! Warning: The photos may make your mouth instantly start watering! :) Enjoy!! Can't wait to come back soon.

I can't believe I haven't written my review on 1130 yet! I had a very nice happy hour with my pal Heather C here. We met before going to watch a performance at the Herberger. The weather was really nice so I was glad that Heather chose a patio table. Our waiter was a kid. I mean, I know I'm getting older, but he was a clumsy kid who fumbled through the drink specials and needed some sharpness. With such a cool sleek spot, you would probably want a more professional waiter. Just my opinion. We decided on the lobster lettuce cups that were rather large and surprisingly full of lobster meat! I really liked the appetizer, I was wishing for more acid but it was still refreshing and tasty. We took our waiter's suggestion and ordered the calamari. What a surprise! I really liked the calamari! It came drizzled with a sweet chili sauce and had pepperocinis tossed into the mix.It was great! I loved how the sweetness of the calamari meat, and the chili sauce played well with the tanginess of the pepperocinis! I had some kind of peach martini that was WAY too sweet for my taste, but I guess for a girly drink it was ok. I hope that next time we'll have more time to linger and maybe even have dinner. I look forward to trying their other offerings.How is this place still open? Tried it numerous times simply for the geographical convenience. Every time the food is HORRIBLE. Last experience included gross Bloody Mary's not work the two bucks, an overcooked  and under seasoned salmon, soggy greasy fries and bad service. I will not come back here.For a couple of reasons, 1130 has become a regular after-work haunt for me. First off, it's conveniently located in the Arizona Center. And I always like an excuse to linger in downtown Phoenix and people-watch after the sun goes down and the trees in the AZ Center light up. Secondly, I've become somewhat addicted to their wings ever since being invited here a couple of times on somebody else's dollar. They're really perfectly seasoned with just enough peppery heat. Mind you, this is not my favorite place in Phoenix for hot wings when I am on that mission, but these are a very compelling appetizer.I was pleasantly surprised to discover they offer a 10%-off discount if you check in through Yelp on your mobile phone. They already had me at Happy Hour drink and appetizer discounts, but another break on the price is always welcome.Consider checking out 1130 if you're catching a movie at the cinemas in the Arizona Center. You could always go for a plate of wings instead of a movie theater hot dog, couldn't you? I know I could.

Say what? $14.99 for a bento box lunch special? Ok.. I'll give it a try.Was it worth it? Meh, not so much. It took 5 days to get our food and the waitress just seemed to be in her own world. WTF?My friend ordered a $5 cucumber salad and it was the smallest salad I've ever seen. It was the size of half a rice bowl and we both looked at it like WTF.My bento box came with 4 pieces of california roll, 4 pieces of spicy tuna roll, 1 piece tuna sushi, 1 piece salmon sushi, 1 pice shrimp sushi, seaweed salad and edamame. It was alright. I was stuffed. But, really, the wait made it just ridiculous. And the $5 small ass cucumber salad was also insane. Blah.

Review Text :
I ordered a bratwurst here during a layover at the Phoenix International Airport and boy did the experience...how can I put it lightly...SUCKED!I don't know why on earth they were even calling this a brat. It was a hot dog with jalapenos and onions on top of a super stale and dry cornmeal-like bun. I think I ended up eating half of it like lasagna...and threw the rest away...up in the toilet, that is.If it is store policy to not speak to the customer, then the staff is doing their job very well. They said absolutely no words during the purchase of the meal...including when my order was ready. Instead they just stood there, staring at people like Neanderthals...and were very snooty. Snooty? Yes, snooty! I suppose the job is not so easy, they couldn't do it.I hope the HQ of Jodi Maroni's does a major overhaul of this location because it could be something cool. Until then...stay very far away!You were warned!Yours truly,Abe Froman, The Sausage King of Chicago.THE QUEEN IS DEAD. Well, she should be. If Jodi Maroni is the queen in question, that is. Terrible, terrible sausage sandwiches. Worse cheeseburgers. Barely edible fries. You can find something better in this airport.While the title might be better suited for a Manhattan Chelsea night club, the allure of Jody Maroni's is an easy one here at Sky Harbor - everyone hates the typical airport food options but most folks (even vegans) love hot dogs.But these hot dogs aren't even worthy of a Joey Chestnut or Kobayashi throw down. They often remind me of a layman's version of a Costco dog but cost nearly 4x as much. Sad to say I've eaten here more times than I'd like to admit, but there isn't a single dog I can recommend on the menu.I can however, digress somewhat on my experiences here, all of which included slow and lackadaisical service and were driven by the hope that each time would be better. I've had their chicken andouille dog, which was really just an overcooked hot dog served in a semi-toasted bun. Now substitute the chicken andouille with their bratwurst, polish dog, Louisiana boudin hot link, chicken apple, Chicago style dog, sweet Italian and you have the same result.The biggest offender was their priciest option, the kobe beef dog, supposedly made of wagyu, the red meat from heaven, a gift from carnivore gods. Yet, even at $9 (airport prices, yikes) it still tasted like ... just a Costco hot dog. Perhaps a tad juicier and an interesting snap to the casing but nothing mind blowing or back breaking but certainly wallet killing.In the end, I mean Jodi Maroni no harm. After all, I've had a much more decent version of his hot dogs in other cities, but a little airport kiosk in a space full of commuters who are willing to pay the extra buck for (as Bourdain would coin it) "meat in tube form" nourishment, is not going to be making anything revolutionary anytime soon.

Restaurant name  Sweet Tomatoes

Review Text :
Oink! Oink!  While it isn't the largest selection of items I've seen - the presentation is really nice.  They have smaller stations set apart for the salads, desserts, breads/muffins, soups, and drinks -- so you don't have the big line-up going on.  If you are a little piggy like me with multiple trips, this is efficient!The server/attendent was hilarious (didn't catch his name, bad Yelper...whack on my hand).  He made lots of jokes as he drove a big cart on wheels "Mexican driver coming thru", a second cart a few mins later "Another cart coming thru, same mexican driver".  Had the whole section in stitches!  Later, when speaking to him at my table, I found him to be a very pleasant and kind man...with a super positive attitude (I mean, who is this happy?).Located in the lovely and central Desert Ridge shopping center, the food is really kept fresh.  This location has a slightly different design than others; a warehouse open-style, with glass and framing inside, and very tall ceilings.  I like it!  Good, especially, if you are claustrophobic...as well as "starvin' like Marvin".I'm really not a big fan of buffets, but my wife and son had a craving for salad and wanted to go to Sweet Tomatoes. So I guess I gave in. Anyways, I've been here quite few times and my family wanted something healthy tonight. There is so much to choose from at this place from the salad bar, soup bar with 8 different home-made soups, pasta bar, bakery, potato bar that includes both baked potatoes and sweet potatoes, and of course the desert bar. I really do think the salad bar is one of the best I've been too. So many choices. They have both lettuce and spinach with everything you can image to put on top of the salad. Also, they have a few pasta salads and other pre-made salads like Cesar's and the likes. Really good. With all these options, it has to make everyone happy except for one thing. Where's the meat? Where's the beef? Not much here. They have different Focaccia breads (something almost like pizza bread) that are pretty good. My wife and son really likes their soup especially the chicken noodle soup. They love it. I tried the chili soup and it had multiple kinds of beans, ground beef, tomatoes and other thing. It was pretty good but little sour from the tomatoes. The pasta bar is ok and probably my favorite would be the Mac and Cheese. The best part of the desert bar is the soft swirl ice cream. Seems like one of the most popular things at Sweet Tomatoes. One last thing, ask the people in the bakery for freshly baked chocolate chips cookies and they will give you some. If you don't ask they won't give you any. Usually, they just pass the cookies around on platters so if you want to make sure you get some cookies then just ask. So the workers are always available for you and they are picking up your finished plates and bowls. They always clean up the dirty tables pretty quickly so overall the place is really clean. So overall the place has pretty good food and if you looking for healthy food then this is the place. One warning, don't over eat cause it's so easy. So enjoy a healthy meal once in awhile.If you've never been to a Sweet Tomatoes in the past you already know what to expect because every city has a place like it.Grab a tray, grab a plate, walk down a line just like the one they had at my elementary school and load up with lettuce, spinach, cold pastas, tomatoes, cucumbers, etc. Have a seat and congratulate yourself for eating healthy (ignore the 3 cups of Thousand Island dressing you also got).Then, I guess as a reward for healthy eating, you grab a bowl of soup to up your sodium intake for the day. Then you grab a few slices (more like 3x2" pieces) of pizza, some muffins and devour your second course.Still feeling good about your healthy eating choices you grab a bowl, put a brownie on the bottom and cover it with ice cream, add some sprinkles and you're golden!Don't get me wrong. I'm OK with all of the above. My kids love this place and, since they both have hollow legs, it's an economical choice and it must be healthier than McDonalds.

Have you ever had the Lean Cuisine chicken enchiladas? Have you ever been to a super obnoxious sorority party, where all the blonde bimbos are tanked and dancing on tables and such? Have you ever been totally ignored by wait and bar staff even though you've doused yourself in lighter fluid and set yourself on fire? Well. Then. You've been to San Felipe's. Lower than mediocore food. Except for the grilled fish tacos. Thus 2 stars. Not 1. When I lived at DCRanch, I thought this would be a less expensive, less formal place to hang out. Hmmm...other than grabbing a quick beer here I'd sooner stay at home, eat Doritos and watch a sorority slasher film. What do Kristin and Pierre say? Meh? Yea, that's it. Meh!

Decided to have dinner here and catch up with a girlfriend of mine. Since it was conveniently located on Eastern between Silverado Ranch and Serene we both decided to eat here.Location is pretty good easy to spot it's in the same shopping center as Bjs restaurant.As we entered we were greeted with a happy smile with the staff in their authentic native thai clothing. The entire restaurant gave that Thai feel and the ambiance was amazing too as well. Not to loud and you can easily hold a conversation at your table without screaming.We ordered the Chinese broccoli with chicken which was delicious. Been loving the greens lately since i'm on a special diet.Next we also ordered the pineapple fried rice mixed with cashews, raisins , and pineapple literally served on a pineapple. Really awesome!.For another entree we ordered the Sea Bass which was to die for, it was incredible delicious, it better be it was pricey and from BangkokFor noddles we decided to have the Silver Noodle Salad, a bit too spicy for me but still really good.We were both kind of disappointed since the mango salad was not available. They only have it during mango season time,For drinks we had a lycee martini which was really good it did not even taste like alcohol and also Thai coffee.. bomb digidy also!For dessert we decided to have the fried banana with coconut ice cream! I really loved it! Specially the coconut ice cream, it tasted the same in Thailand.As far as authenticity of the food it tastes exactly the same in Thailand.I would love to go back to this place and suggest it to everyone. I also heard there is live entertainment on the weekends so I might go back and check it out.I just came back here after a rather long absence and felt the place deserved an upgrade. Still not my favorite Thai place in town, but they are solid and the service is great. Also, a little disappointed by their spice levels. I ordered a five and it felt more like a 2. I'll definitely kick up the heat on my next visit. Liberal with drink refills and cleared plates quickly as well.

Review Text :
The Panda Express at the Venetian served me the worst Panda Express food ever - and I LIKE Panda Express! The food was already ready, like all Pandas, but it tasted overly salty (I didn't even order anything bizarre), and everyone else with me agreed.Can't beat the convenience factor, of course. Maybe I caught them on a bad day?Picked up two entrees (~$6; credit cards accepted) to serve as a poor man's brunch. Can't beat this location's convenience, and service was good. If only they were open 24 hours...Before you judge me, Panda Express is my guilty pleasure, and like all guilty pleasures, you're not too choosy after an all-nighter. I know Panda isn't real Chinese food, but nor is it Americanized Chinese; it's Panda. And since they're inexplicably hard to find on the East Coast, I lust after their chow mein once in a blue moon[1].[1] Yes, it's sad, I know.Even though the same basic types of alcohol are served in different bars, not all bars are the same. Some bars have bartenders with heavy hands and some don't. It can make or break the experience.Well, the same idea applies to chain cheap eateries such as Subway, Chipotle, and of course, Panda Express. Some servers have heavy hands and some don't. It can make or break the experience.Luckily, the staff here has (very) heavy hands. It made my day and broke the button on my slacks.This location is the closest if you're staying at MGM and Excalibur. The employees are friendly and the food is good. The prices are a little high here, but then again, this is Vegas for you.Cheers!

Review Text :
SanTan Brewery in downtown Chandler is a great place to enjoy fantastic beer at low prices. Opened in 2007 and located in historic downtown Chandler, SanTan occupies a former bank building where some artifacts were left intact. Stacks of safety deposit boxes have been re-purposed into seating and the old vault remains as an office for the pub.The open space is relaxed and comfortable, though with many hard surfaces it tends be on the noisy side. For a quieter experience, opt for one of the many seats on the patio, where there can be great people watching.Summer heat requires ice-cold beer. For me, beer is like enjoying a really good piece of bread. Grains and yeast that are mixed together to produce something that is so organic, hearty and satisfying.I tend to order dark beers, since I enjoy the deep robust flavors, and SanTan's Gordo Stout ($4.75) certainly fit the bill. With smooth notes of chocolate and coffee, this beer wasn't as heavy and belly filling as you might expect. The Gordo is one of the lowest alcohol content beer made here and, for me, one of the most flavorful.The menu at SanTan ranges from salads and pizzas to sandwiches and burgers, with most being $12 or less. There are so many tasty appetizers that it's easy to go a little crazy and order too many. The Downtown Sliders ($8), three juicy mini burgers topped with beer-braised onions and beer mustard, were way too easy to eat. The SanTan Stingers ($8.50) are wonton wrappers filled with Applewood-smoked bacon and spicy jack cheese, then deep friend for a light crispy crunch. Soft Pub Pretzels ($6.50) were were another good choice.As for entrees, the SanTan Ruben ($9) was piled high with juicy and flavorful corned beef, Swiss cheese, sauerkraut and Thousand Island dressing. The tender Rib-Eye Philly ($10.50) was wrapped in warm soft beer bread and packed with beef, peppers and onions, then slathered with house beer cheese. Each sandwich came with French fries that were worthy of their own plate.SanTan Brewery offers dessert, but you might want to learn from me and pace yourself.Going here reminded me of a How I Met Your Mother Episode...you know the one where Marshall scours all of New York City to find the restaurant where he had the best burger ever.Well, after I left San Tan Brewery, I hope I never forget this place like Marshall did, because it was here that I have had the best beef burger I have ever had. And this beats Joe's Farm Grill as well as all the other hole in the wall places I've prodded my way into. We ordered both the Stuffed Aegean Burger ($1!) and the Stuffed Mushroom Burger ($11). The Aaegean was the winner. It is a 1/2 pound of beef patty stuffed with cheese, basil, and kalamata olives. It is topped with feta cheese and pesto aioli. The second both my friend and I bit into it, we looked at each other and were like no way. It's that good. No, I can't describe it. Can you describe Da Vinci's Mona Lisa? No, you cannot. The best I can do is that it was like Katy Perry's song, "Firework" was coming to life in my oropharynx. The Stuffed Mushroom burger tempered my drive to give this place 5 stars. This is another 1/2 pound patty of beef stuffed with cheese & mushrooms topped that is topped with swiss and Gordo Stout braised mushrooms. Both burgers were ordered Medium Well, but it seemed like this one was well done. Definitely a good portion of melted cheese and mushrooms, but the burger overall seemed drier. The waitress was very helpful and attentive. The atmosphere was interesting. There was a group of 15 girls who had just got done with a dance recital that looked like clowns with all the makeup their moms had plastered over their faces....so definitely good entertainment value.Try the Aaegean burger. It's for your own good. P.S For your side, you can't go wrong with the house fries which are crispy and well seasoned or the jalepno cesar salad, which comes loaded with parm cheese, chopped tomatoes, croutons, and a hint of you guessed it - jalapenos.A shining beacon in downtown Chandler beckoning all drinkers and beer enthusiasts alike. My first trip here I experienced the winter warmer, the Thanksgiving seasonal weighing in at 9.5% ABV. Don't let the ginger snaps (served alongside the beer) fool you, this ginger-spiced ale will keep you warmed far into the night. Another beer worth trying all year-round is the Devil's Ale, one of their 'lighter' options. San Tan is a vibrant, energetic place. Recently, we sat on the patio admiring the lights adorning the shops and street. It was chilly out but the heaters were keeping us nice and toasty. Need something to go with your beer? The decent sized menu is sure offer something you'll like. For appetizers, try the hummus and pretzels, both big enough to share. Avoid the chips and dip. The Mac N Cheese burger was pretty incredible but they all sound really good.  After hearing about San Tan for years, I'm happy to call it one of my favorite bars in AZ.I have been to SanTan many times and have never penned a review, what the heck?? I have brought friends of from out of state here, been here for friends birthday celebrations, meeting up with friends for happy hour, well it doesn't take much of a reason for me to go, I just really like SanTan Brewing Company.Lets see for appetizer, you have to try the SanTan Slingers,  its smoked bacon, fresh jalapenos, pepper jack & cream cheese in a crisp eggroll with ranch & green onions for the dipping sauce, oh man it's the perfect blend of heat & creaminess. And the Soft Pub Pretzels, omg yum, yum, yum. Though most of the time I do wind up eating off the apps menu, I have enjoyed a burger or 2, I have to say my favorite is the Stuffed Green Chili Burger, burger stuffed with pepper jack cheese topped with roasted poblanos, grilled onions & melted pepper jack and added a side of their buttermilk onion rings, oh damn! SO GOOD!Throughout the year I bounce between the SunSpot Gold or Gordo Stout. The SunSpot is a beautiful blond ale that is just delish & crisp, perfect on a hot summer night here in the valley. When I want something more heaver I go with the Gordo Stout, hinted flavors of coffee & chocolate, it's the best of both worlds! Honestly you can't go wrong with any of the SanTan's beers. But during the winter season say hello to the Sex Panther Double Chocoalate Porter, a sexy smooth chocolate beer, oh man this is some good good stuff! Love it!SanTan is another great local brewery in the valley that has great food & great beer.I came here for lunch on a Thursday with co-workers for a team lunch. Nicely decorated brewery and very loud. What else would you expect. There were four parties of 10+ people so it was very busy which is a good sign that people like to come here. Even though there were so many people our server was all on top of us. Got our drinks out and took our orders in a timely fashion. I ordered one of their signature burgers. The Stuffed Bacon Cheese Burger with fries. Really good burger. Thick. Juicy. Just enough cheese oozing out with two thick pieces of bacon sticking out. Excellent burger. I also loved their beer battered fries. Really good. I got a side of ranch dressing to dip the fries. One of the best fries I've eaten. As for the service, I understand they had four huge parties and that's the reason it took a little longer to bring the food out. Everybody at the table enjoyed the food which was probably a first. The server also refilled out cups regularly. So service was really good, food was excellent, atmosphere was great (I didn't even want to go back to work). What else could you ask for. I'll probably be back. Enjoy.

My favorite Mexican food in town. It looks like a hole in the wall from the outside in a sketchy part of town, but inside you are greeted by a courteous and friendly staff. Everything we have tried have been packed with flavor and was very reasonably priced. I have tried their al pastor burrito enchilada style, fresh chips and guacamole, and camarones ala diabla.I cannot decide which I liked best...oh yeah, I can... their FRIED ICE CREAM! It was perfect. On our most recent visit we sampled their flan which was also great. On our first visit we overheard a table near us raving about the food, and the woman who brought out the food simply said "We make it the way we would at home". I think that pretty much sums up the food.This is our go to place for Mexican food, and whoever it was that compared this to Roberto's ought to have their head checked. I mean, I guess you can't beat the complementary side of e-coli at Roberto's.

Jacquee's Espresso is a delightful little deli hidden in the Two Renaissance Square Tower. Had it not been for a co-worker taking me on my first day of work, I doubt I'd have ever wandered in there on my own, but that's beside the point....The point is that Jacquee's rocks! Whatever you do, don't hate on Jacquee's. If you do and I'm around, I might just bust a ninja kick in your face. (But probably not...I rarely reveal my ninja skills outside my apartment.) I have been to Jacquee's at least once or twice a week for the last six months and I have zero complaints. They have scrumptious sandwiches, salads, soups, wraps, and cookies to die for, all big and soft like. I am a big fan of the sandwiches. Jacquee's makes the kind of sandwiches I would make for myself at home if I wasn't so lazy. Boar's head meats, hearty breads, and vegetables so fresh they make me wonder why I ever slum it at Subway/Blimpies/Quizno's.So basically, in essence, on the whole, the point I am trying to make, to get across, to fundamentally express is that if you work downtown and have not been to Jacquee's for lunch yet, you are going tomorrow (or today if you are reading this in the a.m.). I feel I have done my civic duty by writing this review! Then again, maybe I should have kept Jacquee's a secret so the lines aren't so long....

We were in the hood and decided to to pop in. I'm rarely in the mood for pizza, but it sounded great today. We were gravitating towards a white pizza, but the lady helping us sold us on how good the deep dish is that we decided we can wait the 45 minutes for one (if you know that's what you want- call it in and drive on over there so you're not sitting there forever) , talk and nosh on a app. She told us about different specials not on the menu so we took up the special large deepdish with 2 toppings at $15 and some change instead of it's normal price (I believe about $22). We got ours with spinach and beef....think of it like a pizza lasagna!  If your server doesn't tell you ask specials- ask because she named off a few. The BF was feeling the fried zucchini ($6.95) for our app and I like that it was thin slices so you get a lot of crumb crust. I normally dip in ranch, but that marinara was off the hook so fo'getta abou' ranch! Our server brought us hot bread and though I love me some balsamic and oil, I sopped the rest of the marinara up. Once it came, I was so hungry, yet I only ate 1 and 1/4 a slice. It hits like a brick! The crust is consistently crunchy throughout and the fillings are all quality. We heard our lady chatting with the table behind me and they were talking about Chicago and where they grew up to see if they were neighbors or something so you know that they're definitely legit people here too. She was very sweet, checked on us often and we never had to ask for a drink refill.I'm not much for a pizza person, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. Definitely I think if I have a hankering for pizza again, I'll keep this place on the short list!Decided to finally give this place a try.  It's been on my To Do List for a while now.  The menu is extensive and appetizing......I couldn't make up my mind.  Good thing our server, Rosemary, helped us out.  She pointed out that they had a $4.95 lunch menu and that I should try one of those items.  I looked at the lunch menu and decided for that price I'd order 2 items!I ordered the 1 Topping Thin Crust Personal Pizza w/Sausage ($4.95) and an Italian Beef Sandwich w/Fries ($4.95) with a side of Hot Giardiniera ($.50).The food came out after a short wait.  I went for the Beef Sandwich first.....dipped it in a little Au Jus and added some Giardiniera.....after one bite, I WAS HOOKED!  This is some seriously good Chicago style Beef!  I'm sooo glad I ordered it!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8olG8J91NG_QU92WHG5QfA?select=AxzEEvoOb0DEaYNr8YaiVgThe Fries were pretty good....they're Crinkle Cut Fries and had the perfect amount of Salt added to it.Next up was the Sausage Pizza.  I ordered it 'well done' because I prefer my Pizza that way.  They obliged and it came out perfectly!  The Crust was nice and crispy and the Sausage was AMAZING!  Another score!  It reminded me of Fox's Pizza in the Southside of Chicago when my friend took me there.  The size of the Pizza is pretty good too for $4.95!  I'd guess it's around a 10" Pizza.  I was expecting something smaller....it exceeded my expectations.Overall, it was an awesome lunch.....good food and good times!  Rosemary, our server, was amazing and friendly.  I love going to places like this where people actually care about their customers.I can't wait to go back and try their Stuffed Pizza, Deep Dish Pizza, Chicago Hot Dog, and many many more things I saw on the menu!Return Factor - 100%Dare I say that I like Amore's deep dish pizza even better than the pizza I had in Chicago? No need to hop on a plane to go all the way to Gino's when we have Amore Taste of Chicago here in Vegas. My favorite thing about it... It's hard to narrow it down to only one so here's a few. Their sauce is so flavorful and made from real crushed tomatoes. The ingredients are extremely fresh. Their thick crunchy cornmeal crust is never oily. Every time I have ordered from here, my pizza has been perfectly cooked. I love this pizza! I'm just mad that I tried it because now I'm hooked and I'm going to get fat. When I become too out of shape and have to give up modeling because of this guys, I blame Amore! It's all their fault! Don't say I didn't warn you. ;)I have never been to Chicago so I can't vouch for the authentic taste but I know good food when I taste it! I started off with the Bruschetta that had fresh tomato and garlic over toasty bread. I like that they didn't drench it with olive oil because I don't like when the bread gets soggy. It was perfectly delicious!  Lately I've been obsessed with artichokes so I was happy to find their White Pizza. I ended up ordering the small 10" pizza for $13.50. The tasty pizza also had artichokes, spinach, garlic, mozzarella with drizzled olive oil.  The cheese was gooey just how I like it! I ended the meal with the Fried Dough for dessert. The warm dough was sprinkled with powdered sugar and trickled with honey. When I thought I couldn't eat any more I found room for these little bits of sweetness. The atmosphere is nice and cozy. The tables have different scenes of Las Vegas on them and the walls are decorated with celebrity, sports and Chicago memorabilia. It's a nice place to meet with friends and family because the service was also very welcoming. My drink never went empty the whole time I was there!After reading Nelson and Sylvia Q.'s reviews of Amore TOC and seeing pics, I resolved to go here and sample authentic Chicago-style deep dish pizza pie.  And, after ordering a medium Pepperoni & Mushroom deep dish pie for myself, what I learned is that what is served here really is not just pizza--but extremely filling pizza PIE!  There's plenty of filling, and the cheesy and saucy gooeyness tasted great, but there is also a great deal of almost inch high and high-backed cornmeal crust to these pizzas.  After eating a large cup of homemade Minestrone Soup and an excellent House Salad with lettuce, tomato, white cucumber, pepperoncini, mozzarella, croutons, and a zesty Italian Dressing that also turned out to be large in size, plus 2 small pieces of Diane's thin-crust Canadian Bacon & Cashews Pizza with Extra Cheese, I could only finish 3 slices of my pie before calling it a night.  And after giving away 2 slices to friends who had to cancel going out with us to Amore the last minute because of a sudden air conditioning leak, the following evening after downing another salad I was again barely able to eat the remaining 3 slices at home for dinner.  The deep dish slices were formidable, but they were really good: cheesy, saucy in a sweet way, and with a buttery crust that was not charred in the least.  What I also found to be remarkable is the consistency of Amore's deep dish pies.  Every one I saw being transported through the dining room looked perfect--with a golden crust and a smoking, piping hot center.  Although not as remarkable, I liked the taste of the thin-crust pizza as well, which was very cheesy and flavorful, but its crust is more of a cracker consistency like one will be likely to find in Rome.  The Minestrone Soup deserves mention in its own right, for it was first class.  Very hot, it sported pieces of carrots, Italian beans, bits of tomato, cubes of potato, and Ditalini pasta in a hearty stew-like broth.  And, the mozzarella-laced House Salad was very good, too.            Rosemary and Joey were great, friendly hosts who, despite never seeing either of us before, made us feel welcome, and seated us right away in a crowded room.  Our server, too, was very attentive.  I came for deep dish pizza, and found it to be every bit as good as Chicago's Uno, Due, and Gino's, all of which I have previously enjoyed in the Windy City.  But the next time I come here--which I expect will be soon--I am going to try some of the other great-looking Italian dishes I saw pass by on their way to other diners, such as Shrimp Francaise and a Sausage & Pepper Platter.  This is clearly not a one note eatery!It pains me extremely to give Amore only 3 stars!!  We have been going to/ordering from here very often for over a year, even when I was diagnosed with Celiac and had to go gluten-free. I waited patiently only ordering Chicken Vesuvio, until they recently started carrying gluten-free products.  Now I realize when ordering in I take the risk of being contaminated, but thankfully not only am I very aware  but as well am a bit paranoid...  I have never had a problem ordering from there gluten or otherwise, until tonight!!  I ordered gluten-free pasta and received the complete opposite in WHEAT!!  I called questioning and it was treated nonchalantly as if a pizza arrived with wrong toppings rather than the fact I was almost poisoned, which would land me in the hospital immediately...  Not only were they completely flippant about what just happened,. I even needed to be the one to bring up about being refunded!  After a brief verbal brawl I finally just gave the phone back to the delivery guy, since he was yelling for it back, he gave us our refund and I handed him back the re-made meal, there was no way I was eating their food ever again!As I said before, I hate deducting stars from a place I love so much but if them giving me wheat pasta wasn't bad enough they showed little to no remorse to a VERY FREQUENT customer!!  Not cool!!  Not to mention even if  it didn't work out for me to eat there again and feel comfortable, I have a very hungry boyfriend whose always enjoyed the taste of their foodlll Until the truth of their personalities came out!UPDATE: This review has gone down to 1 star after being treated in such a POOR manner by the manager/owner.  He truly lost me as a customer when he said "I only ordered this stuff for YOU POEOPLE."  And continued on stating that he would take if off if he could.  I have never thought the bigotry I would endure in life would be because of an illness which limits what I can eat!  Shame on this place!  I could have become seriously ill from their mistake and his only response was a chuckle saying, "What, am I supposed to sign off on all Gluten-Free items that leave the kitchen?"  No Jackhole, you are supposed to educate your staff when you take on the responsibility of serving a very large community of people who are doing this not by choice but for survival!I am never going to be the same person again since Yelp came into my life! If you are a "Avid Yelper" it's like a religious revelation..Hallelujah! CAN I GET AMEN BROTHERS!  *AMEN!!* Lets Eat!!Having bookmarked ATC for six months prior to my trip,Amore Taste of Chicago is a place that I made a point to stop at!.Being deprived in Hawaii (Note: Chi-Town Deep Dish Pizza Co in Hawaii isn't even close to this)and not plan on visiting Chicago in the near future. We set out our journey to find ATC. The drive was not bad from downtown and willing to do anything or drive anywhere I didn't care...Arriving to ATC I was very very excited!  Finally my wait is over!..Walking in...I just LOVED the interior of this place,with all the pictures of Chicago Sports Greats and Celebrities that filled the walls.It just puts you in the mood for whats to come next.. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8olG8J91NG_QU92WHG5QfA#L6-nCU2crqXwISzmLaB0WQWe order:*Reg house salad which includes fresh mozzarella cheese. The salad could feed 4 people easily. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8olG8J91NG_QU92WHG5QfA#TfxXspSgSZ6bJ5xaD--raA*Chicago Style Deep Dish 14" with Sausage and Pepperoni pie http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8olG8J91NG_QU92WHG5QfA#TuP3Fgf3fxeEFut83VA3xwI was just in awe to seeing our server Rosemary scoop the first slice out of that thick beautiful pie. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8olG8J91NG_QU92WHG5QfA#5hE8XUhSbkfC52cWsjVHvQ  The thickness of the slice,fresh tomato sauce and melting cheese oozing out was just an awesome site to see.Funny how digging into a pizza with a fork and knife never felt so right. The first thing that hits you is the great the flavor of the fresh tomatoes bursting when it hits your palate,spiciness of the sausage and pepperoni,Oh My God How Buttery The Crust Is...OMG! I just had a Foodgasm!Our friend who had just returned from Chicago the previously week also was enjoying the pizza with us remarked it was like being in Chicago again!Our server Rosemary was so friendly and helpful with all my questions I asked.Rosemary: Where are you all from?Me: Hawaii !Rosemary: From Hawaii? *With a surprised look* How did you find us?Me: Yelp!  ATC has some great reviews and I had to try great deep dish pizza! (Thank You all my LV Yelp friends!)Just some helpful information:*The normal wait for a Deep Dish is 45minutes*You can call ahead for seating and pre-order your pie. It will cut down the waiting time. http://www.amoretasteofchicago.com/*Located in Parkview Plaza.Big Mahalos! To ATOC and Rosemary for the great Deep Dish Experience!I finally got the chance to try Amore's deep dish pizza. A little pre planning was involved because I knew that it would take about 40 minutes to prepare. I called in my order before we left just so we wouldn't have to wait so long. We came in and ordered some cheesey bacon fries while we waited for our order. We both ordered cokes but they were still cleaning their machine so they offered us some canned coke instead. It was nice that they didn't make us choose another soda flavor.Our pizza was ready once we finished the fries. The sauce had just the right amount of sweetness to it. The cheese was also nice and gooey. The slices are big! One piece would be sufficient for a meal. We were really satisfied with the pizza!Admittedly I was unable to actually eat here but my review might explain...We arrived about 7pm to a pretty full restaurant, good sign that a good meal is ahead.  Although there is no sign asking us to wait or seat ourselves, we wait up front to be be sure.  After about 5 minutes we decided it must be seat yourself as not one person from the staff, who eyed us several times, approaches us to help.  As I head for one of the three empty tables, a man appears out of the kitchen and says "Can I help you?"  Sure I reply, we'd like a seat.  He replies, "Well sit up front and wait, there are no tables", quickly followed by "did you call ahead? Everybody knows to call ahead, we're a busy place"It's at that point we decide to liberate ourselves from the rudeness and eat elsewhere.  I'm sorry I didn't know the Amore rules, perhaps they should post them somewhere.  I'm happy they are so successful but I do draw the line at treating your customers rudely because you're busy.I came here for dinner with some friends the other night to try out the much talked about stuffed pizza served here. Walking in we were greeted and taken to a table. The place was half full and had a good vibe. The walls are lined with memories of Chicago, celebrity pictures and yes, I even heard a songs by Chicago while eating LOL! There were several TVs playing various Chicago games as well.After ordering a "1/2 cheese & 1/2 Sausage Stuffed Pizza" (large) priced at $19.50 our server told us that it would take about 45 minutes to make so I ordered "Cheesy Garlic Bread" priced at $3.95 to grub on while the pizza was made. The cheesy garlic bread tasted good, but average. While waiting for the pizza I observed a couple different things going on. There was some sort of celebration with he staff because they all gathered to eat a ice cream cake (didn't look like spumoni to me!) and then there was the couple who got engaged. Yep, after they finished eating, he pulled out a ring and proposed. I don't know if this was where they had a first date or what, but it was interesting! Now let me get to the pizza. When our server (friendly and courteous) brought it to the table I was very excited. It looked so good! This was one cheesy, saucy, good kind of mess! The sauce is very sweet, I actually liked it, but if you aren't a fan of sweet sauces you might not like it. I used a fork to get every last tomato off my plate. The crust is supposed to have a buttery flavor however I didn't taste that. It was more doughy tasting, but certainly edible. I am usually just a cheese pizza kind of girl, but next time I would get a couple toppings to help balance the amount of cheese in the pizza. There was something about the crust that was just not right though. Windy City still puts out the best Deep Dish in my opinion. my husband thought the pizza here was very good, but he also thinks Pizza Hut is good. Enough said. Out front they have benches if you want to eat outside. Besides pizza you can choose from different pastas, salads, sandwiches and dessert. Catering is available.The pizza. That is all you need to come here for. My wife and I met some friends here for dinner and shared a stuffed pizza. Half was sausage and half was cheese. The amount of cheese that was in our pizza was insanely good. The sauce was real good and even with all the sauce and cheese the pizza still had a crisp crust. We also had some garlic cheese bread that was cheesy like the pizza but just okay. Our waitress was cool and checked on us enough. The stuffed pizza takes 45 minutes so call ahead or plan to hang.My family loves Italian food, loves it SO much that I rarely eat out at Italian spots because I've had a lifetime's fill of it (and the hips to prove it). So, when the family decided it was time to go out to eat, the majority voted for Italian and I let out a "BOO!" accompied with a pouty-face. When Olive Garden was suggested, I quickly re-routed the decision and we landed at ATC. It was a busy parking lot and my grandmother is O2 dependent and uses a walker. Since the place has huge windows, the manager saw this and opened a side door for us. This set the tone for the wonderful service we would receive throughout the night.We were seated right away, a waitress came over, took our drink order and handed us menus. The menu is extensive. Tons of pasta dishes, soups, salads, sandwiches, meats, pizzas, and house specialities. Pizzas take about 40 minutes to make so we passed. There is also a separate pizza counter for people placing to-go orders or who opted for pick up.Drinks came out with the quickness as well as the perfect crusty homemade italian bread. Freshly baked, crunchy on the outside, soft in the middle. We each ordered a cup of the soup (minestrone) and needed a bit longer to peruse the menu. Minestrone was great. A lot veggies, homemade, and it had a little, tiny kick to it. Bravo! Never tasted a soup like this before.I've recently broken up with gluten. So I was stoked to see gluten free pasta available. I ordered gluten-free pasta and asked for a spicy arrabiata. It was awesome garlicky, flavorful, and packed heat.Other dishes were sausage and peppers, with smacks of gardeny fresh peppers, mild Italian sausage and excellently balanced sauce. The baked rigatoni was also excellent and came with a massive amount mozzarella cheese. So heavenly sinful! (Did I just make an oxymoron, uh...) Our servers worked in a team effort, drinks were full, we never left wanting or waiting. The owner stopped by our table to see how everything was and told us about his establishment. I'm always way impressed when I see a hands on approach.I love that there is a quality, decently priced, casual Italian place in my next of the woods. When I am feeling some sort of self-hate, I'm going to get all up in that deep dish. I think we'll be instant besties (damn you, gluten).I'm totally in Amore with Amore and love is never wrong.Ive been wanting to check out Amore and finally came in for dinner and  tried the deep dish Chicago style pizza.  Parking was no hassle since its located in a large retail  center.  I took the suggestions from other yelpers and called in my order a head of time. The pizza wasn't ready after being seated so I ordered an appetizer of shrimp scampi - served with garlic bread. The shrimps were deveined, whole and yummy. When the pizza arrived I was taken back of the thickness and contained homemade sausage, mushrooms and the chunks of tomatoes that were sweet and delicious. The pizza was packed with quality ingredients and the dough was thick but not overly cooked. I ended picking off of three slices all the ingredients and passed on the ends of the crust. Overall a positive experience here with friendly waitresses who were service oriented! As for the pizza I'm torn between being fan of regular or deep dish. I guess if both were in front of me I would indulge in either or!Campy at BEST! Don't expect a comp or ANY discount here...WAS good...NOT good anymore...Changed ingredients...It appears the Owner is unappreciative that he's still in business. Maybe cutting corners now...???For all the pizza "Knowers" out there, if you spend your money on a pie from here....you'll have wished you searched yelp for other joints...you can take THAT to the BANK! Good luck WE DO NOT Recommend AMORES to anyone....anymore.My first time at Amore was far from a positive one. As suggested by several reviews, I called ahead to have a deep dish put in for us to dine in later. They told us it would take about 45 minutes to get done, which we expected, so we showed up about 30 minutes in to make sure we didn't get cold food. Well, we ended up getting a cold pizza anyway, and even worse, there was hair in it. When we told our waitress, she acted like there was no way it could have happened and made excuses. To be fair, they offered to make a new pizza, but I sure didn't want to wait there another 45 minutes, and I honestly don't know who would.Before I found the hair, I still can't say I agree that the deep dish is the best out there. I definitely wouldn't recommend sitting in the place for 45 minutes to wait for it to come out either. Maybe it's because mine was cold and I didn't get the full effect, but I just wasn't a huge fan. There was very little flavor to it, the cheese not being hot and melty wasn't ideal, and the dough felt undercooked. As a whole, it just wasn't right and was really disappointing after hearing how great it's supposed to be.About the only thing I enjoyed on my first visit were the appetizers we ordered. Both the Fried Ravioli and Bruschetta were simple but delicious, and I'd recommend trying either.Against my better judgement, we came back here for a second time...more because it's one of the wifeys favorite spots. This time around, almost everything was much better. Our waitress was extremely nice, had our drinks refilled quickly, and it was overall just a much better experience. I couldn't bring myself to order another deep dish, so this time around I tried something new with the Sausage and Peppers Platter...I'm actually really surprised to see this isn't talked about more in reviews. It's literally served on a platter with a pretty healthy portion of sausage, peppers, potatoes and onions. The sausage is a nice coarse ground Italian sausage that is cooked perfect, and has just the right amount of spice. Both the peppers and onions were nicely done with still a little bit of crispness and not soggy at all. But what really makes this dish even better is the white wine sauce it's made with. It's absolutely delicious, and everything really soaks in all the flavors from it. Even after I was stuffed from eating it all, I couldn't help but grabbing some of their basket bread and dipping it in the sauce...it really is that good!Had I reviewed Amore the first time around, it definitely would have been a 1 star review. There really isn't much that I hate more than finding stuff in my food, and usually I wouldn't even go back after I do, especially if it's hair. But I gotta give credit where credits due. The Sausage and Peppers Platter alone is worth coming here for. And if we were to come back with someone who wanted a deep dish, I'd probably give it another shot. I just wouldn't order it again on my own, and with it being one of their signature items, that says a lot.Overall though, Amore is "A-OK"!Items Selected:Thin Crust - Half Cheese, Half PepperoniDeep Dish - Sausage and MushroomCannoliSaid by some to be the best Chicago Style Pizzeria in Sin City, or perhaps just the one most decked-out in Windy City swag, it was for lunch on Saturday that a party of three stopped in to Amore Taste of Chicago and inhabiting a table in front of a mural of the 2013 Blackhawks a 'taste' of two pizzas plus a pair of Cannolis was fine, if not memorable - certainly not a spot worth going out of the way for unless one is completely inexperienced or overly curious to verify whether the rumors are true.More sizable than one would gather from the exterior and brighter than many places of its ilk as a result of large windows exposed to the strip-mall parking lot out front, it was to an empty dining room that we arrived as doors clicked open and remaining that way throughout the duration of our 60 minute stay the service was expectedly attentive, pies requested to be delivered as completed with thin crust presented after a mere ten minute wait.Admittedly benefited by a Midwestern upbringing, not to mention a sister who lives minutes from Wicker Park, suffice it to say that the circle cut into rectangles was far less novel to me than it may be to others while tomato sauce seemingly straight from a can did little to improve rather flavorless crust, the mozzarella not particularly impressive either while Pepperoni was the typical oily store-bought stuff.Not really expecting much from the deep-dish considering the overall quality of the traditional pie it was with a medium-thick version removed from the pan and served atop cardboard that the meal progressed, the same ingredient quality generally marring crust that would have been better off with more butter left to caramelize though the sausage and mushrooms were a touch more successful than pepperoni  as toppings, each cannoli perfectly serviceable with a shattering shell filled to order, though  far from the best available in town.**Generally not the sort to assume that Las Vegas should meet or exceed the quality of signature dishes from cities a thousand or so miles away, Amore Taste of Chicago simply is not as good as any of the classics offered within the confines of The Second City, a more substantial search necessary to see if it is even the best in the (702.)

Review Text :
I can't say enough about this place. I love to get lunch there, and leave with stuff to-go. They have some incredible home-made olives with different spices. I am an olive snob and can't say enough about them. You can also get hummus and baba ghanooj to go, as well as their freshly made (they are a bakery) pitas.  They also have some interesting mixes, canned beans, etc. They have a lot of Sadaf products which is cool because I used to actually mail order from them once in a while! On the lunch side, I love all their vegetarian food and often get a vegetarian platter or falafel sandwich or plate, etc. Their tabouli is out of this world good - lots of fresh mint and parsley, lemon juice, it's perfect if you are into the Lebanese taste. I've never ordered meat there but I've seen other people order it and it looked great. The food is delicious and home made tasting. Their baklava is superb. Split some with your lunch mate. If I were to succinctly describe their food it is fresh, healthy, authentic, and delicious. I gave it 5 stars. Not 5 stars like a fine dining type restaurant - 5 stars because they do their type of ethnic food with unfailing perfection and authenticity and consistency across multiple visits. Middle Eastern Bakery is keepin it REAL yo! ( blatant fishing for cool ratings!)Creeping senility: I thought I'd reviewed this place in 2005. The public area is probably about 600 square feet, but every inch is jammed with Fertile Crescent / Mediterranean goodness.This is a bakery, restaurant, and grocery. The restaurant part of the operation has a an extensive menu of flesh-based and vegetarian options. There are plates, salads, and sandwiches. The plates (kebabs, gyros, etc,.) usually come with a decadent rice pilaf, your choice of tabbouleh or Greek salad, and tsatsiki. There are a few grilled chicken dishes, and the chicken is always moist with a nice char.MEB&D also bottles its own spices. Not as diverse as Penzey's, but it's nice to have an option on 16th St. Hat tip to Adam M. on the olives -- they're delicious.Dessert? They serve different forms of baklava, turkish coffee, and homemade halvah (they'll slice off a piece with a scimitar-looking blade for a sample -- impress your friends!).Tips:- You can buy Greek tobacco soap.- The soup of the day is always avgolemono. It always will be until the mountains crumble and our love is through. Sometimes there's an excellent red lentil as a second option. - They have great par-cooked or reheatable stuff  -- it's in the frozen section.- MEB&D is an effective and affordable option to cater a party on short notice (I've done this).IMO the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. The components are all four-star, but the place gets the fifth for the "park-once, enjoy-many" experience.Had a great lunch here with my friends Sherry and Brandon. The two owners (I am guessing here, but father and son?) were very friendly and attentive. I had the baba ganouj pita with lettuce and tomato, and everyone else's food looked great (a chicken pita sandwhich and amazing looking lentil soup). I was throroughly entertained by a middle eastern television show (satellite I guess?), and the great mix of locals and business people. The market section is also great- you'll find loads of bottled cooking oils, spices, pickles and other pickled veggies, canned eggplant, cous cous and pastas, as well a fridge section with nice looking prepared foods. Will definitely return!The only thing that saved this from two stars was the baba ganoush and Gabi!  We shared a plate of the baba and hummus.  Covered with veggies and olive oil.  This was better than my actual lunch, which was a small Greek salad.  Uh...Greek????  It was romaine lettuce, a few chopped red peppers and purple onion slices with...Italian dressing.  Read: tasted just like WishBone.  Seriously.  I was disappointed, because I've read the reviews.  Maybe I just need to try other stuff.  It had a store inside, too, but I didn't have much time to check the shelves.Oh, and they pushed the lemonade BIG TIME!  Neither one of us wanted  it, but they did give us a free cup of it.  It was pretty good!I'll go again.I'm being on the generous side in giving MEBAD (as I've seen others refer to this place) 4 stars...It's kind of a unique gem that you don't see anymore with the owner at the register and a slamming lunch business in addition to the grocery items for sale that are rare foods, snacks, and ingredients from the Middle East.  I suggested this place for lunch with Amy D today after reading about it on Yelp awhile back... so happy I finally made it there myself!As Amy said in her review, we shared the baba ganoush and hummus plate and we each ordered a Greek Salad.  The salad was decent but nothing special, but the baba and hummus with the whole wheat pita was so damn tasty that we didn't even leave a bite.The free cup of homemade daily lemonade was a perk and the owner was really sweet... and I really did like the flavor of it.  I happen to love lemonade!I'll for sure return to MEBAD when I'm in the area to try more from their menu... this is the kind of place you want people to know about since you can tell how much work the owner and staff put into it each day.  If you haven't been, stop by... maybe I'll see you there - but please don't ask me to share my baba ganoush and hummus with you - I'm ordering my own next time!After living downtown a while now I had to come to think I'd never find a rebound for Haji Baba, I grew despondent and longed for their market and cheap delicious food, on the light rail rides that brought me to Haji Baba my mouth would water as I anticipated my falafel and hummus and favorite confections. I became resigned and assumed I'd just have to make the long trek down there every time the hunger struck.Then as fate would have it the "Middle Eastern Bakery & Deli" caught my eye, luring me in with the hint of what treasures I might find inside.Not only am I over you Haji Baba, I'm thriving, you see I've found a place that is probably better for me than you'd ever be. So with that in mind, and some appropriate mood music let me give a litany of reasons why i promise to love you complete Middle Eastern Bakery and Deli:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFIOu2sYxoc-your falafel is delicious, it is probably the best I've ever had, and for a few bucks you can buy a plate of them, appropriately tiny and crispy golden and crunchy on the outside and warm soft and flavourful on the inside. with tzatziki sauce or some warm hummus and soft pita they make a perfect meal.-your bakery and deli is so welcoming and comfortable and merely a short bike ride away from my place of residence-your prices are so reasonable i almost feel guilty..-your baked goods and confections and broad selection of middle eastern delicacies is heart warming to me.-and your lemonade! lordy. probably the best i've ever had, and i dont just say that about every piece of lemonade i've bagged.-your owners are so kind and welcoming, they make you feel right at home. ;^)i love middle eastern bakery and deli, and despite the generic name it is what it purports to be, and that's a quality that is becoming increasingly rare.Stop. Hummus time. That's right. This grocery story slash eatery is a perfect for for all your Mediterranean needs. If you're looking for items to purchase and take on the go, they have everything imaginable, hummus, pitas, meats, canned goods... Just about everything! However you can also dine in an order some of their delicious homemade food. I enjoyed the chicken kabobs accompanied with hummus and a greek salad. The meal was filling and fabulous. The hummus had a lot of flavor and the chicken was perfectly seasoned. I will definitely be returning to enjoy more and take some goodies for the road.

I think the best way to describe this place is consistent, fresh and clean eating. Nothing here is overly greasy, everything feels light enough that this isn't your guilty meal spot. If you have dietary restrictions or are gluten free, vegan, etc, they are very accommodating. There aren't many places up here I would say you could eat fresh, and this is a nice solitude. This used to be in the Centennial shopping in a small space, but they've upgraded to a sit down service restaurant just up the road. I much prefer it here since you're not bumping chairs with the table behind you. I didn't mind getting up to get my own drink and all before, but now they have servers here which makes sense for the space.I have tried a few things on the menu, but I normally get the same things. With entrees you can go a la carte with just rice or a combo has with salad, pita and tzatziki or hummus. Their rice is seasoned and soft, the hummus is more liquidy and plainer than I like but I do like their tzatziki. Pomegranate chicken is always cooked right and juicy. Greek Trio has moussaka, patstitsio, spanakopita. I think overall those are decent versions, but moussaka is my favorite of the 3.Gyro plate/Vasilios plate gyros are soft and never dried out, comes with rice, salad, pita, tzatziki and hummus already. Gyro pizza is different, but good! Think of it as like a open faced gyro sandwich with tomato sauce as a base.  Combination platter is a appetizer but makes for a good vegetarian meal too with hummus, babaganoush, salad, lots of pita, and some falafel. I think their falafel here is just okay, they are sort've dense when I prefer a fluffier and moist inside.Their cheesecake here is surprisingly good. They do a baklava crust instead of graham cracker so that little bit does it over the top. I get the pumpkin cheesecake usually. Baklava is decent, but not my favorite in town. People who work here are pretty friendly and generally attentive. It's a  family owned business and I like to support our locals.

Review Text :
My lovely daughter Whitney wanted to take me to the movies today.It was delightful to get a chance to put on my Tuesday best and head out into the mean streets of Old Town Scottsdale for lunch and a matinee!It was Taco Tuesday so my thoughts naturally turned to Cien Agaves Tacos and Tequila.The name, Cien Agaves means "one hundred, green, spiny plants" but I suspect there is more to the name than that...they also sell tequila...lots and lots of tequila. In fact, they sell more the one hundred kinds of tequila...a wide selection of various types and quality of tequilas that range all the way from the stuff they siphon out of the gas tank of a 1978 Toyota pick-up truck in Nogales to tequila that was, evidently, made from platinum plated agaves (at least if the price of a shot is to be believed).They even have a "tequila club"...nice! I used to belong to a "tequila club" when I was young and bulletproof...I would drink "tequila" (or agaves, as they call it here) until they (whoever "they" are) needed a club to get me back under control...I could literally fly under the influence of crazy juice:)I decided not rejoin Cien Agaves tequila club...you should all be thanking your lucky stars:)I hadn't been to Cien Agaves for quite a while and I am glad my sweet daughter took me there for lunch today (a euphemism...dear old dad bought, but I like to think of that as my privilege:)No tequila today...no, it was taco Tuesday! $1.00 shredded beef tacos and $2.00 Tecate cerveza's all day long! That's what we were there to try!So we stocked up on $1.00 tacos for lunch, right? Of course not, don't be silly...dad was buying:)We had exactly 1 shredded beef taco (which was tasty, BTW). We had lobster tacos...(ok, but pretty salty...and if I think it was salty... baby, it was salty) we had veggie tacos, we had rice and beans. Most everything was OK to tasty and sent us off to the movies in fine style. The service was prompt and friendly, even though Cien Agaves was absolutely jam-packed during the lunch hour. I had no idea so many people wanted a full rack of $1.00 tacos!Next time, I am going to see if I can eat $5.00 worth of Taco Tuesday tacos...I could do it when I was in the tequila club:)I had a lunch with some friends over $1 tacos.  The scenery, the tacos, the grease...all good.  $1 fried tacos were well worth every penny.  Crispy fried tacos.  Not an every day indulgence but tasty nonetheless.The place has a bit of a funky atmosphere, the service was very good.  I would return for Tuesday $1 Tacos.I am betting Cien Agaves is pretty busy on Friday & Saturday nights.Did I mention the $1 tacos were fried?  Very filling.  That was the first time I've had fried tacos.  And I thought tacos were nearly a perfect food.I missed trying the ceviche that Cien Agaves served at Yelp in Bloom, so when I was invited to go to Cien Agaves for a friend's birthday dinner this past Friday night, I was excited to check it out!The birthday boy made a reservation for 8pm, and when we arrived fashionably late (thanks to my husband), the rest of our group (approximately 15 people) were already seated, eating chips and salsa, and drinking margaritas.  We caught up pretty quickly thanks to Lindsay, our waitress - I had a margarita made with Vodka and J went with a beer.  The food was decent.  I think the 3.5 star average is right on... I split shrimp fajitas with J and shared in the guacamole, nachos, and a few other apps that the table had.  The guys that ordered the special ahi tacos really enjoyed them.  I have yet to try the ceviche and I may even go for the tequila margarita next visit, but I'd for sure return to Cien Agaves in the future.  Two drinks was all I needed and I was done for the night.  Happy hour anyone?!I can appreciate a good happy hour, and Cien Agaves certainly has a muy bueno one.While I didn't come on Taco Tuesday (which I should have for their $1 tacos and $2 Tecates), I did come for Margarita Monday (ok, I made that up - margaritas here are a must every day of the week). We came in before their daily happy hour ended at 7pm and enjoyed some awesome house margies for half price - $3.50! And these suckers were pretty big too. Food was delicioso. I had a carnitas burrito and went with our server's rec to get it enchilada style and got the spicy red sauce. I'm glad I did, because it was so good wet (hmm, TWHS). Their signature chicken fajitas were really tasty as well. Entrees were so big that I couldn't imagine getting any appetizers or dessert - although an after dinner shot of tequila? Si, senor! Obviously, they had a list of cien tequilas on their menu. As much as I love Clase Azul, we decided to get shots of Milagro Anejo and saved ourselves $400.All in all, a fun spot in Old Town Scottsdale to get your Mex fix!I'm craving a Tinga taco just writing this review.  I love Cien Agaves' tacos!  You can order them individually, as part of a meal with beans and rice, or a platter of 10 for $35.  Pork, carne asada, chicken, potato, lobster..you name it, they have it.  Whether you like mild or spicy, are not a meat eater, whatever... You'll find the perfect taco for you.Their patio is basically a narrow walkway with wobbly tables.  That's the only negative here in my book.This place ROCKS! I've been here plenty of times before, but this experience from last Friday night was outstanding. We took my mom here for her birthday dinner. We called in for reservations & to see if we could reserve a booth 2 HOURS BEFORE we were going to go there- they said no problem! Upon arrival, we were seated at a reserved booth and our server, Diana N., spared no time to come and get our drink order! Let me just say, Diana N. made my mom's birthday extra awesome! She was a fantastic server and went above and beyond. She even gave us an amazing churro/icecream birthday dessert (I doubt they do that for everyone).  We definitely will be going back soon!

Review Text :
Old school Italian restaurant located on the first floor of a Central Ave. high rise, Alexi's delivers great food with great service. The room is nicely appointed (nicely appointed?...who says things like that?), comfortable and really reminds me of an upper westside NYC restaurant. Pasta pomodoro, shrimp parmigiana, minestrone soup, house salad all dee lish. It reminds of an NYC restaurant. Hostess in a tight dress. Waitresses all with big hair. Older waiters, follicly challenged and oddly all with moustaches. Naked Cowboy on the sidewalk. Ok, maybe not THE naked cowboy. But one day I did see a cowboy type with daisy dukes and a muscle shirt that read "My belt buckle's bigger than yours". Hmmm. Anyway, the clientele seems to be older Scottsdale type, women in furs and men with furry backs, who dare to venture into Central Phoenix. Me? I show up in my board shorts, Hello Kitty flip flops and a muscle shirt that says "My debt is bigger than yours". ENJOY yelpers!I used to travel to Phoenix for work, which was one of the benefits of that job.  This restaurant in downtown Phoenix came highly recommended by several of the secretaries I was working with and since it was in walking distance of the office, I decided to give it a try.  To be totally honest, it sucked.  Complimentary bread and soup was served for starters.  The bread was stale and I've had better soup out of a can.  The server was so busy flirting with the tall and very tanned ladies at the table next to me to pay much attention to the rest of his customers.  He spent a good deal of the time ignoring me; I was constantly having to ask him for things I shouldn't have to ask for--such as a fork or a drink.  The menu is pretty extensive; though low on the veggie options.  I chose the bowtie pasta with veggies.  It was carrots, zucchini and peppers in a light herb sauce which was bland and served just barely warm.  Very disappointing!  Due to the slow service of the flirty waiter, I was there far longer than an hour and got back to work late, out about $15 and still hungry.  Don't waste your time!

Should I start with the negative or positive....okay, let's start on a positive note! Pro: the location makes it easy to get onto the Parkway East and the waitress was friendly. Yep, that was it for the positives.The cons: andouille sausage that was lukewarm with casing that was unchewable - not pleasant to have to dispose of that on the side of the plate...one taste was enough. Cheese grits devoid of any cheese flavor, but packed with hard lumps of uncooked grain - the largest of which was walnut-sized. The eggs were done well, but the entire dish was topped with a sweet jam that had no relationship to the dish whatsoever. My dining companion had high hopes for her goat cheese, leek and pancetta frittata topped with greens. Yet another fail. She proclaimed it dry with very few of the fillings to be found...but TONS of greens on top.  Odd.Maybe the regular cooks were off for the holiday. Maybe they were overwhelmed by the crowd...although truth be told, we didn't wait for a table even though it was packed. I wish I could have had the experience that all these four and five star reviews had,  but after my first try, it isn't worth going back again. Pittsburgh has far too many great breakfast and brunch spots to bother with less than mediocre.After seeing the Groupon available every time I open the app to check for deals, I finally caved and bought it! Not to mention that my fellow Yelper Meghan B. adores this place so I wanted to try it out. I'm so glad I did!We went on a Friday afternoon and I was surprised by how packed it was. We ended up sitting outside just so we didn't have to wait. We didn't mind, though. The outdoor seating is pretty cute! Our server was prompt and friendly and understood that we were going to order a lot due to having a $40 towards food (we only paid $20 for it!).I wanted to try something different, but after an awesome chest day at the gym, I wanted some meat and ordered a burger. It was awesome! Now, the patty did appear to be frozen, however the garlic toasted bun and beautifully positioned toppings totally made up for it. Nothing wrong with frozen patties, but I just expected it to be a little more gourmet. Not complaining. It was still very good considering the place isn't a burger joint. I had a side of fries that were crispy and delicious and cole slaw that wasn't too heavy. We also ordered a Nutella/Strawberry crepe. It was my first time ever trying a crepe and I fell in love! I'm not really one for super sweet meals, so I don't think I would order this as a breakfast entree, but it totally hit the spot after my burger. We also split a Chunky Monkey pancake. Wow! Not too sweet, but just sweet enough. You really didn't even to use much syrup. It had bananas, chocolate chips, whipped cream and topped with coconut. I have officially fallen in love with this place and can't wait to go back and introduce more people to this delicious goodness! It's a shame it's only open till three, but from the looks of it, they make enough during the morning and afternoons to close their cash registers comfortably.My friend and I have been trying to come to Square Cafe for a year.  Last year, she made a reservation for my birthday, and when we called to verify, they said they couldn't guarantee us a seat.  Uh... what is the point of a reservation then?  We finally tried Square Cafe for the first time a few weeks ago.I ordered a breakfast burrito, known as Uncle Charley's Hot Sausage Breakfast Burrito ($10.99), and my friend ordered the leek, asparagus, and cheese frittata ($9.29).  My breakfast burrito was good and tasted delicious, but the portion was very small for the price.  I ate the entire thing with no issues, and I weigh just over 100 pounds.  My friend's frittata wasn't very good, though, and the side of grits she ordered were just ok.  The food was good but not notable enough for me to be dying to come back.Our server was a nice guy who explained the menu really well.  When he brought over the bill, we found out there was a pay it forward chain going through the restaurant.  We paid it forward in the server's tip, but it's cool that this place is into that kind of thing.  The ambiance is good!A big problem:  It was really cold in the restaurant because despite having double doors, they propped the second set of doors open, which let all of the seventeen degree air into the space.  This was the difference between 3 and 4 stars for me.  I cannot enjoy a meal when I'm cold.I really wanted Square Cafe to be the trendy cafe where I could regularly enjoy brunch, but in the end, it's just ok.  I would come back if someone suggested it, but I don't think I would come back here on my own.I visited for brunch at 1pm today with a friend.  Although they don't accept reservations or use No Wait, they got us in surprisingly quickly (in 10 min., despite an estimate of 20-30 min.).  We were seated at the table closest to the door, but I found it quite warm, and didn't feel chilly at any point, despite the constant stream of customers.Between us, we ordered the following: Sun dried tomato scramble with goat cheese and spinach (me), brussels sprout hash (my friend), side of bacon (split), and two 16 oz specialty drinks (regular cinnamon bun latte for me, decaf gold star (?) latte for my friend).  The food came out quite quickly--less than 10 min. after ordering, I believe--and our waitress was quite efficient, despite being one of only two working with a large crowd.Generally, we were pleased with the quality of the food.  My one criticism was that the ingredients could have been more evenly distributed throughout the scramble--some pieces consisted only of egg, and all of the goat cheese was concentrated in one area.  Once I mixed up the ingredients, the flavors and textures combined, complementing one another nicely.  The addition of some hot sauce, salt, and pepper enhanced them even more.  The spring mix was served with my entree undressed, but I used the orange garnish to add some juice, which dressed it up nicely.  The bacon was cooked perfectly, with just the right amount of crunch and give.  Finally, my latte was just sweet enough (not overly so), with a good milk:coffee ratio, rounding out the savoriness of the scramble and bacon.  Although I didn't sample my friend's dish or latte, she enjoyed them, as well.As others have mentioned, I felt that the portions were on the smaller side, esp. given the price (our check came to $34).  Fortunately, I had a city dining card for this place ($10 discount), but even so, after tip, I paid close to $30.  For this reason, I'm tempted to knock off half a star.  However, because I liked the vibe, was pleased with the quality of the food and the service, and appreciate the fact that this place offers several healthy, vegetarian, and GF options, I'm awarding an even 4 stars.

Review Text :
I have been to many a deli my friend and this is not a very good deli. The kosher style corned beef they attempted was fatty, some of it was chewy and parts of it had been exposed to the air too long and gotten a bit hard. I also suggest more training on the deli equipment before someone is in need of stitches from the slicing wheel. The girl making my sandwich was having a hard time as a result of the previously mentioned hard portion and nearly pushed her finger into the wheel before deciding to shut it off while she fussed over the meat. I like to watch someone fussing over meat as much as the next guy but no one should lose a finger.The potato salad was very bland.Rather than leaving me with a fond memory of deli's I have been to in NYC, Boston, Cleveland, etc it left me wishing I had skipped it and wanting the real deal even more.OMG!  Greenberg's serves up some of the most delicious sandwiches I've ever had.  If you're in Las Vegas and you love a mountain of New York style hot, freshly shaved, thin sliced meat on fresh bread of your choice you owe yourself a visit to Greenberg's Deli on the casino level of the New York, New York Hotel and Casino.My friends are thoughtful.  On the day prior to running the half marathon I had a fairly late pasta lunch and decided to skip dinner in preparation for the morning's race.  My race morning ritual is pretty simple.  One hour before the race I eat a banana or a bagel and I drink a pint of Cytomax to prepare my body for the onslaught ahead.  Cytomax is a fluid replacement liquid that has added vitamins to fuel the body and prolong cramping.Both of my friends were running in their first half marathon, and neither had any set routine for nutrition on the day prior to the race nor on race morning.  They visited Greenberg's on the night prior to the race, and in thinking I was starving in my hotel room they brought back for me a huge deli sandwich with a side of potato salad and a pickle with a bottle of Gatorade.  The time was 10 PM and the race was just 9 hours away.  With no refrigeration in the hotel room, and two overstuffed roommates I was left with no choice but to eat the darn sandwich and the sides.Knowing my love for meat they brought back a Twin Bill consisting of a mountain of hot pastrami and corned beef with just a slight smear of mustard on wheat bread (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/I4Nr-MVc26qWr08-S3Q1ow?select=u6ig5pKlEqhgsmAvUNWrkA).  I swear the take out box weighed in at more than a pound with the thick pile of meat taking up most of that weight.  The sandwich was incredible.  The meats were nicely marbled, flavorful and moist and this was easily one of the best deli sandwiches I've had outside of New York City.  It was even better than Miller's East West Deli in San Francisco, and I love Miller's.  The big crunchy pickle was outstanding as well with just the right amount of sour to it.  The potato salad was basically big chunks of unpeeled potatoes, lots of mayo and just a touch of dill.  It took me nearly an hour to finish the sandwich, and I knew I was in trouble for the next morning.Sure enough, the big sandwich came back to haunt me at mile 10 during the half marathon the next morning.  Luckily I run for fun, and I didn't really care that I finished 12 minutes later thanks to 2 pit stops I was forced to make.I was so satisfied with the sandwich that I made my own visit to the deli the next night to order another.  This time I had the New York Skyhigh (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/I4Nr-MVc26qWr08-S3Q1ow?select=QtjcS6CWBgSaD01Zry3urg) which is corned beef, pastrami, turkey, cole slaw and thousand island dressing on bread of choice.  I even tried their authentic chocolate New York egg cream which is simply milk, Hershey's chocolate syrup and carbonated water hand mixed and machine whirled to create a thick layer of froth on top.  Here it was without the froth (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/I4Nr-MVc26qWr08-S3Q1ow?select=ekkd6tNYWjCU9Z-oXH3_4Q) as I had already sucked it up.  I loved this sandwich just as much as the Twin Bill and the drink?  Well, that was like drinking chocolate milk with fizz!Greenberg's is very reasonably priced too as their sandwiches are mostly under $10 including the sides!I was feeling like a sandwich for lunch and near NY NY so I ended up here. You stand in one line to order and another line to pay. When it came my turn to order I asked for the Vinnies Deluxe in a french roll. The guy carving the meat laughed and said he never had someone order that sandwich on a french roll before and he would never do that because that bread cannot hold all the meat. I let him know I wasn't a tourist and have eaten here several times before never ordering my sandwich on any other bread and never had a problem with it being messy. I then told him if he wanted to buy my $10 sandwich I would get it on the bread if his choice. He laughed and said to grab a fork and knife. For the record... No utensils were needed and no meat fell off my sandwich. The sandwich had beef brisket, turkey, and pastrami with deli mustard and mayo. The meats on the sandwich taste well together and the bread was good. I always leave satisfied but do wish the sandwich was a little bigger. It also came with a pickle. Tables are right outside or you can get your food to go and they are open until 3 am.Greenberg's Deli is a spot you should definitely hit while in Vegas specially after drinking nothing sounded better than big fat Pastrami Sandwich. :-)Located in New York, New York, Greenberg's is tucked in among the "city streets". You order at the counter, the meat is all sliced to order, thin and delicious. The sandwiches are huge.Hot and fresh made meats including pastrami, corned beef and turkey, made to order on a selection of freshly baked breads, with house made mustard and dill pickle on the side. I had the pastrami sandwich and potato salad. Fresh ingredients, the bread tastes amazing, and the pastrami so delicious and piled so high that it's hard to figure out how to eat it! So yummy, and the potato salad is perfect with the sandwich.For a quick and relatively inexpensive meal, definitely stop by this place and grab a bite to eat. You won't be disappointed.The seating area outside of Greenberg's Deli was packed on my last visit, so I asked for my food to-go. Depending on the time and day, inside can get crazy busy and I'm used to that, so it doesn't bother me if I end up getting my order to-go or not. The line can get long, but it  moves fairly quick. There are 3 different sandwiches on the menu I like, so I am glad that they have kept them over the years. Problem is the prices and consistency of the food has changed. I used to pay $8.95 for a sandwich that currently costs $12.95 and isn't as big as it was before. That or the amount of meats are off. For example when I get a sandwich that has 3 different types of meat on it, they put a thin layer of pastrami on the bottom and then a huge amount of turkey. I post pictures each visit and you can clearly see how they are not consistent with amount of meat they put on each sandwich. When I told the guy working this last visit what type of sandwich I wanted on a French roll, he said that he wouldn't recommend that type of bread with that sandwich. I explained that I had ordered it many times before on that type of bread and would prefer it please. He made it the way I ordered it and the sandwich came out tasting great! The meat had good flavor and it was tender and juicy and it's still carved in front of you. I still give 4 stars even with the meat portions being off because the meat here is excellent. I only wish that if they are going to raise the prices, that they not put less meat on the sandwiches as well coleslaw or at least when they do pile the sandwiches high they should put equal amounts of each meat. They do still have soup and for beverages hey have water, juice, beer and soda.I randomly stopped at Greenberg's Deli for a sandwich while walking through New York New York casino. The ordering process here is cafeteria style. Grab a tray and get in line at one end, order, pick up your sandwich and pay at the other end where you exit the line. I decided to get a simple Reuben ($10.95) with pastrami on rye with the standard fixings of swiss cheese, sauerkraut and thousand island dressing. Similar to what you can expect in deli's in NY the meat for the sandwich is sliced fresh right in front of you. Looking at this process I thought that I would be standing in line for a long time but the person behind the counter worked fast and kept the line moving at a steady pace.The sandwich itself is not very big but could be considered to be a decent lunch sized portion. It has a decent amount of meat but its not like its piled sky high. What it has going for itself is the taste which is really good. Definitely among the best that I've had. The rye bread is toasted perfectly. The pastrami is of high quality and its taste is not eclipsed by the sauerkraut and thousand island dressing but shines through in each bite. It's price is also right considering that it is on the strip in a Casino. Overall I liked what I ate so would not have a problem stopping by the next time I'm in town.Greenberg's Deli brings back that loving feeling that's been gone gone gone. Born and raised in the New York metropolitan area I grew up with the loving feeling of dining in delis that serve delicacies from kasha varnishes to Ruben sandwiches. After moving to Las Vegas there has been far less New York delis to enjoy the these delicacies that I love. I am surprised that it took my brother and I over 15 years to try Greenberg's Deli. Better late than never.    It is appropriate that Greenberg's Deli sits inside New York - New York within a Disneyfied Greenwich Village. Both casino and Deli execute such a commendable job with the theme and attention to detail, that a unique dining experience is guaranteed. The New York City motif is so realistic that you expect to hear a taxi careening down the faux Greenwich Village Street, and instead overhear a runaway Manhattan Rollercoaster taxi above with screaming riders.    When you step off the Greenwich Village Street into Greenberg's Deli, up above on the wall is  the menu. It advertises the New York City Deli icons including the Ruben, corn beef, and pastrami. Disappointedly yet totally expected Kashe varnishes and kinishes were missing. However, there on the board was an egg salad sandwich. I LOVE egg salad sandwiches. They are not the easiest sandwich to find in Las Vegas and especially on the Strip. A few years past, I really enjoyed the Johnny Rockets egg salad sandwich until they got rid of it. The egg salad sandwich is relatively inexpensive for the Las Vegas Strip where a Subway sandwich could cost over $8. I would never want to eat an egg salad sandwich by itself. I'd add a prepackaged potato salad for $1.50 and a fountain Pepsi for a couple of dollars more that came out to $13 and change.   Before I could enjoy the food I had to pay. This is a two line process. On line 1, I ordered and picked up the sandwich with the prepackaged potato salad and fountain Pepsi before bringing my tray to line 2 to pay. I carried the tray outside to the Greenwich Village Street where the tables are.   The egg salad sandwich brought back this loving feeling of enjoying delicious food in a New York deli. They served it on between two slices of rye bread (I could of had sourdough). Complimenting the overflowing egg salad that required a fork to savour every bite was onions, tomato, and lettuce. The potato salad was nothing extraordinary. Perhaps, the next time I visit I may enjoy the sandwich with hard to find Wise potato chips or go nearby upstairs to Coney Island to pick up Nathan's crinkley cut fries.    Sitting in the Greenwich Village Street amplified this New York state of mind that in reality is a New York - New York state of mind. The sights and sounds of the casino is exciting. Up above the runaway New York Express roller coaster taxi careened on the tracks, the Times Square Dueling Piano players rocked the classics across Greenwich Village. Greenberg's Deli with the New York - New York Greenwich Village is the marriage of a Las Vegas and New York deli dining experience that brings back a loving feeling that had been gone gone gone.

It sang to us its beautiful lullaby before we spotted it- a lovely waterfall at the restaurant's entrance!  It was a little chilly that evening and I had a feeling that Mamang wouldn't be open to dining al fresco, but I asked for patio seating.  When I spotted a few heaters in place, I knew we'd be fine.  What a delightful surprise when we scored a table next to the babbling waterfall we encountered on our way in!  Nervous energy spent over Mamang feeling too chilled outside was wasted; Indeed, she even complained of feeling too warm!  No worries though, as cousin Melissa eagerly swapped places with grandma.We shared flaming saganaki, "award-winning" gyro dinner (consisting of lamb and beef, scrumptious rice, sauteed veggies, and just-perfect lemon-roasted potatoes), side Greek salad, and flaming galaktoboureka (custard baked in crusty phyllo, topped with vanilla ice cream, flamed, then drizzled with caramel sauce) for dessert!  We three over-ate, but no one grumbled.  Mamang had never experienced Greek cuisine before, so this beautiful evening (outdoor dining, ambience- lighted palm trees, waterfall- and tasty food) was a perfect send-off for our gorgeous grandmother, who was homesick living on US soil for the past six months.  She left for Manila yesterday (Monday).  I hope she's happier back home... Mamang, next time you're enjoying a fresh mango shake, I hope you'll think of me!  I'll be there in spirit sipping on another next to you :)1st con: Poor lighting.  Firstly, my eyes can't feast on the beauty that I'm about to savor.  Secondly, photos taken will most likely be ruined.  Thankfully, my cousin's digital cam had better flash.  Please refer to photos above!2nd con: Lackluster service.  Appetizer was served, yet we didn't have any utensils on our table.  Couldn't find our server, so I grabbed three sets from a nearby table.  Also, we almost missed the flame shows of both saganaki AND galaktoboureka.  Cousin and grandma thought something or someone caught on fire, haha (in the event of a body, not so funny); Presenter should've given us warning before setting the cheese on fire.  3rd con: Restroom was in an awful state of disarray.  Counter was wet all over, and the floor was littered with paper.  Total 180 degrees from the awesome ambience experienced on the patio (excluding the poor lighting, of course).

I came here on a whim and I'm so glad I did. This place is off the chain (not a dog eating joke). It's about $20/person when you do the "all you can eat" option. I have never been to a place that served food in this manner, but wowsers... I like! The waiter comes and you order about 2-3 selections per person, you finish that, the waiter comes back, and you order again. This process is repeated until you are stuffed silly.Can you imagine ordering all the chicken katsu, spam musubi, and kalbi you want? CAN YOU?! Plus, all the food is made to order (I think), so it's steaming hot when it gets to your table.I didn't try too many of their sushi options, but the cream cheese roll tasted flavorful and fresh. Unlimited drinks are an additional fee and they have a fridge in the lobby where you can get up & grab as many drinks as you want, changing it up each time you go.To top it all off, customer service was awesome. Our waiter was super friendly and attentive. It was seriously so yum yum!

I'm feeling bad about the reviews that came before mine, but my honest review is that this place is just 'meh.'I was there last night (which was a Tuesday) for a meeting - we had some drinks and I ordered dinner... service was decent; not great.  Food was the same - I had a bean burrito with a side of guac - it was fine.  Some of the others at the table took advantage of their 'dollar taco' menu.  I think it's part of happy hour that you can get your choice of chicken or steak tacos for 1 buck each - not bad!I didn't start with the chips and salsa because when I do that I can never stop, but from experience, i know their chips and salsa are pretty good.  Go for drinks, especially if you're craving Corona with some chips and salsa - the atmosphere is fine, and it works for small groups too.  It's a decent chain restaurant that is pretty consistent in giving you standard Mexican fare.  Go with just 'meh' expectations and you'll be fine.Woah, UBER FAIL.FULL DISCLOSURE:  I was contacted by Salty management in response to my less than favorable review of their Old Town location.  I was offered a gift card as an "I'm sorry, try us again" ploy in exchange for more detailed information on my shitty experience.  Ok, sure, I like free stuff, send it.  Plus, it sounded like they were making changes and attempting to improve things there, so I didn't mind giving it another shot.  FOUR months later, I receive the $50 gift card.  Right away I was disappointed that the gift card was supposedly only good at the North Scottsdale location, 32miles each way from my house.  Whatever, 3 gallons of gas round-trip (approx $6.00), why not.First things first (and I like to start on a good note before the bloodshed) their wait-staff is fairly attractive, nice sort of emo-slut look... easy on the eyes.  Our waitress was pretty cute, friendly, bra exposed... nice.  Their $8.50 "Monthly Special Margarita" was actually very tasty and poured very well.  Not too sweet and very strong.  If this was the only place in town to get a good margarita, that would be one thing.... but it's not.Now let it rain blood.The lighting in this place was the first fail of the night... we had to move from our first booth because we both felt we were sitting under a spotlight.  Our second booth (a round one) was a little better since we weren't under a spotlight, but the lighting cast a shadow on our table (shadow caused by my body) so that I had to move my body to the right and hold the menu to the left of me to read anything.  So annoying.  FAIL.We ordered their $1.95 Unlimited Chips and Salsa.  The chips were soaked in oil and the bottom 3/4 of the basket was un-edible because they were crumbs!  Wait, did a "Mexican" place just charge me $1.95 for shitty chips and "ok" salsa?  Yup, they did.  FAIL.I ordered the Fajitas, half steak half chicken with corn tortillas.  The Fajitas were made in this tomato sauce, which at first I wasn't too thrilled about, but in all honesty, I'm super glad they did because if it wasn't for the tomato sauce, the dish would have had 0 taste.  The meats had no seasoning on them and tasted completely bland.  I actually considered using salt (I NEVER use salt, even at home, unless it's popcorn) to give it some amount of taste.  Thank god for the tomato sauce.  The corn tortillas can only be described as disgusting.  I was only given three tiny corn tortillas but only ate two of them.  I can't really describe what's wrong with them, but they are foul.  The Fajitas came with a plate of cheese, rice, sour cream, and shredded romaine lettuce (yeah).  The only thing on the accompanied plate I ate was the rice and it was COLD!  Not warm, not luke warm, COLD!  My dining partner's rice was cold also.  WTF?  Needless to say, the cold rice was the best part of the meal, seriously.  F A I L.My dining partner ordered this Chipotle Chicken Burrito which, believe it or not, lacked taste and was bland.  Yes, BLAND!!!  How is it possible that a burrito covered in cheese, injected with a Chipotle sauce is bland?  No clue, but these clowns pulled it off.  Unbelievable.  F A I L.Our bill came, $45.32.. I figured, "great, $50 on the gift card, $5 out of pocket, she gets a $10 tip, and I never have to think about this place again".  Wrong.  They wouldn't let us put the tip on the gift card, so I ended up with $5 left on the card and had to pay $10 out of pocket.  So $10 out of pocket + $6 to get there, I paid $16 bucks and 2 hours of my life to eat an incredibly SHITTY meal.  In retrospect I wish they never sent me the gift card and I had stayed home and ate left overs instead, spending the $16 on a bottle of Vodka and a can of Soda Water.  I don't even really understand, their food got WORSE!!!  Why would you send gift cards, encourage people to try your place again and actually make your food worse?  Am I in bizzaro world here?  Aren't you supposed to IMPROVE the food?  "Mexican" food is the easiest food in the world to make "decent", hell even [fill in blank]-abertos is better, Macayo's, Serrano's, El Torrito, you name it, it's better (even the Clarendon's now defunct Mexican spot was better).  I have to figure the ONLY reason people come here is for the patio and to drink.  But still... there are plenty of places to drink, why support such a lousy place?  Perhaps they rely on their patrons to either be drunk when they eat so they don't notice, or so drunk afterward they forget.  U B E R   F A I L ! !

Review Text :
At the oddly shaped corner where Charleston and Fremont Street become Boulder Highway, in one of the older and more dangerous parts of east Vegas, you can find a great taco 24 hours a day at Pepe's!  For 7 or 8 dollars you'll get a huge pile of authentic Mexican food.  I'm partial to the Super Burrito with Carne Asada, or the Huevos Rancheros - yes they serve breakfast all day!  Que gusta!  Very authentic joint.  Makes a great contrast to the Strip casinos if you want to cruise down Charleston for a break from the contrived slot palaces of MGM and Harrahs.  You might even see a real live mugging - just be careful it isn't you!

Restaurant name  Catch 22 Sports Grill

Review Text :
At the start of football season, I was a fan of Catch 22.  However, as the season is coming to an end, I find my enthusiasm is fading...There are plenty of TVs, and they are labeled according to the games that will be shown.  This is helpful when choosing a seat - I want to see my Texans play!  However, most of the TVs are a bit small for the large space and the two big screens are reserved for Cardinals games.  It would be nice to have the 'good' TVs showing the best matchup of the week, regardless of who is playing.On Sundays, lunch is served starting at 11:00 (there is a limited breakfast menu earlier) and the items I have tried were good.  Hey, it is a sports bar - burgers, fries, chicken tacos and wings go well with beer and football...During my first couple of visits, there were plenty of servers to handle the Sunday crowd.  And, they were very friendly and attentive as well.  However, recently the service has been hit or miss - it seems like there are fewer servers who are unsuccessfully working with the same sized crowd.  On my last visit the service was painfully slow, and very basic things like placing and order and receiving a check seemed next to impossible. While Catch 22 is an A-OK place to watch a few games, I am on the lookout for a North Phoenix alternative...I'm giving Catch 22 all of one star, mainly because who I think might be the new owner/manager decided that the group I was there to watch football with this morning wasn't all that important enough for their business and he decided to talk down to one lady in our group because she was setting up a wireless tower to get sound and he thought she was doing it wrong.  Turned out to be bad wifi from Catch 22, however he couldn't admit it.  Furthermore, when I asked if we could have our game on the big screen he replied "nope, that is not happening" and then gave me some BS excuse of how the wiring in the place is all connected and how certain tvs can't go to another channel without other tvs there going to the same channel.  Interesting how other sports bars can get it right, however they can't.  The tone of his answer to me couldn't have been more condescending.  And seriously, if we were told we get a separate place in the restaurant with our own tv then why should we have to bring our own sound to a sports bar???At the end of the day, we were pretty much treated like second class patrons.  The food is somewhat ok at best, last week our group had lousy service, and whomever was in-charge of the place this morning was a real (rhymes with "Rick") to us.  Never going back there again.This place is horrible. Rude wait staff and owner. Dirty tables..no ketchup. Definatley wont come back. This place needs to be on bar rescue lol.

Restaurant name  Los Reyes De La Torta
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Perfect example of a great restaurant that lives in a crappy place. From the outside one might be scared to go in... it's in Sunnyslope for cripes sake! The tortas, and aguas frescas are both incredible. They blow a lot of other "torta" restaurants I've been to out of the water. The atmosphere is pretty bare bones, but they have done a nice job of making it feel welcoming and festive. There are always lots of kids there and lots going on, so be ready for a non-relaxing meal, but a very delicious one at that. The portions are enormous, and most people would be able to split one sandwich. Just watch your back around the area.Thanks to David B. and a serendipitous coupon from lunchclub.com, I finally went to Los Reyes de la Torta. The description of the Huarache con hongos is what really did it... and it was perfectly described! It's like an extra thick soft corn tortilla topped with beans (navy or cannellini, not pinto) a LOT of queso fresco and... hongos (mushrooms). Don't like mushrooms? Pick a different topping... much like (as Dave B. describes) pizza!The waitress asked if I wanted red or green salsa and I asked for sides of each so I could try them both, but I only got the red... which was fine, because it added good flavor. The portion was huge! And, the price was fair (around $7 including a can of diet coke)So low carbin' is all Ive been talking about lately and Im working on creating a new list with my recommendations. It might seem like a taco/torta shop is the last place you can low carb but Los Reyes is exceptional, especially on the cheap! Order the Tacos Alambre de Res ($4.75) and have them hold the tortillas.. so what you get is a plate full of chopped beef, onions, bacon all covered in melted cheese served with shredded cabbage, sliced radishes, sliced cucumbers, grilled onion and a grilled jalapeno. Slather on some salsa and don't eat the grilled onion and you've got yourself some good eating right there!Phoenix royalty is in the 'slope! These guys, without question, are los reyes. They are not screwing around by making such a claim. People love the huaraches, which are gigantic corm tortillas covered with white cheese, red or green salsa, and mushrooms (hongos) or various meaty choices. I've had the huarache with mushrooms and the version with carne asada. I've also had the mouth-watering shrimp burrito. All are delicious, but...The tortas are where it's at. I mean, they strike some kind of poetic balance that resists duplication. The sandwiches have a variety of toppings and fillings, and are served on a beautiful bolillo roll. I'm partial to the milanesa (breaded chicken or beef). There's something about the mild crunch of the filling that combines with the smoothness of the avocado and the kick of the jalapeno. Fantastic.Los reyes also deliver on the beverage front. The make their own fresh juice, so there are quite a few options for aguas frescas, licuados, etc. One thing worth trying is the vampiro: orange, carrot, celery, beet, and pineapple juices. The vampiro will probably cure the most intractable ailment.The restaurant is also bustling and fun. Servers are friendly and multi-lingual. If you live in Sunnyslope, check the place out immediately. If not, it's worth a trip!Every time I drive by this place, I get a little thrill down my spine. MMMM! Where else can you go to experience a bit of heaven between two soft pieces of bread? I met Mr. Hottie and Foodie Bear for lunch one afternoon at Los Reyes. I will say that I'm not a HUGE fan of sandwiches, but when it's free, what the heck? I walked in to the strip mall establishment and was met by the aroma of grilled onions and meat! So far, so good! Once seated, I found my eyes wandering around the menu and wishing I could eat everything on it! After sipping on a delicious horchata, and pondering the menu, I decided on the Torta el Rey which means "torta that has everything but the kitchen sink in it" (loosely translated)! This AMAZING sammie came with breaded thin beef steak, ham, chorizo, fried egg, cheese, avocado, lettuce, tomato, and jalapeno! This is CERTAINLY not something you want to feed a family member who is at risk of kicking the bucket due to heart or kidney issues. Consider yourself warned. I will say that if you eat this sandwich, you are bound to fall in love with it. It's a dangerous, forbidden love, but a love you will cherish nonetheless. One of the issues I have with sandwiches is the bread. In previous experience, the tortas that I ate had terribly boring bread, or bread that was way too hard. Los Reyes' bread was yummy! It was grilled and and crusty, but not so crusty that you cut your mouth or it's too hard. The ingredients of the torta were all well made and delicious. Everything was HOT where it needed to be and cold and fresh where that needed to be! Perfecto! So why is that 5th star missing? I want to head back to try another torta to be sure of a 5 star rating! Looking forward to it!Yet another place I would never have found without Christina P and Yelp!  And it was good.  Really good!The menu has quite a few recognizable items like burros and tacos, but I opted to try a huarache, basically an over-sized tostada with a thicker, softer corn tortilla and you choose your toppings.  Let's just say it's 8:16 am and I wish I were eating one right now.  They don't serve alcohol, but they do have a great juice bar with many options to choose from.  Of course, that won't satisfy anyone who can't fathom the idea of a spicy meal without a beer or margarita.  But it worked for me.  I will definitely come back if I'm in the neighborhood.  I just need to find a reason to be in the neighborhood now."OK, that kicked ass!"This is the only sentence I could manage after leaving Los Reyes de la Torta.  The food coma was quickly rendering me incoherent...This place well, does kick ass.  ¡Muy auténtico!  Salsa music in the background and soccer on the TVs.  An extensive menu with portions that seem to only come in one size - ginormous.  We thought we were being so smart by sharing two items.  Yeah, right.  There was enough deliciousness to feed a small family.  Mango juice... served in a chalice with a big slice o' mango riding on the side.  Shrimp quesadilla... I had no idea that tortillas could be made in that size.  Torta Del Rey... Easily more than 5" tall and packed with just about everyting that their kitchen can prepare.  I would love to see someone try to bite into this.  We had to eat it with a fork.  Amusing that the torta is served with potato chips - who has the stomach real estate left to eat those!?The only thing you can do after a meal like that is crash on the nearest couch until you feel human again.I will be hungry again sometime late next week.¡Ay, lo me Encanta!I keep coming back! Latest obsession is the shredded shrimp quesadilla. Apparently, there's some sort of translation problem because "shredded" means "with onions and bell peppers." In addition to onions and bell peppers -- and shrimp, obviously -- the ginormous quesadilla is filled with cheese, guacamole and smokey, bacony beans! So good! P.S. When I was there yesterday I noticed a sign that Man Vs. Food was there to eat the torta. Episode airs next week, I think...Agua Frescas...the term always eluded me. I knew it was some sort of Mexican drink, but I never really took the time to give it a shot, I guess my disdain for Horchata scared me off from other ethnic drinks, well...Los Reyes de la Torta made me regret my shortsightedness. After trying the Agua Frescas here, I went home and all but prayed for forgiveness from the Agua Fresca God for doubting him...this is one seriously good drink...at least at Los Reyes de la Torta it is. This place was our back up plan for dinner last Saturday...and quickly became our first choice because our other front runner (Sonora Mesquite Grill) seemed to be inexplicably closed on Saturday evening. This ended up being a blessing though, because I can't imagine having a better Mexican meal than we did at Los Reyes de la Torta. Right when you walk in, you know this place means business. Open kitchen, great smelling food being cooked up, 'best of' signs posted everywhere, and a packed house with people smiling and enjoying themselves wherever you look. Upon first opening the menu, we noticed the prices...dirt cheap. Because of this we decided to get three menu items to try, along with a couple of agua frescas. Here's a breakdown of what we tried: -Pineapple Agua Fresca - Delicious...frothy and natural tasting with each sip filled with a mouth full of mini pineapple bits. -Lime Agua Fresca - Like a fresh squeezed lime...unbelievable refreshing. -Asada Quesadilla - We both liked this the most out of anything we got. Fresh and tasty cheese, awesome tortilla, great tasting carne asada, and a mixture tomatoes/beans/cilantro/avacodo...melt in your mouth good. -Cubana Torta - We are big torta fans, but had to try one here. It was good, but we weren't blown away...again, we aren't big torta fans...so take this with a grain of salt. -Carne Asada Tacos - Okay, I know we already got a carne asada quesadilla...but we really like carne asada...so we just had to do it. The tacos were pretty good, but I wouldn't say they were spectacular. Everything in the taco tasted great but the mini tortillas they use for the tacos wasn't quite as tasty as the flour tortilla they used for the quesadilla. ...we left stuffed and satisfied with our meal. The only possible negative thing about this place is that they don't serve chips and salsa, which is a shame. The hot sauce they bring out to your table to go with your meal would go great with some warm crunchy chips. All in all...this place is excellent. Authentic quality Mexican food for dirt cheap, anyone in the area should definitely check it out. I can't wait to go back and try more stuff. This is a possible 5 star place, just need to go a few more times before it gets 'bumped up'. 4.25/5.I'm in Los Reyes de la Torta!I'm in, Los Reyes de la Torta!No typos there my eagle eyed friends...I am happy to report that both are (in fact) correct!Differences without a distinction!I was reading a thread about over-hyped places the other day, on Yelp.I wrote something pleasant, but inane and in my haste (doing four things at the same time), I misplaced a comma!Other sharp-eyed correspondents pointed that out to me...and I'm as grateful for the unsolicited correction as I can be!After lamenting my typo (and the very fat fingers that I use to type these little stories), I thought to myself "Donald, why not go to one of these very hyperbolically reviewed establishments and see if you can find that comma"?After all, it has to be somewhere.So, after a busy morning, what with working, building, producing, running, meetings, making money, special "mommy/daddy time" with the Beautiful Carin and so much more (you know..."the usual"), it was off to LRDLT for a Tuesday Retox.I met a buddy (who has here been before and raves about this place) and I was hopeful (so very hopeful) that the place would live up to the hyperbole.I couldn't have taken that disappointment, along with losing my comma.I needn't have worried...the Del Rey Torta was everything I could have hoped for...and much more!The whole menu looked terrific and I noticed that the joint was completely packed (even well before the normal lunch hour got into full swing).Everyone in the place seemed to be happy and enjoying themselves...and why not, the food is cheap and tasty...the service is pleasant and efficient...what more could I ask of lunch?Furthermore, the aroma coming from the kitchen was heavenly (always the first indicator, for me), so I settled in and ordered the King Torta...with a diet coke.As my lunch friend says...Sofa King good!And Sofa King huge...certainly the portions are large enough for a small family to share (I saw multiple examples of people sharing lunches).But I do not share...if anybody tries to grab my victuals, they're going to hear angry growling and see bared teeth.Especially when the grits are this good!On a happy, sunny Tuesday morning, I found that some places really do live up to the hype.And while it isn't Keen's Chop house, or Boulevard, LRDLT is Five Stars for what it is!Oh, after lunch...I found my misplaced comma!" , "Insert it with care!After reading Rand's review about a month ago, I just I knew had to check this place out! I stopped by Monday after work with a list of items I'd like to try (I looked at their menu online before coming in). I ordered way too much for my husband & I, but it was my 1st time so I had to try a lil bit of everything. I got the following: shrimp ceviche tostada, carne asada burrito, carne asada tacos w/a side of rice & beans, cheese quesadilla (flour tortilla), carne asada quesadilla (corn tortilla, handmade!) "estilo del rey" style (meaning it's topped with cheese, sour cream & cilantro) & lastly a slice of chocoflan for dessert. I had the tostada, burrito & carne asada quesadilla (over the course of 3 meals, btw) & all were excellent! Although, instead of shrimp I received chicken. It was still delicious but I was excited to try the shrimp, next time. The burrito had a lil kick to it & the meat was seasoned perfectly. The quesadilla was beyond amazing, I don't think I can ever eat a quesadilla again w/out getting it "estilo del rey" style, freakin yum! My hubby had the tacos, cheese quesadilla & half of my burrito. He thoroughly enjoyed everything & made 2 meals out of it. The chocoflan was chocolate cake topped w/a thick layer of flan. I didn't really care for the flan topping but the cake was tasty, super moist! Total for all that food was about $33, which I find totally reasonable. I can say that this is one of the top places for Mexican in Phoenix. I can't wait to return & try all the other yummy things they have to offer!What an excellent lunch I had here! Rand H. organized a little UYE for this place with Mike C., Robyn N., Arlin B. and myself. The establishment is in a rather cramped commercial strip but the restaurant itself is quite roomy, although it doesn't look it at first when you enter. I ordered a ceviche appetizer; this was the best ceviche I've ever had -- I would come here just for this! For my entree, I had the bistecas y huevos with rice and beans; it came with sides of avocado and Mexican cheese. I also had a refreshing glass of mango agua fresca which accompanied the meal perfectly. Great food, great prices, and great service even when the place is busy - no wonder this place is so popular.EwwwwwAre people just giving this place good reviews bc they want to pretend like they're super cool and are totally down with hole in the wall places in the hood?? Bc this was seriously nast. We ordered the queso w chorizo and that was bomb, I'll give them that.Our food came out, I had one bite of my chilaquiles and was like ready to spit it out. The green sauce was creepy and the steak was very off in flavor and not seasoned at all. I asked for a to go box and boxed up the steak to feed my dogs. My friend ordered their torta. She was like 'I can't tell if I don't like this bc it's gross or bc I'm full' I tasted it and was like 'bc it's gross.' she called me today to tell me she tried eating it for breakfast but threw it out bc it was nasty. We'll be sticking to the torta from Gallo Blanco, bc even though their service sucks, at least their torta is amazeballs. Seriously some of the grossest food I've tasted. The staff was friendly and the place was clean and packed. I just personally find the food super nasty.If you've ever been an inebriated bachelor and piled whatever you found in your fridge in between two slices of bread or into a tortilla, or perhaps a struggling mother who feeds her family a hearty mash-up of Whatever once a week on Leftover Night, then you'll appreciate "The King of the Sandwiches".Don't be afraid of rubbing elbows with your fellow patrons, or of a little grease running down from your overstuffed-torta-compressing hand all the way to that elbow.Try somethign that sounds loco -- it won't be that hard.  A couple of the choices contain basically everything you could think of to put on a sandwich, and then some. Actually, you could get a single sandwich that contains the innards of about a half dozen sandwiches all at once.Epiphany~ LRDLT's Del Rey and Las Reynas sandwiches are essentially the Turduken of torta shop tortas.Enjoy your hotdoghamchickenfriedsteakchickenfriedchickenchorizocheeseavocadoonionporkchopeggjalopenoburgerburritosandwichThe Torta de Milanesa was good. Not the best, but decent. I also had a bite of my friends Torta Cubana and that was good, slightly better than my milanesa. My torta de milanesa had beans and no-where else have I ever had beans in a torta, atleast never in Mexico, place where the torta is king. But this might just be a filling replacing the standard avocado added to tortas de milanesa. Since I noticed that my torta lacked that and the avocado always gives it that extra creamy and tasty kick!!         Also, my standards are high for tortas. I've been lucky enough to enjoy tortas de Milanesa and Cubanas in Currnavaca and Mexico City by Tortas Che and others there!! Those are bomb!!! ANYWAYS!!         The tortas here are not bad, their simply good, but nothing that I would frequent nor crave. The service here was fantastic!!!! No complaints there, we were getting attention left and right, nothing overwhelming, just accommodating and super attentive.        The ONE THING I did love from this place was the Fresas con Crema!! Those were AMAZING!!! That is the reason why I came here in the first place. One of my friends had these exact Fresas con Crema at his place and he shared some with me to try and the Fresas con Crema and I fell in love ever since!!

I was quickly seated by two young and bubbly waitresses.  Did I mention that this place is always packed?!  I found out why!I started my meal by ordering the Aguas cremosas - $4.50.  I ordered the Canteloupe (choices of  strawberry, mango, banana, papaya, or canteloupe). The fresh fruit was mixed with carnation and sweet cream.

Amazing!  Go get it!JD invades AZ Day 2:While researching places to eat on my AZ vacation,  I came across the "Man vs Food" episode where he visits this exact Los Reyes De La Torta (LRT). I was really curious, but a bit hesitant especially after that whole Mexico Bakery (MB) debacle (http://www.yelp.com/biz/mexico-bakery-san-jose-2?hrid=D-vOUl2zj5fBOhbOBHRFjg) --but I sacked up; grabbed my brother-in-law (BIL); headed over there; and ordered two of their infamous Torta Del Rey to-go.Torta Del Ray- This thing is a beast and makes the massive Torta at MB look like a midget. They really should call it the "Regadero De La Cocina Torta" (aka Kitchen Sink) because it's got everything you could imagine--and then some! There's Ham, Pork Loin, Beef Milanese, Hot Dog, Chorizo, melted cheese, Queso Fresco, Chipotle Salsa, Omelet, Tomato, Onions, Avocado, and Chipotle sauce. *Whew!* Now that's a mouthful, both literally and figuratively--and to top it all off they give you a handful of Ruffles chips (in case the Torta isn't enough food for you). The Torta itself was pretty good; I think I'm finding out that I'm not a fan of too much stuff on my sandwiches. I think the taste of everything gets muddled up in there and you get some serious mouth confusion. On the plus side, I really liked their Red Salsa; it went great on the Torta and the Ruffles. If I ever go back I'm definitely ordering one of their simpler Tortas. 3.5*Horchata- I liked LRT's Horchata; it had a good flavor without the chalkiness that you can sometimes find. 4*Service & Ambiance- We ordered our Tortas to-go so we didn't experience the wait-staff, but the two people at the front where we placed our order were very nice and friendly. LRT is located in a pretty Ghetto-Fabulous section of Phoenix; upon our first arrival we were greeted by two borrachos chilling in the lot and a couple of other suspicious characters just "hanging out". I'm not sure if I'd pay LRT a visit at night, but during the daytime I think it just adds to the experience. 4*Value- While $9.75 is a hefty price to pay for a sandwich, realistically you can easily share this with at least one other person. 3* Admittedly, it was a little contrived to seek this place out because I had seen it on a TV show, it was definitely fun to do once. If I lived in the area I seriously doubt I'd make the Torta Del Ray a regular item in my rotation. However, I can almost guarantee that their other more reasonably-sized Tortas would be much better. I'm gonna try to stop in one more time before I head out of town, but until then LRT gets a thumbs up.What? I was so shocked by my experience here!! I feel like I was told that I won a new Audi R8 and went down to the dealership and was given a 1986 Club Car Golf Cart. Have my tastebuds died from all of my martini nights? Don't I know Mexican food? My foodie confidence has taken a massive hit. Do I start at Taco Bell and work my way back to the Big Leagues? Damn you Los Reyes!! I thought I should write down how I felt about my torta to start my process back. Dear Carne Asada, you were treated with such disrespect and were left without flavor and Mexican flare! I was so looking forward to meeting you and seeing why so many loved you. Carne Asada, you're like all those girls in SoCal with the fake boobs and lips. Such a disappointment to find out! The one saving grace you have is your roll, but that roll only hides what you lack inside. Empty and souless! Where do I go now? Where are the real Carne Asada's out there? Do I need to go south of the border? I know my perfect Carne Asada Torta is out there. Juicy, flavorful and every bit tasty! I'm going to keep looking, but I won't be fooled by Los Reyes again.

Yelp's 365 Review Challenge 2014 #156 - #365It was my last night at the Orleans and I wanted to have some cheap before going back to the room. Walking around the casino, I saw TGIF, figured it's just like any other Fridays.There was no wait so I just quickly walked in and sat in the bar area. Service was quick and I ordered a glass of beer and some chicken wings. Food was on par like with any other Friday's franchise and the wings were tasty with mild wings sauce. Lucky for me I was able to charge it to my room so I cab earn some points for my stay.One of the worst places I've ever been to. I actually walked out upset.We were seated immediately so the only good thing about this trip was there was no wait time, but FYI - Happy Hour only applies if you're sitting in the bar area.It took 15 minutes for someone to come over and get our drink order, and another 10 for anything to arrive. A different waitress brought our drinks out and when we told her which one of us ordered what drink, she still gave us the wrong ones. Truly, I think maybe she was high. Meanwhile there are nothing but drunk people surrounding us, yelling obscenities and being inappropriate, and I'm sorry but one of the waiters smelled SO bad that it was hard not to cringe every time he came around. The original waitress never came by and we didn't see her anymore for a while. It took us 15 minutes to get ANYONE'S attention and request the check, then another 10 for my card to be charged and brought back out to me. Easily the worst TGI Friday's I've ever been to and I will not be going back.

1st to review? I guess thats really no surprise word gets around that this place is BAD!!It's been quite awhile since I've been to Burger King mostly because they microwave everything right in front of you ans then tell you it was charbroiled. I was lured in by a co-worker willing to pay and wanting to try the NEW Funnel Cake sticks.I stay away from the burgers since they are FROZEN patties semi-broiled then microwaved. Not my kind of burger. I do however enjoy an occassional chicken sandwich microwaved or not. I ordered it MY WAY-plain.The chicken sandwich was ok but the funnel cake sticks were terrible-like a vanilla flavored straw made of straw. I couldnt eat them, neither could my son:(A place I wont be back to for another long while and thats not even due to the terrible service we experienced taking more than 20 minutes for 3 chicken sandwiches + 2 funnel cake sticks.My daughter is a PICKY eater...AND she has food allergies (eggs, dairy)  Lately, the only surefire way to make her eat anything is to tell her it has bacon in it....seriously.So as we fly back from a week of rest and relaxation in Mexico I see this sign...shining like a bacon...errr...beacon of hope....http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DmyS9b7ykIOo7XwYt5I9wg?select=k8y8sNAXTl6XMzg5Qr61rgGod Bless America....and God Bless Bacon.

Review Text :
It has been a few months since the last time I ate at Del's but the experience was so atrocious that I will never live it down or ever go back there.Also, seeing that they have a Groupon today finally compelled me to finally get this review out for everyone that is considering dining there (even with a discount)We went for a Sunday dinner and I remember we started with their homemade cheese sticks and marinara sauce. Had them plenty of times before and they're yummy if they are cooked long enough for coming out of the freezer. Ours were not. So we moved onto our salad course. I always loved their marinated carrots and homemade italian dressing. However, mid way through our salad, my boyfriend looked at me and said " There is a MOUSE running out from under that table" which was beside ours. I thought he was joking with me because he was reluctant to go there from the start. No sooner did I look down and see a little mouse dashing under the table legs and chairs. We set down our forks and decided that we would NOT be sitting through dinner. We discreetly told our server that there was a mouse in their dining room and then asked to speak with the manager. Moments later our server returned and apologized for the situation, that our meals were being taken care of but no, the manager would not be able to talk to us. So I insisted, if only to notify them that they had vermin running around in plain sight. (If you couldn't tell them, who else do you tell this to?)  Only to you, readers, and the Health Department. If out of shame that the management would not come up to speak with us or by thinking that 'taking care of a meal" could be substituted for their irreverence and unsanitary conditions; it is completely unacceptable. The management has a choice to disregard these issues, but you as a patron should never have to. If these are the conditions of the dining room, I would hate to think what the kitchen islike. Will NEVER go back!I went to Del's with my girlfriend on the night of the Restaurant Impossible relaunch, eager to see how the show transformed it. While hectic, the night was a lot of fun and the food was reasonably tasty. The menu was small (as is usual on relaunch night), but had plenty of good choices. There were some high points- the mozzarella sticks, garlic bread and biscotti. As for dinner, I had an average chicken cacciatore, while my girlfriend had chicken parmigiana that was crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. She was happy enough with it that she was looking forward to having it again.The servers were enthusiastic and accommodating, which was impressive considering everything they went through that day. As the night went on, we were both troubled when we overheard the owner complaining to regulars that the show had forced her to severely shrink her menu. She pledged to go back to the old menu once things were back to normal. I couldn't help but wonder why. After all, if you appear on Restaurant Impossible, isn't that a pretty glaring sign that something is wrong with your current menu?About three months later, we figured that it was time to go back with a couple of friends. As expected, the smaller menu was gone and the bloated original menu was back, plus a few of the Restaurant Impossible dishes. I was dumbfounded by the breadth of choices. In addition to the long list of entrees, Del's also offers pizza and 12 kinds of pasta that can be combined with 13 different sauces. I can't help but think that our meal would have been better if the menu was tightened up.We started with mozzarella sticks and garlic bread, the strongest parts of the meal. The mozzarella sticks were a tad overdone, but were still very tasty, especially with the accompanying tomato sauce. The strong garlic bread was a welcome change of pace from what often passes for garlic bread elsewhere. Unfortunately, my French onion soup was middling at best. In addition to being very sweet, it had an unappetizing layer of oil on top of the melted cheese. My girlfriend and buddies found their iceberg salads to be mediocre.The meal continued to go downhill with the entrees. I had gnocchi with butter and garlic sauce. The butter and garlic sauce was flavorful and strong, but the gnocchi were dense and slightly chewy. My girlfriend, pleased with her chicken parmigiana on our first visit, ordered it again and was severely disappointed. The chicken was buried in sauce. I tried it and agreed- the breading was a soggy mess, while the chicken was drier and tougher than on our first visit.The desserts that we saw floating around looked very good, but we were all far too stuffed from dinner to try anything. Del's portions are huge, which they charge accordingly for. As it is, I think the large portions are meant to counteract the middling quality of the food. Three out of the four of the people in our party had enough leftovers for another full meal.The restaurant itself is still bright and clean, just as it was on relaunch night. Service was well-paced, friendly, and honest. The food and menu need work, though. Cut out some of the dead weight on the menu and give the staff the opportunity to focus on creating better quality dishes. I'm sure Del's doesn't want to shake things up too much for fear of losing their regulars... but if they fail to change, they're never going to create any new regulars.My wife and I had a really, really subpar meal here. I was surprised how old ladyish  it was inside based on how well lit and inviting it looks from the outside. And now onto the food...Del's options are most of the classic Italian meals but the menu was surprisingly lacking in any salads. Just to be clear there were NO salads on the menu. We were a little bit surprised by that so we asked the waitress who could only come up with an antipasto salad that was not on the menu. Our waitress was kind of rude and standoffish from the start which set the tone for the rest of the meal. My wife ordered the antipasto salad and I ordered chicken parmigiana. My wife received a huge heaping pile of canned carrots, bell peppers, and wet beets poured over the top of lettuce so nutrient depleted that it was white. My chicken then showed up as one tiny cutlet sadly dwarfed and alone surrounded by a gigantic plate. They gave me a bowl of pasta in a small bowl on the side which I couldn't understand why it couldn't all be put together on one plate. The chicken turned out to be alright but the portion was so small that I was still hungry when I left. After we left we both swore off Dels as a destination for future dining.Well any evidence of the recent Restaurant Impossible remake is completely missing from the menu - the food we received was clearly microwaved and just overall lackluster.  One entree, veal parmesan,  was sent back along with the bitter tasting iced teas.  And the waitress confessed that all the fish entrees on the menu used frozen components.While on the subject of waitressing, ours was in an ill mood and practically invisible during the meal.  To cap things off, it was 30 minutes from the time she cleared our table until our check was finally signed and we could leave.This was my second, and final, visit to Del's.  With all the fine Italian choices in Pittsburgh, there's no need to waste opportunities here.I went there for lunch on a Saturday with my two children after seeing the RI episode.  The restauarant looked nice.  The inside was not busy.  There were people eating outside on this unusually warm March day.Our waitress acted like she was trained in a really bad diner.  No greeting, no manners, just came by and dropped off menus while she was on her way to somewhere else.  When she returned she said, "what are you having?"  No drink order.I ordered the eggplant parm. with a side of spaghetti marinara. One child got spaghetti, the other a sandwich.  My eggplant parm. came - whoops it was instead a chicken parm.  I did not send it back, thinking it might be real good, as I saw Chef Irvine teach them to make.  It wasn't.  It was obviously a microwave-reheated, soggy pattie with sauce and a little cheese.  The spaghetti was inedible.  The noodles were overcooked and had no taste.  They were probably pre-cooked and left soaking in the water.  They were not adequately drained.  The bowl that it came in had about 1/2 inch of water at the bottom, with the soggy noodles laying in the water and some bland red sauce on top.After a long time the waitress yelled from across the room, "are you having anything else?"  About ten minutes after I indicated "no," she dropped the check on the table and kept walking.I paid the check and left less than my customary 20%.I wonder if the owners read these reviews?  Would it even help if they did?Was not impressed with this place... 1): floors were dirty, the bus boy would just wipe the tables to the floor and wouldn't sweep up after.2): unused silverware from the previous diners was no cleared from the table and reused. 3): The Chicken Parm tasted like the chicken was cook and then reheated. The breading was mush and the red sauce had a metal after taste. I def would not recommend this join even to just cross it off the "Restaurant: Impossible" list.I am going to comment about their Catering Services but this applies to their food quality as well.We ordered 200$ of catering food to feed a household after a recent death.  The service there was first awful.  The order was called in advance and told us a time to pick it up.  I went there and half the dishes were still not ready.  I had to wait another 45 minutes just to pick it up.You would think they would assist you when picking up 12 trays of food, nope, no assistance there, carried it all myself.We ordered breaded chicken filets, mashed potatoes, house salad, and everything was awful.  Worse yet they forgot a whole tray of chicken and we had to call them and tell them about it because they were completely unaware this was part of my order, but don't worry they made sure to get my money for it, if you get my drift.  I'm not saying it was on purpose, but when I called do you think they gave me anything off for having to come back to the store?   Nope, not even a penny.  Did I get a good apology and an offer to come to our house and drop it off?  Nope on both accounts.  Just a bit of lip served apology and here's your chicken.To sum up my experience is the service is terrible, and the food is horrible.  If you call this high school cafeteria food Italian I've got the Brooklyn Bridge to sell you.Bully on the block.Del's is as many of you know located in Pittsburgh's Little Italy.  It's situated at the very beginning of the main drag on Liberty if you're coming up from the Strip or over on Baum Blvd.  For that and the nice exterior a lot of people not familiar from the area give it a try.  Though I really wonder how many people go back for a second visit.  I sadly can say I've been suckered into going 3x's and not once have had an experience worthy of a street packed with so many good options. Del's is a typical Italian place with prices inflated like their egos.  Their dishes are typical and they can't even pull off the simplest Italian fare.  I will say however though that the chicken diablo is a decent dish and what I get when forced to go.  Inflated egos, poor service, very average Italian food. Discover a new place in Bloomfield.I live around the corner from Del's. Their food is good, though I'd probably trade a little less quantity for a little better quality, but overall it gets the job done when you're craving Italian.The issue with Del's is the service, and I don't mean the waiters & bartenders. The hardworking servers at Del's go above and beyond to keep the clientele happy. Unfortunately, the owners (specifically, the daughter of the owner) are on such a power trip that they ruin the experience of customers in favor of  friends.In one incident, the bartender was unable to let us know when last call was, because the owners kept telling her to "close. no, stay open, we have people coming" for which the bartender was profusely apologetic and accommodating, closing and re-opening our tab.  In another instance, the daughter of the owner chewed out a group of servers in front of 20-30 customers for not holding an outdoor table for over an hour so friends could bring their dog to dinner while 1) there was a long line to eat outside and 2) I'm pretty sure dogs aren't allowed inside of patio areas that serve food. We have also, on numerous occasions, tried to order take-out, which has never been entered into the system when the owner's daughter takes our order, causing us an extra 20-45 min wait. Additionally, each time she asks to seat us, she wanders away and forgets us, requiring a waiter to stop serving to help out.Essentially, I believe Del's could be wildly successful, if only ownership would step adsde and let more competent management handle day-to-day operations.I am watching a re-run of the food network when they were at Del's.  We ate there last year after we watched the original airing and thought we'd go there.  It had been many years since we had dined there.  When I saw them make the chicken parmesan the way it SHOULD be made, I was enticed to go back and try it.  It looked wonderful. Much to my disappointment, it seemed as if they went back to the original recipe which was frozen microwaved chicken.  I swear when chef Irivne walked out of the door after trying to help this place, they must have thrown everything he showed them right into the trash, which is where our meals belonged.  The saving grace was the sweet young waitress that we had who really did a great job.  In spite of the fact the the food was so bad, we tipped her generously.  Just because this place is almost an institution in Bloomfield doesn't mean it's the place to dine.  Looking for really good food and unusual atmosphere and friendly service?  The Church Brew Works!I have a few things to report on this place.  Since this place appeared on Restaurant Impossible it is good to report that the decor and menu are still just about the same when on the show.  Sadly, the management and higher ups haven't really changed, same mentality.What drew us in here was a sign on the side of the street: "All You Can Eat Pasta Bar." Great we thought, let's go in and try it out.  Then everything seems to have gone down the toilet.  When we got inside and attempted to order the pasta bar we were told it wasn't available due to the street festival going on outside.  Hmm, funny, because there is still a sign, if not two, posted outside advertising this.  If you were not going to honor this special (which I believe runs Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday) then maybe you should have taken in the signs for that week.When we decided we weren't going to dine here and let our waitress know our intentions we got this great, drawn out excuse why we shouldn't go.  Instead of honoring the all you can eat portion of this, they would hand you a card with options on it to fill in for the pasta bar.  Mind you, it wasn't even all you can eat, just whatever you checked on the card (more like a slip of paper) was what you got.  After sitting there and made to feel guilty our waitress came back over and gave us the real reason for the guilt trip: Her manager (who just happened to be the hostess as well) would eventually yell at her that night and quite possibly fire her.  I felt bad, especially since she was about to cry, but don't guilt trip me into buying food at an establishment that was priced higher than should be and obviously didn't honor their specials.  (To our waitress, I am very sorry we didn't stay, even your tears couldn't get us to stay.  I hope you still have your job.  If the management fired you for us walking out, that is just bad practice, patrons walk out of establishments for far less than what we walked out for (This shows that the attitudes haven't changed from the show)).Will I ever go back here willingly, probably not.  I'd return if whomever I was with begged and pleaded to come here.  That would be the only way.Never wrote a review before, but this place was so bad, I had to comment. I personally ordered some pizza for my girlfriend and I, and she ordered some cheese sticks based on her co-workers who recommended them. I will list the things that were bad.- We sat at the bar figuring that it would be quicker, it was not.- The gentleman serving as the bartender seemed like he was more interested in BSing with the regulars than serving us. At one point, my girlfriend was out of water for over 10 minutes. - The sauce with the cheese sticks was inedible. We actually had to eat our cheese sticks with ketchup. We told the bartender/waiter the sauce was awful, he didn't care at all.- The pizza was undercooked and overall bad. I got ill about 3 hours after eating and my girlfriend complained about her stomach hurting, ending our evening early.Overall, my expectation was raised after Robert Irvine was there, but if that is Robert's sauce...he sucks as bad at this place does. The cheese sticks were good and seemed homemade. Other than that, I give our experience an F-.I had planned on delaying this review, but an article in the Post Gazette says that Del's will be closing on May 2, similar to other restaurants featured on Restaurant Impossible.  This makes me so sad because Del's is super super cheap and decent Italian.  My dad and I came in last Thursday, and contrary to other reviewers, most of the service was pleasant.  Our waitress was in a rush but totally competent, and the other employees were pleasant enough.  Maybe because they are closing?  Anyway, we got the $10 dinner buffet, which included unlimited soup, salad bar, bread, five entree choices, a drink, and dessert.  Does it get any better than that?The five entrees were delicious.  The Pasta Mafalda (Marinara and Alfredo sauce) was my favorite.  The chicken and eggplant Parmesan were delicious as well, and the scalloped potatoes were good.  I didn't try any soups, but the salad bar and bread were good too.  The brownie dessert hit the spot, as well.  I prefer the Italian at the Pleasure Bar up the street, but this was good and heavy Italian food on a graduate student budget!The owner has a valid point in the news article:  It's not that Del's food is bad, but a lot of people want to eat at only the most trendy restaurant.  Del's is old-fashioned.  I like it the way it is.I'm bummed Del's is on its way out, but I really enjoyed my meal here!

Even as a Chinese student, I never feel the staff have basic courtesy at all. Every day they serve you with their disgusting faces as if you never pay for your bill. When I see their faces I feel no appetite. This is the Chinese restaurant that I have WORST impression. When friends ask me to go eat Chinese, I must ask whether they are going to EVO. If they say Yes, I say No.

I've been 4 times. The first 2 the food was ok, the soda bread dry and tasteless and the service was no where to be found. The music has been decent the decor is what you want in a nice local pub but the last two visits made me realize this is only a place where you can go if you are white and know people behind the bar. I love Guiness and it's depressing to go to a bar and not get asked what you want to drink for nearly 20 minutes. I've many friends of varying ethinic  backgrounds express this same sentiment. Additionally, one trip resulted in us leaving because apparently we sat at a table that was reserved for "regular folks". Who knew that first come first seated and served doesn't apply - they should put up a sign.3.8 stars.Pretty good pub atmosphere, great chips and pretty good fish, especially for the desert.  My fish could best be described as a plank.  Three good size Cod fillets that were bonded together by the beer batter.  In the traditional English style, I prefer the Haddock fillets but you really only find that in England and New England.The batter was laid on a bit heavier than I care for but it was still good batter.  The chips were nice long slices...perfect.The tarter sauce was slightly sweet, I prefer it tangier.Portions were good, particularly for the fish.*fyi-Fibber McGee & Molly was an early and long running radio show and is considered by many to be a precursor to the modern sitcom.5/12/10Came in to try some happy hour eats (Fibber Magee's offers 50% off all apps and flatbreads between 4p and 7p).  To begin my dining experience, I found the darkness in the pub to be overwhelming (a word I'd rather use in this context is "oppressing," but I'm trying to lighten up!).  I wouldn't have minded so much (as I could've sat closer to the door left ajar, which allowed light to come in), but then the music blaring out of the speakers overhead was just too much!  To compound the situation, the song selections were either U2 (which I liked) or jarring Irish punk rock (which I don't), most of which were of the latter.  :(  Perhaps I should've walked away after making these observations, but I've had FM bookmarked for at least six years now, and I wanted to get it over with.After many inquiries about food preparation, the bread used (which company?  specific ingredients used?), etc., I decided I'd go w/ the crabcakes and the braised rib sliders.  The crabcakes (topped w/ roasted red peppers and garnished w/ wasabi and mustard mayo, the latter I opted out) also came w/ a side mixed greens salad and a citrus vinaigrette. While this dish wasn't the best-looking of all the dishes I had that afternoon- don't let the pic of the bread pudding fool you, it was the best-tasting, but this isn't saying much.  I didn't care for the watered-down flavor of the citrus vinaigrette, and frankly, the crabcakes had enough flavor, so the lack of dressing wasn't a big deal.  I don't know if I'd order them again, though...  What was a big let-down was the braised shortrib sliders' dish.  Now these sliders looked fantastic, but the shortrib pieces were so sinewy and/or fatty, that, as much as I tried, I couldn't chew through any!  I really wanted to like these, bec. of those gorgeous-looking fried onion strings that sat on top of each slider.  Thankfully, my server offered to swap them for something else, and it was w/ a little sadness that I said goodbye to those onion strings :'(Lately, mussels haven't appealed to me, so my server's suggestion to try FM's wasn't giving me much hope.   Surprisingly, these mussels tasted OK, and the price is right (for happy hour), and if I weren't already not disappointed in the darkness of the pub; the loudness of the music's volume; and the sub-par quality of the shortribs, I may have enjoyed them more.  With the hope of finding something good to write about, I ordered the bread pudding.  (At this point, I should've just given up.)The bread pudding dish, which you'd think, looking at the pics I took, would taste good,  was a disaster!  It was dark in the pub, yes, but the dish looked like they just placed slices of bread down, showered them w/ dried cranberries, and poured some white chocolate sauce.  Something was amiss- was it even baked?  How was it prepared?  There wasn't enough cream sauce to cover most of the bread.  I was told that the bread was indeed soaked in the cream, and then baked, but this bread pudding had to be the worst I've ever tried.  The pics looked great, but don't be fooled...  The server was friendly, and most of the stars reflect her attempts to appease me, but I didn't enjoy my experience there, and would never recommend this place to anyone.I live a mile from here and trust me when I say I've been here a lot. It used to be our go to place for a quick dinner when we didn't want to cook. It also used to be the place we'd go for group get togethers in the back room. The bartenders and servers were always awesome and friendly, even remembering our names and favorite beverages. The food was pretty good, too. Now let's jump ahead to now. Over the last year new management has taken over. This was an Irish Pub and pretty authentic feeling, but the new owner has a family member who plays for the Seahawks (American) football team so it's quickly becoming an NFL sports bar. Happy Hour used to be from 4-7 which is great for those who work 8-4 and 9-5. Now they changed it to 3-6, which means by the time we start thinking of going out for appetizers and drinks, everything is full price again. Used to have great half price appetizers, but you can forget that now!My friend wanted a burger the other day and brought the 8year old with her. Was going to give the kid some of her burger, but the server said it was $2 to split a meal now. She's a little girl and barely eats anything, but the server was practically scared that her manager would find out. She said if her manager came out and discovered it, then he'd charge the lady for two meals. That's ridiculous!As I said, we used to come here all the time but this last year the changes have been terrible. I will be going elsewhere in the future.

Review Text :
Our Cow, who art in cow Heaven, Meat be thy Name. Thy Kingdom come. Thy will be done, on earth as it is in cow Heaven.  Give us this steak our daily Meat, and forgive us our slaughter, as we forgive those who slaughter us.  And lead us not into vegetarianism, but deliver us from hippies. For thine is the fields, and the Meat, and the glory, forever and ever.  Amen!The Meat Gods had really shined upon me this time. An all expense paid trip to Arizona with Mastro's as my first dinner. Sweet!! The hotel had called ahead to get us a table for 7 in the bar area, oops, they called the wrong Mastro's. Not a problem, as the staff here quickly made us a table. Once seated our CEO ordered bottle of wine #1 and I got a Grey Goose tonic as well. That's when I notice the lounge singer! There was this guy in the corner of the bar just butchering every top 40 song from 1970-1990. Total American Idol first round reject, but mildly entertaining with his wretchedness. Our server was also a fun kooky guy, I wish I could remember his name to give a shout out, oh well.We then got down to the nitty-gritty, the food. I smelled a few sizzling plates as they passed by and new anything I ordered would be top notch. I opted for the ever fatty and best cut of meat in my opinion, bone in ribeye. 22ozs of wonderfully marbled meaty goodness. Along with that our table ordered a half dozen oysters, giant shrimp cocktail, I got my own Caesar salad with anchovies, and there were some veggies that never made it to my end of the table. -  The oysters were spot on. Just a dash of horseradish, lemon and hot sauce perked them right up.-  The shrimp cocktail contained some of the largest shrimp I've ever seen! Just eating three of them would have filled up any mere mortal. -  My ONLY complaint with Mastro's was my salad. I love anchovies in my Caesar and they were happy to add them, but they gave me whole, oily fillets. The little guys needed a quick rinse and then should have been shredded in my salad. Oh well.Next came the meats. Behold the power and the glory that are lumps of flesh sizzling on a 400 degree plate!http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bdCByYMU8ZZhvhqfGo_UVQ?select=ORYu-cLe0SxineXThaNuYAOur server saw me trying to take a picture and he was gracious enough to shine a light on my prize so I could better document the momentous occasion. The ribeye was as good as steak can get. The fat had rendered into the meat and made it extra tender and delicious. The edges had nice little crusty bits and just the right amount of seasoning. Oh lord it was good. Along with the meats, CEO man had ordered bottle of wine #2, I ordered vodka tonic #2 and servers were heaping portions of spinach, asparagus and mushrooms onto our meat plates. As I neared the end of my hunk of sizzling love, I felt massive meat induced coma coming on. Thinking I would have no room for dessert, I ordered a white Russian to top off my meal and to send me into a tipsy meat sleep. But oh no! CEO man ordered 5 desserts for our table! And damn they were good! The chocolate cake was so good that we ordered a second slice as we finished the first one. Along with dessert, Italian CEO man felt that we should all have some Tuaca to top off dinner. I ended up having two since someone did not like theirs. I left happier and slightly drunker than I've been at dinner in a long time. An absolutely spectacular dinner!I can't believe I haven't reviewed Mastro's! This is hands down my favorite steakhouse in Phoenix and one of the restauranst I pick for a special occasion. Mastro's is the triple threat with excellent service, ambiance and food. Be warned that reading this might put you into a food coma. The food here is delectable and delicious. I don't think you can go wrong with anything on the menu but just be warned that it's very easy to fill up on the pretzel bread and salads before your entree event comes out! My favorite salad is the Mastro's House Salad and Wedge Salad. Both are tasty and both are very filling so be prepared that you might be stuffed! As for entrees, of course the steak is the best way to go but only if you are ok with getting it cooked medium well or less. It practically melts in you mouth! Other musts on this menu are the Gorgonzola Mac N Cheese, Lobster Mashed Potatoes and Warm Buttery Cake. If you only come here and order the sides and dessert, you will leave a happy person!Service here is always excellent and it's always a lively, yet romantic atmosphere. The bill will add up, so be prepared to pay for this experience but if you are looking for a dinner to celebrate a special occasion, make a reservation here!Yelpers gave Mastro's Steakhouse some rave reviews.  So, of course, my boyfriend and I had to try it.WOW!  The food, ambiance, and service were excellent!My boyfriend had the ribeye steak with creamed spinach, and we shared the lobster mashed potatoes.  I had the clear lobster roll and the New York pepper steak.Everything was wonderful, and Mastro's high ranking is well deserved.It's pricey, but you get value for your dollar here.We shall return!

Sometimes you eat at the three star restaurant and other times the three star place eats you. I like to try restaurants with a 3 star or 3 1/2 star average. It does two things, reminds me of why I eat at four and five star spots and that sometimes the masses are wrong. In this case, the masses were right. Stopped at Yummy Sushi out of convenience. The first sign of inferior food should be the name, "Yummy". I went in and fully intended to try sushi, but instead ordered the spicy ramen with added pork for an extra $2. I also ordered the steamed beef dumplings. The Ramen broth was actually very good. A nice amount of spice and a decent depth of flavor. A few off putting things, chopped red bell peppers (I have never seen this type of pepper used in an Asian styled soup before), and the ramen noodles tasted like they were from a $.25 dorm room favorite. Beyond that, the pork was tender and the other veggies in the ramen were decent. Nothing to recommend so far.The steamed dumplings were a little chewy and flavorless, but when drowned in the provided sauce, they were meh.HIGHLIGHT: The service was crazy fast and super attentive. If it wasn't for this, you would be reading a two star review right now. If I could, I would give a two and a half stars, but I'm nice and always round up.

Review Text :
Kobe (Koe-Bay).We haven't been to one of these places for a teppan performance/meal in quite awhile.  We last went to one about 3 years ago in Boston.  Prior to that was about 5 years ago in Denver.  Before that was Cleveland about 9 years ago.  Based on that, look for another teppan review late in 2012 from either Chicago or Seattle - I haven't decided yet but the fares are good that far out.Our chef Gabriel did a nice job on both the food and the performance.  There was plenty of throwing things in the air, spinning various implements around, flashes of fire, smoldering onion volcano's and tidbits tossed to the folks around the table who tried mostly successfully to catch as well as our dog.  Gabriel also rewarded folks with a nice shot of sake from his squirt bottle.  I actually had enough of these to have a nice sake buzz going.  That's right - I catch food like a dog better than the other folks at the table.  A fact I'm not sure I should be proud of.I ordered the filet & shrimp.  It came with miso soup which was fair and lacking very much tofu, a small and plain salad with a pretty mild ginger dressing, grilled shrimp appetizer and white rice.  This is the only teppan meal I have had that does not include fried rice - it is a couple bucks extra.  I opted for the fried rice which was pretty good.  The shrimp (both the appetizer and those that came with the main course) were tender and tasty.  The filet was not as tender but still tasty.Overall, not a bad deal for the meal & show.  I frankly have grown a bit weary of these but it is fun to go with kids or teppan virgins.I had gift certificates to this place and wanted to eat healthier so it was decided that my wife, Kathy R., my grandson and I would head here for lunch. My wife got the Kobe steak & lobster, Kathy R. got the kobe steak, my grandson got the kobe steak and lobster and I had the kobe steak.  All the meals come with: Miso soup, salad, choice of white or chicken fried rice and grilled veggies. When you go to a teppenyaki restaurant, you don't really go for the food, you kind of go for the entertainment. but this place served Kobe beef. Kobe beef is known for being lean, lower in cholesterol than chicken or turkey. it is known as  Healthy beef? In fact all of us  commented that the steak was so succulent it melted in your mouth.Kobe has community seating...(The tables are designed to fit 8 people) You are seated next to other parties around the chef and the chef comes by after all orders are taken. Then in addition the chef brings all fresh ingredients to the table and cooks it for you on the spot with various tricks! The show is very impressive.  The "show" is the checf who cooks in front of you.  In this case he also pulled tricks with knives and fire to keep us all entertained.My steak was cooked perfectly and melted in my mouth. There is nothing like Kobe Steak. The Miso soup was excellent, the salad was so so,  the grilled veggies were ok. It also came with white rice which I did not eat. I only had a few bites of everything and took a lot home with me for later.  One last thing about the meal sevral people at our table ordered fried rice so  we were given the opportunity to try some since the chef made extra. I must say even though I only had a bite OMG it was good. It had to be the best fried rice I've had in many years. FOOD:  If you rate the place strictly on food, then it's not that spectacular. But you're not here solely for food. You come here for an experience. PRICE: The prices are reasonable. SERVICE: After we got seated the waitress immediately gave us menus and asked us for our drinks/orders. She was welcoming, and  was always right there when we needed her to be. She was simply excellent,  efficient, and friendly.  AMBIENCE:  Overall I enjoyed the restaurants environment and vibe! Perfect for families and group celebrations! It's pricey but you gotta keep in mind you're also paying for the entertainment and its unique service. CONCLUSION: This restaurant is fun for birthdays, Anniversaries, special occassions, group outings, couples, and kids. It's entertaining and the food tastes great.   RETURN FACTOR: 100% will definitely be back here but only for a special occassion..

Review Text :
Is the food good?  Unless you're Filipino, the answer is a resounding no!  For some reason, this place is like catnip for my Fiancee and her Filipino family.  The clear standouts that make this place worth the trip are:1. Cheesiness.  No more cheesy than your average fast food place, but this is Pinoy cheese!2. Chicken Joy.  This is some damn fine fried chicken.  I'll give them that.3.  It will make your Filipino in-laws happy!4.  It is a quick and easy way to get some halfway authentic Filipino food somewhat easily.  Give it a shot, I would even suggest driving across town for it, but you probably won't need to go twice.ps.  I plan on copying and pasting this review into every Jollibee I've ever had the pleasure of being forced in to, just so you can see what I am subjected to on every vacation.  *sigh* the things we do for love.Another Chicken & Burger joint that has popped up over by Boulevard Mall...so I decided to give it a go.Located inside the Seafood Supermarket I had NO IDEA it was a filipino fast food franchise..It simply READ Chicken & Burgers...I don't really have much to say on this one....I barely got past the smell of the burger to take the one bite I tried before spitting it out. Definitely an acquired taste because the place was packed and everyone else seemed to be enjoying the chicken meals not too many eating burgers:(I watched Anthony Bourdain's new show "Parts Unknown" on CNN, and in this week's episode it was on Koreatown in LA. After watching this, I was starting to plan my foodie road trip to Los Angeles. I saw that he visited a Jollibee on that episode, and I remembered that there was one in Vegas. I went to the one here, so that it would help save some time when I get to LA (also to help save my stomach). I stopped by before going into work to get some food, to go.This Jollibee is located in the Seafood City supermarket between Flamingo and Twain on Maryland. You can't miss it because it has a huge sign, and it is right next to the Best Buy. Parking here can be tricky, sometimes the lot is packed, and other times there is plenty of parking near the store. After you walk in, there is Chow King on the left, and Jollibee is on the right.Jollibee is actually a chain of fast food stores. It is considered to be the "McDonald's" of the Philippines. There is a menu full of items: sandwiches, fried chicken, entree's, breakfast items and desserts. I wanted to try the same item's from the show, so I picked out an Amazing Aloha Burger, a little big bite Spam sandwich, and a Halo-Halo. There is a counter similar to fast food places where they take your order, and after ordering, the'll give you a number and you pick up your food when they call your number out. My order was done pretty quickly, and the employee's were nice.Amazing Aloha Burger - A large burger that comes with Aloha sauce, patty, lettuce, cheese, bacon, and pineapple. The advertisement picture is misleading, you only really get a quarter of a slice instead of a round slice, of pineapple. The burger itself was very good. The meat was tender, and the lettuce was fresh. The Aloha sauce was more on the sweeter side, and it complimented the sweet-sour taste of the pineapple pretty well. The bacon was the key, it tied all the flavors together, without it, it would be a boring burger. The only complaint would be that I wished the pineapple slice would have been the same size as the one in the advertisement. But other than that, it was a good burger for a fast food joint.Spam little big bite - A slider made from a sweet roll, with mayonnaise. This one was OK. The bun tasted very similar to a Hawaiian roll, but just bigger, and was coated with a light sprinkle of cornmeal. It was toasted as well. The spam was a little bit more salty than what I am used too, but it was OK. For 1$ each, it was a pretty good deal.Halo-Halo - I think that almost every culture in the world has a version of a sweetened icy dessert. This one came with shaved ice, sliced fruits, red beans, fruit jelly, and flan. This version at Jollibee has a predominant coconut flavor, and is very refreshing. It was good.For all 3 items I spent about 10.50. It was a good deal for the amount of food I received. The food was good, and so was the service.So you wanna eat at Jollibee huh?Coming from a Filipino, here's all you need to know. These guys are known mainly for their Fried Chicken, Sweet Spaghetti, Burgers, Hot Dogs and desserts. They have other items as well but these mentioned are what you will mainly see people eating when you go there. They also have all sorts of breakfast items as well but is only served during breakfast hours. Here is a link to their complete menu just in case you were wondering. http://www.jollibeeusa.com/menu.htmlWhenever you see a Jollibee, in most cases you will see a Chow King and a Red Ribbon as well because all three are basically the same company. Now Chow King and Red Ribbon are completely separate reviews so lets talk about Jollibee.Now why is it that most chains that originate from other countries just don't have the same appeal when they open locations abroad? I have always asked that myself. Could it be that something was "Lost in translation?" LOL. Anyways, the most common reason people come here is for the crispy fried chicken that comes in either mild or spicy aptly named "Chickenjoy". Now to many non Filipinos, when they get their order for the first time, they are surprised that it comes with gravy. Ironically, they are even more surprised that it tastes good with it! I for one think of biscuits, ham, or turkey with gravy. But chicken? Hay, don't knock it til you try it.As for their Spaghetti, its definitely not what you are used to. Filipino style Spaghetti is kind of a sweet style of ketchup with sliced American hot dog slices and ground beef. Again that seems like a weird combination but in most cases you will be pleasantly surprised.As for the prices, well the last time I ordered it was two 8 piece buckets. One was spicy and the other was mild. Total came out to about 23 bucks and change. So it was 11 dollars a bucket. Why is it so expensive you ask? Beats me. The only thing I can think of is that there aren't too many Jollibees around and the fact that each piece of spicy chicken has to have a little "spicy" flag on it tells me they have one specific person that does that and only that all day. So that person needs to get paid. LOL.Service? Well it's pretty much the same as whatever other fast food chains you would patronize. Obviously the more packed the place is, the longer you gotta wait for your food. I recommend to just call ahead and order to go so by the time you get there, wait times will be at a minimum.Last but not least. Desserts. For these guys, its simple. You have one of three choices. Halo Halo, Pearl Coolers, and Crispy Deep Fried Pies.Halo Halo (translated in English as "Mix Mix") - Shaved ice with evaporated milk, mixed with certain fruits, jelly, and flan, topped with a scoop of either Ube or Vanilla ice cream. Pearl Coolers - These are basically smoothies with boba or tapioca pearls. They usually have several different flavors ranging from Ube to Avocado.Pies - The best way I can describe these guys is remember when McDonalds used have their apple pies deep fried to a golden crisp? Well same set up here but different flavors. You got Peach Mango or Banana LangkaSo overall an ok 3 star rating is my pick because the food is decent but a bit pricey. The fact that its a chain can significantly drop it to a 2 but these guys do a decent job of trying to serve the same authenticity as its original base in the Philippines.Everyone should know (at least my fellow Filipinos should, anyway) that fast food restaurant with the red-and-yellow bumblebee as a mascot. Jollibee is a must if you're craving Filipino-style fried chicken, which I admit is better than all the fast food chains serving fried chicken.I ordered the C1 combo (two pieces of fried chicken, your choice of a side, and a drink). I decided to get one spicy and one mild to taste the difference. Everything was at the perfect temperature. The chicken was what I was expecting from Jollibee, tender and juicy. The skin (the best part) was crunchy and flavorful. The spicy chicken was actually spicy; it tasted more on the sweet side which went well with the heat of the spices. The mild chicken was the same, juicy and full of flavor. Honestly, I'll just stick to ordering the mild chicken because the spiciness can be a bit overbearing (it lingers on your tongue a lot longer than usual).This place will probably be packed when you visit, so if you're dining in you better grab a seat fast! Employees weren't really the nicest and there were flies in the dining room (which we had to shoo away periodically), but I think if you're craving some good chicken then you should venture on inside the Seafood City market and order some Jollibee.

Review Text :
Nothing wurst than a bad weenie. No bun intendend. But every so often I get a hankering for a hot dog. A Chicago hot dog at that. In the windy city at Milwaukee and Devon sits SuperDawg and it is a site to behold. But I ain't in the Windy City. I'm in the Hot Blistering Sweltering City. And I didn't know where to go. And then I drove down Thomas and saw the Vienna Beef sign! That was it. That's what I needed. The universe had answered my calling. You ever enter a restaurant and immediately have the instinct that you should turn your ass around and leave quickly. Yea. Well I didn't listent to my gut. Cuz it was rumbling with hunger and I could smell the hot dogs steaming. The place wasn't clean. Ok, it was dirty. Stained floors, rec room style paneling with splintering chunks of wood and vinyl chairs with duct tape. Hmmm...still not enough for me. So I get home with my Chicago style dog, with pepperoncini, neon relish, celery salt, tomatoes in a soft poppy seed bun with krinkle fries. Ate it in 90 seconds. Spent the next 40 minutes in my bathroom. You get the picture. Thank God for that Reader's Digest I found under the sink cuz I would have been real bored."Oh Johnnie's you're so fine, you're so fine you blow my ....weenie?" OK so it doesn't rhyme, but Mr. Chang, owner of Johnnie's is a force to be reckoned with. He smiles. He greets. Takes your order. Makes the food. And is obviously passionate about what he does. He even has homemade chocolate cake for less than $2 a slice! But it's about the Chicago dog for me. Neon green relish. Pickle. Tomato. Celery salt. Mustard. Onions. On a steamed poppy seed bun...which I'm sure will cause me to test poz for opiates. For less than $4 you get your weenie and some delish fries! I'm so glad I went back and can't wait to have a Chicago dog made by an Asian man in the desert!

Restaurant name  Tipp's 88 Thai Restaurant

Review Text :
I'm all about venturing out and trying new places in Tempe lately, and my latest find did not disappoint!  I remember that the location where Tipp's 88 Thai Restaurant now lives used to be Ichiban.  I never dined there, but Tipp's seemed to settle right in... the atmosphere was clean, warm, and welcoming.We were there at prime lunchtime on a Monday (today) and they seemed to be doing pretty consistent business.  We sat down right away and were given a visually appealing menu (as my companion pointed out and I agreed).  There was plenty to choose from including the traditional thai dishes and many more.  I noticed that there were many vegetarian options and 20 lunch specials.  I finally decided on the 'kang-ped' veggie with tofu, which is eggplant and veggies cooked in a red curry, coconut milk.  It was served with my choice of soup or salad (i went with salad), steamed white  rice, and an eggroll.  My friend had the pad thai which he said was really good.  I especially liked the salad... it came out first and was served with yummy peanut dressing.  The dressing seemed lighter than others I've had in town, and it was really tasty.  My entree was delicious as well.  Our waitress wasn't the most attentive (my water could've been refilled a few times more than it was), but we had a very good meal!  I'll be back for sure - maybe next time for dinner!***Please note - Tipp's 88 Thai Restaurant is closed on Sunday!  (I hate when you are craving something and go there only to find they are closed... maybe this will save you a trip!)

Restaurant name  Greek Patio

Review Text :
Their rendition of taboule ($6.49) is mostly parsley and a little light on the wheat and mint. Still, a refreshing starter and definitely enough for two or three people.I come here for the souvlaki sandwich, a generous portion of cubed, marinated pork bundled in a pita topped with onions, tomatoes and tzaziki. The sandwich ($7.99) is served with fries, which I like to dip in the tzaziki too!The baklava ($2.99) is OUT OF THIS WORLD! Soaking in a delicious rose water syrup... yummmmmmm!!!Summary: stingy on the feta cheese and too much use of dried spices.We started off our meal with a hummus app and 2 glasses of house wine (only $1.99/glass during happy hour, M-F, 4-7PM). No complaints about the wine and the hummus was decent.Next up we received our Greek salads. Not much feta in the salad, not much cucumber, not much green pepper (I think there was one in mine).For the main course, I ordered up the Greek spaghetti, which is one of my favorite Greco dishes. Again I was subjected to the attack of the missing feta, as they sparsely graced my plate with a few blocks of the good stuff. The pasta also had a good amount of dry spice mixed in with it, which wasn't very pleasing to eat.I really wanted to like the Greek Patio, especially since it's close by to my house, but due to the issues above, I'll be sticking with the Golden Greek and My Big Fat Greek Restaurant. It's worth the drive for me.

Review Text :
I know, I know.  Everyone in Pittsburgh is all into Pamela's breakfast.  But I just don't get it.  I don't like my pancakes crepe thin and extra greasy.  And I really don't like the crispy, crunchy edges.  That's pretty nasty to me.  And the lyonnaise potatoes, while good, are just potatoes.  My friend had an omelet that looked pretty good.  And I'll admit, I stole half a slice of his toast.  I'll probably go back, because it's a good location and the service and decor were both good.  But I'm not going to lose any sleep waiting to go back or craving this stuff.....Honestly, it's hard to say anything that hasn't already been said about this place. After all, Pamela's is widely known for serving the best breakfast in Pittsburgh, and for good reason. (Even President Obama approves.)Believe it or not, until this past weekend, it had been at least a couple years since I last ate here. Not that I had a bad experience or anything. I'm just an impatient person and get intimidated by the line, which sometimes on weekends gets wrapped all the way around the block.Decor inside has a nice, 50's diner throwback. Love checking out all the old black and white photos hanging on the walls.My all-time favorites on the menu? Any of the hotcakes, but particularly the banana and chocolate chip. And lyonnaise potatoes, which comes as a side for most of the protein-based menu items.However, this past weekend, while scanning the menu, I saw something new: Pittsburgh hash. Their lyonnaise potatoes mixed with kielbasa, sauerkraut and topped with Swiss cheese. It was a dream, and possibly the best meal I've eaten there. And that's saying a lot.I think this breakfast is best after a hard workout. Makes the calories more justified. I've eaten here after a night out once or twice, but the meal's decadence was too much while nursing a hangover. Haha.Everytime I visit Pittsburgh I must go here for their hot cakes. Love this place. They accept only cash and the wait is long during peak time on weekend.

Restaurant name  Sushi Brokers
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
I love sushi and I'm not the toughest critic when it comes to sushi, but I consider Sushi Brokers just average... The food is fine; I've never been overwhelmed by how fresh and delicious it tastes. but I've never been sick from it either...I go to Sushi Brokers for the convenience factor (they are located on Scottsdale Rd very close to the 101) and the atmosphere.  The service is just OK as well... but they must be doing something right, because the place was packed when I went in for dinner on Monday night.I took my boyfriend's sister; She is 16 and I figured the music they play would be right up her alley.  I was right!  She knew the words to every song that blasted through the restaurant.  We both had miso soup and we shared seaweed salad and some rolls including spicy yellowtail, eel and cucumber. scallops, and salmon skin.  We didn't order the lollipop roll. but that is my favorite 'specialty roll' on the menu.  Everything was fine... consistently fine.  We missed happy hour, but I've been in the past and I like happy hour prices much better than the $60 I dropped there without alcohol on Monday.  I'll continue going to Sushi Brokers for the fun atmosphere and convenient location.  People watching is fun too, and with big screens all around, I guess you could go to watch a big game on TV as well.  Just set your expectations accordingly and you'll be fine!It's been over a year since my last Sushi Brokers review and I've likely been in a few times since then... the food is always decent, the prices are not bad, and the atmosphere is fun, especially if you like loud music and people-watching.  However, I have to take off a star for the horrible service!I went in for dinner tonight with two girlfriends.  We arrived right after happy hour which likely explains why the place was packed, but luckily, we did get seated in a booth inside shortly after we arrived.  The hostess was nice enough but the wait staff? Not so much!  (I had to use the expression "not so much" since that is Jared's latest expression of choice when he is not satisfied with something).The wait staff was almost nonexistent... our menus were left on the table after we ordered, our dirty dishes were left on the table after we ate, we waited a very long time to get the check, and the bathrooms were pretty filthy too.So I know I don't give 2 star reviews very often, but I can't help myself on this one.  I hope that Sushi Brokers will read this and take my feedback with a grain of salt (or in this case, with a drop of soy sauce).What happened to this place???  Sushi Brokers used to (when I say used to, I mean a few years ago) be our go-to sushi spot and has now gone downhill to the point that the sushi is not even edible anymore.  We stopped going there regularly but would stop in on occasion to see if there had been any improvement only to find even poorer quality sushi.   Our last experience there will definitely be the last time that we ever set foot into this place.  We ordered some yellowtail sushi and the lollipop, cowboy, and summer rolls, although we received a surfer roll instead of the summer.  None of the sushi was the slightest bit fresh and the shrimp dynamite that came on top of the surfer roll was filled with crunchy bits of tail and shells.  The lollipop roll, which used to be our favorite, tasted so fishy and disgusting that we couldn't even eat it and we left afraid that we would end up with food poisoning from the rotten fish.I would rather eat sushi from a grocery store than Sushi Brokers (and I can't stand grocery store sushi!).  It really is a shame to see what used to be a good place turn into such an all around disaster. If you're looking to try a new sushi restaurant, you'd be better off at just about anywhere else than here.I had so many ppl tell me Sushi Brokers would be a gr8 place to eat sushi at, especially having lived in Japan in for so long.  I believe Hiro Sushi, & have yet to find a find another place that can match them.  When we walked in, the loud, hellish music reminded me of RA - I hate RA & their wanna ambience.  Strike 1 against Sushi Brokers.The waitress was more intent on making a good impression with my boyfriend, who was wearing his "Retired from the Air Force" polo than she was in addressing me.  DEFINITELY STRIKE 2.  I was happy to sign the check AND leave her a $.01 tip in her hand.  Yes, I walked up to her and personally delivered it.The fish was SPOILED. To the owners - if you don't know how to keep your fish at the right temperature, learn, and quickly.  Your fish tastes horrible.Happy Hour here is an actual joke. There should be rules about fair happy hour prices because anybody can say it's happy hour, but do you really mean it you sleazy restaurant owners. Yeah the Long Island ice tea is $4, but after I mention that the thing has no alcohol in it, waitress admits that they use a pre-made mix. Very expensive drinks and beers only garner a $2 discount and the worst items on the food menu seem to be discounted most, like Tempura crap and endamme. I don't even eat Sushi, but my very "scottsdaleish" date did and she ate a $15 roll for Happy Hour!  Yes, she is a golddigger, but even that roll should be discounted. I suppose I could write it off as Scottsdale pricing, but not for Happy Hour. No 2nd date and no return to this establishment. Oh, our waitress was nice, would have must rather been on a date with her.I love this place. The sushi is always fresh which initially surprised me being in the desert. Definitely recommended.Tonight was one of the insulting, pathetic displays of customer service we have had.  My wifeis Gluten Free, and after clearly stating this to the server, and ordering a supposedly "gluten free" item (grilled mahi mahi on corn tortillas), they served the tacos on flour tortillas, and continued to insist they were corn tortillas.  The manager finally got involved and admitted they were flour tortillas, and the menu has a mistake.  For a Celiac, this is a pretty big mistake and can cause severe problems.  At this point, there was really nothing left to order except sashimi.  She also added on a salad, at which point the server asked if cucumbers are okay for gluten free!Clearly this restaurant needs to better train the staff on what this means.  The manager was also very unaccommodating and unapologetic.Unfortunately this is a place with decent sushi that we will never be in again due to their complete incompetence regarding accommodating special dietary requirements.Sushi brokers was my go to sushi restaurant  for the past 4 years. The service has always been terrible but I have been able too look past that as I favor all of their speciality rolls. This Sunday we went for Mother's Day and once again the service was terrible. Truthfully there are quite a few good servers out there I have no idea why sushi brokers consistently hires bad waitresses. I'm not a very difficult person but after 10 minutes with empty water and ice tea glasses, I finally had to ask the bus boy to please get us refills. This happened 3 times that night as our server was no where to be found. Anyway the worst part of the night and the reason for the review, was the food poisoning that I got within 30 minutes of eating. I have never been so sick in my life. We ordered the sushi pizza, the spicy tuna and the cowboy roll. All which contain raw tuna. We noticed for the first time that the sushi didn't have the usual fresh taste it normally does but ate it anyway. Big mistake. When dealing with raw fish you should be held to a different standard. I feel sick just thinking about how violently ill we got from eating here. Suffice to say we will not be returning and advising our friends to avoid sushi brokers as well.First time here and not too sure what to expect. Walked in and the place is packed. Booths and bar tables. The place is loud with some good music playing. Let me clarify. Place was loud with everyone eating, drinking and having a good time. Very upbeat environment. We started out by ordering the eel cucumber roll, Shrimp Tempura roll, and Rainbow roll. I know my bad, I forgot to order the Surfer. Next time. The sushi was really good. Fresh and good. My wife really like the shrimp tempura but I'm not picky. Liked them all. I ordered the fish tacos. The soft tortillas were a little hard and the salsa was a little overpowering. Didn't taste the fish as much as the salsa. So the tacos were okay. Not great. My wife had the Yakisoba chicken. It had mushrooms, carrots, Broccoli, onions, and zucchini with thinly cut chicken. Loved the noodles and the sauce. Very tasty but the chicken was a little dry. Seemed like it was a little overcooked. My son had the teriyaki chicken dinner. He said the chicken was good and moist and he gobbled it all up. It came with rice and vegetables. I think it had zucchini, mushrooms and a ton of onions. Service was very good. Our server greeted us right away and got us our drinks. Our food came fairly quickly and he was constantly refilling our water glasses and checking up on us. So overall, really good sushi, okay dinner entrees and great service with a vibrant atmosphere. We enjoyed ourselves and will probably come back so I can order this famous Surfer roll (thanks Bonnie E)

I would give this place much less stars if not for the food.We came here for my dad's birthday and after reading some of the reviews for this place I wasn't really expecting much. To my surprise, the food was pretty good. But the service was terrible. I'll start with the good.We started with Zucchini fries which were delicious. They were perfectly fried and seasoned and the sauce really complimented them well. Between all of us we ordered a filet with vegetables, the crusted goat cheese salad, the lasagna, chicken parmesan and tortellini portabella with grilled salmon. Everyone really enjoyed their dinner, no complaints on any of the food! Then for dessert we shared a crème brulee and a chocolate chip cookie dough arancini with cinnamon ice cream. Again, everything was really yummy. My brother complained that the dough on the arancini was a bit too chewy but that was the only downfall.Now for the kicker. Our service was terrible. Not terrible in the "our server was rude and didn't care about us" sort of way but terrible in the it took us two and a half hours to get through dinner sort of way. We waited at least 20 minutes between each course. It was absolutely ridiculous. The place was pretty empty too. I can't imagine coming here on a busy night!So, like I said. The food was actually really tasty. But when I go out to dinner I don't expect to sit there wondering if our server forgot about us after each course. I won't be rushing back anytime soon.

Review Text :
We usually have gone to Jalapeno Inferno for lunch on Saturdays and one night a few weeks ago decided to go back and try it for dinner.  I asked for my Margarita like I always do there - Top Shelf on the rocks and - strained.  I don't like the pulp in their home made margarita mix.  I got the first one with all this icky pulp and just asked to have it sent back and just to strain it.  The owner came back and was so rude to my -- in front of our 2 kids no less - saying that he gave us the regular margarita since we didn't appreciate the fact that their mix is homemade.  I told him they strained it for me all the time on Saturdays - bless Patrick's heart.  The owner then told me he did not know how that was done.  I said "Well there's a little thing most bars have called a "STRAINER".  He said he didn't have one.  What???So forget the better tequila and the Gran Marnier that would normally be in my Top Shelf margarita.  I'm just some low life that didn't deserve that I guess.  So I find out -- this guy is the OWNER that treated us this way.  We have been there every Saturday at lunch with the 4 of us spending easily $100 a week -- through the slow summer when no one was there and everything.  Yes, good tamales and food in general.  But I'd rather eat in a barn than pay for rude service and line that owners pockets with my money.  We've never been back...I'm no sissy, but Jalapeño Inferno Bistro's Inferno salsa had me in tears!JIBM is located in a strip mall in the middle of no wear in Scottsdale, Arizona. Since it was such a warm, beautiful night, my fiancé and I decided to eat dinner on their outdoor patio. Since we ate outside, I'm not too sure how big the inside of this place is or what it looks like. Right when we were seated we were given a big bowl of complementarity chips and salsa. The great thing about JIBM's chips is that they give you both corn and flour tortilla chips. I love flour tortilla chips and since not many Mexican joints offer them, I ended up going through at least three bowls. Their salsa was really chunky and loaded with veggies, which is the way I prefer my salsa. I also got a side of their famous inferno salsa. This salsa was dark green in color and looked really watered down but to my surprise that watered down green salsa tasted like it was made in the fiery pits of hell. One bite set my mouth a blaze. Sadly, this salsa was all heat and no flavor, so I didn't touch it for the rest of the evening, which kind of bummed me out because I love hot stuff.  Since it was happy hour when we arrived, we decided to take advantage of their half off any appetizer special and order their South of the Border Platter, which usually cost $12.99 but we got it for 6.99. This is what this appetizer consisted of:Cheese QuesadillaGreen Corn TamaleMini Red and Green Chile BurritosChicken Mini Chimichangas Espinaca Con Queso and Beans (Cheese Dip)Besides the quesadilla, which was just OK, all of these items were really tasty, especially the tamale. This tamale is made with sweet white corn masa and filled with Mexican cheeses and green chiles. It was really, really good. In fact, their green corn tamale's have won the Best of Phoenix award for best tamale's.For dinner I ordered their signature Fundido and my fiancé got their Verde Valley Spinach Enchiladas. My fundido was made with a huge flour tortilla that was filled with delicious marinated steak, grilled onions and peppers and then deep fried and covered with an amazing jalapeño cream cheese sauce. My Fundido was wonderful, especially the jalapeño cream cheese sauce, which had an amazing flavor. My girl's enchiladas were stuffed with spinach and a slightly spicy cream sauce and topped with red enchilada sauce, espinaca con queso sauce and toasted almonds. Oddly, I did not try her meal but she said it was really good. Their rice and beans were good too.Besides the disappointing inferno salsa, my only other problem with this place is that all they have to drink is Pepsi products. They do not offer any aguas frescas like horchata or jamaica, which made me sad.  The service here was great. Our waitress, although very busy, always made sure we had everything we needed. She was also extremely friendly and even had a great sense of humor. The prices here were also really good. If your ever find yourself driving down Scottsdale road and happen to pass by JIBM, do yourself a favor and stop your car and grab a bite to eat. This place is definitely worth checking out if your in the area.AMAZING! We tried this restaurant because of a Groupon and will keep coming back because of the amazing food. The chili relleno was the best I have ever had and I lived in New Mexico for a year and never found one that came close to this place! Warm monterey jack cheese oozed from my chili with shrip and just a light batter. The fundido dish was very good as well. Just a kick of jalapeno and lots of cream cheese. The atmosphere was great. Service was fantastic. Several people checked on our table to make sure we were good. The complimentary chips and salsa were yummy, they don't just put regular chips, there were a different variety that were more like a crisp and they were yummy! They also gave us a card for $5 off our next visit which will be soon! This was probably the best mexican food I have had ever!I hate to be the Bad Guy. But, I have to tell it like it is.We were out in North Scottsdale and turned to Yelp for some Ideas for Mexican Food.Seeing 3 people that I know had visited this place and given them great reviews, we thought we would give it a try.Located in the middle of a shopping center, it looked nice,with a big outdoor patio. We went inside and were greeted by a male host who said we could help ourselves  to any table we liked on the Patio.I went to use the restroom to wash my hands before we ate. The ladies was nice and clean and very nicely decorated, I noticed some interesting art work on the walls on the way back to my table. This is where the good times end.Our Waitress ( I think it was Cyvannah) or something close to that, came right away and asked if we were ready to order. We said no,it was our first time there. We had not read the menu, but we ordered an Ice Tea and hot coffee. We got chips and salsa and our drinks. My coffee was old ,the bottom of the pot. It tasted it and there were grounds all in the bottom of the cup. My water glass had a big lip print on it. (NOT MY COLOR). So I never touched that. The Coffee mug was filthy as well. You can see from the photo I took of both of them. Because, later I asked if I could have a 2nd cup of coffee and our server said she would have to make another pot. Since that was the last of it she had given me. Well, there you go, I knew it.Yes, I would love another cup,thank you. I was thinking ,this will be great I will get a real cup of coffee this time. Almost 20 min later she brought it. The cup was just as dirty. Does this place not have a dish washer(machine) because, nothing seemed cleaned.Our food came no later than 5 min.after we ordered it. It took longer to get our to go boxes than the food that was to go in it. When she brought it ,she said,"Careful it is really hot". Well the dishes were hot not the food on them. Meaning they had all been microwaved.I ordered Chicken Soup. It was supposed to be spicy. when she put it down in front of me there were multi colored bubbles all over the top of it. I said, "wait, what are all these bubbles"? She said that happened while she was walking with it , it made Bubbles. Plus it is hot, that is the Bubbles.I took and spoon and scraped the bubbles off. They were soap bubbles.I did taste the soup, it was barley warm, and was not spicy. So either there was soap in the soup or the bowl when the soup was placed in it.My Dining Partner ordered and enchilada with rice and beans. The rice was old and dried out as you will see in the photo as well. We also ordered a sampler platter so we could try a little of every thing. Which everything on that as well seemed as if it was made before and reheated in a microwave.Nothing was good and nothing was hot. even the Cheese Crisp all the tortilla broke apart like it was days old. Fresh tortillas do not do that.The chips and salsa are good , but if you are gluten intolerant, don't eat the Flour chips, they are mixed in with corn ones. Our waitress never came back to check on us till the end. I had wanted Corn tortillas with my meal. I had been given flour. She brought those along with our check. Knowing that we were done with the meal. Looking back that day. I wish we would of asked to speak to the Manager. Maybe he or she was not there that day. Maybe that is why everything was so bad. We paid $50.00 for this mess including tip.Our waitress seemed very pre occupied with something else , somewhere else. There was another girl working the patio with long dark red hair. She was very on top of her tables and taking really good care of her people. So it was just us that had Cyvanaah on the patio.Anyway, it was a horrible experience and one that we paid a lot for as well. Check out the photos , I think you will be horrified. We both felt sick that night. I know it was from the food and I only ate a little.I am guessing that most people like it here for the Drinking ,the Happy hour. Because, I do not know how they could stay in business with dirty dishes and bad food.I used to come here a lot because they are so close to my home, however, this is not a destination for me anymore.  Last time we came here it was for my parenting group's moms night out.  The food is not very good, the service is mediocre.  Some of the margaritas are still good, but not enough for me to want to come here.  So sad!

Review Text :
i'll break it down loosely and to the point.party of 16, good atmosphere, attentive for the most part during the orders. we obviously had a prefix 3 course menu since it was so many of us. had the spiced ahi tuna  which was really great, my main entree was the halibut and if i'd known it was going to be bland i'm sure i would not have ordered it, i ate about 1/3rd of it only and wasn't taken back by it at all, sadly. being a fan of cream spinach i ordered it as my side dish, it was ok but i've had better, no dis to the chefs. everyone just has different likings. the dessert creme brulee was great. service could have been better without a doubt. i had a blast because we were all there as friends, its not like we sit around and point out flaws. work it out aureole, work it out.Let's face it - when you go to Vegas, it's all over the top. It's not enough to be a great restaurant. You need a gimmik to make it noteworthy and to stand apart from the competition. Chef Charlie Palme's Aureole has chosen wine as their over the top signature statement.I could talk about the food, but I would have to say it's about par with the rest of the Vegas scene. Good juicy steaks, etc. I was dining on a prix fixe menu, as I was with a large group. My options were typical (an ahi appetizer, a filet, and a nice dessert). So my knowledge of the menu is limited, but I was very happy with what they offered, and my meal.Now, let's jump to the fun part - their take on wine.Aureole decided not to bury their 10,000 + bottles of wine selections in a basement or cellar. Instead, they opted to encase it in an acrylic tower that spans four stories (42 feet) through the center of the restaurant. When you enter the restaurant, you pass by this absolutely amazing tower of wine, displayed for all to see - from all four sides. Yes, it's cool to look at. But even MORE COOL? How they retrieve the wine. A beautiful woman, dressed in a sleek black leotard is hoisted up like a trapeze artist for every bottle. She is referred to as the "Wine Angel" and she's absolutely delightful to watch. Every time a bottle of wine is ordered, it's retrieved by the Wine Angel. She's a mesmerizing acrobat as she flies up within the encased tower, plucking your order out of her acrylic Heavens.You can also ask for the "wine tablet" which is an electronic wine menu. It sounds cooler than it is - as it had a bad user interface. I'd prefer to tip the wine angel $20.00 & tell her to reach for something tasty!Overall - review? Do go to Aureole once - or at least walk in to see it. The wine angel is something we've all dreamed about!!I'm not gonna lie, I'm pretty horrified by the experience I just had at Aureole.  I've been there for happy hour and it is fantastic.  Two for one small plates, wine and cocktails are pretty amazing.  And those sirloin sliders are unbelievable (the two stars are for those...and the happy hour).  But I have to say, the dinner experience was just weird and offensive.To start, I walked in and spoke to the host stand to let them know that our party would have one more for dinner.  It was then told that they did not have my reservation.  That was strange, I'd booked with Open Table and had mysteriously already received the points.  Turns out they found my reservation and told me that my party was already seated.  I guess I looked at them funny and they pointed at the table.  Turns out "I" was sitting with four people I had never seen before.  So they gave my table away.  No big deal, they weren't that busy, but it was weird that they argued with me that I'd already been seated when I was standing in front of them.So they said they'd prepare another table while we waited patiently in the bar.  After 30 minutes, no one came to get us so we checked in again...and finally got our table.  You know it's a bad sign when the first thing out of your server's mouth is a giant sigh.  Then he said, "cocktails, wine?"  No greeting, no smile, no nothing.  We asked for the wine list and he stared blankly at us.  We replied that we had no menus but that didn't seem to matter either.  So much for that Wine Spectator award.  They have a lot of great wines but you wouldn't know it, the servers have no clue about them or no desire to talk about them.  After being pressured into ordering beverages, we finally got menus.The menus are pretty simple and don't go into a lot of detail.  When the server came back he asked if we would like for him to talk about the menu.  We said yes and he proceeded to explain that they had a tasting menu and an a la carte.  And that was it.  When we asked for suggestions, he muttered something about being really busy.  Then he asked where we were from in a condescending tone.  Ummm...really?  WTF difference does it make?!  You'd think we'd walked in with fanny packs covered in condoms and suckers from a bachelorette party.  After answering no questions, another server came by and asked if we were ready.  When we asked him to talk about the menu, he went into the same spiel about there being a tasting menu and an a la carte.  Yes, we can read, but what about the things ON the menu???  They kept asking if we were ready but wouldn't answer any questions.  At that point, the bread guy was looking like he'd be a more promising server.  It was seriously like pulling teeth.  One even made a snide remark while walking away.  Most places love to talk about the menu, not this place.I'd reached a point where I really wanted to walk out.  I'm in Vegas for business quite a bit more than I'd like and I know that almost anywhere else would provide better service.  My friends ultimately decided we would stay and we placed our orders.Long story short-er, my octopus and hearts of palm salad had two slivers of hearts of palm and fishy, chewy octopus (I actually asked my friends what was supposed to come with the octopus because I could not remember and the only other main ingredients on the plate were cherry tomatoes & fingerling potatoes.  What is with this place and fingerling potatoes anyway?  They're in everything, but anyway).  My veal loin was overcooked despite my ordering it prepared as the chef saw fit and it was lukewarm.  The only good part of the meal is that this place seems to always send over comp desserts.I know everyone's so amazed by the wine angels, but I would have had a better experience watching the rock climbing wall at the gym.I now hate this place.  We were treated like an inconvenience rather than valued guests.  I miss Fleur de Lys, I really hope they reopen it.  If they don't and you absolutely must go to this place, only go for happy hour, otherwise you will end up leaving pissed and sorry you wasted your time.Impressive and innovative, a 5 star review on Yelp easily.Forget the buffets, forget the meal coupons- If you're looking to really class up your Las Vegas experience then look no further. This is 5 star dining at it's best- a beautiful, one of a kind restaurant. Know for their famous 'Wine Tower', Aureole has AAA Four Diamond awards and Michelin Stars all over the place.This was my first time at a Charlie Palmer restaurant, and it lived up to the expectations. The flavor in the food was as delicate and unique as you would expect. Flavors that open your palette to new things, tastes you've never experienced before. My tip- go before the Lion King show. They have a 'happy hour' with half off small plates until 7pm. I recommend the Lobster Corn Dog- the only way to describe it; droolworthy.I'll get the good part out of the way first. The food, overall, was pretty good. I had the parallel tasting menu, which included shrimp two ways (ceviche with avocado, crispy with chili sauce), roasted sea bass, rabbit with truffles and fettuccine, beef loin, sweetbreads, and macaron and creme brulee for dessert. The rabbit and the desserts were the main standouts for me. My friend had the wine pairing along with it, but he said the pairings were not all that great.The other highlights food-wise were the onion soup served in puff pastry, and the dessert sampler. Okay. Now for the rest. I hope you're not going anywhere.The service here was ATROCIOUS. Call me crazy, but if I'm dining at a one Michelin star restaurant with a group of people whose tab is over $1100 bucks, am I wrong to expect service that's better than my local Chili's? I guess so.We were seated by one waiter/captain and ordered drinks. My friend's wife ordered a glass of wine, and another person ordered a cocktail (amaretto sour). We then proceeded to order dinner. About half the table wanted the tasting menu, while the other half wanted to go ala carte. The waiter said that would be just fine. We also indicated that we were going to be paying separately...also told that would be fine.Food service began. Those that ordered the tasting menu got their food first. The head waiter/captain (different guy now) failed to describe all of the courses after they were served. He totally flubbed the dessert course...basically seemed like he had no idea what they were serving. The half of the table that ordered the tasting menu got almost all of their food before the other half got theirs, so half of our party just sat there twiddling their thumbs while the others ate.Finally the other food came out. Several people ordered steaks. None of them were asked if their steak was cooked to their preference. My friend's wife that ordered one glass of wine? She was brought two, for some reason. She also ordered a side dish that was never served. Throughout the meal, no water glasses were refilled. I had to ask each time for more water. Empty cocktail glasses sat unbussed. Breadcrumbs were never swept away. Empty sweetener packets were left on the table. After everyone had eaten, they brought out dessert menus. We looked but opted not to order anything. For some reason, two desserts were brought to our table. We thought that since no one ordered anything, these must have been given to us gratis. Nope! They showed up on our bill.Speaking of the bill. Like I said earlier, we had indicated that we were going to be paying separately. The waiter told us that he couldn't split it for us, but if we wanted to personally divide up the check he could put it on multiple cards. We gave in and did it. As we're tallying up the tab for everyone, head waiter dude comes back and basically chastises us, saying "you know, if you would have told me at the beginning of the meal that you wanted the check separated, I could have done it then. But now it's too late." Really dude? Fuck you.The last straw was when we finally had our bill sorted, everyone paid and signed. As we're leaving, dipshit waiter guy runs up to us claiming that one of us (me) hasn't paid. Bullshit. I said my bill is on the table. He says no, I never saw it. So I walk back to the table, and it's under a fucking napkin. Good job Einstein. Never thought to look there?The service at this restaurant is honestly one of the worst service experiences I've ever had. I almost feel like because we were a party of nine, and gratuity was automatically included, that they just said "fuck you we're getting tipped no matter what." If I'm dropping that much coin I expect things to run much more smoothly. It's a shame, because the food here isn't bad. But then again I've had much better for much cheaper. I can't imagine any reason I would ever come back here, especially with the multitude of other fine dining options available in Las Vegas.And if I ever see that worthless waiter again I'm gonna punch him in the balls.I've been told before that I'm "emotionally sterile". What does that even mean? Maybe, I'm not overly emotional, unreasonably dramatic, or fail to exhibit the cliched passion that comes with the warm fuzzies. Possibly, it's because I'm not googley eyed and in love and have yet to demonstrate the depths of true love. That may have all changed after my exceptional experience at Aureole. I'm in love with Aureole. I can now rant and rave and become emotionally obsessed with the rich and decadent life that I could lead with Aureole. Ever had a meal so good you think that you're going to faint from the deliciousness? Ever tasted something so good you literally had that elusive foodgasm? Not an easy feat, but damn you Aureole, I'm seriously sprung off of what you have serving up!First, let me just set the scene here. Mom, Susan 1 and I met at Mandalay for dinner. I had just come off my high of beating the house and I was ready to celebrate. We went to Strip Steak first and seeing that they had an hour wait, I remembered that incredible wine tower and boom! Dinner at Aureole was coming to fruition. We walked down the steps that curve along the wine tower-a pretty cool sight-down to the check-in stand. I wasn't in any condition for fancy dining-but it's Vegas-if you got the money, they got the goods. We were seated at a lovely table by the window. The sommelier came by and we ended up with a great bottle of Pinot Noir. Let's jump into our tasty meal.Cavier-Russian Golden Ostera served with toast, finely chopped onions, egg white and yolk and cream. Delicious-salty, briney and heaven with every bite! Let me just say that when I ordered the cavier, our server told us that they were out. Seeing the slight disappointment in my face, he excused himself only to come back a few minutes later and said he was SENDING someone to get my cavier from another restaurant on the property. WHAT?!? Roasted Butternut Squash with Succotash-Smooth, nutty and just spectacular! The succotash with arugula was so good!Roasted Chicken-served with black truffle jus-need I say more? The skin was crispy without sacrificing the moistness and flavor!Roasted Pork Chop with roasted tomatoes-Large portion, filling and well flavored!Duo beef filet with skirt steak-I like my steak medium rare-it came out the peerrrfect temprature and practically melted, and I mean melted in my mouth!Creamy Spinach Au Gratin-Susan's favorite! A great side-definitely very rich!Parmesan Fries-and dare I say I tasted some truffle oil in there? Dessert Sampler-Strusel Baked Apple-Yummy. Who doesn't love baked apple? It's the ultimate comfort food. Salted Caramel Bombe-Wow! Salt and sweet definitely go together here! Warm Molten Cake-I'm no chocolate lover, but I was giddy about this! Macaroon Tea Creme Brulee-a very different taste but surprisingly good!Tasting of Pumpkin-Spiced pumpkin cake, chocolate ginger pot de creme, honey caramel lollipop. All amazing!As if that wasn't enough-our lovely waiter, Jose brought us a large sampler of their sorbets to wrap up the night. The food was heavenly but it doesn't stop there. I don't hand out 5 star reviews just for anyone....The great food is just like great sex. Really satisfying and fun but probably won't keep me coming back unless there is some depth....And, like I said, I'm in love with Aureole...now let me tell you why....Our waiter, Jose was outstanding! Knowledgeable, warm and inviting! He not only brought us the sorbets but after drinking our bottle of wine-he brought me another glass of Pinot on the house! I told him how amazing our night was and thanked him for the experience. He then offered to give me, Susan and my mom a tour of the kitchen and to meet the chef!What? I didn't even know that things like this happened! My mom is currently in culinary school and the very thought of seeing the inside workings of one of Charlie Palmer's gems was something we could not pass up! Charlie Palmer of course wasn't there but we did get to meet Chef Vincent who was not only very accommodating but welcomed us in his kitchen! He even posed for a few pictures with us. He allowed us to take pictures of his kitchen and we sat and chatted for a bit. He even signed the menu and wrote  a small note for my mom. My mom's excitement was priceless-she is extremely passionate about her culinary studies and the look on her face was worth every single penny I spent at Aureole. To sum it up:Food-5 starsWine selection and the"angels" that grab the bottles-5 starsService-10 stars (it's my review, I can give 10 stars)Ambiance and experience-100 starsThank you to Aureole! I love you! Thanks to Jose and Chef Vincent as well!***The food at Charlie Palmer's Aureole varied from okay to below average; I think you could have a decent meal here but probably not a great one***Aureole definitely feels like a restaurant that might have been great when it first opened (though the standards and food quality are not there now).  The restaurant itself is nice.  The space goes beyond high ceilings with a massive glass wine tower.  The dining area is nice--it is contemporary and elegant (with white tablecloth) and there are big windows that provide a view of the outside greens.In terms of the menu, there are two tasting menus (a seasonal tasting menu and a parallel tasting menu, which presents a primary ingredient in two separate preparations on the same plate).  There is also an a la carte menu (with some nice sounding dishes).I had the parallel tasting menu because it sounded like an intriguing concept.  There were definitely bright spots, but there were also some average to below average courses (from the concept not being great to begin with or poor cooking of the ingredients and thus not yielding the appropriate flavor/texture).  Here is the rundown on the tasting menu:(Roasted baby beets, tangerines, herb cheese, bourbon maple syrup) This dish was good.  I really liked the flavorful and juicy beets as well as the creamy and lightly tangy cheese.  The tangerines were just okay (not as vibrant as they could have been).(Golden beet panna cotta, cured salmon, tangerine lace) The golden beet panna cotta was creamy and did have a mild beet flavor.  The cured salmon was okay in terms of flavor, but I would have preferred more freshness and moistness.(Diver scallop, white asparagus and scallop terrine, wild mushrooms, asparagus, yuzu froth, trout roe) I thought the scallop was good.  It was very fresh and moist and had a good outside sear (though it was a tad salty).  A lot of times, froths/foams taste of nothing, but the yuzu froth here was surprisingly strong.  With the slight saltiness of the scallop and the strong yuzu flavor, this dish was not as light as it should have been.The asparagus terrine was okay--I was not a fan of the gelatin-like texture and I thought it kind of tasted of nothing.  The garnishes of wild mushrooms, roe and asparagus were fine.(White asparagus, crispy Serrano ham, black peppercorn gastrique) I like how white asparagus pulls apart like green onions and these were a good representation of that (nicely cooked).  The Serrano ham was crispy and salty.  Like the scallops, I felt this dish should have been lighter in flavor.(Roasted Niman Ranch pork tenderloin, wrinkle potatoes, grilled baby leek, romesco sauce) This was a very below average dish.  The pork tenderloin was visibly overcooked and it was quite dry.  The sides and romesco sauce were not bad (the wrinkle purple potatoes were nice and tender), but they were not great either.(Pork sausage, crispy rock shrimp, steamed bun, cucumber salad) This dish seemed way too close to its Asian/Vietnamese basis.  The flavors and fragrances were okay, but I think you could get a much more flavorful and fragrant dish at a good Vietnamese restaurant.The only element that really stood out was the crispy rock shrimp--very moist but also a light and crispy outside.(Ginger beignets, poached strawberries, lychee sorbet, lime rind) The ginger beignets were very disappointing.  They were filled with a ginger custard.  And because of this, the kitchen had to probably chill the beignets.  Unfortunately, the beignets were not evenly warm.  They were half cold, which was disappointing (especially when you think beignet, you think something hot, light and fluffy).The lychee sorbet was cool and refreshing and I really liked the lime rind (small but very strong in flavor).(Coconut ginger vacherin, braised pineapple, vanilla Chantilly, meringue) This dessert was okay.  The vacherin was creamy and cool.  It was filled with pineapple and there was more of a pineapple flavor than a ginger flavor.  While I thought the dessert was kind of a standard dessert, I really liked the braised pineapple (sweet and not too tart), which looked like ginger.There was also an assortment of below average complimentary bread.In terms of service, the food came out at a good pace and the staff was attentive.  I thought the female servers were more personable and pleasant than my main male server (who was still polite).For a fine dining place with a notable chef backing it, the price for their parallel tasting menu was not as high as other similar Vegas spots.  The food was disappointing though and given the lack of quality, it felt overpriced.Aureole may have once been a good fine dining spot, but I am not sure if you can get a great meal here now.  If there was more attention to detail (and better cooking/preparation of the ingredients), you might be able to get at the very least a decent meal here.Aureole is located in Mandalay Bay (free parking structure).

Review Text :
I used to live down the block from this place and never stopped by. I mean, it seemed like a nice spot but I just never got to going. But I frequent Vegas regularly and decided to give this place a shot. Much to my demise.The hookah was mediocre at best (I've been to alot better in Vegas for half the cost). I ordered some food for myself and my date. I can honestly say the food was decent. The server was very accommodating. But looking back, I realize that they were TOO accommodating (you'll see why later). Then things went from good to horrible in a matter of a few minutes.After my meal, things started to change. The server kept urging my date and I to move from the "dining" section to the hookah section. His concern was maybe that we were taking up valuable space. And for this I understand, but it seems like a rather slow night so I didn't understand the rush. They had a dj playing house music. I didn't mind since I enjoy house music and it a place like this it really seemed appropriate. But in all honesty the sound system was absolutely horrid. I can go into detail about it, being somebody who works in pro audio. But let's just say that had they hired somebody decent to set this up, they'd been alot better off.But I guess it wasn't their fault because at around 10pm, the pull the dj from booth (literally mind you) and they go to the back (but not completely out of sight) where I'm assuming an argument ensues. I turn around and mind my business smoking sub-par hookah. But since the music was apparently done, so was my date here.So I ask to close my tab only to find over $300 charged to my account! I'm told by the manager of the place (who is now flustered by the incident with the dj) that this was only an "authorization". I was appalled, a $300 authorization?!?! This is a meal and some drinks, not a hotel room or rental car!!! I write the amount of the official bill (after asking to see an itemized one) on the slip and signed.Well, guess who had to perform a chargeback request? That's right, me. This "authorization" never got changed at the end of the night and I found myself trying to make the next couple days away from home on the cash I had on hand. Overall, this place is trying to be some posh lounge in a desert full of posh lounges. But seriously, how "posh" can you be when you're situated next door to a Cici's Pizza?One star for the overall suck of this place. Had the food been worse, this place would get a big goose-egg from me. Do yourself a favor, don't go to this wolf in sheep's clothing.

My birthday is long past, it is October 4th, and a friend at work had told me he was taking me to get some king crab on my birthday, well 5 months and 19 days later we finally made it. We sat at the bar and ordered the King Crab Special in case you are not familiar with this it is 1 1/2 pounds of king crab legs with butter and lemon for 16.99. I had actually never had King Crab up to this point... The lady working the bar let us try the clam chowder which for some reason I have always just come to the predetermined decision that i did not like clam chowder, until now.. It was "AMAZING" now my grade of amazing may be different then yours when it comes to clam chowder since i had never really attempted eating it until now, so please refrain from the Clam Chowder Critic Hate Mail.. Thanks. So back to my Crab. The cook set the mound of freshly steamed crab in front of me and said enjoy, and that is exactly what I did. The meat was delicious and very plentiful. I don't think 16.99 was a bad price for the amount of crab that we got. I was very pleased with the food " a few new found favorites " and the only reason why I took a star away was really due to the casino not the restaurant. All the smoke is not very pleasant when you are eating. After eating here I think everyone needs a little crab in there life from time to time.

Review Text :
Growing up in Seattle, Taco Time was a normal stop for me and my family. Since moving to LA, and now living in Vegas, I was only too happy to discover this childhood favorite right here in sin city. Now whether you are a first timer or a regular here, there are things that you need to know. First of all, there are two different versions of Taco Time. This one here in this review and the original that is abundant in Washington (also known as Taco Time Pacific Northwest). I call any Taco Time outside of the Pacific Northwest an "Express Taco Time" because they don't have the complete menu and most importantly, the hot sauce is in packets! In Washington, they make the hot sauce made fresh from scratch!The good thing is that the main items that they are known for are readily available. My most favorite item is their crisp burritos which come in chicken, pinto bean, and the best of them all, beef. Allow me to describe it. Seasoned ground beef rolled up in a flower tortilla and deep fried to a golden brown. Kinda looks like a large taquito only way better! Damn, my mouth is watering right now just typing this! Get that in a combo with mexi-fries (basically tater tots) and a drink, you're all set! Dipping these items in their hot salsa is the cherry on top! Occasionally I have one of their tacos, soft burritos and taco salads, which is not bad either. Those choices are up to you. To me, the crisp beef burritos have no equal.I gave them 3 stars because of their location and not so good service. It's in a food court in between Burger King and Subway. The food court itself is smack dab in the middle of a truck stop, which doesn't make it any more appealing. The service is below mediocre because you have one employee that handles everything from taking your order, to cooking, to calling you when it's done. So if you ever go to Seattle, make Taco Time as a part of your itinerary. For more info, go to their website: www.tacotime.comIt's Taco Time. Yeah, right!.  Just letting you know right now, not my idea to come here.  But it was a co-workers time to pick lunch and he swears by this place. Why you ask? I even wanted to know.  Well, this is the only Taco Time in Las Vegas and he grew up on this stuff back in Utah. Big deal...now let me eat.  Nothing on the menu was appealing to me, both taste wise and calorie wise. I ended up pulling up the myfitnesspal app and found something decent.  I ended up getting their Crisp Chicken Burrito.  I know, their known for their burritos. I just didn't want to indulge knowing that a big dinner was within a few hours.  Their Crisp Chicken Burrito is basically a large deep fried taquito in my opinion.  Tasted okay, but that's about it. As for the ambiance...yeah right.  This Taco Time is located at a truck stop off Blue Diamond across from from the Silverton Casino/Hotel.  When you're in here, you almost forget you're in Las Vegas.  For a minute, I thought I was in Barstow or even Baker.  Service wasn't the best and they didn't even have forks.  Good gravy...I doubt I will stumble back in here.

Restaurant name  China Chan Restaurant

Review Text :
I don't usually try dim sum places when I'm traveling unless I'm in a city with a big chinatown (LA, SF, NY). But it just so happened that China Chan is really close to my hotel. I decided to give it a try because of the reviews on Yelp! and I gotta hand it to you guys for being spot on.I was pretty worried when I pulled up to see that the building looked like something that used to be a fast food joint. I decided to go through with it anyways and when I walked in, I was greeted by a hostess in Cantonese. When you hear Cantonese at a dim sum restaurant that you're unsure about, it sounds a little bit like music in your ears. After we settled down and ordered our drinks, we started looking through the dim sum menu (this is one of those places that the carts don't come around... you order off a piece of paper and then everything is made to order...) and was SHOCKED to find that most of the items were priced at $1.80 per order. In my neck of the woods (Austin, Texas) most of these items are easily priced at $2.80-$3.00. So my buddy and I pretty much went nuts ordering. We ordered about 10 dishes (which is enough to feed 4 people) and our total bill was $23.00!!!Growing up in HK, I've had my fair share of amazing dim sum. Even though China Chan's dim sum was not the same caliber to be compared to those of HK, I thought that overall most of the food was pretty solid (especially taking the price into consideration). There were some stuff (like the curry puff) that I thought could have been a little more warm when served. For the most part all of the dim sums that we ordered were spot on.The service was great, but I couldn't give China Chan 5 stars because there were some misses here and there. Taking the price into consideration though, I'm not sure if Phoenix natives just don't know about this place or there're not a lot of dim sum fans here because we were the only table there the whole time we were there. I would highly recommend this place. In fact, I'm pretty serious about going back there tomorrow to get my dim sum fixing before I head back home.5 stars for fresh inexpensive dimsum, minus one star for decor.It's been a while since we've been back but since it's Chinese New Year, it's worth the trip.  I was excited to see an expanded menu, especially the Pineapple Bun with Char Siu, which I had asked them repeatedly to add, since it was all the rage in HK and Vancouver.  As far as I know, no other restaurant in the Valley offers it.  There is actually no pineapple - just looks a bit like the outside of one on the top, which is sweet and crunchy, providing great contrast to the savory roasted pork filling.Everything's as good as I remember with the same ridiculously low prices. Only the Chiu Chow dumpling was disappointing - soggy wrapper with dried out meat filling.  Can't believe this place is not packed to the rafters.  I say ditch the old-fashioned push carts and choose dimsum steamed to order!  Plus they now have picture menus!Dim Sum, Chapter IIAbsent were the bustling carts, leaving a trail of steam and aromas of delicately balanced Asian delights. In its place, a photo-accompanied menu a la sushi style made its way around the table. It was a method that fit China Chan remarkably well.We were a band of a dozen foodies, converging on China Chan on a Sunday morning. We ordered en masse and our food came out in wave after delicious wave. Everything was delightful.As the second instalment of UYE: Dim Sum drew to a close, we were satisfied.

Restaurant name  Flat Top Grill

Review Text :
Flat top has changed their "self service" system to a "we stand behind a glass and you tell us you want system."  So basically they're now the "Subway" of "Asian Fusion"  restaurants.    They claim it's for sanitary reasons.  However, it doesn't really feel like that.  The waitress told us we could ask for more toppings when we were up there.   However, when we went up to get our food, we were hastily rushed through the line, and basically given a feeling that they didn't want us asking for more.   I also noticed they gave one girl (who happened to be quite attractive) in line more service and time to choose, while rushing every one behind her to pick and move on.  If this means I am quite ugly, so be it.  I'm not into men either.  When we came back to our table, we found two people sitting right next to our two chair table.  This may sound like a petty complaint, but the place place was very empty.  They could have seated them a table or so away.  It felt like we couldn't enjoy a real conversation with out listening out there's too.   I also noted a lot of unhappy faces from the waitstaff.  The servers morale seemed pretty low from all of this changes, and it shows in the service.  I also noticed the costumers across the room seemed pretty disappointed in the changes, and overall atmosphere.  DATE of visit:  9/5/2014.

Looking for an A-MAZING vegan pizza (sans cheese)? Follow our formula at Barro's:Order a veggie special pizza with no sauce and no cheeseAsk them to use the white pizza mix as the sauce (oil, herbs and garlic)Add a side of marinara sauce for crust dippin if desiredResult = Stupidly awesome vegan pizza. We loved it.WARNING: It seems the "white pizza mix" may have Parmesan cheese in it. Not sure if it varies by location or not, but we've been given different answers at different locations. I suggest speaking with a Manager at the location you are ordering from to confirm this. We've had to ask for just olive oil, garlic and herbs as the base on a few occasions (rather than the "white pizza mix").

Review Text :
What do you call an elephant with glass slippers?  Cinderelephant.This elephant walks into a bar...Had enough?Me to.  I probably won't be back to Elephant Bar.  My food wasn't bad.  It was just mediocre and overcooked.  For the money I could go so many other places.The atmosphere tries to be interesting and jungley-wungley with animal patterns all over the place.  It struck me as a buffet in Vegas.  I'm not quite sure why but that was the overall impression and it hit me quick.  Not one of the good buffets either.  A buffet overcrowed with blue hairs and sweaty tourists, a loud and bustling buffet with high prices and mediocre food.To their credit (I think) the desserts we split were huge.  I would call them family style.  1 dessert could easily have served 4 people.I used to love the elephant bar. We used to go about twice a month at least and now I find myself looking for other places. The food has been much more inconsistent and I keep trying to find something new to love and only find like. The jambalaya sauce has been different twice and neither time was the same as the other. The Thai salad dressing no longer has that great ginger flavor. I do like their burgers and the honey shrimp is good but not as yummy as my jambalaya used to be. They do have great email specials and coupons and I will keep trying hoping that it goes back to the way it was. The service is always great and we usually ask for the same two or three servers whenever we go. I love the atmosphere as well. Just after a couple eh meals I am sad!

Review Text :
Let them eat cake! During my stay at Caesar's Palace this past weekend I discovered the most amazing patisserie. My sister and I were heading to the Forum Shops and found Payard Patisserie and Bistro. Chocolates, pastries and ice cream oh my! I seriously wanted just about everything in this shop. The pastries were so beautiful...almost too beautiful to consume! Almost. ;) I purchased a box of chocolates as a gift for someone I know who adores chocolates. Word is they are some of the best chocolates ever. I also selected a package of Madelines which were so plump and fluffy. I even saw little flecks of vanilla bean. So yummy! One night after dinner we decided we could all go for a sweet treat. I ordered the coconut sorbet which was the most coconutty, creamy sweetest cold treat I have ever had. I also sampled a bite of my other sister's Raspberry-Rhubarb Napoleon. I'm not a rhubarb fan, but I couldn't even taste it. The pastry was so light and flaky! If you have a sweet tooth like me, you'll definitely want to pay a visit to Payard! Bon Appetite!3.5-4 Stars for Pastry2 Stars for ServiceBefore my trip to Vegas, I made sure to bookmark Payard Patisserie.  Francois Payard, famous pastry and chocolate Chef from France.  His only West Coast Patisserie and Bistro is here at Caesars Palace. Set right in the Casino near the restaurants and the Apian Way shops, I was so excited when I finally saw the big glowing "Payard" sign! I had died and gone to pastry heaven! Upon entering you notice the beautifully arranged and fully stocked truffle and chocolate counter.  Further walking in, my eyes finally laid on the pastry counter.  Just as the chocolate was fully stocked, so were the pastries.  Now this is exactly how to sell a product. No matter what time of day, even in late afternoon to evening when pastires are usually sold out, Payard continously restocked sweets to entice folks like me. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw?select=ePEZJsHZKfJKax4YMRQ_hwI didn't know where to start.  But here's the damage:http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw?select=3Lizm46K61CJAm4AREr_1Q* Banana Creme Tart:  The custard on the was flavorful and fluffy. There was a nice subtle banana flavor throughout, but minimal sliced banana's in the tart.  Overall, you get banana flavored custard. * Fruit Tart:  I'm a fruit tart lover.  A must for me when I go to a bakery.  The fruit tarts here at Payard were prepared beautifically with a good variety of fruits on top...but the crust on the top was too soft, and broke apart very easily.  I like to eat my tarts with my hands, so it was quite diffcult to do so with this kind of crust.  * Apple Tatin:  Refreshing dessert with whole apple slices in the middle.  Texture was a bit too jellow-y in my opinion but caramelized perfectly on the exterior. * Lemon Tart:  Skip.  Way too lemon-y to where the sour flavor over powered everything else in each bite.  Also way too sweet to where one bite ruined my palate, you can even feel some of the sugar crystals left over in the glaze. *yuck* Payard Patisserie also has a crepe counter and a delicious display of Gelato's as well.  Holy moly!  I also ordered myself a cup of the Mango flavor.  I like my gelato icy and they did an awesome job here.  The mango flavor was powerful and refreshing.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw?select=fQu-0yoC5jj0Hw7RTcVq3gWhile the desserts weren't bad here, it's the prices that were a bit painful.  Each pastry was $7.00 each, and a regular cup of the gelato was $5.00.  The staff here at the bakery are also very incompetent and unfriendly.  It wasn't even busy when I visited, and yet they still don't have the energy to ask if I needed help.  Apparently there is only one line to order for all three different counters.  They neglect to inform you of this one line, so I'm left standing the other counters waiting for service like an idiot.  Overall, Payard Patisserie does a great job in terms of presentation, nothing particularily stood out for me, as certain items had too much overbearing flavor, or not enough.  They failed to balance sweet and savory in my opinion.  Will I be back?  Maybe...but please hire more informative and helpful staff.One of my new obsessions are Macarons. They are NOT called Macaroons, those are the English coconut version but "Macaron" the French version. They come in different colors and flavors like pistachio, strawberry and lemon. The little cookies are light and fluffy like little pillows with a burst of flavor and chewy in the center. Payard's Macarons come in a little variety pack of about 6; pistachio, strawberry, lemon, orange and chocolate. My favorite flavors were strawberry and pistachio. I practically ate the entire bag in one sitting. Thank God, we got a second bag for breakfast! ;) Definitely worth trying these little pieces of heaven.***Wolfgang Puck highlighted Payard's macarons on the Food Network, but they were bagged and not that fresh; their other sweet options here might be better***Payard is a patisserie and cafe in Casesars Palace (near the gaming floor).  In addition to the food on site, Payard offers many attractive food gifts (like gourmet chocolates).  The shop has a nice high-end look to it and some of their individual desserts are impressive looking (they look similar to the individual desserts at Jean Philippe at Aria).I recently watched Wolfgang Puck talk about how much he loves the macarons at Payard on the Food Network so I decided to give them a try.  The macarons were not available individually.  They were sold in a bag of 6 for $10.The package indicated that the macarons were assorted flavors, but all the macarons were the same flavor, which was like a mix of hazelnut and almond.  The nutty flavor was strong and good (sweet, rich taste to the macarons). Unfortunately, the texture was not right.  I am not sure if it was because they might not have been fresh, but the macarons did not have that contrast between the slightly crispy pastry top and bottom with the soft and chewy center.  Instead, it was just soft and chewy all around.Service was quick and okay.Despite Wolfgang Puck's love of these macarons, the macarons did not appear to be the signature item here (they were hard to find and were not as lovingly displayed as some of the other desserts).  For a better macaron experience (both in flavor and texture), you should check out Bouchon Bakery at The Venetian.  If you do come here, you may want to try one of their attractive individual cakes or chocolates instead.Caesars Palace has complimentary parking.I think Payard sings a siren song that beckons all who love sweet treats.  Seriously.  Every time I stay at Caesar's Palace, I make it a point to stop by Payard multiple times.  I just love looking at all of the sweet little pastries and yummy candies.On my most recent excursion, I selected a box of the bourbon truffles as a gift.  I was informed that they were absolutely divine, melt in your mouth perfection.  Noted!I could not leave Payard without picking up a little something for myself.  I decided on the French Macarons.  OH MY GOODNESS!  I was officially a French Macaron fan after taking that first bite.  My favorite flavor was the Passion Fruit.  Delish!I also had the opportunity to partake in a little breakfast at the restaurant before we left for the airport.  I ordered the French Toast with fresh berries and whipped cream.  Decadent!  The toast was much crisper than any French Toast I've ever tasted, but it was quite good.  Of course, using brioche certainly helps matters.Oh, and I also got to see Francois Payard himself at his restaurant!  If I would have had a copy of his cookbook, I would have marched right over there and asked ever so sweetly for an autograph.  Oh well.  That will have to wait until my next visit.  ;)Is this the trail to Payard's Place, was all I saidThis concierge has heard that question lots beforeWe strolled through Caesar's Casino and marched straight aheadIt was on a corner curveFrom an inside counter serveIt was there where we saw the macarons.The waitress poured our water into tiny cupsShe got the caprese sandwich from the fridgeShe took crepe batter from a tin and whipped it upAdded mushrooms, chicken, creamIt was a Paris cafe dreamExpensive, but ended too soonThose summer nights, when we were freeFour-day vacation for wifey and meTravel eaters, travel eatersAnd in our quest for macaronsWe stumbled on these DESERT MOONsVegas dreamers, Vegas dreamersOf DESERT MOONsOf macaronsOf DESERT MOONsOf macaronsCaprese sandwich mozzarella fresh and lightBasil and tomato so mixed wellThe chicken crepe needed something to make it rightWe got mojito mint cheesecakeToo rich for me to takeAnd then we got to our macaronsI've never had a macaron I've liked beforeEuropane has the closest to me heartBut when I tried this Payard disk, I wanted moreThe fillings not too sweetA flaky cookie treatThese desserts made my tongue and heart swoonThose summer nights, when we were freeFour-day vacation for wifey and meTravel eaters, travel eatersAnd in our quest for macaronsWe stumbled on these DESERT MOONsVegas dreamers, Vegas dreamersOf DESERT MOONsOf macaronsOf DESERT MOONsOf macaronsLike my last trip to Vegas before, I made another impromtu visit to Payard Bistro.  This time it was for breakfast.Because I was impressed by what my friend had ordered last time, I decided on trying out their Croque Monsieur.http://bit.ly/114h4rUI've had Croque Madame sandwiches but never had a Croque Monieur before.  Even without the egg, it really is a completely different sandwich.  I do love the torched melted cheese on top.  That is a winner!  Good stuff!Unfortunately, I didn't stop for dessert this time since it was still early in the day.That's pretty much all I had.  I still think you're better off coming here for lunch as it's still the best "bang for your buck" lunch deal on the Strip.  Still a solid place to eat if you're around Caesars Palace.Looking for a breakfast meal that isn't fast food or $20 a plate can be a challenge when staying on the strip in Vegas.Two days we found ourselves grabbing a bite here to go. The first day we had coffee with  a muffin and a pastry. I had a blueberry muffin which I found on the dry side. One companion agreed that the muffin was dry, the other felt it went well with the coffee. The cheese pastry tasted like any other cheese pastry. Nothing special except the $4+ price.The second meal here we had actual breakfast. I had the veggie crepe. While ordering, I was quickly reminded by the cashier that these items were premade and could not be customized in any way. Ok. No problem. I liked that there was a menu item with no meat, cheese or sauce. The crepe was made with a buckwheat crepe, which was also appreciated. I don't remember the name of the other crepe ordered, but it was creamy with chicken. I hear it was good, but the person who ordered this felt nauseous after the meal. I'm not saying it was due to the crepe, but it might have been. The last item was the croque monsieur. I didn't did dare take a bit because it looked gooey and cheesy. It was reportedly good, yummy with the cheese. Coffee went well with the meal.How have I not reviewed this place yet!?  I first heard about this place from Food Network's "The Best Thing I Ever Ate."  Wolfgang Puck stated that the best macarons isn't found in Paris but at Payard Patisserie in Las Vegas.  What!?  After hearing such a statement, Mr. W. and I made it our mission to try their macarons and boy were we not disappointed.  Their coffee macarons are amazing!  I can pack those away like none other.  It's perfectly crisp on the outside, chewy on the inside, and never overbearingly sweet.  I hate it when people overload their desserts and pastries with sugar to compensate on lack of flavor.  It's never the case here.  Everything is delicious!  The raspberry lychee macarons and the pistachio are also amongst my favorite.  I haven't tried their savory dishes and dinner but some of my other favorite desserts are the opera gateau and the louvre.  You get what you pay for here and $30-something for a box of macarons is well worth every penny.  There's nothing I love more than receiving a box of macarons from Payard whenever Mr. W. heads to Vegas with his boys.   :)Spelled P-a-y-a-r-d, but pronounced "Pieyard", I think?Pricey? Yes, but it's in a major hotel on the Las Vegas Strip, so price shouldn't even be a point of contention. That being said, I walked out feeling full and not like I was taken for a tasty ride, I'll pay for decent food and good coffee. If it's your first time here definitely go with their croque sandwich, "The Classic Monsieur". This is prepared like a Dutch crunch sandwich, but with cheese baked on the actual bread for that salty crispy crunch! This sammie is stacked with béchamel, Swiss cheese, and boiled breakfast ham. I tried eating this with my hands, but it was just too big, so I ended up using a fork and knife to finish this off. If you're in a hurry, there's also a Payard Express located in front of the venue that's fully equipped with espressos, lattes, and some chocolaty snacks.  Breakfast and sweets, what an amazing conversation.

Okay, so it's not filled with the youngest, hippest crowd in town, but you can't get more elegant and romantic than this place. My husband and I were given a gift certificate to the Palm Court as a wedding present. So we decided to use it last Sunday evening for a combo birthday/anniversary dinner. Things could not have been better. It was one of those meals that takes over 2-1/2 hours but not once ever leaving you wondering where your server went off to or when your food would arrive. Each course of food was better than the last, and many of their dishes are prepared table-side. Kwan, our waiter, told my husband that he's been in the restaurant business 35 years, and it really shows. He personally prepared many or our dishes flawlessly (while waiting on and doing the same for many other tables). So here's a run down of what we ate... We shared the prawn appetizer (prepared table-side) recommended by Kwan. It was in a butter/cream sauce and served with risotto. It was very tasty, and I found the two shrimps apiece were the perfect beginning to our dinner. Next, my husband had the lobster bisque and I opted for a wilted spinach salad (again done table-side). The bisque was really delicious, but sooo rich, I don't think I could have handled more than my one taste. The spinach was a wonderful memory of what spinach salads used to be like before we all cared so much about fat and calories. For our entrees, the hubby had the Dover sole (one of their (again table-side prepared) signature dishes), and I had the rack of lamb, as it's one of my all-time favorite dishes but often not done very well and always too fattening for everyday consumption. Simply put-- both were magnificent!! Even the accompanying sides were yummy. By this point in the evening, we were both about ready to burst, even after saving half our entrees for lunch on Monday, but we couldn't pass up the banana's foster, as it evokes a personal, happy memory for us. Before we could order it, Kwan and staff brought us a lovely cake for our special day. None of that corny chain "happy birthday" singing, just the cake, a candle and a some privacy. After a few moments, Kwan returned and asked if we'd like them to cut and serve our cake or if we'd prefer to take it home with us. Since we had another dessert choice in mind, we took it home. Last night, we had it for dessert; yum! A few additional notes... I agree with the other reviewer, the Spanish guitarist in the lobby just outside the restaurant was wonderful. They really go the extra mile in customer service... we had match books on our table that had been printed with our name on them (and ones that said Happy Birthday and Happy Anniversary). And it goes without mentioning at a place like this, but your water (and everything else you need) never goes without refilling without you even being aware of it). Keep in mind this is not a place to go if you're watching your diet. I told my husband that we did the dairy industry proud; we consumed enough butter, cream, etc. to keep many cows busy for years to come! But you can really taste the difference when real ingredients are used. The meal wasn't cheap-- over $250 after tax and tip (for the food plus a moderately priced bottle of California sparkling wine)-- but we both decided that it was money, calories and time well spent! So, in closing, you want an elegant, romantic dinner and don't care about seeing and being seen at only the hippest places in town, give Palm Court a try. It's been around forever and hopefully always will be.

So my craving and curiosity finally over rode my laziness to truck to the north but let's say it was SO worth it!!This place is not only like Pinkberry but in my humble opinion surpasses it! The Twangy fro-yo has the familiar tang but with a more creamy mouth feel and tangier intensity. They also offer WAY more toppings including cereal, fruit and jimmie's... while they have my beloved Fruity Pebbles and Mochi they also have loads of other items. Included cotton candy (looks like the candy Nerds but tastes like cotton candy).. very unique. Other fro-yo flavors include Pomegranate, Mango, Blueberry and of course the PB like Twangy.We also tried the frozen custard.. oh yeah, good stuff as well though, I was loving my Twangy to much to even think about ordering it. We met the owner very handsome Dave Cha, super nice guy,  and knowledgeable about all things fro-yo. It was a treat to meet someone with such enthusiasm and genuine sincerity.. especially in that neck of the woods (North Scottsdale). If you have a craving for the good stuff.. do yourself a favor and head to Ice Tango.. I really don't think you'll be disappointed. Hurry before the word gets out and there are lines out the door!!After reading all of the reviews that came before mine, I had pretty high expectations for Ice Tango... I love tart flavors and I love frozen yogurt - I was pretty damn excited to finally make my way to NoSco to check this place out.I went with my friend DeDe at around 11am on a Sunday... We worked up an appetite at yoga, and when I told her that I'd read amazing reviews about this place, and that it was supposedly similar to Pinkberry, she just had to try it too.We walked in and were impressed to see such a clean, colorful little store.  I had no idea that they would offer cereal and crepes in addition to their special yogurt with a ton of toppings to choose from.  David was working that day and DeDe drilled him on the nutrition information.  It's all fat free and only 22 calories per ounce.  A small yogurt has approximately 130 calories before the toppings.  We tried the plain and pomegranate flavors and we both went with plain and added fresh fruit as a topper - YUM!Ice Tango is my new favorite place in the valley.  If it were closer to me, I'd be there every day!  I almost drove 30 minutes out of my way to return to Ice Tango the next day... I thought that was a bit crazy, so I am drooling sitting here thinking about my next visit.  If you like tart tasting yogurt, go pay David a visit at Ice Tango - you will not be disappointed!I drove 50 miles to check this place out and had a hard time finding it!It's definitely not your typical frozen yogurt bar.I tried a few of the flavors as well as the vanilla custard.The best (and only reason I would come here) is the Twangy Tart!It's sour just like plain yogurt but with a hint of sweetness to cut the bite and a refreshing icy texture. It's insanely Delicious on it's own or paired with some fresh fruit.They have a beautiful assortment of Fresh Fruit toppings but I felt their other toppings were lacking.I decided on the Twangy Tart with strawberries (see picture)I'm giving 5 stars  based on the unique plain yogurt flavor "Twangy Tart" and their Beautiful "Fresh Fruit" selection, I wish they were closer to me.ETA: My SloganOnce you try the Twang you'll be like Daaaaaang! And Nothing else will ever be the same!Ummm. . .I. . .don't. . .get. . .it. . .? Can someone please explain to me how this place is any different from TCBY from the early 90's?  Besides the ridiculous trying-to-be-trendy-but-just-looking-cheap decor?  I went in Saturday afternoon and it was packed.  I got samples of their flavors, which are pretty limited to start with.  The custards were good.  The yogurts were ok.  I don't get the hype over the twangy tart, it tasted like plain yogurt to me, which in and of itself tastes like spoiled milk.  No thanks.  I wound up getting a Pinalada smoothie and quite frankly I make way better smoothies in my blender at home.  The pineapple tasted canned and there was hardly coconut or mango in it at all as listed on the menu. Admittedly I didn't have a crepe, which I am a sucker for especially with Nutella, so I might be back in here for one. So. . .what is it that sets this place apart?  They offer a few flavors of frozen yogurt. . .and. . .toppings. . .and. . .?  Is it just that I'm spoiled by all the incredible local ice cream parlors in Boston like JP Licks and Emack and Bolio's to even care about this place?  I just don't understand the draw, why anyone would drive so far for frozen yogurt.  Are there really no other options out here?  Sad.

Review Text :
With the addition of Over Easy last week, 40th Street in Arcadia is becoming more and more of a hip restaurant row. Retro chairs [see photo] and space-age stools dot the interior of the cozy joint owned by Sol y Sombra chef Aaron May.The place, which is next door to The Vig, recalls a Matt's Big Breakfast feel (and was so alluded in Java magazine) for this side of town and manages to do so in an old 1970s mission style Taco Bell. I wouldn't have been able to tell if I didn't know. Regardless, the food here is delicious and compared to other places I did not feel like I ingested a tub of butter. I ordered the hearty Wolf Pack with a pancake on the side and I was in heaven. Two (count them, TWO!)  layers of hash browns [see photo] with two scrambled eggs, cheddar cheese and strips of bacon in the middle. The eggs were just the right consistency and hash browns were browned just right and tasted terrific with garlic salt and pepper. A fluffy griddled pancake with syrup on the side, fresh squeezed orange juice and a complimentary New York Times at the counter also greeted my morning grumpiness and I was quickly satiated.  Altogether the meal came out to $12 + tax.  A bit pricey, but worth it knowing you get what you pay for.I briefly talked with the chef's managing partner who went into detail about the tater tots with tomato jam (that I missed on the menu) and the bacon reduction sauce that comes with the brioche.My only complaints would be minor.Small quarters: With about half of the seats outside on the patio, it's probably a few seats more than MBB.  There was brisk business yesterday on a weekday morning, but on the weekend I can see how the crowds would grow.A la carte-like menu: This is a trend I'm not particularly fond of, especially for breakfast. Several of the entrees don't come with either eggs or potatoes. The Loretta breakfast sandwich are examples of entrees that don't come with eggs. The Over Easy brioche and omelettes don't come with potatoes. The wait staff just shrugged it off as, "Oh you can just order [blank] on the side."  I disagree, especially when you're paying nearly $10 for an entre or omelette.Semi-scattered staff:  Everyone was friendly and engaged in small talk with people at the counter.  But after asking twice for my check, I figured it was a small blip in the overall experience.Delicious breakfast food with a cool hip feel? This neighborhood will be all over it.  I'm looking forward to the next visit.EDIT: 1/19/08 -- OK, I'm upping this to 4.5 stars.  Service was excellent today.  And the country fries (and tater tots with tomato jam)  were outstanding.  They were deep fried with seasoned salt, parsley...yum!Oh Over Easy, you taco bell looking motherfucker. I had such high hopes for this place, I mean the only thing better than breakfast in my book is MAGIC and well there wasn't a whole lot of that coming from my meal. I ordered steak and eggs (a classic) which was like 7 or 8 bucks (in the back of my mind I knew there was a hitch), but instincts aside I was still hyped, sadly like most things in my life disappointment:)  The "Steak" basically was badly seasoned deli roast beef stacked over my horribly cooked eggs, my plate was over flowing with watery steak juice it really should have been served in a bowl it was gross I mean gross, the coffee drink was good (kinda girly) and the decor was aiight. So if you find yourself waking up sunday morning smelling like crown royal and cigarettes with someone you barely know and never want to know again take them here.Oh yeah"Matt's makes this place look like a cracked out denny's or taco bell (ha because it used to be one I know I'm lame) zing."The perfect place for hangover food!I cannot believe it took me so long to make my way to Over Easy... but it was worth the wait for sure!  Today I went to brunch at Over Easy with a party of 4 (that's the way to go by the way, so that you can taste  a bit of everything!)Needless to say, we'd all had a few too many drinks last night, and we needed a good greasy spoon, fill your tummy, type of meal.  We arrived around 10:15 on a Saturday and had about a 20 minute wait, but it went by fast and was so worth it!  Brian hooked us up with a table inside and our server brought us ice waters and coffee immediately.  There were so many menu items that sounded amazing, so we decided to start with the waffle for the table as an appetizer.  Yum!  (It's got a vanilla malt flavor that is out of this world good!)  We also ordered a side of crispy bacon for the table - such a treat!I went with the egg white asparagus omelet and added mushrooms to it plus a side of hash browns.  The asparagus was seriously some of the best I've had and I cleaned my plate!  Jared went with steak and eggs over sleazy - it looked so good I had to taste it and that too was fantastic!  The other couple we were with enjoyed their entrees too.  Although I didn't try them, the 'tots' looked good and I would suggest hash browns or tots before the breakfast potatoes.As you can imagine, this was a ton of food for the four of us, but since we were all hungover and hungry, we did pretty well with it... With tip, I think the total for all of us was just under $60 - it may seem expensive, but it was worth every penny!I usually like some fruit, tomato, yogurt, or cottage cheese options.  That's the only reason for 4 stars instead of 5.  I think they keep it simple because of their limited space in this location.  With that said, Chef Aaron May and his team are on a roll with great restaurant concepts and I'm definitely a loyal fan.  I'll be back to Over Easy again soon as well as continue to frequent Sol Y Sombra and the up and coming new restaurants when they open as well!9/8First thing I noticed, as I walked through the vestibule and headed to a counter seat is that it is LOUD indoors, and it wasn't even half-full in there!  I hesitated to move outdoors as it was already past 10a and very hot, but I just couldn't relax at the counter.  Thank goodness I'd already checked out the menu online and pretty much decided what I wanted to try- the chicken-fried steak on a waffle. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8R_oemw4rNjJL6sd40O_oQ?select=MhktxOxPp_sKrzK6tJoR_Q#MhktxOxPp_sKrzK6tJoR_Q  I'd misread that the actual dishes were a $9 plate of fried chicken on a waffle and an $8 plate of chicken-fried steak, country gravy, egg, and choice of potato, but no worries as my server allowed the substitution and charged me $9 for a fried steak on a waffle.  I decided to brave the hellish heat over the hurtful deafening noise indoors and moved outside.  I must've looked pityful wilting out there that a kind young man asked if I'd like him to turn the misters on.  Patio-area is actually quite homely and invting, and I was pleasantly surprised that there were misters installed- for some reason I didn't think many people would welcome cooling condensation on their eggs.... My OE experience was starting to improve...While I enjoyed the flavors and textures of the steak and delicious waffle, I didn't think that the small amount warranted a high price tag. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8R_oemw4rNjJL6sd40O_oQ?select=L4kyavImBPIfIAdVmi1D_g#L4kyavImBPIfIAdVmi1D_g  I had to ask the server if the waffle was indeed that small.  I could see paying that price for two waffles and a steak...  After eating all the crumbs of my dish, I went ahead and ordered a chocolate waffle w/out the powdered sugar from the kids' menu.  I expected to see a chocolate-colored waffle, as I assumed that the homemade sauce was mixed into the batter, but no, it was the same malted waffle w/ homemade sauce drizzled with a heavy hand.  If you're like me who prefers the crunch, you might want to ask for the sauce on the side.  (A nice addition to the menu would be a chocolate waffle topped w/ vanilla bean ice cream and homemade sauce on top!)  Can't for the life of me think why I didn't take a photo of the chocolate waffle, so forgive me for its exclusion in the photo set.  Oh yes, the sauce is OK.What a great place to catch up with good friends.  Loved the atmosphere, and the food was good too.  Better if you have friends who will show up earlier than you do to get a table.  Best if you have friends who will pick up the whole tab.I recommend the Chilaquiles and the 3 Eggs Steak/Chilli.  My wife doesn't recommend the Corned Beef Hash Plate.  Yeowch!Merry Christmas everyone!Guy, I love you on 'Diners, Drive-ins and Dives' and all. But you rave about every place you go to. And you go to a lot of places. That makes you not very credible in my book.Since I already had breakfast at the hotel, I wanted something small to nibble on while the other girls ate. But then the PB&J french toast on the menu caught my eye. Mental image of thick toast with swirls of peanut butter and syrup-like jam with powdered sugar. I couldn't resist ordering!The server later informed me that they only have half an order of the french toast and asked whether I wanted a half order of something else. Since I wasn't hungry, I told her that the half order is fine. But at the same time I was wondering how on earth do they only have half an order. Did they run out of bread??One by one my friends' orders arrived. Big plates of hearty looking food. Then mine arrived, on a dinky plate. Sitting there in loneliness and despair. PB&J French Toast (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8R_oemw4rNjJL6sd40O_oQ?select=FTpZP-NSq5VuEXC_S73C6w): Are you friggin kidding me?! This is like a Smuckers Uncrustable! Not french toast! (http://uncrustableforschools.com/showimage.asp?fileid=2178) Angry! Was not tasty and didn't finish it. I made sure that I did not have to pay full price for this. Luckily, they took the whole item off the bill.Smoked Salmon & Mushroom Omelet (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8R_oemw4rNjJL6sd40O_oQ?select=7IF34zeAOIegxtukbZle-A): Huge! The tatertots were good. But unfortunately, the omelet itself was dry. The smoked salmon was overly salty.The Over Easy (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8R_oemw4rNjJL6sd40O_oQ?select=mngAq_ySH-uFP-GVVQdS_g): Their version of eggs florentine. Didn't try it, but looked good.Brioche French Toast (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8R_oemw4rNjJL6sd40O_oQ?select=gXPle1ZaQQgd8xSRZaFsew): If my french toast looked anything like that I would've been less pissed.Cool place. Nice staff. Mediocre food.

Restaurant name  88 China Bistro

Review Text :
And the skies opened and I could hear "Hallllllllllllllllelujah!" Tasty Chinese food in Charlotte! I was practically convinced that after almost 4 years in Charlotte I was never going to find solid, convenient and fresh Chinese food. Therefore, stating that I was impressed with 88 China Bistro is putting it mildly. The take out menu is traditional (Americanized Chinese) with far fewer fried dishes (thank God). Many, if not all, of the items are freshly made in house and it shows. Hubs picked up a myriad of take out and brought it home so we could feast. Here's what I tried...Sesame Cold Noodle Appetizer: 4/5: For $4.50, this dish is a steal. Plenty of perfectly cooked noodles with a generous helping of peanut-y, sesame dunked sauce on top. The sauce is thicker, so be sure to spread the love around before you dive in. Simple yet de-freakin'-licious. Beef & Broccoli: 4/5: I'll completely agree with Lindsay H - their beer & broccoli is pretty fab. It's freshly made and the sauce isn't that coagulated, syrupy crap. The broccoli is tender and still has a bit of a crunch. Fried rice: 3/5: I appreciate that it's fresh, it just could have used a bit more flavor and a bit less soy. I'm looking forward to my lunch today, as it will be chock full of leftovers from last night's 88 China Bistro meal. One of these days I want to head over there and ask for this elusive Cantonese menu.My review is strictly based on delivery and take-out. I like to eat my Chinese food at home so no one can judge me on the amount of food I order. Hi, I like #allthefood. This isn't the closest Chinese restaurant to my house, but it's the one I choose to consistently order from in the Elizabeth area. To me, it seems like the food isn't as greasy and oily as the others and it tastes like better quality. I have to order egg drop soup every time I get Chinese. I really like the version they do here. I typically also get Singapore noodles, an egg roll, and a spring roll. I'll mix it up from time to time with some sort of spicy chicken or shrimp dish and steamed dumplings. Everything I've had from here has been good, I can't think of a single thing I haven't liked. Delivery is typically quick. Getting take out is a breeze. During my latest trip here this week, the guy in front of me asked how long it would take, 15 minutes? He needed to go outside and make a call. I told him don't stay outside too long, it'll take no time. Sure enough, his order came out with mine quickly and all I had ordered was soup. They do have a website, basically the only thing on it is the menu. You can find a clickable link here on 88's Yelp page.

Review Text :
***Fin (an upscale Chinese restaurant) at The Mirage is like a lot of other Las Vegas fine dining restaurants--overpriced, mediocre food***Most Las Vegas (The Strip) restaurants are overpriced.  So if you are planning to eat at a nice restaurant in Vegas, you are probably not going to get your money's worth.  Still, the quality varies quite a bit.  Mesa Grill and Carnevino are both overpriced, but at least their food is good (at least on my visits).  There are other Vegas restaurants where you spend a lot and the food is bad (or mostly bad).  Fin is one of those restaurants.Fin sits in The Mirage and has a contemporary decor that is nice though it does not really stand out.  The restaurant is very close to the casino, but it is still pretty quiet.Fin is a Chinese restaurant, but it is probably a more Americanized interpretation (based on what we had here).  They were doing a $40 3-course special.  There was a good variety of starters to choose from while there was not much selection among the entrees or the desserts.  We all opted for the 3-course.  We added some a la carte dishes to share as well.I started with the barbecued spare ribs.  They were sweet but not overly sweet.  The ribs could have used something else to give them a little more kick.  The meat did not have a fall-off-the-bone texture.  The meat was not exactly tough, but it could have been more tender.I did not try the shrimp and scallop wraps, but they looked bland.  I tried the crispy shrimp toast that was served on a sweet and sour sauce.  That starter was decent.For my entree, I opted for the Chilean Sea Bass that was served over a sweet garlic sauce.  The sea bass came with a side of steamed white rice.  The sea bass was fried (the menu said wok fried, but it seemed to be more deep fried).  The sea bass was quite greasy.  It was also incredibly fishy, which was a little odd because sea bass typically does not have one of the stronger fish tastes.  It could have been because it was not that fresh or simply that the fish flavor became more pronounced in how they fried it.I really did not like the fish.  The greasiness and the taste made me feel a little queasy and I can eat pretty much anything.From the a la carte menu, we had the General Tsao's Chicken, which was served with broccoli.  This dish was pretty good.  The chicken was juicy and tasty while the sauce was both sweet and with some good heat.We also had Shrimp Lo Mein noodles, which were okay.  The noodles were fine and seasoned properly.  The shrimp was plump; however, they were not cooked long enough.For dessert, I opted for the assorted sorbet, which had 3 flavors.  There was lychee and blood orange.  I cannot remember the other flavor.  Only the blood orange had a good flavor.  The other two flavors were bland.The sorbet here was all ice.  It was like eating a really frozen slushie.The other dessert option was a vanilla creme brulee and it was much better.  The vanilla custard was smooth, creamy and had a good vanilla flavor.  There was a nice caramelized shell.  The creme brulee was garnished with fresh berries.They finished us off with a complimentary Baileys shot, which was good, and a fortune cookie.  The fortune cookie was pretty good.  It was a little thicker and more buttery than most fortune cookies I've had.  The messages seemed homemade especially since the paper appeared to be cut with scissors.Service was not that good.  I have heard that strong customer service is not a high priority at Chinese restaurants (more emphasis is placed on flavors and value).  Maybe this place was trying to emulate that even though it seemed to be an Americanized Chinese restaurant.  The waiter seemed confused and he left the table when we were ordering to check up on another table.  Other servers seemed a little bit abrupt.Still, once we put the order in, the food did come out at a good and organized pace.Of the "nice" Las Vegas restaurants I have tried, Fin may be the worst one.  The General Tsao's Chicken and creme brulee were both good.  For the other dishes we had though, I think you would be able to get just as good food (if not better food) at one of the P.F. Chang's nearby (and at a much lower price).  There are many Vegas restaurants to avoid and Fin would definitely be among them.The Mirage has complimentary parking (both valet and a parking structure).

Review Text :
Another lodge in Vegas usually means the same menu and the same experience.  At least you know what you're getting in, in this case we got a little more though.We stopped by to catch part of the World Series, which meant it was dinner time!   Dinner entrees are available from 4 pm to 11 pm daily and served with dinner salad.  (I always appreciate that their dinner salads are generous, not like those itty bitty side salads you get from fast food restaurants.)  I chose the Cajun Penne Pasta "Cajun seasoned chicken, andouille sausage, bell peppers tossed in a creamy white sauce with penne pasta.  Topped with fresh grated parmesan and sliced green onions.  Served with garlic bread." ($11.95) - When that giant platter arrived, I was shocked!  It was beyond a generous portion!  And it was a tasty pasta dish with chunks of sausage and chicken mixed in.  Definitely something that you need to share.  It's a lot of food!The Husband got the Beer Batter Fish-N-Chips "Alaskan Cod Filet, beer battered and fried to a golden crispy.  Served with fries and cole slaw."  ($11.95) - As we started into the fish, he noticed that it was previously frozen.  But what we didn't realize was that the two pieces of cod were stuck together.  When we separated them, we realized they were still frozen!  Yikes!  I waved the waitress down and showed her the fish.  She apologized and took it away immediately.  A new order came out later on, with a new piece of fish and the previous one refried.  When the bill arrived, the fish and chips were automatically taken off without us saying anything.  Although there is a separate dining area from the bar, there's not much that keeps the smoke from entering the eating area.  Something to consider if this bothers you.They also offer 39 cent wings on Tuesdays and Wednesdays form noon to midnight!This was a rare occasion where I have had to walk out of an establishment I was seated to have dinner at without eating. This was on St. Patrick's day night in which as tradition I took my Mom out for corned beef and cabbage. We decided to visit this location as they were serving a corned beef and cabbage dinner.Long story shorty our corned beef and cabbage dinners come out and the beef is tough and overcooked as can be. We both took a bite of our meal and it was impossible to attempt to eat it was so bad.So we inform the server and showed her that not even the knife would cut through it.She says oh no but we have been serving it all night! I am thinking in my head, really lady well I am looking at two shoe insoles on my plate right now. The server then states well why don't I have the Chef come out and explain the meal to you?WTF, what is to explain, what is in front of me is inedible. I don't care what kind of story he tells me about it I am not eating it! Final Answer and I find it hard to believe that others had not complained about it or sent it back. So she finally takes the plates away and we left as agreed without paying. We drove over here from across town special for this meal and I resent being put in that position to have to leave over something like this. Not Cool!Never again, crossing The Lodge off of my list which is too bad because the location we ate at seven years ago on Ft. Apache had an Amazing corned beef and cabbage dinner. We called them this year and were informed they were not participating so that is how we ended up at this location.

First of all, if you decide to go here because of the other good reviews (which is why I came here) DO NOT buy a $10 for $20 deal because they automatically charge you 18% gratuity without informing you. The bill that we received tonight only had our entrees written down, the bottle of wine that we ordered was not written on the bill.... My boyfriend noticed a $16 charge and I'm so thankful he pointed it out because I overlooked it thinking it was just the tax.... The 18% was written very small, and looked like 8%... I would have ended up tipping these people TWICE....  I asked the waitress what the 18% was and she played dumb and said "oh I think that's gratuity" ... so when she returned a few minutes later after she ran my credit card I asked again if that was normal since we were only a party of 2.... She finally told me that 18% gratuity is included if you use any deals/coupons which I doubt she should have told me BEFORE she ran my credit card when I asked her..... !!!!!!!!IT DOES NOT SAY THAT ON THE DISCLAIMER FOR THE $10 FOR $20 DEAL!!!!!!!! It states 'gratuity not included, please tip on full amount' ---- shady shady shady shady!!!! You would have received a 20% tip if you didn't automatically and fraudulently charge me a tip already....I HATE SHADY-NESS..... SHAME ON YOU PASTA SHOP!! I WILL DEFINITELY NOT BE BACK! At first I really liked this place because I thought it was a mom and pop shop, I thought it was fun and different, but I can't believe the lack of disclaimer and the "playing dumb" that I just experienced. And you can only use either the $10 for $20 deal that you purchased or get the 1 lb. homemade pasta (which WAS part of the disclaimer but I still think that's stupid...)

Unfortunately because of an issue with the service and the owner i will not return to this place.What happened? Well, we decided to go to dinner here and sit out on the patio because it was a beautiful night.  When we sat I noticed they had the kitchen door propped open, which is a huge pet peeve for me, not only is it against regulation, it is gross. Anything can make it's way into the kitchen and into the food that is being prepared. I wanted to mention this to my server to see if it could be corrected. In the meantime 2 employees decided to grab a smoke right outside the kitchen door, one of which was the owner's wife. This really agitated me and thought it was disgusting.When the server returned I voiced my opinion and she apologized and said she would tell the owner. About 10 minutes later one of the employees that I saw smoking came out on the patio to steal a few drags off a friend's cigarette while the whole time just staring at me...as she walked past our table she blew the smoke right over to our table and smiled. At this point I was furious and just wanted to pay and leave. When the server returned I explained what happened and that I wondered if she had mentioned the situation yet to the owner. She said she would let him know. A few moments later the owner came to our table and said.." do we have a problem"? and it was not said in a nice way at all....I even doubted what I heard him say and asked what he said. Again he looked at my husband and said..."do you have a problem" and then turned to me and said the same thing. He was soooo rude I was speechless. I just said....nope ...we do not have a problem, we just will not come back. He just turned around and walked away.I am not sure why he responded this way, but I will not come back to a place where the manager has such disregard to one of their customers "problems".  Too bad Dino's...I liked most of your food, but you let me down.Saw a guy holding a sign on the corner of Dysart and McDowell advertising a Gyro deal and realized I had never seen the place before. Went in the next day and was seated quickly with a menu. Looked it over casually, knowing I already wanted to get a gyro since it seems difficult to find a good one in this part of town. Noticed they had calamari as an appetizer and ordered that with a gyro. The calamari was very good. A lot of places fry it to death and you end up with a chewy wad of batter. Theirs was excellent. The gyro was the 2nd best I've had in the valley, which is saying something considering how many I've tried and immediately forgotten. I will definitely be going back here again and it will likely be my go-to spot for gyros.

Diamonds are not this girls best friend chicken is.   Another slam dunk,  home run out of the park meal.  It should also be noted that the restaurant was way more crowded then I had ever seen before. Good job Chicken Latino.  I am cheering for your success.  On this occasion my hubby of course got the shrimp and Tilapia  ceviche . Which is only served during the weekend as a lunch special.  The shrimp were plump and there was a massive amount of lime juice coating the fish and shrimp very nicely.  I had the half rotisserie chicken , no sides.  I didn't need any starches or legumes standing between me and that bird.  To the embarrassment of my boyfriend I ate the chicken with my bare hands tearing into it like a lion into a gazelle.  I was playing no games devouring my chicken.  Treat -yo-self to Chicken Latino you'll be happy you did.

I'm not down with restaurants that are decorated as if someone took a ride on Disneyland's Jungle Boat Cruise and thought they were hit with interior design brilliance, i.e. Rain Forest Cafe, Islands....ya feel me?  To me, these restaurants have more of an appeal to kids and I'm supposed to be getting tanked there so I can tolerate the screaming rugrats? Ha.Well, this place wasn't overrun with kids watching their parents throw back shots of tequila and that was a plus.  So after the nice hostesses told us that we could seat ourselves at the bar, my friend and I planted ourselves at the one downstairs.  Our bartender was a friendly gal.  I asked for a drink menu which didn't have the most exciting concoctions, but I chose to order the Uptown Top Shelf margarita from her.My drink was pretty good, but what surprised me about this one was that I had expected the drink to come out of a gun.  Hot damn, she free-poured it right in front of my face!  Now, with a restaurant named Margaritaville, one, or at least I, would expect that there would be an impressive selection of tequila.  Not here.  I spied about 5 different brands and that was it.  That was really disappointing so much so that instead of doing shots of Patron, my friend & I opted to try something off of the shot menu called an Overseas High made with blue curacao.  Not bad for something fruity.My experience there was ok for a little pre-gaming to see the Coyotes.  Two of these stars go to the bartender's service and attitude.  The other star is for the drink prices.  Someone from L.A. can double their BAC level here.If you like Pina Coladas, and getting caught in the rain ... if you're not into yoga, and you have half a brain ....  DO NOT COME TO THIS PLACEIf you are a middle aged individual who wants to hit the dance floor and show off your tired dance moves to Beyonce and Chris Brown on a Saturday night while paying $11.50 for a vodka redbull, then this is the place for you!I love Jimmy Buffet and I love the Margaritaville in Vegas, but this place somehow derailed miserably.Blech. Had to work at U of Phoenix Stadium today and Mom came down from Payson to meet me for lunch after.  I don't know Westgate at ALL except for the hockey arena.  It's in an outdoor mall, like everything else.  We were starving and the entire mall was DEAD.  It looked like places were closed, so we went to Margaritaville for lunch.Main entrance isn't clearly marked and we went in through the patio area.  Walked in and didn't see a reception area.  So, we asked the nearest waitress if we were to seat ourselves.  She said in her best airline stewardess voice "Ovah they-ah is where you check-in."  It was fake and annoying.  So, we go check in.  15 minute-wait for 2 people.  The place was crowded, but we had passed a few empty tables along the way.  My mom even pointed it out.  "Our kitchen is pretty backed-up, so we can't seat all tables right now."  Keep in mind this was at 12:30 on a Saturday afternoon.  Wouldn't this be the time to make sure you know to have enough kitchen staff on hand???We meandered to the bar, which was empty except for 2 people.  We sat at the corner and, luckily, found out we could eat there.  The bartender was the first friendly person we came across, and I'm glad SHE got a tip from us.  Service was quick.  Our food came out within 10 minutes.  Mom got the chicken quesadilla, I got the taco salad.  I couldn't believe how FEW items were on the menu.  I was expecting a bit more.  Food was average.  Nothing I'd ever go back for.They kept showing videos of Jimmy Buffet and the people at his concert.  They were having WAY more fun than we were.  NOBODY shouted out "Where's the salt?  Where's the goddamn salt?"  I would have, but my Mom's been suffering from almost 40 years of embarrassment from me already.Blech.Came to this hot mess last weekend, and was NOT impressed.  Waited way too long before we received any service. Drinks took forever, ordered a Mai tai and received a glass full of sweet & sour. Not a great crowd, and very rude, disrespectful bouncers. Luckily there is a Saddle Ranch right across the way that ended up saving the night.

Review Text :
I'm not a regular at Capriotti's, but I was less than impressed with this particular location. It seemed a little on the grimy / dirty side and the guys working there seemed confused by the who pick up process for an order I placed online. The sandwich was overly salted when I got it home and I can't say I'd come back to this location.This is a simple sandwich shop chain I'd wish to see all over Northern California!  The Bobbie, their most popular sandwich, is not your average turkey sandwich.  With slow roasted turkey, fresh cranberry sauce, a layer of homemade stuffing, and mayo....it's like experiencing Thanksgiving anytime of the year!  One of my favorite cold sandwiches on earth.   The Capastrami, their 2nd most popular sandwich, is packed with flavor!  I'm a huge fan of hot pastrami and this pastrami was damn good!  But I wish they had less coleslaw in the sandwich to accomodate more meat.  Their enormous subs and quick and friendly service will expedite my return!  Gotta try the others I've heard so much about...the Capacolla and the Cheese Steak.

Review Text :
I am not going to say much about this place because the only thing I really liked about it were the light fixtures.I tried the Crystal Chicken. Bland.I tried the Crispy Sring rolls. Overcooked.The only thing that was yummy was the #51.. and I have no idea what it was called but my friend got it and I tried it and it was pretty alright.They have a koi pond inside right when you walk in, but I was disturbed at the size of the fish in that little pool.. Definitely not enough room, and I'm thinking this might be a violation, and i'm looking into it. I may eat fish, but I don't believe the living ones should be confined like that.. I certainly don't like elevators, do you?Let me preface by saying I was born in Saigon.  I understand Pho like a redneck understands buckshot.  That's to say, both can be a total miss or to die for.  But, on average they both tend to hit the target.  People who get all worked up over whether the broth was too cloudy, or too sweet, or they got one lime instead of 2 limes need to loosen up a little about this treasured Vietnamese dish.  Pho Da Lat's pho is pretty average in a city where all pho is pretty average.  So I'm saying it's a good showing for pho in Phoenix.  So why 4 stars?  Two reasons: 1) The roast game hen is simply perfect.  It's not a typical dish in any Vietnamese restaurant and transports one to idyllic Provence.  Evidence of the French colonial influence.  It's charred and crispy on the edges and succulent in the meaty areas.  It's served over white rice and accompanied by cucumbers, cilantro and lettuce.  A small dish with salt/pepper & lime is for dipping.  2) These guys have a selection of wine.  Wine with Pho unheard of you say?  Don't pair with red wines, instead pick a dry white wine.  I chose the 2009 Farrier Alexander Valley Andiron (Semillon/Sauv Blanc) $6.  The hints of lime and bright finish go perfectly with spicy Pho broth.  It's also excellent with the roast bird.  The Pho and the Andiron are good by themselves but together they transcend.
Earl of Sandwich=Leave it to me to go to Las Vegas - a Foodie Mecca - and order a peanut butter and jelly sandwich for lunch.  Granted, this sandwich was ordered while suffering from a food hangover from a fancy dinner tthe night before AND 6 am nachos earlier that morning, but work with me here and see me for the rough & tough PB&J (not P & BJ) gal that I be.$3.95 for a freaking sandwich.  What a bargain!  At the sandwich place by my office in San Francisco, this pretty little focaccia & peanut buttery goodness would have set me back ten big ones.  Instead, I left with almost six dollars to blow on the wheel-of-fortune slot machines that call my name in their sweet, sweet way.The $3.95 special was off the Kid's Menu, but I batted my eyelashes in an epileptic way that I haven't done since I ran a red light during my driving test and really, really, REALLY needed my license.Two PB&Js later, Lindsey and I headed up to our room to prepare for another chaotic evening. Unpretentious + Inexpensive = 4 peanut butter & jelly-filled starsDon't feel like buffet? Don't feel like paying $$$ for an entree? are you in a hurry to watch a show? clubbing? gambling? or whatever it is...if you're just hungry and you want something simple & quick...then stop by at Earl of Sandwich, just inside of PH..near the Hawaiian Tropic entrance passage way.the sandwich is good, fresh, the bread is toasted crunchy on the outside. It's a good quick meal.Depending on which hotel you stay at in Vegas, you are sure to be bombarded with advertisements of their in house attractions. Most of the time it's their shows, their buffets, they're world class restaurants... That's why when I stayed at Planet Hollywood last week, I had a Laugh Out Loud moment when I kept seeing this 'Earl Of Sandwich' sandwich shop promotion everywhere. I mean seriously, from the moment you walk into Planet Hollywood at check-in... to the elevator rides up... to the adverts in your room... they keep promoting a sandwich shop? LOL.Well guess what, all the adverts worked and I finally gave in to try this place on my last night in Vegas- and i'm very glad i did! The sandwich was actually awesome! I got the 'All American'... thick slices of turkey, visibly fresh lettuce and tomato, melted American and Swiss cheese on toasted bread, all topped off with cranberry sauce... Maybe it's because i was far from home and had been sick of eating buffets all week long- this sandwich just stood out as delicious. Be sure to use the coupon found in your VIP booklet! I think it's buy one get one free? I grabbed another one before i checked out the next morning for the long drive home ;) A 4 star Sandwich Shop.i declare ye ~ delicious.SO GOOD! STILL SO GOOD!i got the chance to take my parents here. My parents aren't the biggest fans of sandwiches... and they have the mentality where they can always make their own sandwiches at home; no need to pay $6 for a sandwich. So i got them to try Earl's... and they LOVED it.  My mom loves the bread and my dad liked it so much he wants to franchise it. hahaI'm going to say that these sandwiches were the best in Las Vegas for two reasons:1) It's one of the only sandwich places among the string of high end buffets and sit-down restaurants2) My veins were coursing with tons of alcohol courtesy of Fat Tuesday/PURE the night before and eating meaty, carb-filled sandwiches just always tastes better under the influence. There was a lot to be happy about at this place, drunken bias aside:+ Large variety of sandwiches and salads+ Only 6 bucks, which is dirt cheap for Vegas!+ I had the Cannonballs and it tasted really good+ Plenty of seating with clean tables+ They're open for most of the day and nightThis place will fuel you with enough carby-goodness to get you through another day of experiencing Sin City. You should definitely consider making a pit stop here if you're around!You remember that Simpsons episode where they had the Springfield power plant vs. Shelbyville power plant baseball game?  Montgomery Burns hired a bunch of ringers to win.  Do you remember that one had an addiction to those energy drinks?  One of them said, "It's like there's a party in my mouth and everyone's invited!"  My reaction was along those lines.  However my lady friend said, "Stop making that face!"  Apparently this place is so good, I made the "Oh" face.  Yeah... it's THAT good.  Things to go for:Full MontagueCaprese (for you vegetarians)Jerk ChickenItalian Cheddar/Broccoli soupI'm drooling as I write this in remembrance of how delicious my Caribbean Jerk chicken sandwich was. Mmmm. With an extra M.Plus this place is open ... 24 hours. A delicious, beyond delicious, cheap sandwich place (came out to be around $7.25 for a sandwich) that's hot and melty any time of the day. Did I die and go to food heaven?Everything here just smells delicious, they use a special kind of bread that's very ... ciabatta meets flaky crust type deal ... delicious and kind of falls apart but compliments your sandwich perfectly. Their meats are extremely juicy and succulent (yes I just used succulent to describe meat ... really this place takes the cake!). Their sauces are awesome and their sandwiches go great with Grey Poupon! I wish I could order some. :( and now I'm hungry.One of the few dining options with reasonable prices in Las Vegas.  Somehow my friends and I always end up here after a fun night out clubbing and we're starving and want some good, simple food fast.  Sandwiches are a great price for the taste (and for being on the Las Vegas Strip) -- $6-8.  There's also a variety of drinks, desserts, snacks, soups and a kid's meal.I tried the caprese sandwich, tasted great.  Ordered an Earl's Frozen Lemonade.  It was very very sweet, way too sweet.  Felt like I was drinking lemon syrup.  It was under $3 and I was dehydrated, so I didn't waste too much money.  I also ordered a soup, which is also at a low price of about $3.This is everything Quizno's  grew up aspiring to be.  Too bad for us, Quizno's suffers from type A retardation.The Full Montagu has turkey, roast beef and is held together very nicely by cheese and it's fantastic toasted bread.  The tomato soup will warm your soul after losing Jr.'s college fund on the Baccarat table. It's like Spaghetti-O's minus the O's, which I am fond of.  They throw croutons in there to sweeten the deal.Luckily, I had not yet began binge drinking and was able to read up on some world history.  This Earl dude (maybe his name was John), invented the sandwich during a card game in jolly old England. I always thought the sandwich was an American invention.  It's Brit.  Damn you, history.  Damn you for opening my eyes to the truth.And now for your sandwich tip (yeah baby, tip) of the day.  Their HP steak sauce would make anything better.  If you douse your TV with it, it might stop you from putting your foot through your LCD when Oprah is on.  By the way, it's Canadian.  Have you noticed how our friend, the sandwich has been hiding behind a wall of deceit?  Perhaps it's all for the best that there aren't many Earl of Sandwiches around.  I wouldn't want Billy Bob's world to implode when he finds out that his fried bologna sandwich on crust-less off brand bread came from overseas.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DkYS3arLOhA8si5uUEmHOw?select=f87flydbA6bnMIEZXqQuwwNow.  Time to get outta bed and onto a chair at the 3 Card Poker table.Any restaurant with 4.5 Stars after hundreds of ratings is going to attract my attention.  Today was the day I went to give this place a shot.I took my son along.  We decided that we were going to order an Original Sandwich & an Italian Sandwich.....that we we could split each of them and give them both a try.When we arrived, the place was packed.  However, this restaurant knows how to handle volume.  The ordering & payment process was smooth.I was surprised to see the selection of Chips, Fruit, Beer & Wine, and Muffins & Pastries that were available.  We found a 2 Top table and waited for our number to be buzzed.After about 10 minutes, our pager buzzed and I went to pick up our order.The Sandwiches are hot & toasted.  I eagerly bit into the Original Sandwich (Roast Beef, Cheddar Cheese, & Creamy Horseradish Sauce).  The Bread was toasted just right and the Roast Beef was tender, it melted in my mouth.  The bite of the Cheddar Cheese & Creamy Horseradish went very well with the meat & bread.....it was like heaven!  I couldn't get enough.....I wish I ordered a full sandwich.So, I couldn't wait to eat my half of the Italian (Salami, Capicola, Roasted Ham, Mortadella, Mozzarella Cheese, Roma Tomato, and Zesty Italian Dressing).....again, it was toasted just right.  This sandwich also burst with flavor on my taste buds......oh man, I think I hit the jackpot!!!This place was off the hook!  For once, a restaurant lived up to the hype!  5 Stars in my book.The only knock for me is that it is very inconvenient for a local to get in/out of Planet Hollywood just to get a sandwich.Will I come back?  Abso-freakin'-lutely!Earl of Sandwich!!! Great prices for GREAT sandwiches! We all know that just about anything in Vegas costs an arm and a leg. Even their McDonald's are a bit more expensive than your typical local mickey Ds. Earl of Sandwich's sandwiches typically costs under $7.00. Like Janice H. mentioned, it is a BARGAIN for LAS VEGAS! I wish there's an Earl of Sandwich in LA!Wow. Talk about overrated !Okay so I only ordered a Tuna salad, because I really wasn't that hungry, but my other gfs ordered sandwiches and according to them it was an overall, 'Mehh.'  'Mehh' as in..you can find a much better bang for your buck at a local sandwich shop in your neck of the woods. Items aren't expensive so I give them that. They have everything you would find: hot sandwiches (duh), wraps, salads, coffee/tea, potato chips, breakfast options, and even dessert ! There's a lot of history behind this franchise..250 years to be exact so they must be doing something right ?! Uhh..right ?? Unfortunately, my experience wasn't quite enticing or memorable.Earl of Sandwich is like Subway - As in, you place a sandwich shop all by its' lonesome away from potential competition and not many food options available and you'll get hoards of people to come in. Smart Earl. Real smart. Due to its' Vegas location (i.e., inside Planet Hollywood), I'm not surprised many people line up here. This is an easy 'grab n go' meal-type setting and when in Viva Las Vegas, sometimes you just want a quick fix while you go around galavanting Sin City.  Okay..so on to my food:How can you mess up Tuna salad right ? Well, you sure can in this case. Waaaay overdressed and it reminded me of 'cafeteria food' where the ladies in aprons and hair nets use those hand scoopers to pile on a ball of coleslaw or mash potato on you cafeteria tray. Ya..I got a tuna ball *insert imagination* ! I should have known better, but I was really craving a salad. Is this premade? I could have sworn I saw some tossing up front. Oh..and I hate when they dress the salad for you. I like it on the side. I should have asked prior, but everyone seemed to be in a rush to order and move out the way. So I grabbed my salad and herbal hot green tea and went on my merry way.Rating Scale from 1-5:Appearance: Ball of Tuna = 1  Taste: Mushy, overdressed, still edible = 2Originality: If cafeteria food is original, then I MUST be from another planet = -1Overall score: 2 stars because I enjoyed my herbal hot green tea and the salad wasn't that expensive (thank goodness !)So maybe I should have gotten a damn sandwich, but I wasn't feelin' it at the time and my gfs weren't that impressed by it either. Would I give this place another shot ? If I had no other choice, maybe. Ok yes. No maybe. Ha !Happy 2011 everyone!  Hope everyone had a terrific NY celebration (nothing crazy and unsafe, yet extremely awesome and entertaining!)  Now the New Year is upon us, let me start off with a 5 star review for ya'll!Earl of Sandwich... I've never really been a sandwich fanatic and this was all the rage prior to my recent last trip to Vegas by everyone I know and all the reviews posted on yelp.  On the day we were going to be leavin' LV I've decided to give it a shot by walking across the street for a quick brunch at Earl's.Oh boy am I glad that I did just that!You know... sandwiches are sandwiches.. nothing spectacular but nothing too horrible either... (a very safe type of food).  However, here at Earl's it's absolutely incredible on how they can possibly make things tastes so good!Again due to my typical curiosity and the irresistible temptation on trying new things,  I've decided to almost but the entire menu for my food tasting lab I've set up in Bellagio.  (I end up getting the Full Montagu, Hawaiian BBQ, Caribbean Jerk Chicken, and the Earl Cobb Salad.)  The sandwiches were $5.99 each with a decent portion (ain't the size of subway but quality is much much better!), and with two drinks the total came out to like $31 and change...(slightly pricey in my mind but gotta give it a try)I did share all this food with 3 other people though,,, so I not really the pig that I say I am.....So here were our thoughts...Full Montagu:  Great roast beef sandwich with turkey and swiss cheese... the roast beef was the real deal and it had the texture of soft arby's roast beef..... So taking that soft morsels that you call beef coupled with high quality you get an awesome sandwich!Hawaiian BBQ:  I didn't get to try this as my friend devoured it down in a quick few minutes... so I'm gonna take that gesture as awesome and leave it as that!  Jamaican Jerk Chicken:  Jerk flavored chicken + roasted bell peppers in a jerk sauce made this sandwich really really delicious!  That's all I can tell you!  Yum!Highlights of these sandwiches, the BREAD!  They toasted in a way where it's just the right moisture, the right texture, the right flavor, the right crispiness, and the right size overall!  It's just a really delicious bread to compliment all the dressings in between!  I've always believed that what makes a sandwich great is simply the bread itself, and Earl of Sandwich really proved that to be the main point!Earl Cobb:  Aside from having slightly too much dressing that I would have liked (I always watch my dressing calorie count as this is the main trick in getting a salad), it was absolutely delicious!  I've have had many salads in various places, I gotta say that this is one of the more tasty salads for a fast food joint.  Definitely worth the price!  (The people I was with weren't even into salads and they really enjoyed that too!)It's sort of weird that if you want ice tea you have to ask for it.... but you got the typical fountain drinks available for you (pepsi products)One final note.... this place has recently updated their operational hours and it is now 24 hrs!!!  WOW!  That's so awesome!  So you're telling me when I'm hungry late at night working on them slots, I can get myself a sandwich to go, sit down at the slot, blackjack machine, or anywhere to be gambling and eating at the same time?  I Love Vegas!!!So there you have it folks!  The first review of 2011 by yours truly and it is definitely a 5 stars in my mind.  So again hope everyone will be having a SUPER DUPER 2011 and if you do visit Vegas, may the money gods follow you to every machine/table you go to, and the sandwich gods guide you to Earl of Sandwich!While in Las Vegas, you walk up to the craps table and you got the pass and the don't pass line. Well for me, Earl of Sandwich was definitely a "pass". I came to the Planet Hollywood location to pick up a Caribbean Jerk Chicken Sandwich ($6) and wasn't impressed with the flavor, breading or amount of chicken. They are suppose to add a spicy jerk sauce but I couldn't taste any additional "bite". When I asked to remove the inside breading, they took a knife and made my roll paper thin compared to pulling out the breading. It's a simple concept; you order and they give you a pager when your sandwich was ready. The staff were young and didn't pay very much attention to customer service. Lots of seating and it can get very busy throughout the day. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing but for $6, you can't beat a quick bite on the strip and head back to the craps tables!huh.... #1 on "Hot on Yelp" on the Yelp homepage for Las Vegas. I was expecting some expensive 5-star restaurant. But when I think about it, Earl of Sandwich is something I always crave on my Vegas trip.Not only is it the best drunk food (opened late), it's also perfect for lunch and dinner. It's located in the casino part (not the mile shops) of Planet Hollywood. Every time I come here, my go-to sandwich is the cannonball. Delicious bread, meatballs, marinara, and gooey cheeeeese. Simple, yet gorgeous.My boyfriend and I shared one as an after-club snack and on the last bite of my boyfriend's sandwich, he dropped the last meatball on the floor. In all honesty, it was the saddest part of our night. So sad that we talked about it the next morning, very true story.It's that good, man.A sandwich place. It's 24 hours.Located in the Miracle Mile next to PBR bar and grill.Delicious sandwiches. Delicious soups. They have Newcastle. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DkYS3arLOhA8si5uUEmHOw?select=YthQGafrgMApLF_XMj_ZkwI had the cannonBALL sandwich. It was tasty! Did I mention it was 24 hours?? 5 stars.A 24 hour cheap hot sandwich place is a vegas jackpot!!!  I always find myself having sandwich cravings and i'd been spending weeks looking at the reviews. I had decided way before i stepped into the store at PH, that i would be ordering the Full Montagu- Roast beef and turkey!!! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DkYS3arLOhA8si5uUEmHOw?select=pqiqUiWVESs9LubdKK2zcwWe were still full from breakfast, so i didn't get to try a second sandwich as i had hoped (i'm definitely getting the canonball meatball sammie next time). I'm sure after i try a few more different sammies here, i would upgrade to a 5, but based on just the one i had, i just needed a little something more. More mayonaisy sauce? Avocado? Not sure. But i am not craving it, as i do with Cooks, Mendo, Caps or Langers. But... I will be back for sure to get the cannonball and get ANOTHER brownie whoopie pie !! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DkYS3arLOhA8si5uUEmHOw?select=DbdvnjAtWRE2Hj0_MbX26QI had to check out what everyone in Las Vegas was babbling about, and the babbles were 100 percent accurate!! I was expecting regular sandwiches, and in one of the previous reviews that I have read, these sandwiches were actually compared to Capriotti's!WHEN: It is open 24 hours so you have no excuse to not get up and try it!!WHERE: Located inside the Miracle Mile Shops in Planet Hollywood, right across from the Sugar Factory.WHAT: Knowing this, I took my first bite into The Earl Club, and the first bite was all I needed to know that this was truly going to be one of my favorite sandwich joints. It hit the spot right away, haha! The flavors all intermingled inside of  artesian bread created a PARTY IN MY MOUTH! I couldn't get enough, so I came back the next day excited to try another sandwich! This time I tried the Tuna Melt. OMG, I felt like I tasted PARADISE! This is the best tuna melt I have ever tasted!! Beautifulness! Its simplicity was all that was needed to be the best on my list!Besides the sandwiches, I liked the Iced Tea Lemonade! It is something different, but different is good sometimes! =DMy newfound goal is to try all of the sandwiches here!! LOL Another thing, incomparable to Capriotti's for sure SON!WHY: IF YOU HAVE NOT TRIED THE SANDWICHES HERE YET, YOU NEED TO TRY IT FOR YOURSELF INSTEAD OF READING MY FLUFFED UP REVIEW. LOL, THE FLUFF WAS SO NECESSARY!! ENJOY. =)My first impression was (after hearing everyone and their moms rave about the sandwiches), "Really, a sandwich? How amazing can a sandwich really be?"The answer is: it was AMAZING.A-ll the rave really exists for a reason. Located in Planet Hollywood, you could easily pass by this place not knowing its grand existence if you weren't aware of their famous sandwiches. But once you try it you might be so impressed you won't know how to react.M-eat meat meat. The roasted beef was a shocker to my mouth. How could something that looks so simple taste so smooth and delicious? Perfectly soft, perfectly chewy, and just enough flavor that only an Earl's can achieve.A-nd after all that I was thrown off by another memorable discovery. The bread. Warm, crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside, and the most perfectly toasted crust gently surrounding the outsides of my sandwich.Z-ero complaints.I-n Vegas, the party goes on...all night long. That's why they're open 24 hours for your eating pleasure.N-ext time I'm in Vegas, I am stocking up! Great to have on the roadtrip back home. Does anyone know how I can preserve these babies so I can have a stash of them to eat until my next trip to Vegas?G-oogle image "Earl of Sandwich" and you will see a man named Earl Montagu who apparently "invented" the sandwich. Fun fact, the 11th Earl of Sandwich still operates this empire!The lasting impression? "First thing to eat when I go to Vegas, last thing to eat before I leave Vegas."I went to Vegas for a weekend in May, and all told I spent less than $300.  I made a little money playing poker, so I only left $170 in Sin City.  That's for food, gas, hotel, everything.One of the reasons I was able to do this was that I got two meals out of Earl of Sandwich for a grand total of $6.48.  My car got to Vegas hours before our friends, so we decided to have a cheap, casual dinner.  I did a quick search on Yelp, and this place came up with its hundreds of reviews.Earl of Sandwich is in Planet Hollywood, a kind of funny theme hotel if you know anything about Los Angeles.  I find it amusing that the mall is billed as the Miracle Mile Shops, as if the Miracle Mile is a glamorous shopping mecca in L.A.  Even Earl of Sandwich is out of place - it's a chain restaurant, but there isn't a single branch in California.Don't be alarmed that it's a chain.  It's a step up from Quizno's (though I like Quizno's, and Subway, too), and I appreciated its impressive efficiency.  There was a short line to order, but once we got our orders in, we sat down with our buzzers.  They started buzzing while we were getting water, and our food was hot and ready within five minutes of arrival.I ordered the Full Montagu with roast beef, turkey, aged swiss, sharp cheddar, lettuce, tomato, and mustard sauce.  I had half for dinner and half for lunch the next day - I never went hungry, and the sandwich reheated great.  It was really tasty, with good ingredients and plenty of them.  I also tried some of my friends' orders - the Italian sandwich and the Earl's Cobb.  The Italian was maybe even better than the Montagu, with a meatfest of salami, capicola, ham, and mortadello, topped with mozzarella, roma tomato, and a zesty Italian dressing.  Peppers were optional and delicious.  Even the salad was pretty good.  It wasn't a deprivation salad - it came with plenty of grilled chicken and bacon, swiss and cheddar cheese, and a buttermilk ranch dressing.  But it also had plenty of greens and tomato, cucumber, and cranberries.If you're in Vegas for the full Vegas experience, go balls out, hit Robuchon, whatever you want.  But it's nice to know that you can eat something good for $5.99 and tax.  I love a good sandwich, and the Earl delivers.yea, i thought this place was going to suck (it's on the strip), so I had my suck face on, but after the first couple of bites, I had my non-suck face on.what more needs to be said after 1K reviewsFor Vegas, Earl's is an absolute gem. Opened 24 hours AND toasty, tasty sammies? Perfect anecdote/joint to end/start? your 4:00 am debaucheries ;)I love Earl's Turkey Club Sandwich -- it's not only a safe sandwich but it's really good and fulfilling. The bread is AMAZING; it's toasted to perfection and it doesn't scratch up your gums.  Earl's bread has the right amount of crispy crunch and soft dough to compliment the contents of the sandwich.  Everything else seems fresh but I wasn't exactly BLOWN away.  Like I said, for Vegas, yes, this is damn good. I've had better sandwiches in the OC and LA in California BUT I'll give it to Earl's for being the best in Sin City.Tried the Full Montagu (beef, turkey, cheddar/swiss cheese, etc.) and it was good, but not my fave. Solid sandwich, though.Also, their Tomato Bisque -- UM, AMAZING.  I felt so sick after my Vegas trip and had to have soup at Earl's. Best decision during my trip, EASY. Their garlic croutons added the perfect kick to the tomato flavor (which tasted so homey, omg). Rich and slightly creamy... perfect for the weak stomach :)**Accepts credit cards**Tucked away in Planet Hollywood, across from The Sugar Factory**Open 24/7!!**Long line but don't be discouraged, it goes by really fast.Earl of Sandwich, you never fail to satisfy my starving tummy after a long night at the club. Forget the steak and eggs, go for Earl of Sandwich's Tuna Melt, Italian, Hawaiian BBQ, Earl's Club, and other amazing sandwiches.My favorite part about the sandwiches: The toasted crispy bread that's always perfectly toasted.after rolling out of bed WELL past breakfast & lunch, earl of sandwich sounds like a great vegas-cheap eatwe shared 2 of their signature hot sammies! which aren't amazing BUT when you're hungry in vegas & on budget... the toasted bread & ingredients do wonders----the full montagu----the carribean jerk chicken!NOTE: everyone's got the same idea..you'll probably run into someone you know here.. soOOo look alive!!!There are a few rules to follow when in Vegas:1) Don't marry a stripper.2) Don't drink & gamble on an empty stomach.3) Don't call the number on those fliers people hand out to you on the strip. You'll just end up marrying a hooker. That's worse than a stripper if you're wondering.So as I wanted to adhere to this rule system, my BF & I paid a visit to the Earl of Sandwich before going out for drinks and gambling. For $5.99 these sandwiches are a crazy good deal! I had the roast beef w/ horseradish and I loved how the bread is nicely toasted. I highly recommend if you're looking to get a quick bite.Oh and when we stepped back out on the strip I told the man handing out fliers to my BF that he already had a naked girl...but thank you!Yelp 365 Challenge: #33/365 (The Rules)Eat It or Beat It?**EAT IT!!**Earl isn't just great for when you're still drunk at 3am with hardcore drunchies... it's actually seriously freekn' good! With prices at $6 a sandwich and 15+ choices to choose from, all of which are priced the same, you can't complain! OK, I get it, Subway has $5 footlongs, but EOS is top notch. First of all, the bread... the bread, bread, bread... it is soooo amazing: soft with a lil crunch and a whole lotta mmm, mmm!If you're a newb, start with the original! In fact, the original IS my favorite! Last time I was in Vegas, I brought home 10 sandwiches back home for friends and family to try, and after sitting in the car for 4 hours... it still tasted amazing! CONCLUSION:Eat it! Whether you're sober, buzzed, drunk, or because you just want to eat, EAT ITTTTTTT!Dear Earl,Oh how I've been longing to meet you.  After multiple Vegas trips, I still couldn't find a good reason to come to your house at the Planet Hollywood Miracle Mile shops until last month.  Not sure if you remember me, but I came with 3 other people and it was their first time meeting you too. I kinda feel bad because I was the one who suggested checking you out. Thank goodness the time I came to see you, there was no line because waiting in line for a sandwich, that shit cray.  But I'm glad my friends enjoyed your company. For me, it was kinda like a going on a date.  Spending money and at the end of the date, I'm left wanting more.  Usually that's a good thing.  But after I left you, I saw some lobster roll place and kinda wish I spent my time and money there.  Which is usually not a good thing.However, $5.99 a sandwich, I wouldn't be totally against coming by to see you again.  Don't call me, I'll call you.Smooches,Bong EPS - I got to try The Original and The Club.  Maybe next time I'll try the Cannonball because I had a friend drop a meatball on the floor and thought about eating it.Best hot sandwiches ever.  Question Mark.With the guys preoccupied with "guy stuff," I was left to roam The Strip all by my lonesome. When my tummy notified me that it was lunchtime, I didn't have to search far to find a quick grub spot; I was standing right in front of an ad for Earl of Sandwich! Well, that was effortless, thank you Universe.My Caprese Salad & a fountain root beer cost less than $9. I so appreciated the very appropriate portion--just enough for one moderately hungry girl--as some portions in Vegas tend to err on the side of REE-diculous. The tomatoes & mozzarella were fresh, but the salad was kind of drowning in its vinaigrette. Overall, it was un-special & really kind of "meh" but I can't knock a place that serves $5.99 salads & sandwiches.Won't be a stop on *my* next trip to Vegas, but if you've just lost your shirt at the blackjack table, *you* may want to stop by this wallet-friendly Planet Hollywood eatery.For the price ($5.99) this was a great sandwich.  The line was long but it moved pretty fast. I split the full montagu and Caribbean jerk chicken with my friend. The montagu was a solid sandwich but it was something I can put together. The one thing that I don't have is the mustard. Earl's mustard was sweet and tangy and delicious. If I based my review just on the montagu I would give it a three star but since I had the jerk chicken I'm giving this place a four star. The jerk chicken was really good. I love food with bold flavors. Loved the spiciness from jerk sauce and the peppers. Would love to go back to try more.Earl of Sandwich. You were underrated to my taste.Don't know what all the rave & hype is about. Their food tastes the same as Subway's, if not worse. Y'all must be all intoxicated while eating this shit cuz this place tastes OK when you're sober.I must admit the bean soup was really good though I was hella drunk while eating it. It was the only "good" taste that stood out. The line is definitely not worth the wait HAHA.Props to them for opening 24 hrs. That's probably how they make so much money...charging drunktards (like me that night) for multiple sandwiches. I came back to the hotel with two bags of 2 sandwiches & 2 soups. Wtf.It's good munchies food but for lunch? Nahhh I'd rather go to In n Out or Chinatown.After a failed attempt to give Earl and Sandwich a shot back in September, I was happy to finally get my hands on one of their sandwiches last week. Preciousssss...(Golem from 'The Lord of The Rings')NO LINE, YES!I've read many Yelpers reviews that talk about having to wait in line. When we got to Earl's, thankfully when we got there, there was NO line. SCORE! I ordered The Earl's Club, and some pasta salad, and some chips, and (THERE'S ALWAYS ROO FOR DESSERT. WARNING WARNING.) a cookie and a fruit  parfait (I WAS HUNGRY!!!). =X NO LOVE AT FIRST BITEEh, there wasn't anything special about this sandwich and how it tasted. In fact I've had better sandwiches elsewhere (Little Lucca's in South San Francisco, CA). I was fairly disappointed because of the rave reviews I've read here on Yelp. Don't get me wrong the sandwich was still good, it was mediocre tasting and nothing to rave about. =X Goodness, I hope I don't get shot for this review!! CONCLUSIONEverything I ordered, that includes sides and desserts were just okay. Not awesome, not horrible BUT okay. So....3 STARS! Would I come back? Eh, maybe if I was desperately craving for a sandwich. =)After seeing so many people review them on Yelp, I was stoked to finally check out Earl of Sandwich.  From the way people hand them five stars and how they've earned about 1,800 reviews, it's like they're sandwich royalty!When a couple of my friends and I stopped by to grab a quick dinner before meeting with everyone else, we fully expected to run into a line.  Given their popularity, we figured it wouldn't be a question of "if" there would be a wait, but "how long", especially since we were going around 7:00.  Much to our surprise, there wasn't a single person ahead of us when we got there.  Score!  Since my friend and I both wanted to try a couple of their sandwiches, we decided to get two different types to share.  While she ordered The Original 1762 (Roast Beef, Sharp Cheddar, and Horseradish Sauce), I ordered the Italian (Salami, Capicola, Roasted Ham, Mortadella, Mozzarella, Roma Tomatoes, and Italian Dressing).  Even though I tried to set aside any expectations I had, it was tough trying to block out the reviews I read.  While the sandwiches were decent, they fell a little short for me.  With all the hype though, it was bound to happen.- The Original 1762 (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DkYS3arLOhA8si5uUEmHOw?select=REJJpOEpwaK0fLvh-bKn0g) - it's essentially a roast beef sandwich, but its simplicity worked.  The roast beef and sharp cheddar were nice, but it was the horseradish sauce that did it for me - potent enough for a kick, but not enough to be harsh.  I wish the meat had been a little more medium rare than medium though.  - Italian (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DkYS3arLOhA8si5uUEmHOw?select=k8Po4fzJS9cgJcYsOdhfrw) - okay, but I think the Hot Italian at JJ Boulangerie at the Paris hotel is better (and bigger).  I liked the blend of flavors from the meat, but it was hard to separate them out.  The Roma tomatoes added some freshness, but I could have used less of them.  Ditto for the Italian Dressing.Regardless of anything else, Earl is an especially budget friendly option given its location on the Strip (sandwiches were about $7.00 each).  Plus points as well for being open 24 hours - way better for late night munchies than the 24 cafe at Paris or the bar at Bally's.  For those reasons, I'm rounding up from THREE AND A HALF to four.  Had we actually gone then (drunk) instead of for dinner (sober), I probably would have loved Earl of Sandwich.  Instead, depending on the sandwich I want, I might lean towards JJ Boulangerie instead and save my Earl trips for post drinking/clubbing adventures.Earl of Sandwich...mmm...so good...We live in a time when most everything is all about the hype and thus marked up several times in Vegas, especially on the strip.  What a wonderful feeling it was to discover this casual sandwich spot located inside Planet Hollywood.   It is quick, easy, delicious, satisfying and cheap!!!  $5.99 for any sandwich, wrap or salad! Yes, true!I love love their BLT.  The Caribbean Jerk Chicken Sandwich and Tuna Melt are also very popular and delicious.  It's their warm, soft bread that really steps their sandwiches a notch above most others. Their salads are not so good so unless you're seriously allergic to bread or something, try a sandwich. Best of all, it's open 24/7 as it should be in this town!Want to know what the best tasting thing in Vegas is at 3:30AM after hours of sinister fun? The Full Montagu http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DkYS3arLOhA8si5uUEmHOw?select=0hAaWj1C6H_DdxKTKrNxvA    As you can see, The Full Montagu is not an adult themed show featuring scantly clad sexy boys shaking their junk for the masses. This Full Montagu is a big, warm, mouthwatering sandwich packed with freshly roasted beef, turkey, aged Swiss, sharp cheddar, lettuce, Roma tomatoes and Earl's Mustard Sauce (I also add banana peppers). This sandwich is perfect. It's salty. It's sweet and because I added peppers, it's also slightly spicy. And the bread it's served on, oh that bread is great too. Lightly toasted on the outside and soft and fluffy on the inside. Besides the FM, Earl also has a good amount of other amazing tasting sandwiches, both hot and cold, like their Caribbean Jerk Chicken and the Cannonballs, both of which I sampled before (at the location in FL).  They also have salads, wraps, chips, tasty desserts and even breakfast Sammie's http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DkYS3arLOhA8si5uUEmHOw?select=bcK75Axd_C6o9qCvSOe-pwThe Vegas location of Earl is conveniently located inside the Planet Hollywood Resort and Casino and is open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Freaking sweet. And last but not least, the prices here are super cheap, which is also a major plus in case you pulled a Clark Griswold and lost your life savings at the blackjack tables and only have a few bucks left to your name. I love Vegas Vacation. It's hilarious. Anyways, to sum it all up ya gotta check out Earl of Sandwich while you're in LV. It rocks! Oh, and Eugine, baby, I thought of your handsome mug every time I walked by Earl.Probably the best deal you can get in Vegas.  For the price of one hand of blackjack you can get a nice hot sandwich and a full belly.  I came back twice just because I liked it so much.I dug the Veggie (lent) and it was pretty awesome!  I also had the full Montague and it was delish as well.  The meat is perfection, nice and rare and juicy, I just wish I could have a huge pile of the meat!The Caprese was okay, I kinda felt like it was an afterthought.  And their was only one piece of basil for the entire sandwich....I'd skip that one next time.Someone should open up a franchise in LA because it would make a killing.I'm not a huge sandwich person... but you wouldn't know it whenever I stay at Planet Hollywood.  I literally want EOS for every meal.  The bread they make and use is so fresh and perfect with every sandwich.  A smaller bun is used for their breakfast sandwiches... but hits the spot, all the same.  I've had the following: - the ultimate grilled cheese- the tuna melt with swiss (I request for them to add lettuce and tomato... no extra charge!)- the earl's club with turkey and bacon- the full montagu - roast beef and turkey- the breakfast blt (i request to add egg on mine... no extra charge!)- the caprese - they definitely don't skimp on the mozzarrella!  - the blt - the tomato soupEverything.  And I mean EVERYTHING above is delicious.  However, the tuna melt is my all time favorite.  $5.99 for a regular sandwich and $3.99 for a breakfast one... can't get a better quality meal for that price on the strip!  Wish I ordered an extra one yesterday to have today while I drool and write this review...Good and Cheap!!!Everyone, I mean EVERYONE tells me great things about this place. Earl is located in Planet Hollywood. You just line up, pick your sandwich, pick up anything else you'd like (e.g. Chips, desserts, yogurt), pay, and wait for your food. I opted for the CAPRESE SANDWICH. So good! Mozzarella, basil, tomatoes, and balsamic vinegar. SOO good! And what, four to five bucks only?! Wait, open 24 hours?! What?!  Can't wait until they open a location in down town Disney!!!I feel like the last kid on the block to finally get a pair of the hottest high-tops (or should I say trying out the much talked about Earl).We were passing back through Vegas on our epic weekend in Utah, and we decided to spend a night in Vegas (believe me it was hard to leave the next day) the only request I had besides hitting up a buffet and laying out at the pool with a drink is to stop at Earl's and have a sandwich.With that in mind, we all planned to hit this place up for lunch the next day! Earl is easy to locate, half in the PH casino/half in the miracle mile mall. We arrived about 1:00ish and there was a small line, it moved fast which was good. Trying to decide on what to order became a picked as fast as possible which is never an option for me since I saw four sandwiches that interested me!Their menu has plenty to pick from along with salads and wraps. Going on the more "healthy" route I picked a wrap, now which one to choose from (oh the choices).A tiny part of me really wished they could have made the jerk chicken sandwich into a wrap, but they pretty much only can make salads into wraps (boo)! The cashiers are fast yet friendly. If you have a question, they are more than happy to answer it for you!It was our turn and I placed my order:The Earl's Cobb Wrap-grilled chicken, smoked bacon, Swiss and sharp cheddar cheese, Roma tomatoes, cucumber, cranberries and Buttermilk Ranch Dressing.I opted not to have the swiss cheese (not a fan). Tossed in some BBQ kettle chips and I was good to go, Minh grabbed our number, and a drink and we were off to find a table. Did not take us too long to find a place for the four of us to sit at. Getting our sandwich and wrap did not take too long either.Before I knew it, I had my much-awaited wrap sitting in front of me bagging to be open. I have to admit that i  had a "Willy Wonka" moment peeling back the golden paper. Sitting inside the golden paper was a delicious wrap filled with all the goodies; I could not take it anymore. I had to take a bite or two. Bite one... wow this is scrumdiddlyumptious! but oh no my chicken and lettuce fell out the back end of my wrap, the bf was super sweet to stop eating to go and get me a fork so I could eat what fell out. Bite two... I loved the cranberries in the wrap; it gave it a subtle sweet kick. The ranch was prefect in the amount they gave you.And yes, there was plenty of chicken, cheese, and bacon with every bite!The chips are good too, not to greasy but more of a lighter taste with a whole lot of flavor and crunch!I left not feeling overly full, but just the right amount of being satisfied! Cannot wait until their new location in Anaheim opens! It will be Earltastic!!!Finally made it over to see what all of the Earl of Sandwich hype is all about. My sweetie and I decided on lunch out today and a sandwich is what popped in my head and someplace new!I ordered the Hawaiian BBQ, grilled chicken, roasted Ham, aged Swiss, pineapple & Hawaiian BBQ Sauce. It was sweet and good, the meat was moist and juicy. I could have eaten two of these mmmm yum!My sweetheart got the The Full Montagu,  roast beef, turkey,  swiss & sharp cheddar, lettuce, roma tomatoes & the Earl's mustard sauce. We each took a bite of each others sandwich and they are both delicious.We also both ordered a side of potato salad, mmm yum made with the red skin potatoes, was good. Unlimited fountain drinks, coffee and iced tea as well as hot tea.We will stop by again if at Planet Hollywood hotel and casino however don't think will make a special trip to dine here like we did today. I am glad my curiosity has finally been fulfilled :)**** 2.5 stars ****I suppose this is technically an edible sandwich and it's cheap, which is the only reason I'm rounding up here, but what the hell is with all this praise? 2,000 reviews+ and still a 4.5 star rating for something less edible than any random Quiznos or Potbelly... I just don't get it. Granted, I was doing everything I could to keep my brain from pounding out of my skull as Brian and I waited patiently in the somewhat quick moving but incredibly long line, but I still think I was functioning enough to know that this was a disappointment of pretty big proportions.A few years ago when Nicole was staying in Vegas for a brief conference I suggested the Earl as one of the places she should definitely hit for a quick meal, based mainly on the overwhelming number of positive reviews. Her response was basically "it's a good sandwich", with little emphasis in either direction. I thought, OK, maybe she just tried the wrong one (although it was definitely the one I would have gone for as well). I happened to see Venu N's review just prior to my trip, and it sort of confirmed what I was fearing, that this was somehow just the average public broadcasting basement show which somehow snowballed itself into primetime relevance. Or perhaps it's some combination of groupthink with the more dangerous drunkthink.I think I only paid about $6 for my "Cannonballs!" sandwich, which is probably fair enough, but it was just so unimpressive. Just look at the photo, it's sad. The bread was warm and toasted on the ends but not so much in the middle, and the meatballs were sparse and cold inside. I felt less awful, physically, after eating it, but I'm not so sure that statement couldn't have applied to virtually anything at that point. There really just isn't anything special here. I was certainly still hungry afterwards, as these sandwiches are pretty small when compared to their competition.I implore you, ignore all the "amazing" and "OMG" nonsense that you'll read here. It really is quite a simple creation that has a different name people aren't familiar with (outside of the Yelp praise), and thus they mistakenly value it higher than any other chain which could easily supplant it. If you, for some reason, happen to be in this dreadful mall and simply cannot make it anywhere else before dying of starvation, then go ahead and eat here. Otherwise, find a better meal elsewhere, because really, who comes to Vegas to go the cheap route?Earl of Sandwich serves $6 sandwiches 24 hours a day. The problem is that the one and only sandwich I tried was extremely disappointing. I asked the lady at the counter for the most popular sandwich and she said, "Get the Earl Club." So, I did.Sadly, the strongest flavor for the Club was Charcoal because the crust of the Bread was burned just enough to make it snap-hard and bitter while the Bacon was 2 strips of even crunchier charcoal crisps. With skimpy toppings, light on the cheese, and not enough flavor to overcome the burnt taste, the Earl Club was a miss. I ate most of the Turkey and Cheese, but let the rest hit the trash can on the way out.The convenience of being connected to the Planet Hollywood Casino and Miracle Mile of Shops was nice, but the Earl of Sandwich was a losing bet in a city full of great eats. Treat it as a late night stomach-stuffer for $6. Nothing more. Nothing less.I had been wanting to try the Earl of Sandwich for a long time.  I had heard good things about it from friends, and had read lots of great Yelp reviews, so I was exciting to give it a try this past weekend when visiting Las Vegas.  My initial impression of the food was not good.  I was let down by the fact that my bread was pretty badly burnt on one side.  I had taken my food to go, and did not make the discovery of my bread being burnt until I got back to my room.  However, even with the sandwich being burnt, it was still decent.  Besides being burnt, the flavor of the other ingredients really stood out.  I had ordered the 'The Original', which is a roast beef sandwich with cheddar cheese and horseradish sauce.  After feeling like I missed out on something good, I decided to go back to the Earl of Sandwich the next day to give it another shot.  I ordered the same sandwich again, and it was so much better with the bread being slightly toasted.  I also got a potato salad, and liked that as well.  Overall, it was a very tasty meal.It is so hard to judge a place based off of one experience, and I am so glad that I went back to give the Earl of Sandwich another try.  My second meal was awesome, and I will definitely go back the next time I am in Las Vegas.In the ever evolving world of sandwiches, many claim to produce the best sandwich in the world.  Among the contenders are the likes of Capriotti's, Mendocino Farms, Which Wich? and many more. Among this iconic list of sandwich makers, there are droves of fans and haters alike.But make no mistake, The Earl of Sandwich makes some of the most addictively good sandwiches i've enjoyed in a very long time! Tack on the competitive prices and it makes it even better! So it's safe to say i'm a fan when it comes to the Earl's cheap & tasty eats!The Original with Roast Beef - The bread was excellent! As soon as I grabbed the warm bag in my hand, I knew I was in for a toasty treat!The bread was perfectly crisp on the outside yet warm and fluffy on the inside. Not thick, bread-y, dry & spongy like most other places. The roast beef was piled high and it was juicy and full of mouthwatering flavor!Jerk Chicken SandwichFilled with generous portions of chunk grilled chicken breast (not sandwich meat), red peppers and of course a good helping of zippy banana peppers, this zesty lil number was quite flavorful and surprisingly juicy (considering it was chicken breast!) but my favorite has to be the original for overall mmmmmm mmmm mm factor!DessertBrownie Cream SandwichImagine two chocalatey rich brownies sandwiching a decadent layer of sweet vanilla frosting...yup it's insanely rich and sweet! I advise you to purchase a glass of milk with this decadent number cuz you'll definitely need it!Service was nifty & quick and they got us in and out in no time flat! Don't forget that all toppings are free with the exclusion of avocado, so pile it high if you so desire! And did I mention the prices? Only 6$ for a delicious hot sammie! That's a steal for a great sandwich on the strip I might add!With that said, it's a no brainer...if you're out after the club looking for some awesome late nite eats or just strolling the strip, give EoS a try, you won't be disappointed!Happy Eats!There are literally thousands of reviews extolling Earl of Sandwich as the finest (and most affordable!) place to have a sandwich on the Strip.While all those reviews are indeed awesome, I'm going to talk about something else entirely: tomato soup.Yes, tomato soup.(I've said it before and I'll say it again... The easiest way to make a snap judgement about a restaurant is by looking at the quality of its soup.)The tomato soup at Earl's is orgasmic.  In fact, it's the best damn tomato soup I've ever had.  It's rich, it's creamy, and it's packed with an incredible depth of tomato flavor.  It's topped with the most perfectly crisped croutons I've ever encountered (not too soft, not too hard).  One spoonful of this tomato soup and I was in foodie heaven ...... at 8:30am.Yeah, I went to Earl's for breakfast.  Weird, I know -- but please don't hate.  It's actually a great place to go for breakfast.  There are no lines in the morning, and there's plenty of seating to go around.  In fact, it was only like 5 minutes between when I placed my order at the counter and when the little electronic plastic thingy started blinking and vibrating to let me know my food was ready.What to have with tomato soup at 8:30am?  Grilled cheese wasn't on the menu, so I had the next-best thing: the tuna melt.  And, oh my God, this tuna melt was just as orgasmic as the tomato soup.  It was a fresh, delicious roll with piping hot tuna and a layer of beautifully melted cheese.  Is there such thing as tuna bliss?  I think there is, and it's served up at Earl's.Did I mention that all this food cost less than 10 bucks?Have I convinced you of Earl's amazingness yet?  If so, get off your butt and walk -- no, RUN -- to the Planet Hollywood hotel as fast as you possibly can and start noshing on some of the best cheap eats in Las Vegas.People have often asked me about late night eats in the City of Sin and usually the first place that comes to mind is Earl of Sandwich. The good ol Earl might just be the best thing that has ever happened to Planet Hollywood and for 24 hours a day, seven days a week it feeds many appetites for non-Strip prices.For those not in the know, Earl of Sandwich is a chain. Not a Nevada only chain like some others were lead to believe, but a national one. It doesn't carry the name of a Quizno's or Subway's, only its way better and until LV gets an place that is local and convenient, it seems the rest will be flocking here and adding to the already silly lines that occur randomly throughout the week.My sandwich of choice is the Full Montagu, a beautiful concoction of turkey, roast beef, lettuce, cheddar and swiss cheeses, tomatoes, and Earl's mustard. It's a classic choice, perhaps their most popular one, and it is delicious any time - whether its hungry and sober or hungover and blacked out. A fun combination is the Turkey Holiday (aka the Thanksgiving dinner), which features turkey, cranberry sauce, stuffing, and gravy. There are a multitude of sandwiches that fit every palate, every craving, and thankfully are between $5-8 each. This is considered a great deal on the Strip.If you can stomach the lines and the sometimes impatient service, Earl of Sandwich is a rite of passage for many late night hungry folks on the strip. This is a way better alternative than shooting for the standard casino diner / cafe and worth the few bucks for a shot at sandwich glory.I've only been here 3 times in a 5 year span and I was drunk 2 out of those 3.  This place isn't on my must-eat list when I'm in Vegas, but it's good, cheap, and convenient since it's open 24 hours.  If you've never been here then it's worth a try.  The food definitely tasted better when I was intoxicated, especially the tomato bisque, for some reason that soup wasn't very tasty when I had a clear mind.  I thought it was too rich and acidic.  As for their sandwiches, I tried the "full montague" and "hawaiian bbq" and liked them both.  I think their bread is definitely the ingredient that makes their sandwiches so tasty.  It has that perfectly toasted crunchy exterior when you bite into the sandwich, then you get a mouthful of fresh ingredients and delicious soft bread.  I was just here two weeks ago but only ordered the tomato bisque, it definitely hit the spot at 3:00 am.  I'll be back!Eating sandwiches in Las Vegas?  This wasn't exactly where I saw myself eating with all the choices on The Strip.  When it came down to a decision, I couldn't refuse the loudly reviewed sandwich shop which now advertises that they OPEN 24 HOURS outside.  *Chicken tortilla soup - Bun and I almost always get a soup and share.  Through experience of sandwich shop soups, the soups usually are menu fillers.  Due to the constant reheating, flavor and freshness disappear over time.  Ranking them atop many franchise soups, the chicken tortilla soup wasn't too shabby.      *Cannonballs! - Yeah, "Cannonballs!" is the name of the sandwich.  Also don't forget that exclamation point when ordering.  Like a good o' cannonball to the face, nothing surprising here, inside they have marina, cheese, and hunky balls of meat.  Boy does my Bun love her meatball sandwiches.  Even at Subway, when in doubt, her choice would be a meatball sandwich.  Chowing down the sandwich, I wrestled it away from her for a bite.  That singular bite almost led to a second.  That is until Bun put a sleeper hold on me and yanked the sandwich out of my hand.  *Earl's Club - What's the difference between Earl's Club and a turkey club?  Not much besides the name.  Turkey, bacon, lettuce, and tomato were what I tasted before gulping it down.  Do I have any comments on the sandwich?  "Good".  My mouth is still full.  Don't bother me.        All sandwiches are about six inches and deceivingly filling.  In view of the fact their label of a franchise, nearly all ingredients tasted very fresh.  Their most underrated attribute are the artisan bread used for buns.  For about the same price, why would anyone on Earth pay for a Subway sandwich?  Budget friendly and open all the time, Earl of Sandwich is a wise choice for the haggard Strip journeyers.  In need for food and a place to rest their feet, Earl of Sandwich is a very useful alternative on The Strip.Inside of Planet Hollywood. This hotel and casino is ehh, not many slots that catches my eye nor table games BUT, I will come here for Earl of sandwich. You order, pick up your chips, pay and wait for your sandwich, the whole decor is just like a sandwich shop. I got the Earl club, since we asked the girl which was the best selling sandwich and what they were known for. My husband got the meatball sandwich. OMGOD my club sandwich was BOMB, I was able to taste everything in my sandwich, turkey, bacon, Dijon sauce, fresh tomato, the lightly toasted bread, best club sandwich ever!! Hands down. Meatball sandwich was delicious too, not overbearing with sauce and the meatball was flavorful! Mmm hmmm...AND I am not a fan of meatball sandwiches, they usually end up grossing me out because of the soggy bread and tasteless meatball. This was our meat at 1030 for our journey walk back to the Luxor, it was well worth it.To me Vegas is all about gambling, glitter, lasers, lights, music, and of course the infamous Earl of Sandwich!  Its cheap, delicious and in my opinion no trip to Vegas is complete unless it includes a couple of these AMAZING sandwiches.  My all time favorite if the Club followed by Tuna Melt and the Full Montague, but for the time being the Holiday Sandwich is my current number one SO. DAMN. GOOD.There are enough places to blow your money in Vegas - go to Earl of Sandwich for one of your meals and get the best bargain in town for seriously one of the best sandwiches I've ever had anywhere!I made sure to rush to write my review after a recent trip to Vegas because I can't rave enough about their holiday special sandwich, which is pretty much the best Thanksgiving sandwich you'll ever have anywhere (and that includes the Bobbie at Capriotti's, which is another one of my faves). The only thing is that they only offer this til January, so make sure to run over and snatch one up!Though the ingredients are what you would expect (turkey, gravy, stuffing, cranberry), i fell in love with the flavor and quality of each of them. I think the thing that makes it is the bread, which is somehow perfectly crispy on the outside and soft and warm on the inside. Believe the hype! Unlike a lot of other places in Vegas, Earl of Sandwich is a sure win!24 hours. You can phone in your order if you don't want to wait in the long lines. But even though the lines are long, the food is worth it twice fold. This is the kind of place you give into the food, throw out your calorie counting habit, and just enjoy all that is in the creations of Earl of Sandwich.You have to try the tuna melt. Seriously. You will love that sandwich more than the smartphone in your hand you're using to read this review. Like my favorite Yelper Natalie M. said: "BEST TUNA MELT....LIKE....EVER!" I'm just waiting for Cali to catch on and bring this bad boy over!Earl of Sandwich was the first place I ate at with my friends when we arrived in Las Vegas. I had the Caribbean Jerk Chicken, which is grille chicken, roasted red peppers, banana peppers, and the jerk sauce. To me it's tasty and not that spicy and I liked it. It's affordable, too, compared to all the places we would eat and go to in the course of our trip! Pretty lively even that early in the morning, but expected in the city that never sleeps.This was the first place that I went to for a meal after arriving in Vegas, even though after checking in to my hotel and walking here it was almost mignight.  With all the reviews I thought that this was a must but I do say that it was a bit disapointing.  The sandwiches were just okay, nicely prepared but the flavor wasn't that special compared to other sandwich shops.OMG this place is beyond the fabulous of the stars!!! Seriously! Words cannot explain the awesome goodness that comes out of this place. Actually, I guess I should say the line speaks for itself. Don't let the line discourage you, it's actually not too bad. But the sandwiches are oh so yummy!!Actually, the first time I had a sandwich from here, I wasn't actually there. I had just landed in Vegas and went and partied up a bit and went back to my room at the Elara. My partner was hungry and told me that they would be back. I was like what is open at this time of night. Are you gonna catch a cab? Wait, they said. No sooner had I removed my makeup and dressed into the comfy clothes, back they were with the sandwiches. It was still warm. I bit into it and was in heaven. Or as close as I could get to heaven while being in Las Vegas! At the time, I attributed the satisfaction to all day travel and some great drank. Boy, was I wrong.Couple of days later, the partner wanted to place some bets at the sports book and asked if I wanted to grab some sandwiches to watch the game. I said sure, so I stood in line and got the sandwiches while they placed the bets. When we got settled back in the room, I took a bite of my sandwich and was so wowed! So they are as good when I'm sober AND drunk! That happens rarely, so I was just awed!!When we finally had to leave Las Vegas for home, we grabbed some sandwiches to eat while we wait for security at the airport. So convenient that this place is in the Planet Hollywood Hotel and Casino. Makes going home a little bit more bearable. Ok, that's a lie, but the sandwiches are very tasty and easy to eat with all your luggage your lugging around.I would like to say I've tried most of the sandwiches. And so far, every time we've stayed at the Elara http://www.yelp.com/biz/elara-a-hilton-grand-vacations-hotel-las-vegas#hrid:NPjBgidFouwIPjezynmpgg we've gotten sandwiches from here and they've all been yummers. I definitely recommend Earl of Sandwich!!If you are drunk and you're in Vegas, heck, even if you're not drunk and in Vegas, this IS the place to be. Just try any sandwich and it will taste like heaven because 1) it's probably the cheapest thing you can get in vegas even cheaper than cheap hookers lol just kidding 2) the best drunk hot sandwich you will ever taste and 3) the best next-day hangover sandwich because you didn't finish it the night before I recommend the club or the chipotle sandwiches. The only downside is that the lines are ridiculous. But you will be with friends so the time in line will go by pretty fast.I'M SO SAD. Earl of Sandwich has definitely downgraded from the glory it used to be!I came here on my last trip to Vegas, only to find out that Earl is now only a shadow of his former self. Let me interject with some background history: I frequented Vegas when I lived in Southern California. When I say frequent, I mean at least once a month. I know Vegas like the back of my hand: I can tell you what hotels are located where, and what time each of the nightclubs' guestlists close. I was very familiar with Earl's menu. Drunkenly slurring out an order for the Earl's Cobb wrap, debating over the potato salad in the fridge, with my heels in hand at 4 am in the morning - that was my THING!So on my most recent trip, I happily approached the cashier at Earl's, announcing that I would like to order the Earl Cobb Wrap. This was what I had been looking forward to all night, post-clubbing. Not squeezing myself into a dress, not enjoying the live DJ performing at a million or billion dollar club or whatever, but shoving Earl's in my face drunkenly after a night of dancing. Then the cashier said the words that absolutely broke my heart: "We don't have the Earl Cobb Wrap".I stared agape at him. The wrap that I had eaten loyally for 4 years straight on my every trip was GONE?! Just like that?! I spent a while in disbelief, drunkenly lamenting my sadness to Mr.Cashier before reluctantly ordering a Chinese Chicken Wrap and making my way down the queue. Walking through the line, I brightened up at the thought of at least getting my potato salad. I peered into the refridgerator. And my spirits plummetted once again. What was once a generous portion of potato salad (think 6 oz) was now 2-3 oz! The same applied for the yogurt parfait - it was half the size it used to be! And surprise surprise, the prices were still the same original prices.By the time I get to the front cashier (where customers pay), I was one sad, drunken lady. I shook the potato salad in Mr. 2nd Cashier,'s face, demanding "WHY! Why did you make this smaller? What happened!!"Mr. 2nd Cashier responded tonelessly (he was probably used to these reactions), "Corporate happened."When I received my wrap, instead of the wheat pita bread Earl's wraps used to use, it was some stupid flour tortilla. Dry and definitely did not soften the loss of my beloved Earl Cobb Wrap. Bleh.And so, I shake my fist as I angrilly write this review. Darn you, Corporate, darn you! How dare you take away what was once magical about Earl of Sandwich!The wife and kids were starving and giving me angry glares as I dragged them around the strip for about an hour looking for somewhere halfway decent to eat...then I realized this place had hot sandwiches and cold beers...done and done.THE FULL MONTAGUhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/earl-of-sandwich-las-vegas?select=himxweK-gPR8lklN_7vXGA#himxweK-gPR8lklN_7vXGARoasted beef, turkey, Swiss, cheddar, lettuce, tomato & mustard sauce.  Delicious.  The wife enjoyed her sandwich...so the angry glare eventually turned into just a partially dirty look.Good enough for me.Was in Vegas for a buddy's bachelor party and after a long night of drinking/strip club hopping ;-) and gambling,  we found ourselves at Planet Hollywood.  It was close to 5am and there was still a long ass line but was glad to see it move along quickly.  Since it was my first visit, I ended up splitting two sandwiches with a friend (original and the hawaiian bbq?   iirc).  Waited for a few mins (seemed like 1/2 hr prolly cuz I was still drunk) before they paged us to pick up the sandwiches (glad there was plenty of eye candy dining in the area!!).  Thought the sandwiches were sooo good that we ended up going back for lunch which was less than 6 hours later.  Wasn't a big fan of the Hawaiian though but it's most likely due to the fact that there was pineapples in the sandwich (it was the one that my buddy ordered).I've only had Earl Of Sandwich a couple of times, but never had the Holiday Sandwich-and it's what I've been missing in my life. Holiday Turkey, stuffing, gravy & cranberry sauce, holy mother of sandwiches! Now I dream about it in my sleep thank you very much Christina Y. It was crowded and a bit messy-hey, it's Vegas. the service was nice and although the Lavender iced tea was dry and empty-someone from the back grabbed our glasses and hooked us up. A great stop on Miracle Mile for a reasonable bite-and oh that holiday sammie, more pleaseThis place is the epitome of quality food at a reasonable price.  For being located in the Planet Hollywood shops you would expect some type of large mark up here but that is not the case.  This is a fantastic deal for a quick bite to eat, quick service and delicious sandwiches.Since I knew that a single sandwich wouldn't be able to curb a Vegas sized appetite I added on the Tomato Soup which of course is the perfect compliment to any delicious sandwich.I went for the Full Montagu and Lauren V. ordered the Caprese sandwich.  If memory serves me correct I don't think we put down our sandwich after the first bite nor did we share with each other.  That leads me to believe that both sandwiches were amazing.Easy solution for anyone thinking about coming here: just do it.  It's a steal for the quality of food.I met friends here for breakfast before a desert excursion.  My friends eat here when they stay at Planet Hollywood and like the taste and cost of their breakfast sandwiches.  Metting at 7 AM, there were only a few people at the restaurant.  I ordered their bacon, egg, and cheddar sandwich and a coffee.  In a few minutes, the buzzer went off and we picked up our sandwiches.  The sandwich was good.  There was a lot of bacon, the egg was good, but I didn't taste cheddar.  The coffee was very good and we each took a refill for the road.  For a quick breakfast sandwich when you're in the PH area, I'd recommend this place.I was just thinking that if I checked in to this business enough I could be the Duke of Earl of Sandwich, which would be probably the best royal title mashup ever. Random musings aside, I have to say that I must be missing whatever the hype is about this place. I visited this place three times while staying at Planet Hollywood, once for breakfast, once for lunch, and once at (ahem) maybe around 2am. At no time, sober or un-sober, was I really in any way impressed by these sandwiches. This is sort of an up-jumped Quiznos with the added bonus that the bread starts out unbaked and bakes as it's going through the conveyor belt. However the ingredients going in to the sandwich seem fairly standard for fast food quality, maybe slightly better, and the flavor coming out the other end simply wasn't there for me. Yeah they're greasy gut bombs and people like that, but coming from the land of Bunk Sandwiches (greasy gut bombs that they be), this is nowhere near what I'd consider to be gourmet or even all that great. Don't get me wrong. I'd take this any day over a McDonald's burger or similar. And compared to the vast array of gross casual food served on the strip, this is a step above. But I simply didn't encounter anything close to the 4- and -star raves people are heaping upon this joint. The highlights include that the prices are totally reasonable for this part of town, and the tortilla soup is actually pretty good. But my caesar salad had some slimy brown lettuce mix in the midst of the rest of the sturdy romaine, and both of the greasy sandos I sampled were simply that. Greasy and salty and just okay. For where it's at, I give it three stars. Anywhere else? I'd probably choose something with more flavor.Disappointed? Yes. Feel like my fellow Yelpers duped me? Yes. Confused? You bet your ass!!Don't get me wrong the Sandwiches here are alright but after seeing all of the rave reviews and 4.5 star overall rating I really do feel let down and expected way better than I got especially when they claim to be home of "The worlds greatest hot Sandwich". If you put that claim out there your Sandwiches better be pretty damn amazing. Sadly, no.The Full Montagu (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/earl-of-sandwich-las-vegas?select=bcK75Axd_C6o9qCvSOe-pw#7NJLUm9T5aCBtyZLQrdO3w) - $6.49. Yeah, it was cheap and hot but also fairly small. The Beef was a little under cooked for my liking but whatever, I know America likes their Beef still Moo'ing. No big deal yet then the Salad was also really sparse too and nothing really had that much flavor. My Husband had the Holiday Turkey (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/earl-of-sandwich-las-vegas?select=bcK75Axd_C6o9qCvSOe-pw#__Es78IE8ZJeG61x_gtvww) - $6.49 Which he said was and I quote ''fairly good''. He then went to on to tell me it was probably the best Turkey and Stuffing Sandwich he's got from a Sandwich shop but then this is only his 3rd so take that how you will.The sad conclusion I came to here is that open a Sandwich shop 24hrs a day in a location where drinking is one of the most popular activities and set your prices low you're guaranteed to get great reviews.3.5 starsThe sandwiches aren't worthy of the overall 4.5-star rating here on Yelp but they are good enough .... as snacks!  The sandwiches are small and there's hardly any meat in them to the point where you might wish you had more... or perhaps ordered two for yourself.  We got:Pastrami Reuben - I really liked this as the flavor was definitely there but was disappointed when there was hardly any pastrami in my sandwich.  If I were to come back, I'd get this one again, though, since I'm a fan of pastrami.The Full Montagu - This had roasted beef, turkey, swiss, cheddar cheese, lettuce and tomatoes.  This wasn't bad but it definitely had more meat than the other sandwich.  Again, the sandwich was the same size as the other -- small! This place is convenient if you are either staying around the strip but I'd rather drive and explore what else Vegas has to offer.  I'm sure they have better sandwiches that have generous portions of meat for about the same price.  As good as the pastrami reuban was (minus the lack of pastrami), I'm most likely to pass these sandwiches up and drive to some place else.  Worth a try, though!Somewhere between a 3 and a 4 depending on how you are getting your "Vegas " on. Nothing earth shattering or groundbreaking  Earl of Sandwich reminds me of Corner Bakery meets Subway or Jersey Mikes or Quizno's ( you get the idea) . They have an ample array of sammie offerings and the somewhat daunting line is a testament to this particular locations popularity. The line rivals In n Out except it's just the humans sans cars.  They offer soups, salads, and of course Sandwiches and  wraps. Count people watching as an entertaining distraction while you are waiting for your order to be filled.  It seems many a hangover victim are either slumped over in their chairs or recounting their past evenings exploits while waiting in line. Once you get past the line and the wait the actual sandwich's are reasonably priced and filling enough to tide you over until your next meal. I have been here a few times and I like the convenience of ordering the food to go, especially if you are staying at Planet Hollywood.   It doesn't hurt they are open 24 hours which is surprisingly hard to find even in Vegas. The sandwiches are filling and satisfying if not a bit heavy on the bread. Here is the  Chipotle Chicken with  Avocado Grilled chicken, bacon, cheddar, avocado, lettuce & chipotle sauce. I have ordered this several times and but for the 1/2 wait this one usually hits the spot. .  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=Fy71pENHo8QeE39MO55ZDw&select=iH-IwkAfh0gtGqFF23fCjw I am not sure if you can call ahead and place a phone order but that might be a way to avoid the longish wait. All in all it is a satisfying if not all that unique place to get a decent sub-style sandwich.  I will eat there avian when I am at PH but doubt I would go out of my way to grab a bite at Earl of Sandwich.Earl is delicious and always a great choice when your looking for sandwich sustenance!I've been to Earl many times mostly the Downtown Disney location in Anaheim every time it's always been quite good and hit the spot!My favorite sandwich they have here is the chipotle chicken avocado it's packed with flavor pieces of avo as well as a thick savory mildly spicy sauce and just all around good!They have a few soups as well of these I chose the broccoli cheddar it was flavorful with a few chunks of broccoli inside.This location is right on the strip and easy access from Planet Hollywood Casino it's open 24 hours and they have breakfast too!The line moved decently fast and our food was super good you know ill hit this up again when I'm in Vegas or the other one that's closer to home!There's always a line at every location...This place is great hangover food aside from soup.  The chipotle chicken sandwich tasted so good, even when eaten later as left overs.  Just wish they put more meat in it.  Those who eat a lot like me need to get 2 sandwiches.Never thought I'd say this, but damn, my feet hurt. After running in comfortable and minimalist running flats for the past 2 months, I have no idea how us wimminz survived on Vegas dance floors for 4+ hours. Oh, right, dancing under the influence, dancing impaired, or whatever you called it? "I can't feel my face when I'm with you" followed by "I can't feel my feet/legs when I'm drinking too".And then we make our walk of shame out from the taxi line to Planet Hollywood (see, no one EVER thinks about the cabbie), and trek to Earl's to finish off the night. Some of us have our shoes still intact, and other are hobbling in sandals or sans shoes (walk of shame, I tell you!) and keeping our fingers crossed that the line won't be like the line for a ride at Disneyland without the coveted fastpass. Well I'll be damned, the line was short and it's a sign that we must eat here. We. Must. MEAT. Here.Toasted Tuna Salad Sandwich on Wheat Bread, best combination evarrrrr. Berry chicken salad is pretty tasty too, especially when substituting the balsamic vinaigrette dressing for the peanut dressing 'cause we ain't basic. The sandwiches are NOT the best sandwiches you will ever MEAT. They're excellent for carbloading after a long night, dipped in the scrumptious tomato bisque soup. Prices are cheap for Vegas, and pretty filling too. Yea, we all know why you're here, and it's NOT for gourmet sandwiches. A bit overrated, but I think the hype lies in availability and consistency.Shoutout to the employees for still helping us with smiles on their faces even at 4am and not judging us. Or maybe they are, because they've all been there. We've all been there. We're still there. And we just can't help ourselves.MEATWICHES.Maybe it's bc I'm an east coast sammie lover or I wasn't toasted when I ate here, but this place is average as can be for me. Sorry, Earl, your hours aren't getting you any extra stars here. So many places in the Vegas are open late, so that's not special. Speaking of not special, the sandwiches here... add them to the list. Are they good? Sure. Are they great? No. Call it a step above Subway (2-stars) and a Step below a Capriotti's (4-stars). I do appreciate the price point (I just payed $19 for an omelet elsewhere), but, to me, Earl isn't really pulling me into PH anytime soon. In the area and need a quick bite? Do it? Taking transpo over here just to get a sammie, you been bamboozled, homeslice.YASSS EARLS! 4,300 reviews! Pick a sandwich...Substitute what you want(ex: cheddar instead of Swiss). Wait for your buzzer to go off.. Get your golden nugget... Enjoy the best Vegas fast food!!!The wait actually kind sucks -hence 4/5- I left to go buy whiskey/vodka/AND rum for our room before my sandwich was ready. But the bread on the sandwich is the best I have ever had...The food is cheap and satisfying! This is a vegas staple that deserves all their good reviews!Hint: order at the counter on the left, pay on the right!I don't know what it is about this place that makes it taste better than the one in downtown Disney.Maybe the yum bread that soaks up the alcohol in your tummy, the craving of something carby and filling after a night of dancing, the big chunks of avocado they put in the sandwiches, or that tummy chipotle sauce they use in the chipotle avocado sandwich... Whatever it is, it can def give MSG a run for its money. It is decently priced, especially being in a casino, and a good stop for a good old sandwich and chips. Don't let the line deter you away... It's open 24/7. Holy moly.Came to this location and couldn't have been more disappointed. We ordered a the register and there was a ton of employees working here. I was so impressed with how efficient things seemed to be running but after ordering we waited, and waited and waited over 25 minutes for a single sandwich. When we asked where our order was, no one knew. We insisted to get a refund since it shouldn't take close to half an hour for a single sandwich. I'm sad we couldn't try Earl of Sandwiches since my extended family spoke so highly of them when they went to Vegas. I guess come here if you have an hour to waste on "fast food".
Ground Control=First time trying and will probably be the last time EVER. I came in and ordered a panini togo. After 5 minutes of ordering they tell me they ran out of turkey so they will give me chicken, how the heck can you run out of something when it was in the morning, not even the afternoon nor was it busy. the restaurant had about two tables, so I was hopeful the kitchen would finish my food under ten minutes. I was wrong it took about 25 minutes to get my sandwich. Not only did it take forever, they just handed me a box when it was done. Do they not have bags? wheres my fork for my salad wheres my napkins? The food, was nothing special, had a box full or arugula and a mediocre sandwich.. Maybe I'm just being picky..  but it was such a horrible experience I really did have high hopes...If you want good sandwiches, FRESH desert, and good drinks; I suggest going to Sugar and Spice down the road they have never failed me.This place is somewhat schizophrenic, but I can't stay away. The decor is Austin Powers meets the Lilliputians. Once you get past the unkempt entry way-gelato bar- espresso station, you are confronted with vibrant orange trim, odd round booths, low slung tables with semicircular chairs all intersected with a long diagonal bench providing high top style seating. A slight hipster feel, interrupted by what some might see as politically incorrect (I find it awesome) throw back military art. Unique doesn't seem a strong enough word. They roast their own coffee which is top notch, make their own gelato, and have the most amazing wine and beer selections in the area. If you want a Bud Light, go somewhere else. But if you want an artisanal wine, or a Quadrupel beer (St. Bernadus) this IS the place for you. Just a fantastic selection of IPA. Weiss, Stout etc...Their motto is "no crap on tap".  Pair a nice brew with their fantastic garlic parmesan fries and just enjoy the eclectic music and environment. The menu is just like the decor, varied and maybe even odd. They have excellent, albeit limited, breakfast selections. The breakfast selections; breakfast burger, paninis, bagels and burritos are wonderful. They also boast crepes, scrambles and skillets which we have not tried as of yet.Lunch: Burgers (Angus, hand made, juicy), salads, roast beef and turkey sandwiches, paninis, including the VIPR panini (Pastrami, havarti chive cheese, brown mustard). Then there is the wood fired pizza oven (Sopresseta pizza is my personal favorite).  I told you...unique. But everything is super tasty.Dinner is really the lunch menu with sometimes nightly specials. Last night's special was pork chops with a berry compote, risotto, and asparagus. Since pork chops are not on their regular menu, this is not the "take a dollar off of our normal menu price, and call it a special" special. It is a no kidding. unique menu item.So, the downside. They regularly run our of things, and occasionally substitute another item without warning (thought you were getting potatoes with your breakfast..ha!...here are some sliced strawberries and cantaloupe instead). The service can run slow, and management does not aggressively keep their staff moving. The place is just what it appears to be; a restaurant/gelato bar/coffee house/pizza joint/wine bar/brewhouse. A bit confused...but what do you expect when a fighter pilot opens a restaurant? I still can't stay away....I'm sorry but the service here is terrible!  And the food is mediocre. Been several times and every single time I am actively ignored for upwards of 10 minutes especially at the bar. The ONLY reason we keep going back is to fill our growlers with beer. In the coffee shop up front they keep all their supplies and back stock where everyone can see it. Very messy. I wouldn't waste my time or money hereI cannot believe that such a great place can spiral to such a bad thing.  I have been coming here for years.  They were at a different location and it seems like their new spot just hasn't had the same appeal. In the West Valley it is near impossible to find a spot with good beers and wines and this place has so much to be desired because they have the beer and wines, but the horrible service and food just leaves you disappointed. The staff just have no attention to the customers and at times they are understaffed.  I understand the constraints of staff but maybe a different approach to leadership can help this place because the clientele is still coming in but even talking with people I know, everyone agrees the service is just bad.After hearing and reading all kinds of reviews, we decided to check G C out.  A Saturday early afternoon.  Sat at bar.  Had The Worst customer service by the bartender.  No smile, no suggestions.  Husband ordered a draught beer.   I ordered a cocktail that had about 3 ice cubes.  Asked for a lime + was told "oh i dont have any cut right now."  What?!!!  So Cut One!  Lazy.  Left after 1 drink.Fourth time going here. 3rd time leaving agitated. Last time I'll try the place. For the life of me, I can't imagine why they'd continue to hire people who just don't care, don't want to help, and seem bothered by a persons patronage.Very disappointed as I live so close and there's so few options out here. But, I give up on this place - service is just too awful!Despite a stellar beer list, and what looks to be a delicious and unique menu, I cannot promote this place. I have wanted this place to be good for so many reasons, but they fall so short in food presentation and taste and fail miserably in service. I have visited Ground Control more than 10 times because it seems so promising, but every single time I've been there, I have had to wait extensively to even be acknowledged after sitting down at a table, and then again to have my order taken and then throughout any meal for any other service like napkins or silverware or a refill on my drink. The food has either been over-priced for what's on the plate or prepared just under mediocre in quality. I've had burned pizza, under-cooked pizza, tiny portions, and soggy salad. At one of their beer event nights, they ran out of glassware and had no resolution or even condolence for the inconvenience or wait. And then, there was no one wait staff assigned to my table and so again, no one took accountability for my experience or my orders. On that same night the bartender was extremely rude when I stopped him on his way back to the bar to ask for one simple request (since I didn't know who my server actually was). He told me he was far too busy to assist me and when I asked for management, he shared some choice words with me and then I was approached by a young lady who was equally as rude. Rather than hear my concerns, she immediately defended the actions of the bartender and wanted nothing to do with resolving my issue of getting some service. Then, I was given fake contact information for the owners of the establishment. To this day, I have not been able to connect with owners to discuss my disappointing experiences there. Great concept for a restaurant, but a huge disappointment. They get praise for their  beer list and if that's all there was to an establishment experience, I'd have more stars to hand out, but there are just too many other glaring defects that no brew (or even several brews) can fix.
Adam's Ribs=It's been a while since I last Yelped.It's not for lack of trying, it's just that .... well, none of the new places that I have tried out have really moved me enough to even bother to click a few buttons to give a mediocre rating to.  Yeah, it's been that kind of a ride for me the past few months.But, like all slumps, this one had to end and boy, what a slump breaker it was!  Creamed spinach in my teeth, BBQ sauce all over my face and my hands smelling like I had been tending a bonfire all night.  It. was.GLORIOUS.Here's the breakdown: (what we ordered tonight)Me - Beef Trio (2 Beef Ribs, Brisket and Tri-Tip)  The brisket and tri-tip were both very tender, very juicy and practically melted in my mouth.  There was even a moment when I had a slice of brisket at the end of my fork and I was trying to pick up some of the dry rub off one of my ribs with it and it practically disintegrated.  It was THAT tender, yet very lean and not fatty at all.  Creamed Spinach - You can tell that it's made fresh, not thawed out from a frozen glob.  My wife hates cooked spinach, but she LOVED the creamed spinach here.  It had a homemade/handmade quality to it along with everything else.  I don't know how to describe it other than "Down-Home Gourmet" Garlic Mashed Potatoes - Very VERY flavorful the whole way through.  You can also tell that it's hand-made, not powdered, with skins and all, just the way I like it.  BONUS!Sweet Potato Fries - With Honey and Cinnamon! it's almost a dessert! This is the only place I have found here in Las Vegas where the sweet potato fries are crispy and not soggy, definitely one of my favorites. BONUS +2Sweet Tea - One of the staples (Brisket is the other) that I HAVE TO try out at every new BBQ joint and weighs very heavily in my final tally of how a restaurant ranks because I down these suckers non-stop and Adam's did not disappoint.  It may be a little too sweet for others, but it's exactly how I like it, with a noticeable taste of brown sugar to it.  Another Bonus, these guys are just hitting me right where I live.Pulled Pork Sandwich - (According to the wife) "It wasn't greasy or fatty, it was just pure tender, juicy meat with a nice soft bun"We actually got a chance to speak with the Owner, Adam (Who also owns the Freakin' Frog on Maryland Pkwy) and he was very friendly and informative.  He introduced us to their various sauces and their incredible dry rub.  The regular sauce was a little too sweet for me, but then again, I never do regular sauces and always go for the hot stuff.  Their hot variant "The Slow Burn" is not an in-your-face kick you in the teeth super-hot insanity sauce.  Think of it more as a fine Sake`, deep subtle flavor (Very flavorful) with a slow burn that gradually builds at the back of your throat and catches you unawares, kind'a like the way good Sake` creeps up on you and then BAM all of a sudden, you're drunk.The Dry Rub though, was definitely the star of the various condiments.  According to Adam, it is salt free (I believe he also said that they try to use as little salt, if any, in all of their dishes) so you can pile it on as much as you want and not feel guilty about your sodium intake.  The flavor just made my mouth water even more  it was so subtle, yet complex.  It was the perfect complement to the Brisket and tri-tip.Look, I can just keep going on and on until my fingers get worn down to nubs, but here's the skinny.  I like me some BBQ and I definitely LOVE me some beef ribs, DRY (No sauce) Since that's the way to really tell how good a restaurant's dry rub is.  Lucille's Smokehouse taught me that and that's how I've been judging my ribs ever since, by how they compare to Lucille's and I'll be brutally honest, I like Adam's ribs better than any other BBQ place that I have tried in town, yes, even Lucille's and CJ's.  Everything we tried just tasted home-made  and not like it came off an assembly line.  These guys put a lot of love into their cooking and it shows.  Just give them one chance, you may just find yourself a new favorite BBQ place like I did.
Tea Infusion=Every time I go waltzing around The District (ahem, twice) I make sure to stop by this hidden gem for some extreme iced tea action. I use extreme in the sense that there's 100s of options that all end in AWESOME. White peach iced AWESOME, iced pomegran-AWESOME, four AWESOME berry tea, creme brulAWESOME. And those are just the flavors I've sampled. I could be "The Richmeister" from SNL while lavishing praises upon these teas.Going with the white peach-a-rino, iced pomegrana-rama-ding-dong, the creme brulee-ster, four berries? Berry nice. Makin' the copies...But I digress.Tea Infusion has an awesome location in terms of drawing in business, so all you naysayers that are poo pooing its place nestled among chain stores can just shut it. From a business perspective it makes perfect sense. People get thirsty when shopping, especially in the desert, and this place appears like an oasis on the horizon. If it was a dinky little independent establishment it would never receive the exposure that it does at Tempe Marketplace and probably would have a hard time staying solvent, regardless of how much we adoring Yelpers build it up. So I'd rather laud the smarts of a business man who broke through the corporate mold and managed to offer an independent and hip lil tea shop amid the brand name wasteland that is Tempe Marketplace than complain about it. It's so nice to step into this place, breath a sigh of relief and shake off the oppressive crowd of consumers (and anklebiters) waiting just outside that door, especially if it's a weekend evening. And I've got to say that a nice cuppa makes the window shopping, caterwauling live band, and gaggles of giggling adolescents much more enjoyable.Aside from a tea selection that puts China Mist to shame, they offer some munchitos that I've never indulged in like sandwiches, sides and scrumptious looking desserts. One day, Tea Infusion, one day.The only complaint I have is with the staff. I understand you don't make much and sometimes customers are devilish. I've been a barista before. But that's no excuse to neglect your customers or the cleanliness of your establishment. I went on a Saturday night and one chick was very loudly and obnoxiously chatting up a customer, leaving her coworker to fall behind when handling group after group of people by his lonesome. The counter was filthy and cluttered with tea paraphernalia, smoothie stuff, dirty steeping devices, and milk that someone had neglected to put back in the refrigerator. I wanted to jump behind the counter, tidy up that terrible mess and help a dude out, then give that flirty flit at the end of the counter a piece of my mind. I get the disenfranchisement you feel when being paid slightly over minimum wage, but have a little respect for customer service and the integrity of your shop or you won't have one to report to for long.I finally made it to Tea Infusion yesterday for November Yelp Office Hours... We had a nice turnout and it was fun to see all of the different tea selections everyone made.  I started with an iced pumpkin chai tea with soy milk and boba - it was fantastic!  Each sip made my taste buds tingle with delight!  A few people had smoothies, and some different hot tea selections too - there is so much to choose from, it's kind of overwhelming!  A few hours later, Sarah G sold me on an iced green jasmine tea - it was also wonderful!Christine and Brandy took care of our group and they were sweet - 4 stars for the service.  5 stars for the tea and the huge selection!  3 stars because they were not open when I arrived at 10:30; the doors didn't open until 11!  (So if you plan on stopping by Tea Infusion in the morning, you may want to call ahead of time to make sure they are open).  Overall, 4 stars!  Free wifi and food offered too... I'm sure I'll be back to Tea Infusion - check it out next time you're at Tempe Market Place!I swear I NEVER like to leave a bad review based on just the service. I've been to teainfusion several times,  not because their whack fake boba is that good, but to see if every employee was rude or maybe I caught them on a bad day. I understand hemorrhoids, headaches, tummy bubbles, and domestic issues.  I know everyone has a bad day. Well this place has a freakin' black cloud just chillin over it! Everytime I step in this joint, it's clear that the person behind the counter feels inconvenienced by having to actually make my order. Seriously, I'm ordering a chai tea with boba, not baked alaska. The worst part is I'm in a pissy mood when I leave the place. So I gave it a try and the only thing that comes to mind...... treat me like ass once, shame on you. Treat me like ass twice,  shame on me. Treat me like ass three times, and I'm calling you out. Get a grip tea fusion you are not the only spot in Tempe Market Place, your tea is mediocre at best and your boba is not even legit. I sincerely hope the managers take this review into consideration. And, on one last personal note, If I get another pair of eyes rolled at me when I walk by the store I'll personly sit outside and hand out samples from paradise bakery, coffe bean and juice it up smoothies! All of which offer tea.
Buckingham Smokehouse Bar-B-Q=After a long rainy day stuck inside I had worked up an appetite and it was time for another BBQ run.Being closest to my house Buckingham's made it 1st on my list.This place is in a great location right next door to the movie theater.As you enter you are greeted by a very friendly asian lady and a large dining area with boothes along the walls and western decor on the walls.They have quite a deisplay of trophies & plaques touting their accomplishments & merits.I ordered a pulled pork sandwich w/2 sides for $8- I also got horseradish cole slaw and mustard potato salad.This place is for real. Great smoky taste, the pork was slightly crunchy but very moist & tender. The BBQ sauce was spicy with some real zip to it.The cole slaw was the biggest surprise. Horseradish-very spicy but crunchy and delightful. The potato salad was incredible too.I saw an order of ribs and they looked like some of the best I've seen. I will be back to give them a try.For now I'm off to my next BBQ destination.........
Rub Bbq=Next to Last place on my list of BBQ places in Las Vegas & some pretty mixed reviews BUT ..... I immediately liked the place the chopper w/smoker sidecar by Orange County Choppers/American Chopper & I liked the modern design with flat screens easily viewable from every seat and large comfy booths along the wall. There were a few large groups already eating and the BBQ looked great BUT... I decided to try a couple sandwiches this time & skip the bbq-the table right next to me ordered a 3 meat sampler with brisket,ribs & pulled pork & it looked fantastic. I ordered the B.L.G.F.T. or Bacon Lettuce Green Fried Tomato and a side of mac & cheese, the wife ordered a pastrami with mayo coleslaw. I tried all 3 of their trademark sauces and I thought they were all good, each had it's own distinct variation. We both ordered sweet tea which was pretty damn good but a little warm. The place was only 1/2 full so service was pretty fast & the waitress was very informative. The only complaint is it is way overpriced.$14 sandwiches...BUT.... Monday-Friday 5-9 they have all-you-can-eat BBQ for $30. I will have to go back & give it a go.So bummed to see that RUB is gone. Got drawn in by the cool bike.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zKC3gRFQ8eRU8oRXENAEaA?select=ed8NbVr26_qtR-MXHyYTUg#ed8NbVr26_qtR-MXHyYTUgRighteous Urban BBQ had the best Burnt Ends I have ever eaten. PERIOD!I came here to the Rio a couple years ago for work and had to stay for several days. Day 1 RUB, server pointed out the Burnt ends. Game on Guinness and a plate full of BE's. I crashed out after that meal.  Line at seafood buffet way too long. Go to RUB and have another delicious meal of BE's and onion strings and more craft beer. Night #3 went back for some more, of those orgasmic ends.RIP RUB!
O'Donoghue's Pub=O'Donoghue's is quite a smooth, chill place. $2 HH beers that even includes things like Blue Moon and Full Sail amber is a pretty smokin deal.  ...and all day HH on Saturday!It seems that if you'd like to stalk or otherwise find and meet BrianS, this is your best bet! After the recent attempts to recruit yelpers after the wine tasting soiree, a scant few of us shared great company and hilarious conversation at Brian's local version of Cheers.  But since it's irish, there was plenty of craic to go along with the beer and whiskey being served.Funny I can get a better (cheaper) happy hour deal by driving from near Ghettrocenter to near Grayhawk!   8^ P
Eat Unique=Eat Unique.  The name totally threw me off.  For some reason I had it in my head that this would be sorta like a health food deli.  And you ask...why did you think that Rachel?  Usually because I just make my mind up that that's what it's going to be.  Totally solid reasoning, right!?What I was excited about where the alternative food sub options.  I ordered a Taco Salad and instead of beef chili I ordered turkey chili.  That, in my head, was healthy.  In reality I don't think a heaping portion of gauc, sour cream and cheese added up to zero calories.  Let's also consider the fact that for a moment I thought I had ordered JUST a nacho platter because the ratio of nacho chips vs lettuce was about 20 chips to 1 piece of lettuce.  Don't get me wrong...it was really REALLY good...but it was a nacho platter.  And you know what...I am TOTALLY ok with that!  Eat Unique folks!Anyone that goes to or works at Carnegie Mellon knows that we have the WORST food options ever on campus.  They taste ok, but they're expensive as can be.  One day I forgot to pack my lunch so I wandered down to Craig and Forbes.  I wait for the bus by Eat Unique so I figured I would test it out.I ordered a spicy grilled cheese ($5.99 w tax).  I think it had pepper jack and cheddar cheese, tomato, and banana peppers.  There was supposed to be bacon, but it was either a negligible amount or they forgot it.  Maybe I was starving, but this sandwich was great.  I really loved the combination and the price is so fair.  Panera charges twice that for some of their sandwiches.This place gets crazy at lunch time.  I think I waited about ten minutes, which is ok.  If I ever forget my lunch again, I'll be back!
Mark Rich's New York Pizza & Pasta=It was a busy day at the office preparing for trial when the boss decided to buy pizza for everyone. YAY! Nothing like ordering pizza to keep up everyone's spirits. It might usually take a while to get everyone together in the office, but not when pizza is involved. We all raced to the pizza as soon as it arrived, lovingly placed on a table by our office manager. But, something was missing. WHERE ARE THE GARLIC KNOTS?My favorite part of eating pizza is enjoying the garlic knots--a love discovered in NYC, made permanent by a bag of knots small enough to be eaten like popcorn on a long subway ride through Manhattan. Delicious, buttery wads of dough covered in minced garlic? YES, PLEASE! Dipped in marinara! Dipped in garlic sauce! On their own! They are just delicious! But, to my disappointment, they were absent.I was put in charge of calling Mark Rich's to inform them of the terrible news. The man who answered seemed to already be aware of the mistake and asked if I wanted the delivery person to run them back to the office. Well, yes, sir, that is why I called. He told us the knots would be delivered right away (we already paid for them anyways.)As I slowly ate my pizza, trying to save space for knots, the phone rang. Someone from the pizza place called back and offered to give us a credit for the knots. How kind! ...Wait. Are the knots still on their way? No? Oh.Is this a refund?A credit for a future order.Oh.I don't enjoy ordering knots, not getting them, being promised knots, and being told I can have them later. Why would we order from them again if they didn't get our first order right? It's one thing if you get compensation for a mistake, but this wasn't the case. I almost gave them two stars because the pizza was pretty good, but poor service drives me up the wall. I understand that mistakes do happen, but to make a promise and renege due to laziness or any other reason is inexcusable.Nastiest, soggiest pizza ever. Was like Wonder bread with sauce on it. Crust was completely soaked. Could barely separate pieces, it oozed grossness. Watery sauce all over the place. Was like a culinary school, epic fail, mistake. Would love to eat any chain's pizza over this. Made better pizza with kids at home with a 99¢ roll of pillsbury dough. NEVER EAT THE PIZZA, unless you are on a diet, its too gross to swallow.Our family dined here this past weekend for an early dinner.  When we arrived, the restaurant only had a few patrons, so we were seated almost immediately of walking in their doors.  The waiter who greeted us and took our orders was friendly enough.I decided to order a cheeseburger and french fries along with a root beer.  I know what you're all thinking!  Here I come to an Italian pizza and pasta restaurant and I order the most American item on their menu.  To my defense, my husband chose the restaurant as we were looking for some place quick to eat before our show.  I wasn't in the mood for pizza, the pasta seemed too heavy as I wasn't very hungry and the salads didn't sound too amazing.  They all came with raw onions, (Yuck!) and their descriptions sounded as if they were all made with filler iceberg lettuce, as I like to call it.Of course I was given a Sierra Mist in place of my root beer.  The waiter quickly dashed off, and I was too tired to say anything.  A half an hour later my cheeseburger arrived very dried and sad with no cheese.  Maybe I should have ordered one of their salads, and requested no onions.The only saving grace for this restaurant is that they brought out some wonderfully soft dough on a cute pizza plate to keep my daughter occupied while we waited for our meals.#90 / 100Yelp 100 Review Challenge 2014The stuffed pizza slices are the bomb- it's basically a thinner version of a deep dish style pizza, with cheese and meat stuffed between two crisp layers of crust. They're around $5 each and easily make a lunch, served with a cup of marinara for dipping. The salads and pastas here are not their forte- maybe it's just the dressing, but the antipasto salad had ample toppings but nothing interesting going on flavor-wise. Meat quality seemed just so-so, and the "house italian" looked like it was packed with herbs but tasted more like plain oil. Fellow diners who opted for pasta specials mentioned that they were overcooked and mushy rather than al dente as expected.They have a limited list of lunch specials ($7, five options) and outdoor dining tables with umbrellas. Though it's set up as though you walk in and order, then wait for your food to be brought out, they only do takeout orders at the counter and if you are dining in, you have a server. Beer and wine are available.
Whataburger=Whataburger...how I love the name and I don't know why. Open 24-7, which is usually a scarey thing, they totally hammer out a fresh, yummy, fast food experience every freakin time. Whataburger? I say Whatabusiness! U guys deliver a fresh In N Out experience with the hours of a local taco stand. Bully for u Whataburger people. Of course the burgers are great....no need for me for a double, a plain ole single with cheese and bacon makes me mouth water. Whata Size it and you get a super size situation. Not my thing acutally. When I'm cheating and doing fast food, I stick to the basic small order. But I can't resist the side salad. For $3.50, u get a HUGE side salad, always fresh and always eaten after the burger to help push through the grease and carbs I've just ingested into my temple. Ok, so it's not quite a temple. Geez, give me a break. Rickie introduced to the Whataburger experience and I can't thank him enough. Well, I can, and believe I do my best if u know what I mean...wink wink. Ok, ok, enough rambling...fresh fast food u actually wait 10 minutes for is so worth it. TIP: Enjoy Amy Winehouse, I Don't Want To Go To Rehab  while ur waiting at the drive thru. God...ok, don't judge me...so I had a few shots of Patron and a Corona or two....Over and Out Yelpers!
NM Cafe=I guess having lunch here was a fitting way to end my latest Vegas get away: fitting because even this place has a bar.Does every eatery in Vegas serve alcohol?But no big complaints.Out of all the menu items, I settled on a simply cheeseburger and fries.With all the buffets and Asian eats, I've forgotten how good a burger could taste: seasoned ground beef cooked to perfection with a thick slab of cheddar on a toasted ciabatta bread.Good stuff.There were a couple other things that did surprise me:1) the service was attentive without hovering.  For some reason, I assumed lunch was going to be uncomfortable.  I was pleasantly mistaken.and2) they serve a popover at the start of the meal and was accompanied with a small plate of strawberry jam and cream cheese.  It was warm and tasty but I wished it was given at the end of the meal because it felt more like a dessert item than starter.Overall, I liked the NM Cafe.  I don't know if I'll return since my loyalties lie more with my trusty Nordies Cafe.
Dick Clark's Bar and Grill=Well, what did we expect. After all, we are in an airport. But wait, now days airports are offering some pretty tastey food. Not in Terminal 3. Not at Sky Harbor. Not on this day. I'd say maybe we picked the wrong things, but as I looked around, not only did things not look so appealing, the guests were definitely not members of the clean plate club. My turkey club came with a lemon garlic mayo (yuck I say) and was served on a thick ass hoagie roll with 2 thin pieces of microwaved bacon, 2 thin pieces of processed turkey (think Lunchables) and a disc of american cheese. More bun than stuff easily. Rickie ordered the Philly Cheese and we quickly renamed it the Silly Cheese. Again, way more bread than the good stuff. The fries were so so but the pickle, well thank God for that pickle, cuz it sustained me through the first screaming child on our flight (see review below...if you're brave enough). I settled for 1800 as they didn't have Patron. Rickie settled for a Dos XX as they didn't have any vanilla vodka nor Franjelico (some of the fixins you need for his fave drink - updide down pineapple!). Our server, a bit stand offish at first quickly warmed up to us as she realized we were fun gay guys at the beginning of a trip with vacation money burning a whole in our Diesel jeans. A couple of rounds later we were singing a medly of American Bandstand hits and heading out the door for our flight. Buzzed but still hungry.
Mighty Cup=Definitely love the feel of the place and that they have free wi-fi and ample outdoor seating. Always a fan of independent coffee shops. The iecd chai-latte was delish but way overpriced as I got about 5 sips out of it due to all the ice. It's as pricey, if not a bit more, than Starbucks, and refills on just coffee was overpriced in my mind. I'm used to independent coffee shops that charge hardly anything for just coffee refills while you're sitting in the shop. They have sandwiches and other foods for lunch, too.Cool place though. Check it out if you get a chance.
Bunky's Cafe=TEN DOLLARS!TEEEEEEEEEEEN DOLLARRRRRRRS!Next time you have ten bucks in your wallet, aim for Bunky's STAT and pick up any one of the several lunch options that adorns their two sided menu. This place not only has delicious offerings in a cozy settings, but it's consistent, the sign of a well run kitchen/front of house. I made the mistake of breezing past the dessert case today, all of which are handmade in house. Holy tiramisu batman! Seriously, I don't know why more people aren't pulling up a chair at this joint. Great stuff on Madison's east side where we're overrun with burgers and Asian.
Del Taco=So my Son comes to me the other day and says....."Dad, I have to go to Del Taco and buy 34 Tacos for a school project"....I said "What are you trying to pull?!  What class is this for?"....he says "Health".....I laugh my ass off and ask him if he's serious.  Apparently, he was.  They were studying the nutritional contents of Fast Food and if he brought in 34 Tacos for the entire class he'd get extra credit on his project.Of course, this was too funny to pass up so of course I agreed to do it.  So we left for school a little early this morning and I called ahead to ask the employees how long it would take to make the Tacos.  They said they'd start working on it and that they would be close to having it ready when we arrived.  10 minutes later we arrived and they were 1/2 way done with the order.  We waited another 5 minutes or so and we were on our way.34 Tacos ($14.33).....extra credit for kiddo, priceless.Will I return?  This Del Taco has their act together....of course!This is a great location. Inside the store is clean and the staff is very friendly. They are very fast and the food is correct and hot and tasty! I love the Cheddar Quesadillas and Buritto Deluxe. AND they have Cherry Coke!!!
PT's=I went there couple times already. Personally I think it's a very good good place to hang out with co-workers and also close to where I work (as my part time job)!They have one security guard check ID before enter the bar area; then you will see a full bar in front of you with 2-3 TVs on each side. If you want avoid smoke or group of ppl, maybe you should turn left, they have couple sofa down there; or turn right if you want quiet and eat something here (because they provide 1/2 off on pizza after midnight and 1/2 on all the drinks, very very value).I love their nachos, especially steak!!!!!! Highly recommend!!!!!Easy parking + open 24 hrs + looking for DANNY ( I like his service very much)...... = enjoy a night!
Times Square Pizzeria=Decent but not even close to 5 stars.They do well with their sandwiches (chicken parm sammich was pretty darned good) and okay with the pasta dishes, although their price exceeds their quality.DO NOT bother with the pizza -- at least not the slices at lunch time.  They're precooked and reheated poorly, creating a crust that is hard and that you *wish* was flavorless, and congealing the cheese grease up quite nastily.I will credit that even during busy lunch time, they've been able to accomodate a dozen or so people in a single party fairly efficiently.  On one occaision they put up quite a fight on the splitting of checks, but had no choice when most people had to pay by card; but on another occaision they split checks with nary a gripe.
Bertha's Café=There are those places that I review after one visit = mind blowing food and service which I am convinced is no fluke or so abysmal that the dogs of hell could not drag me back. There are those places that I review after a handful of visits = consistent service and food or locations I would return to and not be embarrassed to admit.Then there are those places that I have selfishly kept for my own, even after having eaten every item on their menu (multiple times) for fear that the next time I visit, I will have to fight for a table or parking spot. Bertha's Café falls in to this last group.Bertha's is a small, yet comfortable space that has clean lines and simple décor. There is a large cart that always has a sampling of the most current gossip rags, architectural periodicals, and newspapers for your enjoyment. Soft tunes play in the background and simple prints of farmers' markets from around the world adorn the walls.The food is the real focus and soul of this establishment. Breakfast is served daily until 11:00 a.m. and I would highly recommend the Waffles (served with honey butter and blueberry/maple syrup), the Roasted Tomato, Pesto Egg Sandwich (with arugula and havarti on an English muffin), or the Brioche Egg Sandwich (bacon, arugula, pesto, eggs, and parmesan). I also enjoy the Fruit Parfait which they make with seasonal organic fruit and home-made granola.The only problem with lunch is that every time I go, I really want to have multiple items. My top three sandwiches are the Asparagus & Havarti Panini (oven roasted asparagus, pesto mayo, arugula, roasted red peppers and Havarti - grilled to perfection), Roast Beef and Blue Cheese (with mayo, tomato, arugula, and caramelized onions), and the Salami Pesto and Goat Cheese (with sundried tomatoes, pesto, and mixed greens). The wraps and soups are all wonderful, but I will be honest and say the sandwiches generally win out. And finally there are the salads... there are several, but some of my current favorites include: The chopped salad - chocked full of blue cheese, applewood smoked bacon, bell peppers, avocado, chicken and green onions. The Harvest Salad which is the perfect blend of candies walnuts, apples, blue cheese, and dried cranberries. Or the Curried Chicken Salad that is mixed with pinenuts, and dried cranberries.Most of the salads can also be ordered in a wrap version. And thankfully, Bertha's offers "Lunch" specials which allow you to choose one of their daily soups and  1/2 of any salad, or  1/2 of any sandwich and either soup or  1/2 of any salad.So other than unique menu offerings, what makes Bertha's so special??  The staff is unbelievably friendly and helpful. Servings are large. The sandwiches or salads can easily be shared or make two meals. All items that are listed in a vegetarian fashion can have chicken or ham added. A special kids menu provides options for those with less developed palates. In addition to their standard menu offerings, they have daily special sides and soups. Literally everything is freshly made (no pre-packaged garbage). And finally there is the desert counter. Bertha's offers a rather large selection of freshly made pastries, muffins, cupcakes, desert bars, and some of the most incredible cheese cake I've ever put in my mouth. Some items are seasonal, which somehow makes them even more desirable, as you know you will have to wait an entire 12 months to have such goodness again.I have taken a number of people to Bertha's since first being introduced myself and have never heard anything but raves.  I really don't know how I will make it through the remodel... I'm quite sure I will go in to withdrawals!Quite simply, the food is a spiritual combination of flavors and textures. And so it is with a fearful heart and the desire to support local businesses in this time of economic insecurity that I encourage you all to try Bertha's Café. Just remember, if you see me there and the place is full, I may force my way in to your table.  : )Having just returned from another extraordinary lunch at Bertha's I realized that I neglected to mention one of my favorite things... the cupcakes! Anyone that knows me well, is aware of my long search for the perfect little cake. Well, let me just say, forget Sprinkles, forget Tammy Coe, and just head straight to Bertha's! They have two sizes. Small tasters for $0.75 and full size beauties for $2.25. They generally have three regular rotating selections and an additional seasonal offering. Personal favorites are the Pumpkin (seasonal), the Carrot Cake, and the Chocolate. Red Velvet is almost always available, but I try to avoid anything with that much dye. These little cakes are moist (can you believe it?!! a cupcake that actually has the texture of a full size cake, instead of compressed sawdust!), taste like the real thing and not just a fancified white cake dolled up on a Saturday night, and are topped with the perfect accompanying frosting pillow. The minis are perfect for parties. They are just the right size to be considered "finger food" and will allow your guests to sample a variety of flavors. Call ahead if you have a specific request and they will generally accommodate your request. If you are a fellow cupcake-o-file, make sure you stop in and give them a try. Trust me, you won't be disappointed!  ...now I have to go wipe the cream cheese frosting off my satisfied lips!!!I'm hoping that my visit to Bertha's was just on an off day... I really wanted to like it - and maybe I had high expectations but shouldn't I since Bertha's has a 4.5 star average on Yelp?  I've been waiting for this new location to be open for awhile now, and I finally made it in for lunch yesterday.  After studying the menu, I chose the Harvest Salad... $6 for mixed greens with candied walnuts, apples, Blue cheese, and dried cranberries - I modified and replaced the blue cheese with goat cheese and I added chicken for an extra $1.  I do not recommend the Harvest Salad.  It was mediocre at best.  The chicken was nasty... I pushed that to the side and ate the rest although the apples had little flavor.  I definitely had order envy upon seeing my friend's turkey sandwich.  That is the way to go - next time I'll for sure go with a sandwich or a soup/sandwich combo.  The cashier was extremely slow... I think it must've been her first day on the job.  We were patient though.  Hopefully she will get better with practice and the next time I visit, the process will be smoother... and I know what NOT to order now, so I'm hopeful Bertha's will live gain an additional star in my book upon my next visit.  Perhaps Berthas for breakfast is the way to go?!Wow, what a disappointment Bertha's turned out to be.First off, they need to take the sign down from their old location, which I went to, and drove around like a chicken with its head cut off looking for the place.Second, their online menu is not current. I went here because of the tasty-sounding Buffalo Chicken wrap which they no longer have. (The menu picture that someone posted on Yelp is way too tiny to read)Third, they forgot my fruit salad ($3) which I didn't realize until I had drive all the way home. I called to inform them of their mishap and the woman on the phone was confused as to what they forgot. She kept asking me what I ordered and didn't understand that THEY FORGOT MY FRUIT SALAD. Ugh. Annoyed.Fourth, my salami was served on a stale ciabatta, It was overloaded with goat cheese on one half and skimped on the other.  The amount of salami was skimpy as well.Fifth, the sandwiches don't come with chips.  I am a firm believer that all sandwiches should come with a side, and I am grateful to places that include them in the price.Sixth, the red velvet cupcakes were dry and the frosting was mediocre.  Not cream cheesy at all.6 mishaps and Bertha's gets one star. On a good note, their cookie that came with the sandwich was delicious, as was their passion tea.Don't waste your time.I don't know why I do this to myself...How long does it take to make a bowl of delicious and nutritious oatmeal, complete with cinnamon, nutmeg, maple, raisin's...you know something good for me?I'll tell you how long...exactly 180 seconds...from scratch:)But, I got busy this morning and forgot...again!So I ran all morning long on nothing but coffee (which would be enough, some days...but not today:)By the time I got done with power yoga (on an empty stomach), I was feeling decidedly in need of some serious retox...but I didn't go that way:)I decided to try to eat something a little bit healthy...for a change:)And, since I hadn't been to Bertha's in a couple of years, and they have their new location opened up, I dropped by Bertha's to grab a sandwich re-fortify me:)I liked Bertha's prior incarnation, over behind the post office at 40th and Thomas, and I was pretty regular customer there for a couple of years.This location, this version (Bertha's - version 1.5...it can't possibly be what they intended, and must therefore be a mid-release version), is lacking in few areas:* Service - I used to appreciate that I was greeted with smile and a  "hi" when I walked in:)...not at Bertha's - v1.5...no "hello"...no "how can I help you"...no response to my "hi"...just a vacant stare until I decided what I was going to have, then writing followed by the total...that was it, followed by a shouted "ORDER" to the kitchen:(* Quality - I appreciated that they always paid attention to details, and that my sandwiches, soup, baked treats, whatever, were always well prepared and tasty...When I got my Ham and Cheese Panini (to go...I was a little busy), no bag check and no napkins when I looked in the bag:(...I asked for them and was handed a wad of napkins with little more than a grunt...I headed down the road and opened up the sandwich...took one bite and found ice crystals in the middle of the ham:(...semi-warm on the outside and still frozen inside (or did the definition of "Panini" change while I wasn't looking?)* Atmosphere - I liked the old space...I realize that Bertha's - v1.0 was small, but it was nice:)...the new release, Bertha's - v1.5 space looks and feels like the "remodeled on a budget" second hand clothing store that this space probably was...not a great room and not well done on the remodel...I was waiting for my sandwich and thinking "why were they closed for 5 months?...I could have done this remodel all by myself over a long weekend, for about $200, including the apartment white paint for the walls"I made a completely legal U-Turn (as far as you know) and went back to Bertha's - v1.5, and asked them, about the ice in my Panini:(No "oh, I'm sorry", no "can we make you another?"...just the blank stare from counter girl...I suggested another attempt at Panini-ing my panini...she took it back to the kitchen, where I heard "It's still cold" and returned a couple of minutes later with my Panini (easily identifiable by my bite marks on the corner of the panini...They microwaved the friggin' thing!!! :-(I headed back to my car, and tried to eat my Panini...do you know what microwaving does to thick crusted Italian rolls?...It turns the crust to concrete, is what it does.I was starving and I still only managed to get through about  1/4 of the Panini.I think I am going to wait until the next release of Bertha's, to reload.It could be that both Bertha's - v2.0 and Windows 7 will surprise and delight me...but I have my doubts.This little place is great!  I just tried it today with friends of mine at lunch...it's a cute little cafe and they bake all their baked goods...I only had the little red velvet cupcake but the frosting was delicious and the cake was so moist...the bread pudding looked awesome too but I didn't get to try it,,,I had this amazing fresh salad with chicken, blue cheese, avocado with a balsamic vinaigrette...it was awesome!  I wanted to try the thai chicken wrap because it looked yummy...I cannot say anything negative it was great!  I will be back!If you talk to any real estate agent they always give the same three words of advice, location, location, location. Another dial-a-realtor-cliche is getting the worst property in the best neighborhood. Usually if you don't follow these guidelines you may have a long hard road ahead. Well So I thought, Bertha's Cafe moved from their location at 40th Street and Thomas to a hidden corner at 32nd Street and Indian School, boy was I wrong.First step through the door you will be surprised that the carpet doesn't match the drapes, so to speak. The small space is filled with charming farm and bistro tables and a large case filled with delectable baked treats beckons you for serious consideration. It seems that even at a perceived bad location, Bertha's is one of the best sandwich places that you've never heard of. Aside from the baked goods, Bertha's offers generously stuffed sandwiches, ample sized salads and a rotating soup menu.The Asparagus and Havarti Panini is Bertha's signature sandwich and for good reason, its killer. Stacked onto fresh baked MJ Bakery bread is a composition of oven roasted asparagus, roasted red peppers, pesto mayo and havarti cheese. I opted to upgrade my sandwich with slices of roasted chicken breast which took something great and made it better. The crispy edges of the grilled bread combined with the salty-sweet flavors of meat, veggies and cheese made for sandwich perfection.I am still thinking about the Club Sandwich with its roasted turkey, ham, bacon, lettuce, tomato, mayonnaise and cheddar cheese. It's a classic that has only been improved with plenty of quality ingredients.All sandwiches are simply served with a sinful chocolate cookie, so you might want to add a small side salad to your meal. I ordered the Pesto Pasta and Peas as well as the Dill Potato Salad. Both salads smelled great from the fragrance of fresh basil to the sharp earthy dill, but were a let down when the lack of salt and pepper left these both fairly bland. The problem was easily fixed with a few shakes of each.Salads are fresh and crisp starting with the Goat Cheese and Roasted Red Pepper Salad. A pile of mixed greens is topped with pungent goat cheese, sweet roasted red peppers, tart sun-dried tomatoes and savory pesto was a hit. Thai Chicken Salad was another favorite loaded with crunchy bits of carrots, cabbage, cucumbers, peanuts, green onions and bell peppers. On top was sliced chicken breast, tomatoes and served with a side of spicy peanut dressing.While I loved the chocolate cookie that came with my sandwich, I nearly had a food-gasm when I took my first taste of Bertha's Caramel Toffee Bar. The chewy madness starts with chocolate chip cookie dough then it's spiked with loads of Heath bar pieces, caramel and white chocolate chips, so wrong yet so right.I wonder how busy Bertha's would have been opened in a prime location? With a lunch line nearly out the door on my last visit, one can only imagine.If you have a name like Bertha, you better know good food. And Bertha, well, she makes a mean sandwich. All you need to know is this: pesto chicken sandwich. Ok, I lied. You can also do a half sandwich with ANY of their salads. Most places make you get one of those pathetic "garden" salads with a cherry tomato and some carrot slices. Not Bertha. She lets you get anything from the Thai Chicken Salad to the one that comes with little grilled cheeses. It's ridiculous and I love it! Now, if she would only open on Sunday.
Zeffirino=My friends and I took a short trip to vegas for the food and entertainment.  We visited several restaurants with either famous chefs or great reviews, and for some reason (cannot remember who recommended it) we also went to Zeffirino one night for dinner.I arrived slightly early than everyone else and was ignored by the maitre'd as I stood in front of her, instead she walked to a small group of people eyeing the restaurant as they walk through the grand canal shops and started talking to them.  Eventually (after maybe 10-15 mins) I decided to enter on my own and sat down at the bar for a drink.  The maitre'd did not become more effective after my friend arrived and our group of 7 (or 8, i can't remember) was sat at a 5 men booth while there being only two other occupied table in the whole restaurant.  We mentioned the seat being "too cozy" and was not acknowledged.After most of our drinks were served it took another 8 requests for my friend's "hot water" to reach the table for her tea bag.  Meanwhile, we realized that the menu was rather limited with plain pasta+marinara sauce being around $20.  The disaster is just about to begin...  as a group, we ordered 6 appetizers, 3 salads, and 6 entrees to share, but it was obvious that the staff at the restaurant felt that we were cheap for not ordering enough and their attitude was absolutely horrible.  First it was the over-cooked duck that the manager insist is done medium rare,Manager,  "We DO NOT, and WILL NOT EVER serve duck cooked more than medium rare."Us, "So how would you call this? (showing him the meat)"Manager, "That is definitely more than well-done!"Us, "and we asked for MEDIUM RARE"Manager, "But We DO NOT, and WILL NOT EVER serve duck cooked more than medium rare"Us, "Er..............."Aside from the tea/hot-water problem, and the duck-problem, we seem unable to get the wait staff to provide us with the correct number of utensils throughout the whole meal.  Although they were not busy at all, with only two other tables being occupied in the restaurant, they had extreme difficulties being us 7 but not 4 forks and 7 but not 5 knifes.  The service was simply offensive.All in all, it was a horrible experience, not a single dish was memorable.  The steak was average, all the pastas were at diner level (even Olive Garden makes better stuff), the salads were nothing more than what you can get at a college dinning hall and the appetizers were so not interesting I can't recall a single thing about them.Don't go!!!!!
Applebee's=A couple years ago, my mom was a given a gift card to @applebees. We never got to use it however because there really is no nearby Applebee's where we live in California. Applebees seems to be abundant in Vegas however and so it seemed like the perfect thing to do to bring the gift card on a recent Vegas trip. I ate lunch at this Applebee's location with my mom and we got the 2 for $20 deal. This actually turned out to be quite a good deal because it's plenty of food. You get your pick of an appetizer to share an two full sized entrees. We got the spinach and artichoke dip for our appetizer and for our entrees we got the Oriental Chicken Salad and the Three Cheese Chicken Penne. The appetizer came out first and was actually best eaten right away. The tortilla chips were fresh, hot and crispy and matched perfectly with the piping hot spinach and artichoke dip. I was happy to see some big chunks of artichoke in there. It was good but after awhile, I could taste that the dip was a bit on the salty side and this could probably be attributed to the cheese. My mom and I split our entrees. The Oriental Chicken Salad turned out to be a lot of food. It was very good. The dressing was nice and sweet. Fresh Asian greens tossed in a their Oriental vinaigrette and topped with crispy noodles, almonds and chicken, it was a great salad. You can choose to get crispy chicken or grilled and we chose grilled. The three cheese chicken penne turned out to be my least favorite of all the entrees. It was all pasta and barely any chicken. The chicken was just on top and there really wasn't a lot of cheese. It's supposed to have mozzarella, provolone and Parmesan, along with bruschetta, fresh basil and Alfredo sauce. I don't think the ratio of the toppings and the chicken with the pasta was too well done. The whole pasta seemed dry. Anyways it was an OK experience here! I'm glad we finally got to use the gift card and it was plenty of food. It lasted us for both lunch and dinner!
Planet Dailies=I've sampled a lot of late night food in Vegas. And, in my opinion, Planet Dailies is BY FAR the very best. I was so happy and comforted when staying at Planet Hollywood because I knew I had the great food here to come home to late-night. And then I'd feel better in the morning too...There were 8 of us girls staying at the Planet Hollywood hotel and, a couple nights, the 8 of us dined together at Planet Dailies at around 4 AM. The other night, I still ate here but with only one other friend who'd stayed out late with me... I could miss my fourth meal of each Vegas day at Planet Dailies!The menu is extensive and yummy (especially late-night!) and we tried everything from fries, to omelets, to burgers, to steak. The Bellagio's late-night food has nothing on Planet Hollywood's!It's a step above Denny's, for sure. Bonus points for being open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week because clearly, you'll need food after that long night of debauchery.I had the the Buffalo chicken sammich fashioned after an order of what else but buffalo wings, duh. Pulling an all-nighter and being in desperate need of refueling, of COURSE that's the item that stood out to me. I wasn't really expecting much as the place even resembles a Denny's, but all in all, I was surprisingly pleased. No small piece of rubbery chicken doused in some ranch-like goo made it's way to the table. Instead, I received a hefty patty of crisp, hot sauced chix, sprinkled with a good amount of blue cheese crumbles. Not fine dining by any means, but it certainly hit the spot. It was a decent size too. I only finished half and took the rest back to the hotel before heading straight back out for more trouble-brewing.... but that's another conversation entirely.A few cons:- $15 is on the pricey side for a meal that probably shouldn't cost more than 10 bucks elsewhere. It *IS* Vegas, though. I suppose that's to be expected.- SERVICE. Damn. The guy was nice when he was around, but we barely saw him outside of taking our orders and when he brought the check. I understand we're eating at 4am, but this place is supposed to be fully operational 24 hours a day. Why oh WHY did it take 30+ minutes to get our food? And if we didn't ask another server to check on our orders, I wonder how much longer we would have waited.Anyway, I'd eat here again if it was a convenience issue (which it was), but probably not by choice because of the whole when-in-Vegas-eat-GREAT-not-good thing... Actually, on second thought, I take that back. I'll probably be back out of necessity. Thems dining options are slim to none at the crack of dawn. Mmmmk, I'll stop rambling now.This was one of the restaurants inside the Planet Hollywood Hotel in Las Vegas.  It's a nice option since they have such a vast menu.  They also offer a couple of specials including all you can eat pancakes in the mornings and a prime rib special in the evening.  Unfortunately I missed out on both!Anyway, the food itself was ok.  Nothing to write home about.  Although, as I mentioned before, the choices are pretty good.  Open early and late is a big plus being in Vegas.  Costwise, I suppose it could have been a little less expensive being in Vegas for a diner, but not too bad.  Service was just ok as well.  Although our server came out right away when we sat down, after the food came out, it took a while to track him down when we needed something.  Overall, pretty ok though.Keep on Yelp'n!
The Buffet at Treasure Island=To be honest, the worst part about this buffet was the price. $22 for lunch is just ridiculous.I dont care for champagne or Mimosas so the fact that they were included was irrelevant.On the other hand, I was impressed with the variety of foods they actually did have.I was feeling queasy (shocking, Vegas?) so I couldnt mentally enjoy most of what I was seeing.My red skin mashed potatoes with turkey gravy were bomb. The actual turkey was incredible and usually turkey sucks.The egg drop soup had the best texture but way too many peas.I couldnt think of eating a salad but the salad station was incredible. I liked that a person assembled your salads for you so no ones dripping elbow skin on top of the bacon bits.As far as entree foods, I thought an improvement they could make is not have as large quantities sitting out because the texture changes and then its no fun. The desserts were RIDICULOUS! We were seated right by them and it was torture. So many miniature desserts. It was so cool. I had a little cheesecake, a chocolate covered strawberry and a bite of mini donuts which only could have been better if they were hot.The dudes loved the ice cream and cookies which I also couldnt stomach too much of. I did taste the ice cream and it was so super smooth and creamy. Tasted like Blue Bell.Overall it wasnt bad. I would have been able to enjoy it a lot more if I hadnt been feeling like death. (:LET'S BE TRUTHFUL... Last week I decided to treat my wife to an evening of pretending to be a tourist on the Strip. I booked a room at the TI and after check-in, took my hungry bride to the buffet to graze on a strip buffet offering. I stepped up enthusiastically feeling fortunate there was no line and paid the $23 per person to get in. As we walked through the dining area I noticed about 18 diners in the restaurant (odd for a 7:30pm dinner I thought) who were not really eating much. Must be a convention of health nuts as most plates were fruit and snacks... no real food. We arrived to the line and my wife looked at me and said... "Is it just me, or does this entire place look tired?" I thought to myself and replied, "Sweetie, I don't understand why all the hot food has a dried skin on top, the cold food is shriveled, and the employees are all frowning... but that doesn't effect how much fun we'll have tonight, right? After seeing her expression, I immediately stated that we were leaving and requested a refund from the overly understanding lady at the register. Notwithstanding the terrible looking food, the strain on the faces of the line cooks resembling a Hollywood production of someone pointing a gun in their backs to work there or else... I found the saddest part to be how unfazed and prepared the smiling lady at the register was when I asked for a refund. We left, walked across the street to the Palazzo and enjoyed a great Italian dinner. PERSONAL NOTE TO PHIL RUFFIN, OWNER OF THE TII was born and raised in Las Vegas, and this was my first experience staying in a strip hotel/casino. I'm proud of our city and welcome every visitor with open arms to enjoy all the entertainment and great dining Las Vegas has to offer. This buffet, the air quality in the casino, the poor cleanliness of the room, (our room had burnt out light bulbs, yuck on the dresser, broken dresser drawer hanging out, and empty alcohol bottles under the bed and chair) and the lack of smiles on the employees faces is not what I envisioned any tourist should experience. When this property opened it was fantastic, enjoyable, and affordable, and most important the air was breathable. When we arrived in our room, my wife had to do a breathing treatment because the horrible air inflamed her Asthma. Perhaps you'll take these recommendations to heart?If you have a similar experience at this or any other Las Vegas property, please write a truthful review so the hotel owners get the message and step up their game. I would be happy to stay at the TI again and perhaps encounter an experience deserving of a glowing review, which I would be proud to post. Until then...Me and my friend were staying at the Wynn and wanted to try some buffets around the strip besides eating at the Wynn Buffet. This Buffet doesn't have a lot to offer compared to buffet at the Mirage, Caesars, Wynn, Bellagio and Cosmopolitan. It's about the size of a 2nd rate buffet located off the strip but more modern. Food is meh and service is okay. I wouldn't eat here again and would rather walk a few feet more to the Cravings Buffet at the Mirage or the Fashion Show Mall Food Court.Only went here because the hotel gave two FREE buffet coupons as part of the stay.  Please don't go here unless it's free, wouldn't recommend it even if it's a BOGO deal.  Most of the dishes were bad, would even bother going over them one by one.  Instead, here are the ones that are decent:Shrimp and chow mein noodles - the shrimp were bay shrimp and puny but the soup was actually decent and the noodles were the classic Hong Kong style.  Chow mein was not bad either, noodles are thin.Pho - not bad broth, comes with beef balls which was decent too.  They have the standard ingredients (lemon, parsley, green onions, but no basil) for toppings.Pasta station - sauces were decent, rich tomato tasteFruits station - fresh fruits, nothing frozenDesserts - they offer Dreyer's in the standard favors but also includes kona coffee and mint chocolate chip.  Crème brulee was good, nothing wrong here.
Las Famosas de Jose=I feel like you have to be drunk to properly appreciate 3-pound burritos and $16 multi-meat and cheese tortas with silly names. I consider myself a fairly adventurous eater but chose to stick to their basic tacos and tortas and was underwhelmed. Lamb meat is dry, sauced tortas are drowned in sauce that was a bit too spicy for my liking. The un-sauced tortas made the dryness of the meat more pronounced. If they can't do the basics well, I'm not about to spring for their deluxe Frankenstein concoctions.
The Lodge At Cactus=Well all I can say is the chicken wings we ordered were still half frozen when served to us. We told the server, he reaches onto our plate and grabs a wing off of it, then says "yea, you're right, let me tell the cook" He comes back out and takes another wing off the plate to "check if they're all cold" at this point I don't want any of the food on the plate after his hands have been in it. The nachos were very, um, creative? They had canned stewed tomatoes. Stewed tomatoes. Gross.  I asked for a greyhound with kettle one, which was basically ocean spray white grapefruit juice, no kettle one. So in closing, I'd say avoid this place. Go next door to Roberto's. You have a better chance of getting decent nachos.
Eddie V's Prime Seafood=I hate to say this, but after my experience at Eddie V's last night, I think they've gone down hill...  There was a lot of miscommunication - here's why:Upon walking in, we were pleased to see that they still offer all night happy hour on Sundays and Mondays.  (Their happy hour = 1/2 off most appetizers and I believe drink specials too).  The hostess asked us for our name and we responded that we didn't have a  reservation; that we were just going to eat and drink in the bar area. She was not the friendliest, and just nodded.  Side note - no reservation was needed as the restaurant was not busy!So, we sat in the bar area and when the waiter came to take our order (we were a group of 4), we placed several appetizer orders right off the bat and said that would be good to start and we'd add more to the order in a bit.  We also ordered drinks.  I specifically ordered my new favorite 'black cherry effen vodka with soda.'So when the waiter came back with the news that they were out of black cherry effen and didn't carry it anymore, I was a little disappointed.  No big deal though, I went with the 3 Olives Cherry Vodka instead WITH SODA.  Waiter comes back with the drinks and mine  looks like cherry coke.  I taste it and sure enough. he's given me a cherry vodka with diet coke - no clue where that came from, but he took it back and brought me (finally) what I ordered.  In the meantime. he came over and asked if we were ready to order... When we asked if the first round would be out soon, he said he didn't put it in yet as he did not think we were serious when we put the first round in.  Ugh - not funny when you're with 2 very hungry men :)We ended up ordering more and were all hungry for the first round of scallops, ahi tuna, mixed green/pear/goat cheese salad, corn and crab chowder. and crab cake.  In the meantime, we were given bread and butter, but alas, no silverware, app plates, or napkins... no big deal - we got those within a couple of minutes.  We were so happy with the first round. (except for the soup which we all agreed tasted like water and potatoes so we sent it back) that we decided to order more... another scallops. another ahi tuna, a tuna tartare, broiled oysters with a spinach and artichoke fondue, and a steak.  This time, it took an extremely long time for our food to arrive and when it did, the scallops were presented totally different and the ahi was overcooked.  Also, the waiter thought we ordered raw oysters and not the broiled ones...At that point, we were done - no need to attempt to correct the order.  The soup and ahi were removed from the bill (as they should've been - we did send them back).  I have to say, aside from the company, this meal was just mediocre.  I've had great meals at Eddie V's in the past, and hopefully this was just an 'off' evening, but I will not be running back anytime in the near future!Sorry, Eddie V - only 3 stars this time...our meal was a comedy of errors and even with happy hour all night, not worth the $$!Eddie V's recently began offering 'All Night Happy Hour'.  This is a beautiful thing for someone like me who typically doesn't leave the office in time to get anywhere before most HHs end.  Hey, the desk-bound want happy discounted stuff too!!I started the week off right on Monday by meeting a friend at the end of the day for HH.  Great decision!  The bar/lounge area is nicely appointed and even had live music from a jazz trio.  Over glasses of Pinot Noir we enjoyed items from both the HH and regular menus:Wedge salad - a nice portion of cool lettuce, topped with decadent bleu cheese crumbles and heirloom tomatoes.  Our waiter even split it for us, just to keep things fair.Crab cake - this is fantastic.  It is easily the circumference of a softball and bursting with crab.  Just crab - no chintzy filler to affect the flavor or texture.  Priced nicely for HH and delightful when paired with the remoulade sauce.I save the best for last...Truffled mac n cheese.  Let me say this one more time - Truffled Mac N Cheese.  Best. Thing. Ever.  This is really beyond description, but I will try.  A perfectly-executed combination of pasta, zesty cheeses, truffle oil and truffles too!  Don't forget the all-important 'crust' of cheese on top.  AAAAAAAGH!  Under my facade as a Responsible Grownup, there lies a 5-year-old who counts mac n cheese as one of my favorite things.  If this is the last one I ever taste, I will be happy.OK, I will admit it.  We went back on Friday, too...   Primarily for the mac n cheese.  Really.
Sushi Kame=I miss Japanese food.  I grew up in Southern California, with Japanese-American family and I'm jonesing here in the midwest for a good chicken katsu, or a decent Udon.  Kame's the closest I've come here to being satisfied.  I like it a bit better than Kamakura, and the servers are both friendly and on point.The miso's pretty good, the udon is a trifle underwhelming, but the katsu's quite lovely.  Although---you can get cheese on it?  WHAT THE HELL?  Is that a terrifyingly midwest thing?  Cuz I've never heard of this.  ICK.That aside, i'm bummed that they only have chicken katsu curry (one of my favourite things in life ever) one day a week.  I want it now ;)
Port of Subs=This is an ok Port of Subs location.  My hubby loves Port of Subs, so we eat at them regularly all over town, whenever he gets the craving.  Some are yucky, some fantastic, but this location is right down the middle.  The staff at this location are very hit and miss.  Some are friendly and welcoming and some seem bothered you are making them work.  The store is clean and usually very well kept.  I am boring and always get the #1. I call it the Italian meat buffet because it is loaded with pepperoni, salami, capicolla, ham, and provolone on bread and it is fantastic.  I am drooling just thinking about it!  I am kind of anti-veggie, so I go with just the meat, cheese, pickles, extra mustard/mayo spread, and all of the seasonings.  It is tasty!My hubby always get the #2, which is the turkey, ham, and cheese.  He loves it and is always a happy camper afterwards.  I guess we just know what we like!I like how everything is sliced fresh for your order.  The veggies, even though I don't eat them, all look fresh and much nicer than the veggies at that other chain sub shop.  The bread is always flaky and fresh and tastes great.  They always have a huge selection of sides as well with about 10 chip types, cookies, and brownies.  I am just happy with my jalapeño chips though and really haven't tried the other items.  My hubby likes their cookies and brownies though and he gets at least 1 every time we are there.Overall if you want a sandwich quick, this is a great location to grab one and go.
Sauce Pizza & Wine=In the past two weeks, my wife and I have been to this location twice. Both times, we ordered the exact same thing...because it was absolutely delicious!For our appetizer, we opted for the Caprese Bruschetta. It's topped with mozzarella cheese, and it's perfect for sharing. If I'm not mistaken, it comes in a serving of either 2.5 or 3 pieces.For our pizza, we decided we would split the Portobello & Artichoke Pizza. It's a thin crust style of pizza topped with...nevermind. You know what's on it.  Again, this pizza was perfect for us to split.Sauce has a great modern vibe going on inside. It's kind of trendy, mixed with a little hipster. So, it should appeal to many different groups. On our first trip, we sat inside. It was nice to see how the staff were so involved in the entire process. Even though it's not a "wait service" type of place, the staff didn't seem to know that. They were constantly policing the dining room, making sure every table was spic and span for the next group that would inevitably be coming in. While doing so, they were also very diligent in making sure that the clientele were being cared for.On our second outing, we managed to find space on the patio. Each table outside of the natural shadow created by the building's overhang has an umbrella. Though, there are no misters that I saw. Thankfully, we managed to find a couple of tables under the overhang. Therefore it was nice and shaded. As for the rest of the seats, they might be better suited for the cooler months, or in the evening. For both of us to share an appetizer and a pizza, plus two refillable fountain drinks, we managed to pay around $20. Not bad for such good food and service!
Pho Vietnamese Cuisine=if vegas over memorial day was simonster's version of hell, and getting home was heaven, then pho at TI was purgatory.i'm not usually a fan of pho or ramen.  why?  because it's not filling enough as a meal and it's too much work as an appetizer.  literally every time i've had pho or ramen as a meal, i was still so hungry i had to go eat a proper meal within minutes or my stomach threatened to implode.after driving out to vegas and eating greasy diner food on the way, all of us were ready for something a bit lighter and healthier before what we knew would be another super rich and heavy dinner at daniel baloud, so pho beckoned us like an oasis.how ironic that the best, most filling pho i've ever had would be in a casino in vegas!  there were seriously double if not triple the amount of noodles in the bowl as i've usually gotten, and my gal at the time generously donated half of hers as well.the cooked beef in my soup was super tender and amazingly plentiful too, so i actually got...dare i say it...FULL on pho!!!  usually i just see a couple forlorn pieces floating on the top and that's it.we all enjoyed our meals so much that first day, we actually came to pho again before we hit the road to brave the mother of all traffic jams on the way back to LA!now that i'm back, i dunno if i'm going to run out and order pho again, but i'll always treasure (no pun intended) my meals at pho in TI!When you come to Pho, you have to remember this: it's all relative.I can say with much confidence that this is probably the cleanest pho restaurant you'll ever venture into.  Obviously, being located in a glorified Las Vegas casino means superb cleanliness and inflated prices.  But surprisingly, Pho still holds true to some of its typical Vietnamese restaurant roots, those being:* Sriracha, hoisin sauce, and fish sauce were found at every table * Chopsticks, spoons, and sauce platters were well-stocked at each table* Despite having only 20 items on their menu, our white lady server looked at me weird when I called out the dish name, and proceeded to ask for the item number instead -- just like in Vietnamese restaurants!Prices are definitely atypical of Vietnamese restaurants though.  $10 bowls of pho, $4.50 Vietnamese coffee, and get this, $9 banh mi!  The beef pho was not bad at all.  The broth was light and had a good clean taste.  My beef stew pho kho was tasty, but too thick and gravy-like.  The soups weren't scalding hot like I prefer, but we made do.  It's a fairly decent meal for Strip standards.There is no other casual Vietnamese restaurant on the Strip.  Pho is all you've got.  It's all about convenience.  Time is money in Vegas, and that money should be used to gamble...not spent driving to Chinatown, wasting gas and your precious time in Strip traffic to get the same average-quality Vietnamese food.  Like I said, it's all relative.Dear god! I rather have noodles with drinking water than eating here again. The service was horrible and the food was 110% crap. The pho was taste-less, the rice plates was not tasty, and everything else was dull. There was nothing asian or american about this place, for a restaurant in treasure island I expected way better. Let me start off with their service. The host was a very good one, she act like the placed was packed and took her precious seating us down(which took 10 minutes). After we sat down the waiter didn't come by for another 10 or so minutes but there clean-up boy took our drinks order.. what the heck? Let me tell you they only had 3 waitresses and they weren't the quickest ones out there. Of course they were probably ages 50 and over but that's okay I like them old. After we ordered our food, it took them over 20 minutes to get a bowl of not so great looking pho and a disturbing put together rice plate to my table. Not only the food took forever to come out, they got my pho ordered all wrong. I seriously didn't think it could get any worst but it did. The waitress took forever to just get our bills. I mean seriously what was she doing? Or what were THEY doing? where are all the little old waitresses? I'm not giving them a hard time, I smiled when they came, I asked nicely when I needed things but this is just too much. My 20 minutes lunch time meal turned out to be an hour or so. A total waste of time and money if you are planning to go eat here. This place should get more fast pace moving waiters and a better chef. I had a horrible experience
Bricktop's Restaurant=Ah, Bricktop's...so conveniently located near the mall but not AT the mall. This is pretty clutch, IMO, as I don't like to fight the crowds to score a salad. I've been to Bricktop's many a time - for a casual lunch to a late dinner. Every time I've visited I've been happy with my meal and the service - seriously, ever server has been oh so friendly and accommodating. Their patio is pretty great for a leisurely meal alfresco and even their bar is fairly roomy. While I've sampled a few different items here, I have a few absolute favorites:Ahi Tuna Salad: A super generous and light salad with avocado, mixed greens, mango and a hearty portion of delicious seared tuna. I ask for the dressing on the side and sometimes the greens can be a little overdressed. Guacamole: Ok, you won't believe me until you try it, but Bricktop's guac rivals Cantina's. No joke. It's really, really flavorful!Griddle cookie sundae: It's magical. It's a cookie baked in a small cast iron skillet, topped with a large scoop of vanilla ice cream and doused in chocolate sauce. It's warm, gooey perfection. I dream about this dessert. Note that it take 10-15 minutes to bake the cookie, so be patient for your dessert! It's a wee bit on the expensive side for a casual dinner, but it's tasty nonetheless. Yay for Bricktop's!For the longest time, I was under the impression that Bricktops was a pizza joint, albeit one of those "upscale" ones where they smother your wood-fired pizza with food stuffs that simply don't belong on a pizza. Salmon? Are you kidding me? But I was mistaken, and gladly so. I was pleasantly surprised with Bricktops upon my first visit, and I've been there 3 times since. And each time I've eaten at Bricktops, my dining experience has been better than the previous time. My first time, I popped my cherry there with a cheeseburger. I figure if you can't screw up a cheeseburger, then you're likely to know what you're doing in the kitchen. Bricktops passed this test with flying colors. One of the best cheeseburgers in town, no joke, and complimented pleasantly with a very generous serving of shoestring fries. First visit, color me impressed.Second time around, my family and I dined there on New Year's Eve. A bit of trepidation surrounded my dining experience at first; I've been to several NYE dine-ins that have been nothing short of awful because of the importance of the holiday and a stunning lack of planning on a restaurant's management's part. But not at Bricktops. Reservations were honored without fail, our meal prepared with the utmost attention to detail and taste, and our waiter was very friendly and attentive, despite the buzz and the clamor in the air. I opted for the Parmesan Crusted Chicken, which was wonderful. Nothing beats chicken so tender you can fork it. My wife chose a New York Strip, Pittsburgh style, which she thought was very delicious. I sampled a couple of bites. Unbelievably tasty. My daughter loved her salmon and noodles, and for eating her plate clean, she was rewarded with a bowl of vanilla ice cream. Not just frozen, store-bought ice cream, but fresh-churned ice cream, the vanilla tasting of real vanilla bean. I can't say who enjoyed this more, my daughter or me.Last visit there, I chose the veggie burger. Pardon my french, but HOLY SHIT, that is one spectacular veggie burger! Listen, just run there right now and try it. I guarantee you will not be disappointed.A word about the Deviled Eggs & Sugared Bacon: what you've heard about this sinful delicacy is true. You can't just eat them. You find yourself DEVOURING them. Order a plate for you and your sweetie, and a fight for the last strip of bacon and the last sliced egg may break out, and it's gonna get ugly. So order two plates, one for you and one for him/her. Your relationship will be the better for it.After 3 visits - and possibly a fourth coming this weekend - I can easily make the claim that Bricktops has become my favorite, go-to eatery in the Queen City, replacing my one-beloved 131 Main.Fancy restaurant that fits right in to the very spendy Southpark neighborhood. Starting with two hostesses to greet, a large and well decorated dining area, white table linen and three staffers to take care of our table (one who did nothing but refill water glasses). If you're looking to impress, this will get 'er done.We started with the goat cheese bruschetta which was more like a small goat cheese and veggie pizza as you'll see from the picture. Which isn't to say that it's not really really tasty and quite filling. You could easily have this as your main course.But we didn't. Today was a "salad" day. I went with the Cobb, my wife had their "Florida". Both were good portions of protein and were very flavorful. Interesting plating for the two salads. They must put them into a cylinder of some sort where they build the layers and then "flip" it onto the plate. It looks pretty.My only complaint is that while there was blue cheese in the salad, the dressing on the side was a balsamic and oil rather than a blue cheese dressing itself.$14 for the pizza... I mean bruschetta and $18 or so for each of the two salads. A little expensive for a late lunch but it was quite good and I'd recommend it.
Pei Wei=I have tried this location twice now and will for sure be back. You can place your order online and it is very user friendly. I wanted to make changes to what I was ordering and there was a option to customize it so I didn't have to worry about phoning it in or ordering in person I was just able to easily and accurately place my order online. I started with a "Pork Egg Roll". These were addicting like candy. Great flavor and decent size for $2.00. I had the "Chicken Lettuce Wraps" for my meal. The chicken has such good flavor. The lettuce is fresh and crisp. This is one I might have a hard time not ordering each time. My man had the "Lo Mein With Spicy Beef". I sampled some of the noodles and was hooked. I had to steal a few more bites. The noodles weren't dry and had so much flavor. They have a gluten free menu.If you don't want to get your food to go they have a dining area.They cater.Since signing up on the website to order online they have sent me a couple good coupons good on my next visit.With all the mediocore to scathing reviews, I've always said No Way to Pei Wei. I ordered for pick up and had a very friendly, helpful, if not Jeff Spicoli sounding, employee help me with my first ever Pei Wei experience. At 9pm on a Thursday night there was plenty of parking and I found the little Pei Wei place to be 1/4 full and actually a nice looking room. The surly person (manager type) who rung up my order, must have had to much MSG as he was irritable and I must say a bit puffy. But most importantly, after devouring our take out, Rickie and I voted four thumbs up (that's two thumbs for each of us, times two, carry the one...well you get the idea) for three of the four items. So spring rolls, potstickers and Korean beef....you'll soon be hanging with us again soon. Pad Thai? Yea. You're not invited. Unless you can sauce it up a bit and find it in your heart to bring along more tofu and veggies. But I'm not counting on it. Pei Wei? Yes way for this gay! OK!?My brief review in haiku form:Cheap PF Chang's fix.Better than Panda ExpressYou can get beer here.Thank you.
Hot N Juicy Crawfish=Since returning from Houston a couple of months ago, I found myself craving crawfish any chance I get.  After experiencing the crawfish craze in the Westminster area of Southern California, imagine my delight when I saw the sign for "Hot N Juicy Crawfish" in Las Vegas.The BF and I anxiously awaited the opening of this first of its kind restaurant in Sin City and finally got to sit down to dinner the past Sunday.  Inviting a couple of newbies made the dining experience that much more enjoyable.We started off with a pound each of the crawfish in every flavor - Juicy Cajun, Garlic Butter, Lemon Pepper, and Hot n Juicy Combo.  At $8.99/lb, it was a dollar more than SoCal prices but we were okay with it.  For every two pounds you order, you get one corn and one potato.  So, we made sure we got our corn pieces and potatoes and were able to choose what flavor we wanted it in.  (In the end, we ordered additional corn and potato on the side, corn runs about 50 cents each.)  We also threw an order of sausage ($2.50 for half a dozen or $4.00 for a dozen).  Depending on the season, they should be offering Dungeness crab, Blue crab, and shrimp.  You can also order oysters, fried shrimp or oyster baskets, Catfish Po-Boy Sandwich, or a Basket of fries.They didn't ask us how spicy we wanted our crawfish, later on telling us they automatically make it spicy unless otherwise stated.  The heat was a good amount, not too hot that it was unbearable and enough where we reached for our beverages.  Of the four, I would say the Juicy Cajun had the least flavor while the Hot n Juicy Combo had the most.  We ordered four more pounds of the Hot n Juicy Combo in this sitting.  The sausage was actually spicier than the crawfish!  We also found the crawfish to be pretty clean overall.  We're ones to suck up all the juices from the heads too, so they gotta be clean.  And I gotta admit, the last two pounds we had were especially good.  They do a good job on having cleaner crawfish than other places I've experienced.Be sure to get the salt and pepper mixture too.  You get a bowl of cut up limes and you squeeze all the lime juice into the little plastic cup and mix it all together.  This is usually meant for you to dip your crawfish in, but I found myself not needing it that much.Service was better too.  Upon entering, they line your table up with the white plastic covering and lay out a roll of paper towels.  They also provide bibs too.  You can ask for plastic gloves, but they just get in the way.  They asked us often if we needed refills on our beverages and how we were doing overall.  (I would say this is probably because they are a new restaurant, I only hope they continue with this service in the future.)They had a steady flow of customers this holiday weekend night.  It didn't get too busy, but they were never empty either.In conclusion, the four of us were pleased with our experience at Hot N Juicy Crawfish.  It looks like we'll be coming back here a lot!  Yay!Side note: There's a 17% gratuity added for parties of six or more.(You can check out my food photos up above!)Fun place to go.  Service was good and you just eat everything like a viking.  I found the crawfish to be unsatisfying....too much work for such a little amount of meat but good flavor.  We had to order a pound of shrimp after we ordered 2 pounds of crawfish and a pound of blue crab because neither of us felt remotely full.  Everything tasted great though.  But I will only order the shrimp the next time we come here.  As soon as we were leaving, a bunch of poker players (JC Tran, Nam Le, Amnon Fillipi etc) came through the door to eat.  I thought it was interesting that these guys could eat at Picasso every night yet they chose to come here of all the places on a Wednesday night.So, me, my bf, and our friend roll up on Hot n Juicy. When I invited my friend, she says, "Oh, crawfish. I haven't had crawfish since Miami. We used to go to crawfish parties all they time and they'd have BUCKETS of crawfish." So I'm getting all riled up. I've never had crawfish. So we get there and each of the tables are covered with a plastic table cloth and there's a roll of paper towels. I'm like, "Aw, shet. Things are gonna get messy." So I order a pound of crawfish ($9), hot n juicy special seasoning, mild. Because I'm a pussy like that, I have spice issues. What. Bf ordered the same thing, but spicy. The waiter gives each of us a bib that says "Let's get crackin'" and has a lobster on it. Let's get crackin' indeed. I thought I was gonna be the only asshole with a bib on, but apparently everyone does it. So it must be alright. Like unprotected, premarital sex. And crack. I was looking forward to this all day long. I had a three-hour long, GRUELING work out, and all I could think about was some hot n juicy craw daddies. The waiter dropped our crawfish in plastic bags. Little crawfish in a puddle of awesome spices. When we started to dig in, we realized we didn't know what we were doing. And our friend that went to crawfish parties in Miami? Didn't actually eat the crawfish there. She just drank beer. So we asked the waiter for help and he obliged. Once we got the hang of it, it was all cherry. It just seemed like a lot of work for a small meat yield. In the beginning, I couldn't bring myself to suck the juices out of the head. But then I removed myself from the idea that they were once living animals. With eyes. That stare at you. There are places that are good for drinking beer with food. Not only is Hot n Juicy good for beers with food, its not only perfect, its down right necessary. I almost didn't oder a beer, but halfway through my hot n juicy and spicy meal, I had to get a beer. I ordered fries, too. Which came in handy in soaking up the extra juices.  The seasoning was so good. I was licking off the excess from my fingers and pulled away a stub. For the two dozen crawfish, four beers, and fries, we paid $46 before tip; average $15 per person. I would not recommend going here hoping to feast on a budget. (I hit this place up, because of Famous Teri's review http://www.yelp.com/biz/hot-n-juicy-crawfish-las-vegas#hrid:1Kovc8dDQe3xUhdKabbpFw) * off the strip, non-casinoAfter a long day of walking and shopping, we were hungry for some crawfish.  And thanks to yelp, we found a winner in Vegas!This place truly lives up to their name.  We ordered two pounds of shrimp and two pounds of crawfish...all medium spiciness with garlic butter seasoning.  We should've ordered a pound with different seasoning and heat....to test our taste buds.  I'm eyeing the Hot n Juicy Special and Lemon Pepper seasonings for my next visit.  I think the garlic butter had more garlic than butter....extremely potent!  The crawfish was very spicy at medium...but we loved it.  Some of these crustaceans were larger in size than at most places I've gone to.  The shrimp was my favorite though.  Same spices as the crawfish, but more juicy and meaty.  We also ordered sausage, corn, and Cajun fries...which were all just okay for me.  Customer service was top notch here...I just wish they were open later than 10 pm.  We learned that the Man vs. Food show will be taping at this restaurant.  With their hot n juicy menu, it's evident why this place will be premiered.Great shrimp, sausage, and corn! They serve it up to you in a plastic baggy with their spicy sauce. Be sure to wear those bibs they provide. It's gonna get a little messy...You can order your sauce mild to extra spicy. Us "wimps" ordered a bag of mild and a bag of medium (sorry, I like to enjoy my food while not having my mouth numb with fire).  Actually, compared to other places I've been to, their mild was like medium  and medium was HOT HOT HOT! but it was all good. I was still able to enjoy the taste because the spicyness didn't really bite, it just built up as I came close to finishing the bag.I prefer shrimp over the crawfish because the shrimp is meatier and well worth peeling over the crawfish. The calamari rings and fries we ordered was a nice filler to absorb some of that spice!IF you like FISH BAIT this is your place.I found several things that were really bad.1st service is slow2nd they weigh there crawfish w the sauce in the bag. so you really dont get what u are supposed to get.3rd. the shrimp are very tough and super dirty4th the crawfish a very  very dirty5th what ever spicy level you order they just give you whatever they feel like6th CASH DISCOUNT? wtf is this. you mean if i decide to pay in cash, you will give me a discount? does this mean you are doing something wrong. Im pretty sure if you stay at bally's and when you check out. The front desk says. hey if you pay with cash i will give u a discount? no way. this is called tax fraud.Rule# 1 about eating seafood in the nevada. ONLY in a hotel! there stuff is so rubbery and nasty. i really could not eat it. and i eat pretty much everything. but this was the 1 that was impossible. I dont think any real foody would disagree.my score: 1-10staff- 3menu- 2price- 2bathrooms- cant even be rated is was that bad "0"over all- Total Scam!I almost threw up the minute I walked in this dive.  What a pit.  the smell of "fish gone wrong" was too overwhelming for me.  And the place was DIRTY.  Seafood and dirt DO NOT mix.The service was awful if you are not Asia....seriously....all the Asian folks were taken care of immediately.We ordered, then I made the mistake of going to the bathroom to wash my hands before I ate.  OMG.  I'm sure I picked up masses of germs just walking in that hole.Food came, and I swear we didn't eat it.  The shrimp were so tough it was impossible to really eat.  The crawfish?  It's like someone said below...it was like fish bait!  SO dirty and what really pissed me off was that I asked for medium and instead got the spiciest hottest juice ever.  When I asked if it was correct, she just shrugged her shoulders.  Wow.Disgusting, will never eat here again and will never suggest it to anyone who doesn't want to get sick.I've been to this place about three times and I'm still not tired of it! I have also been to the boiling crab in san jose, california but it does not compare to our louisiana style crawfish! If you do not like breaking the shells of the crawfish, shrimps are the way to go! There are also various seasoned flavors that the shrimps or crawfish are cooked in, but be prepared to taste a little spice! Oh! Another tip, be prepared to wait. Sometimes the waiting list is about an hour!! But you'll enjoy it overall. It is one thing everyone must experience! You get hot n juicy bibs and you also can get down and dirty with your hands, so you can choose to wear gloves. If you also like rice with your seafood, a bowl of rice is $2.Las Vegas is Sin City for a reason; it celebrates the seven deadly sins. In Vegas, your greatest weakness or vice becomes the source of all your pleasures. We were ready to give into our carnal desires and get down and dirty, indulging our voracious, gluttonous appetites. We wanted to get stuffed with something Hot N Juicy. Hot N Juicy is known for their seafood: crab (Dungeness, blue, snow), shrimp, and of course, crawfish. You pick the type of seasoning (Juicy Cajun, garlic butter, lemon pepper or the Hot n Juicy Special) and the level of spiciness (mild, medium, spicy or extra spicy). We ordered 2 lbs of snow crab legs and 2 lbs of crawfish with Juicy Cajun at medium, 2 pieces of corn, 2 red potatoes, etouffee (a Cajun seafood stew, similar to gumbo), and a side of sweet potato fries. Eating at Hot N Juicy is not an elegant refine affair. It's messy work because they dump a plastic bag of whatever seafood you ordered and you're only protection is the plastic table covering and a plastic bib. You open the bag and dig in.The crab meat was very sweet and juicy. It was perfectly cooked. I found that the spiciness of the food depended on the type of seafood because the seasoning is on the outside of the shell. The meat isn't spicy unless you soak it in the sauce first. I found the level of spiciness in the crawfish much higher because the tail meat was much smaller and there was more shell around it, unlike the crab meat where I could pull out large pieces of meat out of the shell. Also I got more spicy sauce from the crawfish because I sucked crawfish heads. After a while my lips got tingly and numb from the Cajun spices. I've never had crawfish whole before. I only had them de-shelled. While I love crawfish and the meat was great, I'll never have them whole like that again. The tail meat is rather tiny (I like 'em big -- size matters when it comes to these things). At the end, we looked at the mountain of shell and agreed that it was more work than it was worth. Crawfish is mostly shell and I'd rather pay someone to shell them for me.Etouffee was a spicy rice seafood stew. I liked the flavor and the level of spice was just perfect for me. I thought the rice was a tad overcooked and mushy from just sitting in a pot all day, but in general it was enjoyable.The boiled red potatoes were much needed as a break from the relentless Cajun spice. They were nice and sweet. The corn is out of season, so not as sweet and juicy as in the summer, but still tasty. The sweet potato fries were crispy and tasty.The final price for all of us was $30/person for three people. We gorged ourselves on great seafood and left utterly satiated. Happy ending for us indeed.What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas. But this is one of the few times where you wish you could get crabs and bring them home with you.I can honestly admit I'm a lazy person when it comes to eating. Cutting a piece of meat with a knife and/or fork/spoon (when I'm even lazier) is probably the most strenuous work I'll tolerate. Using my fork or spoon is enough, isn't it?The ONLY, I repeat ONLY, food I'll take time to carefully work at and eat is shellfish...specifically crab, lobster and crawfish. Unfortunately, being located in the Tri State area, there is a lack of crawfish which saddens me. Since I was in town for work I jumped at the opportunity to eat one of my favorite shellfish friends...crawfish!After leaving the CES convention center, my colleagues and I hailed a taxi* and requested to go to Hot N Juicy located in Chinatown. A split second later, we realized Hot N Juicy sounded like a strip club so we joked around with the taxi driver and insisted it wasn't a peep show. We were going to that AFTER we ate.My colleagues didn't know it but I was giggling like a little school girl when we arrived. Unfortunately for them, they aren't as adventurous when it comes to food so they ordered calamari, chicken wings and fries which they enjoyed.Our waiter was extremely informative, briefly describing to us (mostly me) how to order the seafood (per pound), by seasoning and spiciness. Since I've been to Boiling Crab I already knew what I wanted...2 lbs of garlic butter crawfish with medium heat. The garlic butter seasoning is SO mouth wateringly good that I could drink it as a side (not recommended though). They serve the seafood in plastic bags with bibs and paper towels. This is the messiest meal you will ever eat but so worth it. I was in business attire but was able to leave without any stains!As I twisted and separated the head and tail, sucked the head and pushed out the meat from the tail...my colleagues looked at me in complete disgust like I was a monster. Did I feel bad? Not at all. I easily finished the 2 lbs of crawfish like a true fatty. I ordered medium heat but my mouth was on fire pretty much the entire time I was eating so to counteract the heat, I took big swigs of beer which helped. The seafood pricing on the menu says market price so be sure to ask the waiter beforehand. The crawfish was about $10 per pound. Currently, they're having a BOGO shrimp special because they opened up another Hot N Juicy location in Washington, DC. Do I hear a road trip?My next visit will showcase their blue crab legs. If you're ever in Vegas or DC, I would highly recommend coming here if you're a seafood lover and don't mind getting messy. It's a freakin' dream.A fun tip, Hot N Juicy was on Man vs. Food.------------------------------------*In Las Vegas, taxis aren't allowed to pick up passengers on streets like NYC. They have to pull into a parking lot, hotel, restaurant, etc.If I were to rate this place based on the food alone, I would give it a 4.5.. The shrimp was really good with the signature hot and juicy sauce, even better than what I've had at boiling crab *gasp!! My friends and I shared deep fried soft shell crab, catfish, and fries, which were all really yummy.What brought it waaaay down for me was the HORRIBLE service! We went to eat there on a Saturday evening, so we were expecting it to be really busy, but it wasn't. Thought that would be a good thing because our server would probably have more time to be attentive, but NO! My friend's mouth was on fire from the spicy sauce and had to ask for a coke refill 4 times before a different server finally came and refilled her cup, I had to ask for water 3 times, my other friend's plastic bib broke and she had to repeatedly ask for another before someone finally brought her a new one.When I received my bag of shrimp, there was a hole in it and juices were leaking everywhere. I politely asked the server if I could have another bag just to place the one I already had inside because I didn't want to lose all the sauce to my table, and he replied with a horrible attitude, telling me I wouldn't need one because it would be messy anyway. I then replied with, "Can you just get me a bag like I asked for please?" And he proceeded to throw his hands in the air, say "Fine," in a very sarcastic tone, and just threw the bag on the table. Um, excuse me?? First of all, I wanted to save my delicious sauce for my rice, not for licking off the f*cking table, DICK. I wish I ordered crab instead of shrimp so I could use the claws to attack him.Overheard the tables next to ours complaining about the bad service and the unnecessary attitudes as well. I hope the management at this establishment figures out a way to properly train their employees to be helpful, attentive, and polite. Until that happens, I won't be returning to Hot and Juicy.Wow! I can't believe that it took me this long to finally try this place.  It has been a long time dream of mine to get down and dirty! Hot n Juicy and lemon pepper shrimp at one pound each with a side of white rice. In addition to skin peeling, eating with my hands, sucking the juice out of the shrimp heads, licking the juice from running down your fingers, and drinking the juice from the bag after devouring the shrimps; while all were sitting in my tummy and with a side of beer was EPIC!!!!I have finally had the chance to check this place out and what a disappointment.Let me start by saying... our waiter, Nick... DAMN. It was almost like he was fed up in being there and just didn't give a fck. Once we sat down, he came and yes... threw out menus in our face, threw sugar bags down on the table, and asked us you guys want anything to drink?! Daaaamn serious?!?!! Why Boo??!! WHY??! Wow okay... . Came back with our teas and took our orders.. that's the last time we saw his face. It took numerous attempts to get a runner, server, whoever worked there to ask for refills, which finally was able to be refilled, but with regular tea when I had Raspberry. Nasty... The whole time we were there... our throats were like a desert and our drinks were empty.. so damn empty,  the melted ice made a few gulps of replenishment to get us through our meals. We had to ask for gloves, we had to ask again for our pepper and  limes on the side, which our server never brought, and we even had to ask the next table to please get their server's attention for us after she was done giving them their food orders, just so we could... Ask. Even our tools to crack open our crabs were not the right tools, but after trying to get a server's attention. It was more tiring to wave down a server than tear apart our meals. From the frustration on the service here, I tore the crab legs with my own bare hands and ate like an animal. Tearing it with my own straight teeth!!! Grrr!!! I ended up doing the.. break the shell with my fingers and gently wiggle wiggle the meat out. Several times I showed my great company that I conquered a looooong piece of crab meat Ha haaaa! But then she shows off her piece, which was thicker and longer than mine!!! Oh yeah?!??!!!! I had that Ooo impressed face and nodded my head. We entertained each other... But never once were we checked back upon to see how we were doing or we needed anything. It was literally the worst service for a fun-filled environment. I heard their other new location has better service, but this experience makes me think twice to even want to give them my business.The food was the only thing that made me want to give Any stars to this establishment. The sweet potato fries was excellent in texture and taste. The shrimp, crab, and side of sausage we ordered were full of spice and with the combination of asking limes on the side to make your own sauce.. it tasted refreshing, sweet, spicy, peppery, bitter, and ended with a great bite from the acidity of the limes. Don't forget to ask for those pepper and limes on the side.. makes a great impact with the flavors of the spices that were cooked in with the crab and shrimp. Even if you have to hunt someone down that worked there to get it! I will note that the food deserves high remarks. However, due to the lack of service we received here, it's unfortunate to give it such a low rating. But I must speak the truth and the service here was... non-existence. Damn, DAMN shame if you ask me. It ruined a good meal experience and for us to constantly try to get a server's attention is just bad news. We couldn't enjoy our food and it shouldn't be that way.And for that reason alone... first and last time dining here. Wasn't so "hot" after all and that's the juicy part.ABSOLUTELY AMAZING.I came to Vegas, with the saying "what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas"Well I cant express how much I love this place and how yummy the crawfish, shrimp, mussels, and sweet potato fries were. Great service, they were very quick and attentive. The food was amazing packed with flavors, definitely better than boiling crab. Their sauce comes with chopped potatoes that absorbs all of the flavor from the sauce, yummy...The shrimp: big, hot, and juicy. haha the shrimp tasted fresh and did I mention juicy?Crawfish: I am not a big fan of these little critters because it takes so much effort just to eat the little meat they have. But these guys here are pretty big. mussels: my favorite! you guys gotta order these! sweet potato fries: crispy on the outside soft and sweet in the inside (:Definitely have to come back here again while I am in Vegas!I don't want to lower my rating here, but something must be addressed:Prices. This is an eatery with fluctuating prices based on market sales, so what a pound of shrimp costs today might not be what it costs tomorrow. And their entire menu lists "Market Price" where you'd normally find actual numbers. So, where do they display this crucial information?On the back of my waitress' order book. They used to have a BIG SIGN advertising the day's prices. You know what's there now? A couple fucking TVs. How ingenious! Why let your customers know your prices when they could instead zone out on some fucking game and ignore the people they're dining with, all while annoying a waitress by making her hold up her "price guide" while I decide if I want king crab or clams. Best part: there isn't even a fucking bar in front of the fucking TVs. Not that this place even needs one, but the lack of seating around these TVs proves their lack of worth even more so. If you own this place/are a manager: lose the fucking boob tubes and try to look like a real eatery, not another jerk-off spot with 26 TVs. I go out to eat (novel concept, eh?), not space out on crap. Get with it, guys.Get ready to get messy and sloppy (in a sober way).Went here with a friend cause he was drunk and hungry. Yeah, I had to babysit.Ordered 2 pounds of crawfish (so I can get corn and potato), mild spicy-ness and hot and juicy flavoring. Mmmm-mmmm-mmm! Delish.Do expect to get your hands dirty. Use a spoon to scoop out some of that deliciousness of juice onto your crawfish (after peeled). But expect the service to be just okay. They forgot to get me my bucket of calamari.For the price, it's aight. Kinda expensive but hey, it's still good. Why 3 stars? 1. they need to expand and 2. service needs to be good or better.This review is long overdue. Hot N Juicy is a staple among myself and my girlfriends! It is the ultimate, messy, satisfying meal.We usually order:-Crab legs (spicy medium)-Shrimp (spicy medium)-Add sausage and corn-Seasoned fries-Bud LightI generally don't drink beer (the occasional Amstel Light when boating) but for whatever reason when eating at Hot N Juicy I just have to have a Bud Light to wash down all the flavorful, salty goodness.Three tips: 1. YES wear the plastic gloves, if they don't give them to you, ask for them. Otherwise you will wreck your manicure with all the juice and sauce. 2. Bring a hair clip (if you have long hair) 3. Wear clothes that you don't mind absorbing garlic and HNJ sauce aromas. You will smell like a HNJ shellfish when you leave this restaurant.Mmm just writing about this makes me crave HNJ now!OMG. This place was excellent. The food was sooooo good. However, I reeked of garlic the next 2 days. REEKED! I could smell it on my fingers for crying out loud!No bueno.That was one of only 2 things I didn't like. The other....no cocktails, just beer.But moving on........The food was delicious. I mean, my crab legs were outstanding. I tasted my friends shrimp and WOW. I have really been put off by shrimp lately and it was just like my crablegs.....outstanding!!!!!I will absolutely be back.....just when I know I wont see people for at least 2 days!Me and the hubbs decided to  go here for an afternoon date. Place wasn't so busy and the waitress Danielle, was very nice. We ordered a lobster, a whole Dungeness crab, calamari for an appetizer and a couple of bowls of rice. It seemed like a lot at the time of ordering, but the food just wasn't filling.  I should of ordered shrimp or something else.The calamari was The only thing I really enjoyed. It was ALL squid, no peppers, and it was light and crispy. The flavor we requested in the lobster and crab was plain, and the waitress explained that the water used to boil it is flavored with seasoning. The flavor was fine, with a hint of old bay seasoning-esque. The crab was a bit overcooked and the lobster was not as tender as I wanted. For $90, I think this place is overpriced and not that great when it comes to the quality of the seafood. The waitress should of checked up on us more and they should consider hiring a cleaning crew for their bathrooms.
Macayo's Mexican Restaurants=Dear Macayo's, I would like to thank you for renewing my hatred for your bland, artery busting Meximerican food. I hadn't experienced your brand of deep fried crap since I came of majority and stopped dined out with the family at restaurants that specialized in satisfying even the blandest of palettes. I must say, you continue to exceed my wildest expectations in that respect! I had to continue looking down at my plate just to make sure the 3,000+ calories I was consuming were more than just a mirage of Mexican food.I will admit that I have a long standing, simmering hatred for you, Macayo's. So maybe this biases my opinion a bit. I can't in my right mind fathom why I thought you deserved a second chance last night. I think it's testament to the fact that sometimes I make super stupid decisions on an empty stomach, especially when I'm hungry enough to eat the ass end out of week dead burro. I suppose I was expecting something a bit more appetizing than that stretch of hyperbole. How wrong I was.Your patio was the highlight of the evening. It's backed up against a lake and there was a duck that watched me eat. He had a shiny green head. It was nice. I made him my zen when all I wanted to do was lash out in frustration over the meal. If I could offer a suggestion to benefit both the duck and myself, perhaps you could pipe some music out onto the patio, because listening to Suzie and Sally Suburb bitch about their waistlines while committing refried sin was pretty grating.The food however, far outshone those cackling soccer moms in terms of annoyance. I don't know who you think you are, Macayo's, but charging 10-15 bucks an entree at your establishment just about gave me a heart attack long before the lard had a chance to bully up on my arteries. Maybe it's because I think you have the street value of a gum job from a run down whore, but I have to say that those prices were shocking. I could travel the valley over and find better Mexican food for much cheaper. For that price, I expect outstanding quality and taste, or at least a hip see and be seen environment. All you have is a duck working in your favor. I do have a serious question for you though, what's with smothering your entrees in cream cheese and trying to pass it off as Baja sauce? It was the same jalapeno spread I get on my bagel in the morning, but with even less heat and flavor. I suggest renaming it Manhattan sauce in honor of the bagel and schmear capital of the nation, and I think it would be a touching homage to the Pace Picante "New York City?!" commercials. I also can't understand why the majority of your entrees offer either rice or beans, but few have these in conjunction. Those are universal standards at a Mexican food joint, and the ultimate test of quality since they're comparable the valley over. Do they bring you shame? Is that why you don't want to offer them both? Or are you just a cheap nickel and diming motherfucker, Macayo's? I'm more apt to believe the latter, because you charged me two bucks for guacamole without informing me that it cost extra. Then you delivered a pile of gelatinous green goop of questionable origin that had absolutely zero flavor. By this point in the meal I really shouldn't have been surprised at how bland everything was, because I was on to your ploy of substituting flavor for gobs of cream cheese and a heavy hand with the salt shaker. But despite stiff competition from the bland pico de gallo and the puzzling "Baja sauce", it was the shitamole took the grad prize of suckdom for the evening. I have never tasted weaker guac. You must have used some terrible avocados and whipped them with corn syrup or some other food-like filler. There wasn't a zing of cilantro or lemon juice, no hint of Serrano spiciness, not even the tang of some onion, although I did see a couple soggy tomatoes bits added for color. I don't think I will ever be coming back, Macayo's. It's not you, it's... I can't lie; even to spare your feelings. It's you. It's all you. I'm breaking up in a public setting because I'm scared that you'll key my car while by back is turned, or at the least smother it in cream cheese. I know you're into that freaky shit.Wishing you deep fried broken dreams,EricaIs has been a very long since I have visited this Macayo's.  Parking is shared with a few other business's but, still amble parking.Very colorful inside, but, some places here are a bit worn out and could use a bit of sparkle.   We came about 5:20 and had about a 15 min wait. They were quite busy for a Tuesday night.We checked it out upstairs, but it was freezing a cold up there. So we were glad we ate downstairs. We got a nice booth. we had a sweet server. She was very busy, but did her best to keep checking on us.She refilled our salsa and drinks several times. The food was just so so. Not the kind of Macayos we know and love.I had a steak Quesadilla which was a little light on the steak.  Lots of Onions though.T got shrimp enchililadas. She said they were good but, both of us the rice and beans were a little flavorless.All in all good food though, service was great! Thank you Nora!HH is fantastic! $3 Margaritas are what Happy Hour should be about after all! They also offer select appetizers for $3 & $5. A few of my favorites include: tamale bites, red corn chicken taquitos, baja pizza, and large cheese crisp. I've heard the queso dips are pretty fabulous as well. You can get 1/2 pint of Baja sauce for $2.99 now! If you have ever had the pleasure of eating a Baja Chimi, you know that this is a marvelous announcement. I would swim in that stuff if I could. Though, that is probably highly unrecommended for numerous reasons and I bet it would take A LOT of sauce to fill up a whole pool. That being said, definitely make sure to try the Baja sauce if you have not already had the opportunity to do so. In my opinion, the best tables in the place are the booths by the windows. Don't forget to watch your step as you are walking up or down the stairs. This has become a bit of a joke between my friends but surely you'll receive the same warning. Just one more example of the great Macayo's customer service. Making sure I do not face plant in a crowded restaurant is rather high on my list so thank you. No matter when you dine you will receive unlimited chips and salsa and you will get plenty of drink refills. Typically, the food is out fast and pipping hot. On my last visit, food was out in under 10 mins! (We weren't even on our second bowl of chips yet). In the past few years, the menu has been adapting to various dietary needs so they offer gluten free items and (to my delight) calabacitas (their version has corn, zucchini, poblano pepper) have been added to the menu options as well. (Yay!)
Mike and Ronda's The Place=Honestly, I live right around the corner from this place. I have been eating here since high school and now I'm graduating college. This is the breakfast spot, I get the omelets or the breakfast burrito and they usually come with pancakes!! The place IS always packed but it's never a long wait for a table. You get a great deal for your money, the portion size is definitely worth it and usually turns into two meals. This was a 4-5 star review up until this point, and now they only get 3 from me. The rude waitress thing is a problem for me. These high school girls with their ratted up hair and overdone makeup at 6 AM need an attitude check. More often than not I get a snooty, curt waitress who resents bringing me a clean fork or a fresh pot of coffee. I don't care if there is gum under the table, that the food is greasy or that the blueberry pancake syrup is really colored sugar water; all I want is a polite waitstaff that doesn't roll their eyes at me. Mike and Rhonda, I love you and it's nothing personal, but give me a better waitress and I'll give you a better review.I'm sad to say that The Place has gone very much downhill since their move to a bigger location. I've given them a few chances hoping it was just growing pains, but it's taken way too long to get back on their game.I am part of a regular group that used to go here every Friday morning. We always sat on the patio of the old place and always got the best service. Super friendly, fast coffee refills--they were just ON.After they moved across the street, they began to make it clear that they would not be accommodating our group. They wouldn't set up a table for us and tried to shove us into individual booths, even when there were only 5 or 6 of us. They have a "back room" with larger tables that they wouldn't open at the time we got there (~6:00am) claiming staffing issues. They finally and begrudgingly let us back there along with several other larger groups facing a similar circumstance; we were basically ignored. They might has well just told us to our faces that they would not be serving us as a group and saved us all the trouble.Don't read between the lines here--we are not a loud, annoying, or demanding group. We are just some guys that like to get together at breakfast.Sadly, our concerns were not heard or passed on to anyone who cared, so I doubt we will ever be back. We've since moved on to places that will gladly accept our business.Quick fast and good. I had the standard 2 eggs, toast and hash browns with a slab of Ham. Eggs = Cooked perfectlyToast = buttered wellHash Browns = Not cooked as much as i prefer (and asked for) but were goodSlab of Ham = nice huge hunk, cooked until caramelized a little on the slab nice!Staff was quick and service was on point.
Brasserie V=Brasserie V - what does the V stand for? My most recent vice.My criteria for a good restaurant (in order of importance):1. Beer2. Food3. ServiceWARNING: This place is hopping, so be ready for a wait, but it's well worth it!The beer selection is phenomenal.  Belgian beers are infinitely complex and notoriously delicious.  Add to that an entire book of beer choices and you have an impossible decision to make. Luckily, Brasserie V's staff is knowledgeable and friendly, ready to help you make such a critical decision.The food is SOOOO GOOOOOOD. I have never had anything I didn't love here.  Moules, frites, burgers, chicken or tuna salad sandwiches at lunch - variety with quality. I'm actually on their wifi right now, writing this review, and eating tonight's special: a burger with egg, crimini and oyster mushrooms, and rosemary and truffle bernaise sauce on sourdough. Only $13! Oh shit. The guy next to me just got the duck breast with door county cherries and red wine sauce. I guess I have to come back tomorrow.The service: this is why I'm a regular. I live nearby and the staff is so much fun that I'm content to hang out at the bar and chat them up for a few hours while they endow me with sample upon sample of whatever 4 new beers they have on tap this week.I feel like I sent my teenager to college.Like I walked my oldest daughter down the aisle. She's all grown up......and I'm thrilled I can say, "I knew her when." Back when she was a few tables and a neighborhood bar. Back when servers were speedy and bartenders had stellar beer recs. Back when the only thing to stave my hunger was pretty much the best burger in town. Back when frites were fierce and sauces to dip them in were stupendous. Here's the thing though, that's still the case even after the expansion! Bring on the burgers, the frites, those incredible mussels swimming in a butter connection I'm afraid to know too much about. Bring on the friendly staff that make you feel like family and Andrea and Matt that always greet me with a smile. Bring on a crazy amount of Belgians in bottles (I'm talking 200 at any given time). And bring on what I think has the coolest atmosphere for grabbing grub with friends on Monroe Street.Sometimes when a restaurant gets too big for its own good by knocking down walls, polishing up original tile flooring and installing a beautiful wood bar that frames the stunning beer coolers nicely it can flop. But not here. Brasserie V was ready, and I'm not certain how they did it so seamlessly, but the transition to a world with additional seating was smooth. I want to say it has something to do with the folks in black (the ones that work there) that jump, no dive in head first, willing to do whatever it takes to make experiences memorable for folks like me that knew her when.Um, first of all, let me say this--$21.00 for unlimited mussels and frites. Are you kidding me?!We tried all three broths--the awesome classic, the St. Bernardus wit, and the final one made with Jordanal farms sausage. All three were delicious, and excellent.The frites were fresh, crispy, and delightful. NEVERENDING EVERYTHING.I'm stuffed. Near the end, we noticed that a lot more of the mussels were closed, rather than open--it's a sign that they were probably cooking them too quickly. That's where the star comes off.Everything was great, though. I have less than a week left in Madtown, and I'm thrilled Brasserie V was one of the stops.Pleasantly surprised.  The whole family went to try Brasserie V on Friday night.  There was a 20 minute wait, but there was enough room for the kids to sit down and for the parents to have a beer.Once seated, our waitress was very attentive and friendly.  They have kids meals for $4.95. Well done Brasserie V!  Parents still get to order a special meal and their kids are happy as well.  We ordered V Burgers and a giant bowl of mussels.  Kids meal choices were simple but all good stuff; grilled cheese, spaghetti, etc. with sides.  Even came with a toy too!V Burgers were just as yummy as the menu exclaimed them to be.  The onions put it over the top for me.  They really hit the mark.  Burger cooked perfectly.  The artichoke side salad was a little bland but we poured some of the mussel broth over it.  Now we're talking.The mussels were perfect.  My 8 year old mussel connoisseur said they were the best he's had.  There were plenty of the little bivalves in there to keep a person busy for a while.  The waitress kept the drinks coming, talked to our kids and helped make this first visit a great one.  Everyone wants to come back.  Bravo!My advice : Stop whatever you're doing and go to Brasserie V, right now. This place is my ULTIMATE Madison fav, my never-fail go-to, and where I always, always bring visiting friends. Seriously, since moving to the area a little over a year ago, I've probably consumed 100 Caprese sandwiches from this place (shameless, I know.) Their beer selection is out of this world, not just in volume but it quality (I stick with a couple favorites but my boyfriend orders something new every time) and their burgers/sandwiches are the perfect combo of pub-chic + gourmet. ALSO, the service is really fantastic. The bar staff spend the right amount of time with you and are super helpful in their beer recommendations.
Ta Ta Bistro=This restaurant is located at the NW corner of Horizon Ridge and Stephanie. It's behind the 7 Eleven and Metro Pizza. Visited 9/2/12Was on the mood for some kinda nese like Japanese or Chinese . Ta Ta Bistro fit the bill nicely. Especially because I just walked out of another  restaurant close by because there were kids sitting on the floor coloring in the middle of the restaurant ( just wasn't the dining experience I was thinking of tonight ).Ordered some sushi eel rolls, spicy tuna wrap and salmon wrap.Also went in for the chicken teriyaki meal. This included salad, miso soup and large plate of juicy teriyaki chicken breast topped with great tasting sauce and sesame seeds. Plus rice of course white or brown. For the record I love Japanese style rice and I went with brown rice cuz I'm eating right. ( yeah right  :p )Service was a little disorganized. But food all came with good presentation and good taste.They have sushi bar, teppanyaki grill table, and not cramped table space. All good. but the decor is tired and needs a fresh look and vibe.The restaurant has alot of food options and each time I come they deliver the goods. Timely, tasty, close by and really reasonable prices. Definitely not over the top but consistently good.I'll be back.Generally places that try to do too much (fusion) fail or come up short at any one thing. Here we have regular Japanese menu, hibachi, extensive sushi menu, and extensive Chinese food menu yet from what we have sampled everything was delicious. We tried two sushi rolls (sushi rolls are named and almost identical to those at Sushi Bay... odd) Paradise roll and Valley of Fire roll... both delicious and what we expected. The calamari tempura appetizer was just okay...compared to Sushi Mon's it failed miserably. We also shared an entree of General Tso's Chicken and that was fresh and delicious... pretty standard higher quality Americanized Chinese food. The service was okay...we had three different servers and one of them annoyed me briefly. I asked for a Sapporo and she said "Let me see your ID" ...so basically demanded it instead of asking to see my ID. What the hell? But, everyone else was nice, the food reasonably priced for the quality and portion and it was a cute little place. I would come back to try more of their dishes.From the name and Yelp listing (Asian fusion, Chinese, thai?), I wouldn't have been able to tell that they serve sushi- but it's actually a hibachi/sushi joint in the style of Bennihana or Ohjah. Front windows advertise 50% off regular rolls and teppanyaki.This place is a steal, for sushi: $40 got us two regular rolls, two special rolls, and a gigantic salmon skin hand roll, plus tax and tip for two. The pricing can't really be beat. Their discounted regular rolls are decent (if a bit heavy handed on the rice), but the garlic ponzu sauce had an odd chemical after taste that I did not care for at all. The WHATS WRONG and MUMMY special rolls were both artistically presented and tasty, with ample amounts of fresh fish. And that hand roll was gigantic! Good value for the sushi found here. Service was decent, attentive without being overbearing. Check the specials board behind the sushi bar for featured rolls: the Lady Gaga Roll sounded good, and the What's Wrong was a hit. Note that they have a large dining area: they were able to accommodate a 10 person graduation dinner group without reservations without a problem.
3 Tomatoes and A Mozzarella=I've wondered about this place for a while now but have been reluctant to go since it looks another boring chain place.  I then realized chain places are prevalent in Las Vegas' restaurant make-up.Therefore, I had to set aside my innate SF disdain for commercial eateries or otherwise I'd starve or be forced to cook at home.And we can't have either happen. So I braved my fears and finally tried this cozy looking place in the middle of nowhere that serves pizza, panini, and pasta.I'm saddened to say my initial trepidation was well founded: our food turned out to be very average.The mozzarella in our Caprese Salad wasn't fresh, the cheese tortellini tasted like it came from Costco, and the pizza sauce was bland.Maybe I should've cooked at home.Overall, I won't be returning.
Caribbean Hut=Dodging drunks coming in and out of Stool Pigeons, I decided to stop in on this small place. I did not see one person. The sign on the outside promised Caribbean (Jamaican) food. From the time I opened the door, I could smell nothing but the flavors from the island, the jerks, curries, and many other island favorites.      Looking at the menu, I see the prices are extremely low, and still , not one person (I realized why, they just opened). So I ordered the Jerk Chicken of course, that had a rich dark sauce. My wife had the Ox Tail, the sauce also was so good, you would want to drink it from a straw.      Do not let this little place in a strip mall fool you. They have very good and authentic foods, that will tantalize every taste bud that you have or wish you had. CAUTION! , if you have no idea what Jamaican food is or want a piece of square fish or chicken McNugget's do not go here. This is the real deal. Do not take my word for it. Try it for yourself. And... Do not drool on the keyboard while you are looking at the pictures.
Canal Restaurant=Five star venue. Reminds me of big city digs in L.A. or NYC. The runway. Oh, I so wanted to strut my butt. But I decided to nibble on the delicious appetizers like corn cakes with avocado salsa and the yummy mini croque monseurs. The Strawberry martini, although a bit too minty, was fruity and dry. Like my "funny" cousin Jim, who's 47 single, likes wicker and has an "I HEART cats and books t'shirt. Well, what do ya do? Service at our yelp event was great I thought. Kristy had quite a few folks to sling drinks at and she was polite and professional. The menu seemed slightly inventive, with a $30 lobster sandwich, a spin on a cobb salad and the now obligatory sliders. I will be back for a visit and will definitely talk it up. Next time, however, I will be ready with stilletos and my Victoria Secret angel wings!
Redendo's Pizzeria Ristorante=Jackpot.  I was soooo nervous about finding good pizza in AZ.  In Boston the choices were pretty atrocious and I was expecting to have to go on a hunt for a good slice out here.Pulling up to Redendo's was reassuring.  The Yankees logo on the front window was a promising sign.  Walking in and seeing the poster on the wall of the guy flipping a pizza was even more reassuring- that dude was on every box of pizza I ate growing up.  I ordered a slice (and I didn't get asked "what kind?"!) and my husband went with a calzone.  As we waited for our lunch we took in the surroundings and immediately felt at home.  The Whitestone Bridge sign.  The 7 train icon.  The oldies playing on the loud speaker.  Yes, this was looking promising indeed.The pizza was nearly perfect.  I chalk the difference up to the water.  It was everything a NY slice should be...thin, cheesy and yummy.  My husband's calzone was not only huge but amazing.  The marinara sauce was fantastico.  I have found that it's very hard to find good marinara sauce  (too sweet, too tomato-y, etc) and we were very happy to find it here.  I can't wait to try the parms and pasta dishes!10/21/10My first visit to Redendo's!  Dark wood tables everywhere, a plethora of old photographs adorned the walls, and old crooner songs played loudly overhead- I asked nicely if the volume could be turned down, and thank goodness they obliged!  Too bad a quarter of the FOH was occupied by empty pizza boxes ready to be used- what an eyesore!  The women's restroom was spacious, comfortably decorated, and, most importantly, very clean.  (I accidentally entered the men's room, and while still decorated, it wasn't as elegant as the women's, and it didn't feel as clean and fresh in there, sorry to say.)I was craving for fettucine alfredo, but I asked server Nicole what her favorite dish was on the entire menu, and she pointed to the eggplant parmigiana and said that she and her beau split this dish all the time.  I told her I'd get one of those, but hadn't realized it was a sandwich until later, but no biggie.  I like hot Italian... heroes.  ;)  I then said I wanted pasta alfredo, and she said that was her favorite pasta dish, too [what a coincidence! ;)].  For my next visit, I already decided i was going to try the Popeye's, but I didn't tell her.  When she later revealed that it was her family's fave, I thought either we go for the same flavor combos; this young woman is reading me like a book; or agreeing w/ everything I say.The fettucine alfredo was a beautiful sight to behold, and its garlic parmesan cream sauce was one of the best-looking AND best-tasting parmesan cream sauces (for the price) I've ever had!  Loved the two garlic mini-breadsticks that flanked the noodles, but I wish they were a little crispier.  The eggplant parm was tasty, but it's sliced VERY thin.  I would've preferred it a little bit thicker.  Enjoyed the bread, which I was told was homemade (I've got to find out for sure).  Unfortunately for me, the bread is lined w/ a cornmeal crust underneath.  This makes for a wonderful crunch, but not for a happy and feeling-good Aileen :(  Perhaps I can order their heroes w/ two sandwich tops?  Hmm...Do you like crusty pizzas?  Do you like goat cheese and ricotta?  How about some spinach and lots of roasted garlic??  If you like white pizzas (no tomato sauce), then you HAFTA try the Popeye!  I've ordered this pie almost every week since first trying it in late Oct./early Nov. of last year.  Mom couldn't get enough of it; she was the one who'd ask me to order one for takeout at the end of every work week!  :)  She finally asked me to stop getting them late Dec./early Jan., but I never tired of it.  She recently started asking if we could go have some more pizza about three weeks ago; I just bought one last night!  The Popeye is the only variety I've tried here (it's the only white pizza they've got), but with such great flavors on a perfectly crispy crust, I don't want anything else!p.s.  Tried the tiramisu, as well-- Ordered it to-go, but had to try a few bites at the resto.  LOL  Very nice, and not too sweet.  My two complaints were that it needed more espresso and that the slice was a bit small for the price.  (Or maybe it just didn't look so pretty when served in an aluminum bowl.)  Would I order it again?  Hmm... I'll have to get back to you on that!I am always on the lookout for new-to-me places to try pizza, on the hunt for that elusive perfect crust/sauce/topping combo. Tucked away in a strip mall and not clearly visible from the street, Redendo's probably has the best you have never tasted (but should!). On our initial visit we went with a pie that had mushrooms, 1/2 pepperoni and 1/2 sausage. It was good... very good! Doughy yet crisp crust, with ample topping coverage and a flavorful sauce. Even Mr. "I Grew Up In NY" approved, which is high praise. We also tried the linguine with clams - tasty and a generous portion. However, the pizza was clearly the highlight. You know a restaurant has earned a spot in the rotation when halfway through the meal the discussion involves what will be ordered on the next visit. We already knew what we wanted... the Popeye - a pizza highly recommended by fellow Yelper Aileen B... We ventured back a week later and started with the pepperoni pinwheel appetizer - a small stromboli-like roll of cheese and pepperoni, encased in the fantastic crust. A nice start to the meal, especially when paired with ranch dressing (I know, weird but good - try it!). On to the main attraction... the Popeye!  A wonderful pizza with the same fantastic crust we enjoyed previously now topped with spinach, goat cheese, ricotta and thin, slightly crisp slices of roasted garlic. Delicious! It is now the standard by which every other white pizza is measured.  While Redendo's is clearly a favorite, I do have to point out a couple of small details that for me are a bit annoying - they charge the price of two full toppings if you go half and half on a pizza. I never understand this - it is not a full serving of topping for half a pizza, why charge full price? Also, while it was recommended to try ranch dressing with the pinwheel (yum!) it was not discolsed that there is a charge for it.  These small things definitely will not keep me away - the food is great and the service friendly. A perfect combo! Listen to Popeye and eat your spinach... on a pizza!Wow. I'm seriously impressed! Redendo's had been popping up in my Yelp nearby Feed for a few weeks now and I kept meaning to stop by. I'm so glad I did.I ordered a small Caesar salad, an order of garlic knots and a calzone to go. About 15 minutes later I walked out the door with a package of food that smelled like an Italian heaven. The "small" salad was huge and fresh. The garlic knots were delicious, as was the side of marinara that came with it. The real star is the calzone. I don't know what I was expecting, but this far exceeded any ideas I could have had. The thing is huge. It's basically a pizza folded in half. Mine had ricotta, fresh tomatoes, sausage and roasted garlic. Ridiculous. So good. I'm still enjoying it and I had the thing like three days ago!All that was $16 and it lasted me about three days. Highly, highly, highly recommended!
Wally's Pub and Grill=I met a business associate at Wally's for lunch today.It might have been the wrong day to go to Wally's. Today is Cinco de Mayo and at Wally's, they were celebrating "Cinco de Wally's" (Wally's Five?!?!?...five what?) with a "special" menu.Boy, can I just state for the record that it is seldom a good idea for a restaurant to screw around by replacing their menu with ethnic food to celebrate holiday's.This goes certainly for "pubs" trying to get their Mexican fiesta on...it goes for Mexican restaurants trying to add corned beef on St. Patrick's Day...it goes for fine dining restaurants trying to add hot dogs and burgers on July 4th and it goes for Applebee's and their ilk trying to serve "turkey with all the trimmin's" on Thanksgiving.The results are at the very best uneven and at the worst, Cinco de Wally's.I sensed a problem at the start...they gave us a "special" menu with all Mexican food "especial's" and the only regular Wally's food available was the Wally burger and wings. Oh well, a Wally burger it will have to be. My associate decide to risk it and ordered the chicken tacos, but offset it by having a margarita, which is, as we all know, a powerful flavor enhancer and pain reliever!The service was slow, but not really problematically slow...just not very attentive, at first. It took 10 minutes or so for our server to take our drink orders and another 5-10 minutes to get our drinks, but the pace picked up after that.We got our food and that's when the fun really started:)I ordered my burger medium with cheese...it arrived a delightful shade of un-medium gray in the middle, with no cheese. My associates meal arrived and it was...a plate of lettuce! The taco platter was supposed to be 6 small tacos (taco sliders?), but all we could see was a platter of shredded lettuce. Substantial digging produced the tiny tacos (and they were tiny...2 bites, at best), but no salsa, no cheese...just meat, tiny tortilla's and a hay mound of lettuce.We called the server over and I sent back my burger (you can't uncook a burger and I am reluctant to send food back to the kitchen, but this just wasn't correct) and my associate asked for cheese, salsa and sour cream, two of which he received (no sour cream at Wally's?...really?).I got my replacement burger and cut it in half...still no cheese, but by now, I was over my desire for a cheese burger and just wanted a little sustenance (5 mile run this morning...I was hungry:).I took a bite and the burger was essentially room temperature. That will rob you of your appetite pretty quickly. I flagged down our server again and asked him to try again, which he did. But when he got back, I was essentially done with Wally's Five for today, so I didn't eat much of the burger...sorry he had to warm it up for me when I ended up leaving it on the plate..oh well...we paid for it, so:)I like the Wally's at 44th and Camelback, just fine. I was prepared to like this one, too. I was thinking about passing on the review it because of the Cinco de Wally's thing, but...I was there, it wasn't good and I feel like Yelping!
J & J Szechuan Cuisine=Tried this place out after reading an article on Thrillist about the 10 best Chinatown restaurants:http://www.thrillist.com/eat/las-vegas/best-chinatown-restaurants-in-vegas I ordered their bestselling sautéed spiced lamb, and it was just average good. It was very spicy, so they definitely got their Szechuan on, but I was a little disappointed with the portion. It felt like a lunch-sized portion, but I paid the full dinner price. Oh, and the rice was extra - really?I would have to say that I agreed with most of the articles picks for best Chinatown eateries, at least the ones I have been to. J&Js was my first attempt at the ones I have not tried, and I am already disappointed. Not only do I think J&Js is not the best Szechuan in Chinatown, but its bestselling sautéed spiced lamb is not even the best Szechuan spiced lamb dish in Chinatown (that honor has to go to Yunnan Garden).I sure hope the rest of the list is not as far off.So I wasn't hungry when I dropped in to visit my friend at his storein Chinatown.  But it was lunch time, and they were craving this lamb hotpot that they said was really big and good from this Chinese restaurant I don't know about by their Chinese name.The restaurant turned out to be J & J Szechuan Cuisine, which I had bookmarked to try their lunch specials earlier this year.  The interior of the restaurant looks and feels really vintage (not in a good way). But from experience, I know some of the best Chinese food are served at this hole-in-the-wall type restaurants.  After we were seated and handed our menu, my friends proceed to order the Lamb Hot Pot (which they said was off the menu).  Sounds good.  I love the whole secret menu concept.After a fair amount of time has passed and we have completely demolished the appetizers and the Cold Noodle we ordered, the waitress finally brought out the hot pot.  The reaction from my friends was that this was not what they were served on their previous visit. The portion is a lot smaller (as in about half of what they were served the last time).  So instead of it being a hearty large portion that could be split with 3 people, it was just enough to accommodate 2 people at the most.  It was a good thing that I was not hungry to begin with.  The noodle was also cooked so much that you can't even pick it out with a chopstick, as it has pretty much been cooked to mush.  They spoke to the waitress and asked why this did not look like what they ordered previously, but the waitress just argues back saying we do not remember what we ordered the last time.  Considering the portion is less than half of what my friends ordered the last time. And he took pictures of what he ordered from his previous visit. I highly doubt that. Smh.When they asked if it can be returned, since it was so different from what was served before, the waitress just said no!To add insult to injury (or is it injury to insult? I wonder which is worst) one of my friend found a random string from who knows what in the Lamb Hot Pot.  We should have taken a picture of it first.  Because when we showed it to the waitress, she dismissed it as just a piece of noodle (It is right there on our table. Try eating it!). Then she said it was the string from the noodle package and just picked it up without offering an apology. Yeah, that was about the only smart thing she did. Get rid of the evidence!So inconsistency in what is served, even if it is a secret off the menu item, is already a big red flag for me to never return here again. But the fact that a foreign object was found in the food and the customer received the "No F Given" attitude when confronted about it, is just the final nail in the coffin.So yeah, even by Asian/Chinese restaurant standards, this place has crap service and subpar food.  Thus probability of return is less than 0.1%.  But in the event of a zombie apocalypse, I will bookmark this place since it will still be low on other people's list of places to scavenge for food. 1 star, because half stars are not supported on Yelp.
Archi's Thai Bistro=On an errand to pick up a Halloween costume, I called in an order to pick up some Thai food from Archi's. The nice lady on the phone told me my order would be ready in 15 minutes, although she did ask me twice to make sure I was aware I was calling the Rainbow Blvd location. I arrive about 12 minutes later and I see the waiter bringing my order to the counter. Perfect timing. Paid the bill and was on my way. Note: I was there on a Sunday around 12:15pm and only about 2-3 tables were being used. Kinda empty for prime time lunch.After going to Archi's, I ran another errand and then finally headed home. When I opened the boxes, the yummy goodies were staring at me wondering what took so long. I ordered:1. Pad See Ew - Stir fried wide rice noodles with Chinese broccoli and Thai soy sauce. Choice of meat included chicken, pork, or beef.WOW. This dish was really tasteful. The noodles were perfect. Soft yet with a crisp of crunchiness. I chose the pork and it was sliced and tender. I got it with a 5 on the spicy scale and it had a nice kick without being overbearing. I would definitely order this again. For sure.2. Fried Rice - Stir fried rice with tomatoes, onion, green onion, and egg. Comes with a choice of meats (chicken, pork, or beef)This dish was also good. I wouldn't say its the best dish ever, but I would probably order this again after trying a few other dishes. The rice had good texture and it wasn't dry or oily. Good portions of meat as well.I definitely preferred the Pad See Ew over the Fried Rice, but I'm not against ordering the Fried Rice again. I recommend trying this place. Maybe next time I will dine in and check out the atmosphere.Pictures are included as well!This is Thai Perfection! Archi's gets my 5-star rating because it leaves nothing at all to be desired and always keeps me coming back for more. The Panang Curry Sauce is what sweet (and spicy) dreams are made of. The depth of the flavor is INSANE. I can taste the perfect balance of sweet coconut and kick of curry and cilantro. This sauce is consistantly a crowd pleaser at my table. I also always order the Garlic and Pepper Beef which is served with broccoli and cabbage. The meat is always tender and served hot. You can order your dishes at any spice level. I must not forget to mention the coconut ice cream for dessert. DELICIOUS. Secretly I am tempted to order seconds or take some home for later. We all know it would be devoured in the car by the first stop light! Archi's is clean, the service is quick and the quality of the food is on point every time and cheap, too! If you have not been there I highly recommend it to get your grub on:)So far this is one of my favorite Thai food place in Las Vegas. Coming from the Bay Area where I had amazing choices I was originally reluctant to try and would just wait for trips home. We ventured out, discovered some NO WAY places, some EH and a few greats. This is a great. We've never had a bad meal at Archi's. The dishes are consistent, full of flavor, fresh ingredients cooked to perfection. At times the service can be a little slow, but the place is always packed and it appears they keep the number of servers pretty low. Worth the wait I say!Pad ThaiFried TofuNum Tok Beef SaladPad Prik Pow or KingPanangPineapple Fried RiceBasil Fried RicePak Kea Mowomg, I'm totally salivating as I write this list. redic.I am ridiculously addicted to the Ginger Ginger Ginger Beef lunch special at Archi's Thai Bistro. STUPID addicted..  It is the only thing I have ever had there, and I doubt I will change it up any time soon. My first visit to Archi's was with the lovely Jaime W. for lunch. Every other time, I have gotten my meal to go. This place gets jam-packed at noon, if you are planning on having lunch here it would be a smart move to show up closer to 11.  Sometimes the wait just to pick up to go food is 5-10 minutes, with the wait to get a table just as long if not longer.The lunch specials are $7.95 (unless you want shrimp) and you get the entree, a generous portion of steamed rice, a fried wonton and an eggroll (if you eat in I believe you also get soup). I have had better eggrolls and I throw away the wonton. The delicious ginger beef dish keeps me coming back week after week... It has baby corn, mushrooms, bell peppers, onions and a ton of delicious ginger.Every other dish at Archi's may suck, and I may never know... but based on how busy they are day after day, I doubt it. If you like Thai, you should give Archi's Bistro a try.The atmosphere is a whole lot better than the Flamingo location so this is the place to go if you're not doing take out.  Our waitress was forgetful though.  My wife ordered white wine and she brought out red.  I wanted Chang's beer and she brought Singha.  We wanted 2 glasses of water (one with no ice) and she brought just one glass of water with ice.  That took my rating down a star.   We split a papaya salad at level 7 out of 10 spice.  It was refreshing and spicy as heck for me.  My wife ordered the green curry with tofu.  She always, always gets green curry.  The tofu was deep fried which complemented the curry very well and frying it makes sense so the tofu stays together in the hot broth.    I got the country curry with shrimp only because it had the most ingredients listed on the menu.  That had eggplant, mushroom, bamboo shoots, green beans, baby corn, basil, zucchini and a few other things in a red curry base.  I had that at spice level 5 which was a quality burn for me.  Definitely a quality Thai meal at a reasonable price.I came here for lunch right as they opened at 11 am after hearing that this place fills up quick during lunch time -- and it does!I was not impressed with their lunch special selection. The price of $7.95 was decent for the amount of food you get, but they charge extra $1 for brown rice substitution. Really? Around thirty percent of the lunch menu was chinese food, and I don't come to a Thai restaurant to eat the goopy concoction that is sweet and sour chicken. They did not have Pad Kea Mow (drunken noodles) as part of their lunch menu. Bummer. I opted to skip the lunch menu and order my drunken noodles with chicken ($9.95) anyway. The portion was large and the taste and quality of ingredients used were superior to many other Thai restaurants. The chicken was cooked perfectly and was not dry -- a feat only few have been able to accomplish.The service was a bare minimum. There was no personal interaction; it was drop off your food/drink and quickly run off. I get it, it's busy... but you're doing well so stop being stingy and hire more wait staff. They never brought out Jessie B.'s hot tea, but it was on the final check. She did take it off, but that is carelessness and lack of service at its best.I'd come back for the food if in the area again, but I wouldn't rush off to drag people here from the other side of town.Finally made it to an Archi Thai location!We started off with the Thai Iced Tea ($3.95). Good flavor tea here...a bit stronger than most. Large portion...not sure about refills, since I did not need one personally.  Yum!Thai Beef Salad ($10.95): Grilled Top Sirloin, Tomatoes, Red Onion, Green Onion, Cucumber, Cilantro, Romaine Lettuce, & Spicy Lime Dressing. The citrus flavor was not very strong in this dish...the beef was tender and flavorful though.  As far as Thai Beef Salads go, it was a bit disappointing.Pad Kea Mow ($9.95): Rice Noodles with Egg, Garlic, Chili, Bell Peppers, Onion, Bamboo, Mushroom, Green Beans, Basil & Thai Soy. This was very good, with a good heat behind my request. The pork was tender and delicious as well...recommended!With so many Thai choices in town, I can't say I will be back again anytime soon...but it is a solid choice for good thai food if you are in the area.I've been to all the Archi Thai location's. The food is consistently the same great quality regardless of location. He had the Po Tak soup and Chicken Pad Thai, and I had the Chicken Panang Curry sauce with extra veggies, which comes with white rice. These are choices I was very familiar with. We both enjoyed our meal.They add spices according to your liking and tolerance level. I like my food a little spicy - but not hot. A three is perfect for me in the summer and a four in the winter. I enjoy their Jasmine hot tea, the excellent service, clean restaurant, and atmosphere.
The Carmel Room=Yummy, yum, yum for my tummy, tum, tum!My hubby surprised me with a nice dinner out at the Carmel Room as an "I Love You" present.  Ahhhh, so sweet!  It was especially nice because this was the first dinner at a non-family friendly joint we have been to since my daughter was born over 2 years ago!  Oh how I have missed steakhouse steaks!We popped into the Carmel Room because it is close to grandma's (aka the babysitter) house.  It was also a good choice for us because it is off of the Strip.  Restaurants off of the Strip are so much easier because of the parking, shorter walking distance, less crowds, and better prices.  The Carmel Room is a steak house and we racked up quite a bill, but it was still less than it would have been at one of the trendy places on the Strip.  I like the Strip places too, but it is so much easier to not go down there these days.We walked up to the maitre 'd and were greeted so warmly.  He was so funny and just started us off on the right foot.  We were seated at a super comfy table and were automatically welcomed by our servers.  All of those guys were so friendly and had us laughing and enjoying ourselves right away.  All through the meal we had fun and happy people around us, as well as crazy good service.  It is so nice to have nice people and amazing service when you are out.  It really makes the meal, in my opinion!The interior was very pretty and comfortable.  They had regular dining areas, as well as private areas all around.  It wasn't too crowded, which was nice because who wants to listen to other people when you are on a romantic date?  It was a very nice restaurant to sit back and enjoy a great dinner.  My only thing I would rate on the negative side was the sound level.  It was nice and quiet for the most part until the lounge act went on at a neighboring bar.  When they got on, it got really loud with bar band music.  It wasn't horrible, but I could have done without it in a steakhouse setting. For dinner, we had crab cakes for an appetizer, 16oz boneless rib eyes with sautéed wild mushrooms and herb butter, truffle mac n' cheese, garlic mashed potatoes, and we finished it off with a Grand Marnier soufflé. Everything was fantastic!  The crab cakes were full of big hunks of crab and served with a very tasty sauce.   Both of the steaks (we are boring and ordered the same thing) were super tender, and melt in your mouth tasty.  The mushrooms were cooked perfectly and really added to the steak.  The herb butter bumped up the flavor another notch or 2 as well.  These were some great steaks!  The truffle mac n' cheese was good.  Not the best I have had, but pretty yummy.  The garlic mashed potatoes were very smooth and creamy.  I do wish the serving size was bigger though because I love mashed potatoes almost as much as love my kid!  I also ordered a side of Béarnaise because it is AWESOME.  The Béarnaise here has to be one of the better sauces I have had at any steakhouse in recent memory.   Oh, and the soufflé! The soufflé was absolutely delectable!  The soufflé was so light and fluffy!  Then the sauces made it even more fabulous.  The sauces were a milk chocolate sauce and a vanilla Grand Marnier sauce with some fresh whipped cream thrown in for good measure.  Everything was super flavorful but I was in love with the vanilla Grand Marnier sauce.  I could have drank the whole container of it because it was THAT GOOD!  Drool!The place does skew a little on the more mature side of things.  I know we were the youngest people in there, but we didn't mind.  Being a more mature crowd, it made us more relaxed and comfortable.  If you want a nice steak dinner without the hassle of going to the Strip, I would recommend the Carmel Room in a heart beat!
Jose Cuervo Tequileria=What to do when you get to the airport WAY early AND your flight out of Vegas is delayed at least another thirty minutes?  Duh!  Drink, silly!Since this was on my way OUT of Sin City instead of on my way IN, I was no naive sap:Me: "How much is the Mangorita?" (drink prices are ODDLY not listed on the menu)Waiter: "One Mangorita."Me: "No.  How MUCH DOES IT COST?"Waiter: "$12"Me:  "That's what I thought.  I'll have a Mangorita, please."Hey, you expected me NOT to get it? Actually, for Vegas prices, this was quite reasonable (who would have imagined that food and drinks would be CHEAPER at the airport than in the city you're visiting?).  The Mangorita surprisingly tasted like REAL and FRESH mango instead of some artificial "mango" syrup.  It was blended and slightly sweet but not syrupy and served in a pint glass. Also, the waiter claimed it had a double shot of tequila and while I couldn't taste it, I sure as hell felt it.  Woo!  Drunk plane ride!  Yay!I also ordered the chicken chimichanga.  As someone who used to fry chimis professionally in high school (yay crappy part time job!), I wanted to go back to the kitchen and give the cook a little tutorial.  The size was good, but it was undercooked on the outside (although nice and hot inside) so while the ends were crispy, the middle of the outside was kind of doughy (bleh).  I slathered on the generous portion of guacamole to hide the icky texture because, as mentioned above, the Mangorita was starting to take over my body.  It was filled with plenty of shredded chicken but also with shredded lettuce.  Um, WILTED shredded lettuce.  Bleh again.The chips tasted like they came from a bag opened yesterday instead of being made on site. The salsa tasted like it may have been made last week by my mother who considers black pepper to be "too spicy" to add to her food. Triple bleh!One last bit of super USEFUL info: this is ONLY a good option if you've got PLENTY of time before your flight.  Our meal took over an HOUR.  The waiter came over, took our drink order, disappeared for 10 minutes, came back, took our food order, disappeared for 10 minutes, came back with our drinks, disappeared for 10 minutes, came back with our water, disappeared for 10 minutes, came back with our food, said "right away" when I asked him to bring the check, disappeared for 10 minutes, brought the check, disappeared for 10 minutes, came back for the check, disappeared for 10 minutes, came back with the receipt to sign.  I have no idea if he came back to pick up the signed receipt because we didn't wait around another 10 minutes.  I found this really weird for a restaurant in an airport. We were inside the "secure area" so it's not like we just stopped by for a nice lunch.  We had a plane to catch!Server Michelle rocked it out for our group. A great way to end our Vegas seminar weekend.Good food and zesty Margaritas . . . Lovin' this.No bueno!  Unfortunately bad decisions are sometimes made when I only have 35 minutes between switching planes while tempting margaritas are staring me in the face.  Banana Margarita - There's no price on the drink menu, so my server said it was $14-$15, glad it only ended being $13.49.  The drink was good but came in a very small cup for the price.  Chips and Guacamole - At almost $11 I figured, what the hey, it's going on the company expense report and it'll be my dinner.  It's the only thing I ordered and she brought out the wrong dish.  There was a delay in getting my receipt because she put in the right order but had to make a correction.  Instead she brought me Chips and Salsa, which was $6.49.  I said, "I actually ordered Chips and Guacamole."  She says she either take that back or she can add on a small side of guacamole for $1.89.  I don't have time for all this mess so I say, "Just bring me a small side of guacamole."  Well, the guacamole on the bill showed up as $2.89.  It was tiny!  Not to mention, it wasn't fresh made, nor was it packed a few days before at some local distributor, it was the canned stuff that was like a thick soup with no chunks of avocado.  The tortilla chips were like Mission Tortilla Chips, except triangular.  I hate Mission Tortilla Chips.  If you want to stop here and get a drink, that's fine, but the food (not just my dish) seems to be lacking.  If you want to walk around with your drink, order it in a to go cup.  Las Vegas McCarran Airport is rad like that.Great food and service. Nice cold beer and tequila selection. I think its the best food to eat here at the airport :)You can't beat the location of this place in Terminal C in Las Vegas airport.  We all know that the food is barely edible, but who cares?!  It's a nice spot to have a drink or something (simple) to eat while waiting for your flight.   The waitresses/bartender  work their you-know-what's off and are so pleasant.  Yes, they get slammed and you might have to rush them along a bit, but it's fine.  It's the airport and everyone they encounter is probably hungover, tired and crabby!!! Lol Hats off to them!
Chompie's Deli=This was a tough review for me.  I wanted to give them higher marks, really I did.I went in with low expectations.  I've had Jewish food on the east coast, OK?  Things were looking good right off the bat.  We were seated and water and a tray of pickles appeared as our tushes hit the cushions.  My lovely wife picked up a pickle, crunched off a bite, gave a surprised expression and said, "Not bad.  I'll be the Jew-judge."  She is Jewish, after all.  Fair enough.  I thought the pickle was pretty good, comparable to some I've had on the east coast.That's where things started to go awry.  It took between 5-10 minutes before anyone came over to get a drink order.  We ordered several items to share.  My wife and I shared a corned beef sandwich and fries with gravy.  The kids shared matzo ball soup, blintzes and a latka.  I ordered coffee.The soup came first and it was very good and authentic.  Coffee?  "Oh, right."  My water has been sitting empty for a bit.  The rest of the food arrived pretty quickly, and my coffee arrived.  Water?  "Oh, right."The blintzes were very good, especially the cheese.  The corned beef was good, it passed muster as authentic.  Fries?  Good.  Brown gravy?  Fine, but it had an odd flavor.  Latka?  Very good.  Water?  "Oh, right.""Can I get a refill on the coffee?"  "Oh, right."The prices are high.  The sandwiches are available whole or 1/2.  $13.xx for a whole corned beef is a bit high, but it is big enough to share so that's a plus.  One sandwich and one order of fries was enough for 2 adults.   The fries were $4.xx  Coffee?  "Oh, right."  I don't appreciate having to ask for every refill 3 times.  I would probably write it off to just one server having an off day or something. In summary:  Good kosher-style food, a bit pricey.  It will hit the spot when I'm craving a corned beef sandwich.  The service was spotty.  So what may have been a 4 star review has been knocked all the way down to 3 stars.  Coffee?Not great compared to a good deli, not good when you factor in the price.It was soon after moving here from Los Angeles that I found Chompies.... being a regular patron of West Coast heavyweights such as Langers, and even Canters, I was hungry for good deli food and thrilled... at first.  Their food is "meh" at BEST and WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY overpriced for the quality.  If they charged 1/2 the price they do currently, this place would be 4-stars.. but don't come up in here trying to charge Langer's prices and serve up Schlotzsky's quality. Next.Oh Chompie's... one of my favorite Tempe finds! Chompie's is home to my favorite soup! Chicken Matzoball Soup! Delicious and onxious with awesome flavors. I have had a great time sittig outside yapping with my sister about who knows what while munching on the biggest pastrami and saurkraut sandwich EVER! This thing was HUGE! I was scared, I was elated, I was determined. I went again for dinner and had my same matzoball soup but this time I had the Chicken Schnitzel. Warm. crunchy and full of flavor I was elated. The sides were eh, I make better carrots and the potatos were okay but the gravy had an odd flavor I wasn't too fond of. I have YET to try a dessert, but someday I am going to damnit!! Oh and the pickles are yummy! :D Jussayin' The service leave MUCH to be desired for. We had to ask for everything about twice and the staff likes to play handsie in a closed section behind frosted glass. I had craptastic service both times I went. But I still hope ya'll give chomp down on some Chompie's and fall in love with it like I did!!What's the matter with Chompie's in Tempe?That's always my question and I just don't have any answer. We've eaten at this Chompie's three times and we're always disappointed. However we've eaten at other Chompie's, most often the one in Chandler, and we're stuffed and happy. I don't get it.We went with a group of Yelpers to this Chompie's because it's close to Gammage and we were all attending the opening night production of Fiddler on the Roof. So I suggested JewFood. Now, being an east coast Jew, I have certain standards which, frankly, aren't easily met in the desert. But they're not met at this Chompie's at all.I phoned at 3:00 that afternoon to give them a heads up since we were expecting twelve people (we wound up with eight - you know how Yelpers are). I gave them the count, the time and made clear that we had a time crunch, needing to be out of there by 6:00 - 6:15 at the latest. When we got there the table wasn't ready.We were seated fitteen minutes later and I told both the host and the server that we were attending the theatre and needed to eat and get going. Our food arrived at 5:45 or 5:50. I can't say for sure which it was. Had a hard time getting more pickles, I never got the lemons I asked for, sauces had to be requested repeatedly. And the food was nothing to write home to Bubbeh about. My extra lean corned beef was fatty and chewy and my daughter's patty melt, requested with extra onions came with a mere four pieces of onion. She asked for more but they didn't arrive until she was nearly done eating. I would have contested the extra charge for those onions but I had to get going or risk losing the opportunity to park in the Gammage lot. From the rumblings I heard around the table, we weren't the only disappointed diners in our party.Now I've reviewed the Chompie's in Chandler http://www.yelp.com/biz/chompies-restaurant-and-bakery-chandler and gave it five stars. So the problems clearly aren't pervasive, in my opinion. If we'd had time we would have gone to the Chompie's in Chandler or the one in Scottsdale but the Tempe location was five minutes from Gammage. Oh, well. I'll consider this my farewell address. I won't be back to the Tempe Chompie's again.If you have ever been to Katz's in NYC, Kaufman's in Chicago or Cantor's in LA you need to know right away , you will be disappointed ..this isn't that kind of Jewish Deli. Now if you haven't, this might be just fine for you. Located close to ASU I wonder if they just have given up trying to really show off how good it could be. maybe feeding the students and their out of town parents is just enough for the Chompies Family. But if they do want to attract locals to come in here are some ideas: Refill water glasses at least every 15 minutes, this is salty food; pickles, pastrami , chopped liver etc...give us some water...and if you see customers sucking on ice with an empty glass take the hint... give us a nice big bowl of pickles 4 pickles in an a 10 inch dish just looks silly...show us you care like a Jewish grandma and give us a decent amount .... When you say LEAN it means no big flabby pieces of loose fat dripping off the meat on every side. Lean would be the no visible trails of flabbiness. Do something about the fries...when the person next to you says , "they taste okay when you put gravy on them" you know they are just meh... If you are giving me fries ,make them decent ..it's not that difficult. Check on your table occasionally , taking the order and bringing the food and little else makes me wonder why we even need the waitress...I will go take the order and get the food and no need to tip me.... and I refill water glasses. Chompies has the potential to be more but who am I to tell them what to do?Chompies has the best bagels in AZ. Period.Most places under cook their bagels, and they are too doughy- like Einstein's. Chompies bagels are unmatched and very tasty, along with their cream cheese, which comes in a ton of different flavor options.Way overpriced. The pastrami sandwich was good though. It had a good flavor, but I can't justify $12.99 for a sandwich and a little cup of potato salad. Now I'm not just talking about this sandwich. The rest of the menu was overpriced as well. Even the kids menu. Items on there were up to 8 or 9 dollars.Service was ok. Seems that there are better places to spend your money than here. Like fancier places...
Aiello's=Holy canolli this place is fantastic! How have I never been here before? The set up of the restaurant is very open and they piped in old school tunes, Frank Sinatra, Harry James and Tommy Dorsey. It really reminded me of Artie Bucco's sister restaurant.   The service was excellent and the staff was friendly and hospitable.  We even heard the owner/chef yelling at the staff from the kitchen "wize this fettuccine sitting owt heaar!" it was classic. He really showed a passion for both the guests and the food.  I had read a few yelp reviews before I chose this place and I can only mirror what everyone else said. The Italian bread and focaccia with red pepper olive oil and garlic butter are amazing. The spaghetti and meatballs were to die for. The meatballs LITERALLY melt in your mouth. I want to go back and try everything on the menu.  Spoiler Alert  - After the meal the owner came to our table and asked us to guess a number between 1 and 99, you get the number and dinner is free. We didn't win but it was a fun game and a nice way to end the meal. I will be back - I am anxious to try lunch and the pizzas they are selling out the back!
Pho Avina=I'm always really hesitant to review places that are literally across the street from ASU West (where I take classes and work) because I worry that my opinion of the business is skewed by its convenience, but to hell with parliamentary procedure, I've got to russle up some FUC's!At the computer lab at West we have a whole drawer of our office dedicated to take out menus. It is as expansive as it is useless, because the answer is always "something Asian". The only times we've ever used one of the many pizza menus we have is when our bosses offer to buy us lunch, because we fear letting them know what food we really like will give them some sort of power over us. So yesterday John S (who is Clarice's boyfriend but was my +1 for the yelp event, what's with that?) and I were doing our usual lunchtime shuffle, passing around menus for Chen Wok and Fu-Sing Garden. We came across a menu for Pho Avina. We initially saw the word "pho" and collectively agreed that Pholicious sounded like a brilliant idea, but we were looking for takeout and the staff at Pholicious is so awesome to me on a regular basis that I'd hate to dis them by walking in, giving them an order, and then loitering outside while they made it for me. Thankfully, John solved my culinary quandary by mentioning that he really liked the boba at Pho Avina. The last time I had boba I liked was at a Quickly! in the bay almost two years ago. The Lollicup near my house, which was promoting itself as if it's shit didn't stink but had weird, unpredictable hours and always managed to be "out" of boba whenever I was really craving it. So Pho Avina it was.Ordering was only a minor travesty. The restaurant is so tiny and compact that the only place to put their register/takeout counter is right next to the path of the servers, so in the couple of minutes it took us to place our order we managed to obstruct every other employee working there. Thankfully, despite the complaints of my fellow yelper girls, I wear heels about 90 percent of the time, which makes me I'm easy to spot and never surprise someone turning a corner. If they run into me it's because they're jerks and want to see if I'll say "excuse me" and give away my gender. Puny non-yelpers. The mighty Jetta is not fooled by your nonsense.We spent the fifteen minute waiting period out and about the strip mall, reading The New Times and visiting the nearby gaming store which I'm going to yelp anyway despite not buying anything. 15 minutes isn't a bad waiting time for egg noodle soup and boba. I've waited longer for a cheezburger and shake. Oh jesus, did I just spell "cheeseburger" with a z? I know I should correct it, but I feel compelled to leave it there. the internet has permanently fucked my cognitive language skills. I ordered the #41 (egg noodle, shrimp, crab, calamari) and a coconut boba. John ordered the old school "beef and rice noodle" pho and a taro boba which he could not describe the flavor of and whenever asked how it was or how it tasted kept thrusting it in my face and telling me to try some. The sense of urgency in his voice didn't compel me to want to take that leap.The takeout arrangement was both clever, convenient, and troublesome. In our bag were two styrofoam cups of soup, little baggies of warm noodles, and a ziploc of cilantro, sprouts, peppers, and limes. While this made taking our lunch back to the office quick and easy, it did cause some problems in unloading its contents. The noodles, while still warm, were beginning to stick to each other and solidify, which made stuffing it in the cup of broth rather difficult, especially when the noodles didn't separate once submerged. The portions of noodles were relatively small, and I ended up having to put in handfuls of sprouts just to adequately fill the cup, which itself was modest at best. I know I would've gotten more if we had ordered dine-in. I don't mean to sound like another one of those portion-obsessed Americans, but with work and school and Aramark's price-gouging at our cafeteria, my lunch has to hold me over for the whole day. And this didn't work out for me.The food (what little of it was there), was actually quite tasty. The squid was chewy, the crab meat tasted real, and the two shrimp that were in there were pretty massive. The broth was hands down the best part. I could drink a whole bowl of that shit. But won't. Because too much sodium is never fun.I realized waaaaaay after the fact that what we had ordered was not in fact boba milk tea but in fact "snow bubble milk tea" (i.e. frozen boba). The pearls were frozen solid and hard to chew and more than one my straw did the "McDonald's Choke" where the contents became so cold they would not submit to the vacuum I was creating. Eventually I just let it sit on my desk for a half hour where it melted and was then delicious.[Joke about how lesbians aren't as good at sucking things as other people has been omitted. Yay self-censoring!]Ok so Its time to light Pho Avina's facking ass on fire.  I remember going here when just the old lady ran the joint.  She was top notch, the food was good, she cranked out one hell of an avocado boba.  Those were the days party people, those were the days.Now let me compound things a bit.  I am talking tons of shit to my co workers about how I love vietnamese food and that you just cant get a good nuoc mia ninh kieu in Phoenix (obviously trying to be a food badass, cuz I am) and Pho Avina goes and sucker kicks my shit in the ballz.For the record I ordered easy.  I went ZERO pho as it was 142 outside.  I went BBQ Pork bahn mi, spring rolls, bobas.I GOT SOME MOTHERFACKINGSHITTASTICAMERICANIZEDBOOLSHEEET.I say again, BOOOOOOOLSHEEEEEEET.Bahn MiRotten brown HALLOPEENOHS, check.Funky ass pork, chiggitty check y'all.MotherFACKINGCHUNKS of veggies, microphone check y'all.  How do you fuck up a bahn mi?Spring Rollsrotten lettuce, uhhh huhhhhcrispy rice wrapper, you bet your assBobaGot FACKING syrup?Let me tell you this vietnamese food experience went over like a turd in a punch bowl with my co workers.  Who now have undisputed proof that I am a dip shit and to not listen to me.  Based on this one Pho Avina experience.  My co workers have shunned me.Pho Avina just got put on notice.  I used to eat there because I thought it was a cool little AUTHENTIC vietnamese joint.  I dont go in for mass consumption shit.The only good thing about Pho Avina is the fact that it's clean. Besides that everything falls a bit short; in terms of service and food.Came in looking for a new Vietnamese spot to try and to curb our Vietnamese cuisine and boba/snow craving.The restaurant is clean and spacious, not too many people were dining at the time of arrival but quickly filled up. I ordered the Clear Rice Noodles with soup on the side (Hu Tieu Saigon). It's a noodle dish that comes with bean sprouts, onions, clear rice noodles, slices of bbq pork, pieces of imitation crab, shrimp and chives. The noodles are tossed in a sweet soy and comes with a side of broth (chicken). The dish was lacking in flavor and portion. Even with chili sauce and a spritz of lemon, the dish was lackluster and just had a sweetness to it. It was 35% onion and bean sprouts. Totally not a satisfying nor did it taste close to what Hu Tieu Saigon should taste like. We were given a plate of veggies and the cilantro was wilted and the plate looked limp as if sitting out for past it's prime.The service was a bit spotty, it was good at first and kind of awkward. A few customers ended up leaving because they weren't being helped though there was a good amount of staff available. At this point I didn't order boba/snow dessert because I didn't think the food or service was good.Price is decent if you're looking for a mediocre bowl of noodles and slow service, but you can get better quality Vietnamese food elsewhere. The only thing going for this place is it's clean atmosphere.This place is my best friend favorite place.. I was kind of ehhhh about it because I know where good vietnamese food is at. Haha. Anyways good vegetarian options for me. Yes. Score. Very helpful and very accommodating. Their vegetarian vermicelli was wonderful but next time I have to tell them easy on the garlic. Overall everything went smoothly :)
New China Cuisine=This place just isn't the same. I've been eating here for a while and keep noticing the decline with each visit. When I walked in it took forever to get seated and the smell was really bad inside. It smelled like rotten eggs so they might have some pipes that need a checking. I did have 6 people at my table but there were no other customers so waiting just over a hour for our food was beyond ridiculous! The egg drop soup was a gloppy mess and my beef dish was tough with a terrible flavor. I have ordered this dish many times and just isn't what it once was. hen the bill came our server assumed we needed split checks after I specifically told her that I was paying for our party and she made it very confusing and awkward for the myself and the others at my table. I questioned coming back since the experience here wasn't what it once was ans then I saw a ROACH running across the floor and knew I'd never be back again.My family and friends have been getting together for a few years here to grub. That will be happening no longer. The last 3 visits were terrible and the last visit specifically was not good. I'm sad about this because I really loved the food before, but now it's just not consistent. On this last visit we were the only customers in the restaurant yet it still took over an hour to receive our food and the food came out staggered. My niece only wanted Egg Drop Soup and they totally forgot to bring it to her and only did so after asking a 3rd time about it. When she finally got her soup it was like a bowl of gloppy gel. I loved the soup here before, so I have no idea what has happened, but it wasn't even edible. What I loved ordering here most, Strawberry Chicken, tasted awful. One thing that wasn't easy to ignore was the nasty smell inside. It smelled so badly of like sewage or something. Then at the end of the meal we noticed roaches on the floor! OMG I was so ready to leave. Drinks come in cans and refills aren't free. After loving this place for so long it's a major disappointment to see New China Cuisine go so downhill.
Sala Thai=I found a good one!Thanks to the reviews from Josh and Megan, I remembered Sala Thai Restaurant when I was craving thai food for dinner last night.  I wanted to try something new and it worked out well because Sala is located not too far from REI where I was headed to do some holiday shopping.  Sala provided me with a pleasantly full belly and fueled me for my shopping.When I pulled into the parking lot, Sala was easy to see thanks to the fact that their lighting inside is extremely bright.  They are located next door to a martial arts studio and I could hear the people over there doing their thing a couple of times during my dinner... not necessarily distracting, but enough to make other yelpers aware of!A friendly thai woman welcomed me when I walked in and told me to sit down where ever I wanted... I took note of her authentic fuschia thai outfit and was pleased with the fact that she followed me over to clean the table thoroughly before I sat down.  As I waited, I took note of some of the thai artwork on the walls and some letters from children - thanking the people at Sala for a 'cultural experience.'  I assumed from this that Sala had hosted some kind of dinner for elementary students and their families; very cool.The menu is extensive and I had a hard time deciding what to order... everything looked really good!  There were several items that I had never seen on a thai menu before such as several entrees with pumpkin and a thai omelet.  That is the problem with dining solo at a thai restaurant - you don't get to share and try different dishes.  I enjoyed looking at the menu and the pictures of select dishes as well.  Please note - Sala Thai does not serve alcohol.  They do offer fresh fruit thai mocktails and thai iced coffee and tea.  After much debate, I went with #10 to start - Thai Salad with Peanut Sauce and #84 - Spicy Eggplant with Shrimp.  I was really happy with the salad; It tasted fresh and included lettuce, tomato, cucumber, carrots, onions, and red peppers.  The peanut Sauce was served on the side and it was sweet, creamy, and the perfect sauce to compliment the salad.  I ordered the Eggplant with 'medium' spice.  This was plenty!  I tend to like spice, but next time I may even order mild-medium.  I was happy they served me plenty of white rice to balance the spice of the dish...Serving sizes were generous and I had leftovers to take home.  I cannot wait to return and try some of the other menu items as well.  This is the perfect place to go on a weeknight if you're in the mood for a casual thai dinner.  Next time, however, I'm bringing friends!A great neighborhood restaurant with quality food, nice atmosphere, and no attitude.  I love to support independent, non-chain restaurants and when Sala Thai opened up in my neighborhood, I was very excited.  I've eaten there over 10 times so far.It's a great place to introduce Thai food "newbies" because the food is great and the menu has lots of photos of the entrees.No complaints about the food.  And reasonably priced too.Appetizers worth sampling:  spring rolls, chicken satay, and tofuEntrees worth trying:  pad thai, pad see-u, curry dishesI saw a complaint here about the time it took to receive their food.  The restaurant features a glass wall looking into the kitchen.  They make all of their entrees to order; that's why it takes longer.  I will gladly wait another 10 minutes knowing I'm getting freshly prepared food.One final note:  the restaurant is getting popular so watch out for a full restaurant during on-peak hours.  Dinner service starts at 5pm and I've seen it fill up by 5:30pm on weekends.If you're going to Sala Thai on a Sunday and meeting other people you would do well to remember that there is light traffic on Sunday and you will get here early.  If you get here early, there is a Big Lots down the street where you can spend a few minutes soaking up an almost permeable seedy feeling.  Or not.  I would opt for not.  Or you can do what our dinner partners did and visit a dive bar for a drink.  It's just as well because Sala Thai does not serve alcohol.  I'm looking forward to the review on that one, Christine.  No pressure.I was excited to try Sala Thai after seeing numerous strong reviews.  Overall, they did not disappoint.We started with pork satay.  We had not seen satay offered in pork.  This was the least satisfying of the selections we had.  The pork was a little chewy and the yellow curry just didn't seem to go well with the pork.We all shared four entrees.  We had spicy basil fried rice which was delightful and probably my favorite item overall.  I am hoping to have that again soon.  It had a nice balance of spice and fresh basil that was refreshing.  The catfish with panang curry was very nice.  It was the largest catfish fillet I have seen, cooked quickly so as to sear it lightly and some crispiness on the outside while remaining moist and tender inside.  It was heavily sauced and we ordered 4 out of 5 on the spiciness scale.  I think everyone at the table fought off a reflexive sneeze with the first bite of that one.  I would like to see how hot the 5 is, but keep in mind the 4 is pretty hot.We also had pad thai which for me is a bit of a benchmark dish.  Sala Thai's was unique and very good.  Not overly sweet and with just the faintest hint of smokiness in the pepper flavor, rather complex for pad thai.  Rounding out the tour de Sala Thai was a duck curry with coconut milk, red chili paste, pineapple, basil, tomato and onion.  I'm not a fan of duck but this was very good.  I had several pieces of the duck and plenty of the sauce ladled over my steamed rice.I recommend Sala Thai.  The sauces were so flavorful that Myles M and I mortified Christine O and Audrey W by licking clean every serving dish on the table.  Not really, but it was close.Another 3.5-er.  I'll make this quick since football's on:~ Basil fried rice - great~ Spring rolls - average~ Papaya salad - great~ Red curry chicken - good~ Chicken tom yum soup - good ~ Drunken noodles with beef - great~ Mocktails: we had one of each - mango, banana and pineapple banana.  The mango was the best.  There's no alcohol at this establishment, btw.  What good is a restaurant w/o alcohol?!
Mango's Mexican Cafe=I bet you suburbanites of "America's most boring city" love paying top dollar to get just decent Mexican food. When it comes to my search for great Mexican food, I just can't catch a break outside of the barrio. I ordered the Killer Burrito. Beef, beans, guac, and sour cream. Possibly a bit of cheese. The tortillas are made fresh from scratch, and taste amazing. Their beef tastes exactly like it would from someone's home. The salsa was nothing to get excited over, but the fresh, hot chips were great.So you're probably wondering why I gave this two stars?The prices are a joke! If you don't believe me, laugh at this:Any plain burrito (carne asada, chicken, etc.) is $6, but if you don't like yours plain, it'll cost ya.The horchata costs $2.75, and it's the fountain drink horchata, NOT the real stuff.A quesadilla with carne asada, sour cream, and guac comes out to $11.00. Yeah, I made that face, too.My burrito was $7.50. No, portions are NOT huge, they're the same as every other place. So in reality you're paying up to *double* the price for your meal (just think of that quesadilla!), and you're certainly not getting the quality to match. But does Mesa really have an alternative?
Thai Hut=When Rickie mentioned going to the Thai Hut, I thought, that's funny, I'm really not in the market for neckwear. Then we drove by and it looked so cute. Like a Thai diner with lots of booths lining the windows which overlook McDowell around 3rd Ave. Obviously not a lot of money or design when into the reincarnation, but the energy of the room and the super friendly staff warmed me instantly. I swear the server telepathically took our app order as the spring rolls arrived to the table, hot and crispy, before I had even squeezed the lemon in my water. Along with the chicken satay, they were both good, not out of this world however. Rickie's "chicken noodle" soup was flavorful, yet the chicken was hella funky. Oddly shaped bland, poached peices of poultry particularly unpleasant. The sizzling beef was Thairiffic. Really. Thairiffic. My obligatory phad thai, although missing the tofu, was very dee lish. Prices were affordable. No beer however and that made me sad. I mean I was just costume shopping at Easley's and really could have used a large Thai cerveza. Rickie loved his Thai iced tea (me? not a fan of that beverage...sort of tastes like lawn clippings and cream). The service is outstanding...attentive, friendly and efficient. That pushes them from 3 to 4 stars easily. Great energy, good food, smiling staff. I'll be back.OMG - another great Thai find in Phoenix!Thanks to the other Yelp reviews, I've been wanting to try 'Thai Hut' for the last few weeks.  So, when Liz M. and I were deciding where to meet for dinner, I suggested it... I think we were both pretty impressed!It's centrally located right at 1st street and McDowell and the cutest little diner with amazing service and delicious food... The menu has a variety of options to choose from with lighter fare (fresh rolls, soups, and salads) to more traditional Thai fare (curry dishes, noodle dishes, fried rice, and more) and of course desserts that sound oh so good!Liz and I started with the fresh rolls (cold hand wrapped and filled with vermicelli noodles, shrimp, tofu, bean sprouts, cucumbers and green onions).  They were served with both a creamy peanut and a tangy sweet sauce for dipping.  I mixed the sauces together and savored every bite... Then we shared the pad thai and the stir fry eggplant.  Instead of adding chicken, pork, beef, shrimp, or tofu to the eggplant dish, we had them add more veggies and it was perfect!  Service was great... our waitress checked on us several times and kept my water glass full at all times.We were too full for dessert this time.  I guess that's reason enough to return... as if I needed a reason ;)****One more thing - Thai Hut offers take out - it even says on the menu that 'phone orders are welcome.'  I'm sure I'll take advantage of that sometime as well!Have you ever gotten an orgasm from peanuts?  No?  Well, I just did.Number 27.  Medium hot.  Went with Robert M & Bacon for dinner tonight and we each got a dish to share.  Started with the fried tofu.  Bland.  the sauces were watery.  Also got shrimp rolls.  Yummy.In all, we had a red curry (#26) which was good, but it seemed as if the green beans had been frozen then cooked.  Also, the #34, medium spicy.  Had a peanut taste, a little sweet.  And then: #27.  (angels singing) Now, I don't know the names of any dishes.  I always order by number.  When it came to the table, I drooled all over my white shirt.  And, well, something else in my white panties.  Amazing!Service was quick and friendly.  I love that it's RIGHT ON McDowell.  Tables face the street, which you don't get very often here in the PHX.My leftovers are in the fridge.  Since I'm single and need the *ahem* effects of #27, I'll be having it before bed.  As a snack.  To get ready for bed.  #27.  Marry me.  I'll be the first person to marry a number.I have to be honest; I found Thai Hut average at BEST. I may not be an expert, but Thai is my favorite food (I eat it at least once a week) and I recently spent 10 days in Thailand, so I have had my fair share and I certainly know a good meal when one is put in front of me... and no such thing happened here at Thai Hut. My food and my hot tea were lukewarm-bordering-on-cold, the flavor in the Tom Kah soup was minimal and completely overpowered by the chili flakes they put on the top (fist time I have ever seen that) and the yellow curry, while traditional, left a lot to be desired in both the taste and the consistency (very soupy).The service was okay, but certainly not friendly. I actually even felt uncomfortable at times.With all the other Thai places in the area (Thai Elephant, Wild Thaiger, Thai Basil) I have no reason to make it back to Thai Hut. Sowwweeee!
Yo Pauly's NY Pizza Co.=8/25Thin-crusted Whitestone Bridge pizza (garlic, ricotta, mozz, spinach, tomatoes, and olive oil) was good!  Could've been a little bit crispier, but I was happy.  Spotted their thick-sliced Sicilian pizza and mentioned to Paul that I was not a fan of thick-crusts, bec. I found them too soggy and too doughy, and he graciously offered me samples.  Thank you Paul, but I'm still not a fan of (approx. two-inch) thick pizza.Bensenhurst baked ziti was very delicious!  Penne, ricotta, house marinara, parm, and mozz.  This must-try dish came w/ garlic knots, a popular appetizer.  Perhaps these knots are better when they're fresh- I tried them re-heated (toaster oven), and they didn't do anything for me.  Will have to visit with a few friends in tow to try this dish and app fresh from the oven!Also tried a gyro sandwich.  Not bad, but for the price, I'd rather swing by Tempe's Haji-Baba's and spend a buck more (plus gas money) and get TWO wonderful gyro sandwiches.  Five tables present, but the space didn't feel inviting enough to stay and dine in.  This venue screams "take-out" loud and clear.To the owner:  Last Thursday you had a young man waiting tables who I had never seen before.  He was a bit pushy and overbearing, but I wanted to give him a chance thinking that perhaps the young man needs more to time to adapt to his new job.  This was my thinking until.........1.  He brought us our dishes and we sat there without cutlery and napkins until we got our own by taking them off other tables.  I refused to do what my husband did and brought it to the attention of one of the waitresses.  She apologized and promptly gave me my cutlery and napkins. 2.  My waiter was stroking the back of his hair, rubbing his neck.... doing this with the hands that were soon to touch my food.3.  My waiter was playing with his mouth and chin with his hands..... doing this with the hands that were soon to touch my food.  Do we see a pattern here???4.  When I asked for a take out container for my leftovers, he brought an aluminum pan and cover but made sure that his fingers were all inside the aluminum pan when he handed it to me.  I had to wipe it down with water and the scarce napkins.  Here is a clue waiters and waitress everywhere in YelpLand... DO NOT play with your body parts while you are on the job serving food to people who go out to eat for pleasure not to witness a science experiment on bacterial growth.  I was not going to Yelp about this, but the owner of Yo Pauly is a decent sort who runs a place with very good food and he needs to know what his wait staff is doing.  The food on this particular night was excellent as usual.  The service left much to be desired and the habits of this particular waiter touching himself before he served our food was disconcerting not to mention, a bit "nasty."HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!My husband and I decided to come here tonight, as he has had this pizza before at work. Big mistake.We walk in and the guy greets us and is very nice. He tells is we can sit anywhere we want, so we do. We look at the menu and wait for someone to come by to get our drink order.  Doesn't happen right away, as the guy and girl that seem to be the only 2 working, continue their conversation.A group of people come in and the girl comes out to their table and jokes about how she's the manager (I sincerely hope not!). Then she asks them what they would like to drink.Apparently, serving your regulars/friends takes priority over guests that were there first. That was our cue to leave. Not spending time and money at an establishment with such rude service.
Pho Hung Restaurant=This restaurant was opened in 2007, in the height of the Vegas boom times and housing bubble, when pricesof everything was going up and up, and money was flowing easily. Million dollar condos going up everywhere, speculators betting on housing prices getting lucky more than rolling the dice at the craps table. IThe time was like rolling 11's consecutively and parlaying your bet....the odds were long (18 - 1, but pays 15 - 1) but it just kept coming in to pay. So a great Pho restaurant owning family from the Portland area, (they own several popular ones in the Pacific northwest) decided to roll the dice in Vegas, They spared no expense in the decor. It is decorated with all high end materials, with marble-like tables, 2 large flat screens, and a lot of quality to make a very clean and pleasant restaurant. The problem is, it is too far from the Strip, out on Spring Mountain a mile from the strip at Decatur in the A&M strip mall. And that long odds 11 crapped out, the housing bubble burst, and Vegas is hurting. One of the owners was the cashier the night I went, and she was very friendly and accomodating, asking what I wanted to watch on the flat screens.  We had a nice long talk after my meal about Vietnam, Saigon back then, where her family is from, now Ho Chi Minh city under the communists now. They own a restaurant back there, called Pho 99, at 139 Duong Nguyn Trai, Phuong Ben, Thanh Quan 1, T/P Ho Chi MInh, Viet Nam. There is one in Portland called Pho Hung.I ordered my standard over the past year, Pho Tai Nam. The beef was good and the broth was, too. Plenty of fresh greens to go with it.The price was more like glitzy Vegas, not the grungy pacific northwest.Bonus: they accept credit cards, which most grungy dives do not.My friend decided to try this place out since we've been to most of the Pho places on Spring Mountain.  Pho Hung is a little bit farther away from all of the hustle and bustle.  We were here in the morning around 10ish.  The restaurant was practically empty which was not a good sign.  We should have ran out of this place right away but fools that we were, we sucked up and sat down.  Our waitress was friendly and helpful.  But that's about it.  I ordered beef stew with baguette, but they didnt have any baguette.  They didn't have time to drive to Lee's Sandwiches.  So I ordered their spicy beef noodles, our waitress said they didn't have it today.  I ended up with crab meat noodle soup per the waitress' recommendation.  We also ordered rice with grilled pork chop and eggrolls, beef noodle (pho bo), crab meat noodle (bun rieu), chicken noodle (pho ga).  The pork chop was burned and dry.  It looked like it's been around for a few days.  The eggrolls were very funky looking and orange.  My crab meat made it into little patties and deep fried.  I've never had it deep fried before and it just did not taste good.  Their beef noodle was ok.  However, it didn't make up for the rest of the order.  I have to give it 1.5 star.  This review was written per my hubby's request because I wasn't planning to write one, hence, no photos.  Maybe I should go back next time just for the photos.... yeah right!
China A GoGo=I really like this place. I am kind of weird. If I want Chinese I normally go to the buffet. This place is the only exception to that rule.Lets commence with the actual store. The location is very clean and organized. I am surprised that they have so many staff members being that is it kind of small. (maybe they have the whole family)My favorite dish here is egg fu yung! I tried it for the first time ever, and was shocked at what I had been missing out on. The use actual gravy at China A GoGo. (other places use what looks like Teriyaki sauce)Over all the fried rice was really good as well. Other places offer free egg rolls when you order so much food. In which case I do!  This particular locations doesn't. (which is whatever you know)I can't see my self giving them 5 stars yet that lack in the fried wonton area. They are very diminutive. The taste is on point, just need to work on size and crispness.2.5 STARS  In the future, this China Go Go location looks like it will be a China No Go. I left extremely disappointed.   First, I felt they overcharged me. If the pepper steak lunch special is $6.89 and a Coke is $1.50, how did it end up $9.70? But, why sweat over the small stuff? You live once. However, the big stuff was that the food wasn't good. In all honesty, the Chinese food I eat in a Feast Buffet is better.  A red flag that the quality was lacking here was when the egg drop soup was placed on my table a couple of minutes after sitting down, with the pepper steak immediately after. Please give me time to enjoy the soup. Yeah, the food came fast. But it was lacking in quality and reminded me more of fast food than a good Chinese restaurant.   In recent times I have been to several Chinese restaurants in Las Vegas. I can tell the difference in quality just from the pepper steak. The peppersteak here was lacking in the flavor and ingredients that I have been accustomed to lately in the Chinese restaurants that I have dined in. For example XO Chinese Restaurant down the road and China Wan Wan on Boulder Highway, served me pepper steak that would make me drive out of my way to have it. Here, the pepper steak was lacking flavor and pieces of it had a rubbery taste. Here, the fried rice lacked flavor where down the road XO served some of the finest fried rice that I have had in Las Vegas. And the chow mein noodles that seemed to take up over a third of the styrophone bowl was filler that lacked flavor. It was nothing like the lo mein noodles side that Chop Stix on Mark's Street in Henderson recently served me with far superior pepper steak. Even the chow mein noodles at Panda Express is far better. Finally, the Coke tasted funky and I would pour it out and complement the food with Mr Pibb.  Customer service is also lacking here. I remember the people working in the Locosee Road China Go Go being personable. And the people working in the Alicante Parkway and the Windmill Parkway China Go Go's were nicer workers serving better food.  In the future this China Go Go is a China No Go for at least a year.  There are far better Chinese restaurants and better China Go Go's for me to spend my hard earned money.ROACH IN FOOD....If I could, I would give this place negative stars. My fiancée was craving Chinese food so we decided to go here since it is close.. We ordered in the store and got it to go. When we got home we were serving the food on plates and saw a roach in the fried rice. My daughter was already eating it, so I made sure she spit it out. We packed the food, and went back to the restaurant. When we got there we told the manager and they offered to make the food again, but as you may understand, we didn't want to eat there. They told us that has never happened before, unfortunately we won't be going back. Heads up!
McCormick & Schmick's=We enjoyed Christmas dinner here this year.  Not many restaurants are open, so we were excited to be able to dine here.  First off, McCormick & Schmick is not at all what I thought it was.  I thought it was an uber cool, high end fine dining experience.  In reality, it's merely a 1/2 step above Red Lobster.  When we arrived, the lobby was jammed packed.  We were seated approximately 30 minutes after our reservation time.We were lead to a table smack dab in the middle of a high traffic area.  We protested.  BJ always requests a romantic booth for two.  So after standing in the middle of the restaurant ackwardly for 5 or so minutes, we were finally taken to such a table.    Service was friendly from Val.  BJ got a Sierra Nevade brew and I ordered a festive beverage from the cocktail menu.  My Poinsettia was sweet beyond belief and tasted sort of like perfume.  We shared a chopped salad which was fairly good.  We also shared a crab tower, which was nice.  But we have had a similiar type appetizer at Bahama Breeze that is SO much better.BJ wanted to be different, so he had mussels and the clam steamer for his meal.  He liked his choice and said it was okay.  I wanted to be different, too.  So, I had the lump crab cake with southewest jicama slaw and poblano cream.  I was quite put off with the appearance of my dish.  I didn't care much for the brightly color cream slopped on my plate and the slaw was down right nasty.  The crab cake was alright.For dessert, we pondered our choices.  Nothing sounded very special, but our server was all about the carrot cake.  Surprisingly, it was the best part of our meal.
Black Forest Mill=Oh bejesus, I have some stories from this place! This place is strange, crazy, oh so many things...I confess I have never eaten here except beer cheese which I think was good(too drunk to remember). Most of the time I get drunken blitzed crazy here, dance my a$$ off, and leave my credit card at the bar...This place has changed pretty dramatically since when I first started going. They used to have some good live funk cover band on Saturdays, then they switched to a not so good funk cover band, and now its some crazy techno raver freaky shi...Hmm I just don't think I like it as much anymore, I can't get down like that til 4 am anymore. The bartenders I used to love are gone and now there is Scottsdale snob boob job chick, dumb-as-rocks frat bro, and weird ambiguous raver boytoy behind the bar. Last time, Raver boytoy had jeans torn all the way up his a$$ and then changed after an hour to black patent booty shorts, freAKY-DI bondage shirt, and heavy black eyeliner. To say the least I was beside myself with laughter, but I knew I had to get out of there, everyone started morphing into Fear and Loathing-type creatures.....Ok but here's the rundown: great German beers served up in awesomely large glasses if you prefer and decent alcohol selection, large dance floor, good music occasionally, really great owner and wife team....PS if you take someone special back in the pitch-black mysterious tables of the restaurant area, there is this red exit light shining like a beacon, pull the curtains around your table, lay back into each other, savor this moment of absolute zen and completely let go....you just might just discover who you really are...Saturday night and I was going to turn in early (well, early for me), but this was on the way home and I'd never been so my friends easily convinced me.  I never realized this place was so hoppin' at night.  Actually, I never really noticed this place at all.  There were a lot of hipster types and people with great personal style.  It was very hard to differentiate between the gay guys and the straight guys.  Usually, the straight guys don't know how to dress so it's easy to tell them apart, no offense straight guys.  Can you tell that I really enjoy it when people express themselves through their clothes?  Plus, it made for a fun game with my two gay companions.  There was a cute guy at the end of the bar and I just couldn't figure out who he'd be into more.  I decided to go find out, but as I approached him I notice he had one of those rings in his nose like a bull would have.  Maybe this is wrong, but that freaked me out and my internal voice screamed abort, abort!  It's sad how something so trivial can be a deal breaker.  I'm just not into anything that hangs out with snot.    Anyway, the place is split into sections with a bar on one side and a dance floor on the other.  The bar is against one wall and there is a flat screen streaming live video of the dance floor.  The bartenders were really great, and might I add partially naked.  I like a little eye candy with my vodka.  It was also pretty cheap compared to what I'm used to paying for Kettle One.  It was about $6 instead of $10.  It was a weird combination of neighborhood bar meets Scottsdale dance club.  I spent most of the night in the bar, but did find myself dancing to a few songs.  While surrounded by gyrating green laser beams, I spotted Mr. Nose Ring and decided that he would probably not be into me based on the way he was dancing.  I really need to stop making assumptions about people.  There could be a straight man out there who both knows how to dress and how to dance.  I hear they also have live bands.  I'm not sure what vibe this place gave me, but it was different than my usual scene and I liked that.  It had sort of an underground, Euro hip, 1960's parent's basement, sneakers with dresses, member's only jacket, ambiguous looking males, 90's rave, and Cheers feel all combined into one.  Does that help paint a picture?  Did that even make sense?
Claddagh Irish Pub=I  recently visited Claddagh Irish Pub in Middleton's Greenway Station for a happy hour-munchies thing after work with a pal. We had beer, shared an order of the corned beef and cabbage rolls, and split a "Paddy Mac" sandwich, which is essentially a Reuben. The food was quite good. I especially enjoyed the corned beef and cabbage rolls, which when I went, were similar to a fried wonton that had the fixings of St. Patrick's Day dinner inside. Sort of like an Irish egg roll. Yum. The Reuben was average, but the fries were pretty tasty as well. Service was unremarkable in either a good or a bad way. All said and done, I would usually rank that sort of experience as four stars. Normally, I would definitely return to a restaurant that showed me a good time and had good food. Why then, you ask, is this a one star review? Let me explain.I take major (MAJOR) issue with Claddagh's use of the words "gluten friendly" to describe certain menu items. (Menu items that are often served with bread.)  I presume this was done in an effort to appeal to the now-popular dietary trend of avoiding gluten. The problem with this, Claddagh, is that "gluten friendly" is not a thing. If someone can't eat gluten, then they can't eat gluten. Period. Full stop. Claddagh's use of the term "gluten friendly"  to describe foods that still contain gluten, would be like if JIF Peanut Butter made a new type of peanut butter that was 50% peanuts and 50% almonds...and then tried to market the new product as "Peanut Allergy Friendly". Does that make sense? Although I personally find  vague claims of "gluten intolerance" dubious, especially when the person has never had a problem eating gluten before, there are definitely people with a **medical diagnosis** of Celiac's disease who absolutely, under no circumstances, can consume gluten. I feel that Claddagh's attempt at marketing its menu to appeal to the "gluten-free" dietary trend could harm people who actually need to avoid gluten for important medical reasons. Even if it's not a life or death situation, people who wish to avoid gluten should be allowed to do so without having to jump through hoops and worry about being tricked by menus. It's majorly unethical to twist words to imply that a thing is something that it's not. This is especially true when the item in question (food) has the potential to directly impact a person's health. Claddagh: fix your menu. If you want to offer gluten-free options, then please do so. However, referring to a spinach-artichoke dip appetizer served with crostini or to a hamburger served on a wheat bun , or even to your fish fry, which is battered in flour as "gluten friendly", is unethical. People have a right to know what's in their food, and this feels like a deliberate attempt to mislead people in the name of making more money.
Aunt Chilada's Tempe=I ate here as part of a work function.  They have amazing chips and salsa.  That was probably the best part of my meal.  I love Mexican food and could eat it literally every day - but I found this to be a very very Americanized version of Mexican food.  It was "Eh" - not bad, not great...just "Eh".The best part of the meal were the chips, they were delicious and the salsa was amazing.  I like spicy food and the salsa delivered - but everything else was so mild and just forgetable. There were a lot of us in the group and our food kept coming out in waves.  The first batch of people served started eating and were more than half way done their meal by the time the third wave was served.  I believe our large group plus the large number of diners that were already there very likely overwhelmed the kitchen staff.  We had a reservation, perhaps they could have scheduled a few more people.  The server herself was good, she was on the spot with drinks, refills and more chips.  I don't know how much the bill was because the check was picked up by my boss, but if I were paying for dinner, I don't know that I would come back here if other options were available.
Jun's Korean Restaurant=Came in before catching a plane back home. I got the impression this is family run BC there's pictures of the kids at the front counter - it's always great to support local small businesses.I sat at a table and the waitress/ owner took my order. I selected the Kalbi combo at $10.95 The meal included steam rice, banchan and salad. Plenty of food to fill up and was totally satisfied with the quality of the beef ribs, sides and banchan. Jun's house reminds me of a fast food joint but offers authentic Korean food at reasonable prices. I'll be returning here again for sure..I never thought of Bulgogi until one of my dinner guest said my beef skewers reminded her of Bulgogi. I vaguely heard of it, but never actually tried it. I don't know why I've never experienced Korean food and I'm not saying one visit to this fast food Korean joint qualifies me as any kind of authority on it, but I do know what tastes good and what I like.I liked the Bulgogi at Juns. Despite a gentle snub from an actual Korean about Jun's being "fast food", we decided to give it a try anyways. I attribute that to Mel C's review (thanks, Mel!)The Bulgogi plate was generous with rice, a fresh salad with a light asian love-you-long-time type of dressing, and thinly sliced, tender, flavorful, marinated beef stir fried with onions. I ate all the meat and enjoyed it. My only wish was that it could have had more of a carmelized sear to it. That would have made it perfect.The other dish ordered was the Bi Bim Bop...fun to say, but another dish that was new to us. Rice topped with veges, like shredded napa cabbage tossed in sesame oil, stir fried meat with mushrooms, and topped with a sunny side egg, the yolk begging to be broken. We enjoyed that as well.I know this may seem like going to Panda Express for Chinese food, but when it's good, it's good. My new quest will now be to find the best Bulgogi. Thank you Jun's for opening my Asian eyes (lol) to Korean food, and thank you for the wonderful service. The whitey I was with...aka my wife, is a bit high maintenance and knew even less about Korean food than I did. Our very nice server took the time to explain everything to her. This will be a nice weeknight quickie spot for us.
Benihana=08/18 and 08/19Came to check out Benihana's happy hour and sat at the bar.  One bartender was more eager than the other to answer my questions regarding my food issues, but both were gracious and friendly.  I wondered if they split the tips evenly?Tried a few plates...  Some were 50% off, and some were slightly reduced.  The menu pricing was a little confusing, and I hope that this is corrected in the near future.The seaweed salad was OK.  Don't know if I would pay the full price of $3.75, though.  (And for 50%, or was it $3?, I don't think it was worth that, either.)  The gyoza was also just OK- a bit on the bland side and a bit lacking on the mouth-feel aspect.  The asparagus tempura plate was a nice surprise; However, the greasiness got to me, and in the end, I was stripping the batter off of the spears more due to necessity, and not w/ the sadness I normally would be feeling from having to trim off delightful cruchiness, bec. otherwise I couldn't enjoy the meal knowing I'd ingested all of that excess oil!  The tuna sashimi was very good and substantial, compared to all of the "light" apps that I tasted before it.  The spicy yellowtail was also very nice, although the jalapenos were a bit too much, so I just scooped them off to the side.  Really liked the acidic component of this dish!  With all the HH reductions, I wasn't thrilled w/ this meal, but at least I know which to revisit and which to pass next time.Lunch was also a bit disappointing.  Both lunch boat and duet came w/ many components, but Mom and I only truly enjoyed the salad, the chicken (it was good, although I couldn't eat much of it), the salmon sashimi, and the runaway hit, beef julienne (both off of the boat).  Since these came, for the most part, in two-bite portions, we didn't feel like we received our money's worth.  Looking back, I know we won't be returning any time soon.
Iron Rail Café=When I dine in the Iron Rail, I am on the right track to value. The Iron Rail is the Railroad Pass' s draw to get motorists off US 93/95 into the casino. Flashing signs advertise too good to believe restaurant specials. There is a $7.95 prime rib special and $1 strawberry short cakes. That is the tip of the iceberg of restaurant specials.  In my case, Railroad Pass lured me into the Iron Rail from the River Mountains Loop Trail. I try to support business parking lots that I use as trailheads. After three post-hike dinners here, I am a fan. My meal of choice has been the $6.95 spaghetti with meatballs (not meat sauce). The portion is generous. Unlike the Grand Cafe,  filler garlic bread is nonexistent. Also unlike many of the cafes, the meal includes soup or salad. The chicken noodle soup has been delicious. The cola is not flat. After the end of the meal, I usually drink a cup of coffee.  The coffee may not be Starbucks, but it is good. All this food and beverage comes to approximately $11 before the tip. The Iron Rail reminds me of a small diner staffed by friendly people. On all my visits here, they made me feel welcome. With a smile, they give me a choice of a booth, table, or counter. I choose a booth. Service is with a smile, but could be slow. After a day of hiking, I prefer not to be rushed. The ironic thing about this is that I am supporting MGM International Resorts instead of a small business. When I exit the Iron Rail, I leave with the feeling that I was on the right track for a good meal at the right price. The Iron Rail will be a cafe that I will return to.The Yelp Challenge.  Review 43 of 100.
Valley Pizza Downtown=If you are a fan of the Bikini, this is probably the best thing that has ever happened to you. They will deliver. Right to Bikini. You can drink your $4 pitcher of hooch whilst scarfing down some deliciousness!I happened to cruise by here on my bitchin bike on my way to Bikini this Saturday to support the Grand Avenue Festival. I was litterally brought to tears at the convenience of this location.After imbibing for a while I walked back over to find the coolest, sweetest group of people. The owner was the order taker, and it is obvious how passionate she is about her business.We ended up with the garlic bread, a cheese pizza, a Philly Cheese steak and a veggie sub for $23. How this is possible, I do not know.UN  FREAKING  BELIEVABLEMan was this food good! Seriously! The cheese on the veggie sub was so tasty and the crust was scrumptious. I was also stoked to hear that they were considering putting in an extra oven to make gluten free pizza and were also considering vegan cheese! They even asked what a good brand was!A+ Customer ServiceA+ LocationA+ PricesA+ FoodHellllssss yeah! #NewFavoritePlace(PS - the review from Michael S was from the previous pizza place. This was closed, someone new bought it, redid everything and this is a brand new place)Ok, first off, I'm sure Michael S is a perfectly reasonable and accurate Yelper but the one star review he wrote below/above is from a different owner before it closed down and reopened with new ownership/management. So please don't judge them by that review. First: the location. It's located near my home where no other pizza shops dare open shop. Yes!It's just across the street from the Bikini. Can you hear the angels singing? Second: been there twice now. First time had pizza crust (for vegan-ness) and fries and a bite of the veggie sub. All superb. Today my boy Richard Z had the Monsoon, which they're soon to be famous for (it looked amazing) and I had the vegan version of their veggie sub, which was outstanding. Really, really good.  They're super nice people. Charming little place. Place to sit outside and watch the culture. They'll walk your food over to the bikini. Open til 9 on weeknights and 11 on weekends. LOVE THIS PLACE! So happy it's in my hood.So, this is my first review, and I've already got writer's block.  Im sitting here trying to think of witty and insightful things to say, but all I can come up with is "This place is super freakin good."  I live right around the corner, so my favorite part is the short drunk stumble I can embark on from my crib or Bikini Lounge, which I also spend an unreasonable amount of time at. (Bikini review almost certain to follow).  Since proximity is crucial to my lazy ass, no points deducted yet.  The second obstacle became apparent the first time I walked in, rockin a Cleveland Cavs shirt, which the owner who's from Detroit immediately began to hate on.  You see Cleveland and Detroit are in a constant heated battle for America's most ridiculed city, and we take it very seriously.  After a quick shit talking show, I realized how nice of a guy he actually was, and decided that I liked a little civic-pride in my food-obtaining.  It's a small joint, so there's usually two-max-three people in there and they make you feel like you walked in to their own homes for a nice meal.  Friendly, personable, and happy to see you.  Still at 5 stars.  Food: Pizza, sandwiches, salads, very basic.Delicious.  All of it.  I've had pretty much everything available, and it's all tasted outstanding.  Not often do you walk in to a small pizza/sandwich shop in a random neighborhood and get a quality Fish n Chips for like 6 bucks.  The pizzas are unique and interesting, and almost all have toppings you wouldn't immediately think to combine on a pie.  You'll learn that I'm extremely easy to please when it comes to basic foods, but the taste and portions at Valley Pizza always make me walk back over there and give them a high five (or low five or fist bump or whatever you're currently into).  All in all, I've been to Valley Pizza about 15 times now, and I've never been dissatisfied.  I know giving something 5 stars on your first review sets a difficult precedent, but this is truly a hidden gem in a neighborhood known mostly for Bikini Lounge and the Grand Ave galleries.  (Also for the occasional bum fight in the parking lot across from Bikini which if I could review I would give ten stars).  Do yourself a favor and the next time youre in the mood for a pizza or a big-ass sandwich, give this place a shot.  And if you dont agree, I'm right around the corner and you can come tell me why.  I might jack you in the face, but my door's always open.Don't let this ghettofied hole in the wall scare you. This pizza joint may look run down, cheap and sketchy, but looks are deceiving. This place serves up some good  food realness. They have tons of Vegetarian options that are full of flavor. I always order the Queen Elizabeth which is made with white cheese, tomatoes and Italian spices. Scrumptious, Delicious, Divalicious. Definitely a pizza fit for a Queen! Hahahaha. Okay, that's out of control and a bit much. In seriousness, delivery here is fast and the salads are decent, but what made the salad  good was their Chipotle Ranch dressing. It's very hot and spicy. It has a kick to it and that's why I love it. My mouth went up in flames when I took a bite and that's a good thing!  I was on fire!
Sneakers Sports Grill=The word that most aptly describes the Sneaker's experience:Eww.This exclamation should be accompanied by a scrunched up nose, sneer or depressed sigh depending on the intonation.Does the smell of open sewage wafting from the bathrooms entice your tastebuds? Eww! *scrunchy nose*Do shriveled potato skins, overcooked fried zucchini sticks, or soggy hot wings float your boat? Eww. *disdainful sneer*Does the fact that they constantly change their specials and scheduled events without notice, luring you into this depressing hole under false pretenses sound dandy? Eww... *depressed sigh*I live dangerously close to this place, so more often than not I'll end up here when there's a dispute along the veins of: "Whatta you wanna do tonight? I dunno. How bout you?"Most frequently this is the end decision on a Friday night, when they hold live trivia with a host and the opportunity to win 20 to 30 bucks if you come in first or second place. But it's difficult to enjoy some live trivia when it's canceled every other week without any prior notice. That kind of business ethic doesn't instill any loyalty in your customer base. It's also kind of trashy how our winning credits are always hand written in near illegible chicken scratch on a piece of register tape, only redeemable for food, and only on a day other than trivia time. I get it. You want to lure us back on a weekday so we'll spend money in the bar. Klassy.I wouldn't have such a problem with the place if it the food was at least worth it. The nachos are huge and covered in lots of toppings but it's primarily cheap-o nacho cheese sauce or sour cream, which add little flavor and just make the whole thing a sloppy mess. The wings are soggy and generic (the hot isn't spicy in the least-- maybe they were referring to the temperature?), and there's an absolutely terrible Island Jerk flavor. The zucchini sticks are always overcooked and soggy. The cheese sticks are hard and chewy, not stringy mozzarella. The potato skins look like shriveled little potato abortions adorned by three bacon bits and some nacho sauce. The pizza is pretty decent and probably your best bet. I wouldn't recommend anything else on the menu. They use cheap, bargain basement product and it shows in the quality of the food.That leaves the bar to make up for the abysmal food. Too bad that's pretty hit or miss, with an emphasis on the miss. For about a two month stretch Sneakers seemed to change their daily specials week by week if not day by day. One day it would be two dollar ladies mixed drinks all day, next week just 9pm to close. Then it would be two dollar drafts all day, changed to half priced wings during happy hour. I don't like the bait and switch. I understand that a new or struggling place needs to cut costs and redefine its specials but when it's changing that often (too quickly for even the signage on the tables or menus to keep up) there's a serious issue with management that needs to be addressed. It seems like they've finally settled things to 75 cent domestic draft beers during happy hour (Coors and Bud) and half priced appetizers. Solid. Then from 9pm to close the daily drink specials start. Good. Keep it simple, stupid.The service at least tries to make up for the crappy food and ever changing drink specials. They're always more than patient when it comes to explaining the changes and always apologetic when they get the brunt of our disappointment when we've been victims of the ole bait and switch. The decor looks like a tacky college sports fan decorated it with all the tables sporting different teams and mascots, and paraphernalia splashed all over the walls willy nilly. There's also a weird identity problem going on, with some cheap wine prints on display in the bar and a gigantic statue of Uncle Lester from the Addams Family dressed in a referee suit. They offer Rock Band but I've never seen anyone playing it. They offer the Buzztime Trivia but hardly any televisions are ever tuned to it. There's a couple pool tables, darts, a basketball game, Buck Hunter and a couple other video games in the back. It just seems to be having an extreme identity crisis, trying to be something different to everyone, but half assing it so no one ends up satisfied.They've taken to serving beer in plastic cups and giving out paper plates for food during happy hour which is a bit on the depressing side. The general vibe makes it seem like it's on the brink of closing any given week, which is too bad because they easily have one of the best patios in Tempe. If you're going to go, sit on the patio and enjoy the greenery, cool water, friendly ducks and turtles sunning themselves. It will make you forget just how much of a downer it is inside the place.
Buffalo Wild Wings=We came here for happy hour and I can't say I'll go out of my way to go back. The mixed drinks were mixed poorly and the service was spotty. We ordered wings and some drinks and I didn't really like anything. The sauces weren't even coated properly.
Sabuddy Israeli=okay. wow.so, after reading reviews of Sabuddy here on yelp, we decided to make the long drive out to Scottsdale and have some middle-eastern fare...definitely an adventure worth having and gas money well spent!it was quite empty in there(an hour before closing time), and the service was very attentive and friendly, the music pleasant and conducive to eating...we started out with the labne(sweet cream cheese with spices and olive oil, served with warm pita)...it was okay; just normal cream cheese...I aimed for the olive oil when dipping my bread...Jamie ordered the Israeli meatballs(covered in red sauce, perfectly seasoned and tender and served over savory rice, with tender, well-cooked green beans, carrots, and chickpeas--delicious)I had the tabouleh(THE BEST tabouleh I've ever had--and I've had a lot!)...it was marinated in the perfect mix of lemon juice and olive oil..the bulgur was almost crispy, not soggy, mixed in with the chunks of tomato and parsley leaves.I'm partial to adding hummus to my tabouleh, so we ordered a small hummus plate(creamy, a bit garlicky, but not overly so, and with a nice sprinkling of paprika on top, served with 2 more warm pitas)...along with my salad, I had 2 falafel balls(only 50cents apiece); the best falafel I've ever had--a crispy, spiced shell surrounding a moist, tender, mushy center...kind of like middle-eastern hushpuppies, seriously and utterly incredible!for dessert, we were convinced to buy the baklava and lemme tell you--I don't know what one of the other reviewers on here was talking about--it was moist, crispy, and drizzled in what seemed to be a cinnamon/honey/coffee sauce...we also ordered a pot of Turkish coffee--rich and hot with definite chocolate undertones...absolutely perfect and in barely any need of sugar after the supersweet, supersavory dessert.we're already planning our next trip--he wants to try the shawarma, and I'm dying for the schnitzel and many, many more falafel balls!
Bagel Factory=I'm very torn about Bagel Factory, as living in New York made me a bagel snob.  It's not fair to compare Bagel Factory to a NYC bagel so I won't.  But if that is what you are craving, this will not fill that void.  I think the best bagel in Pittsburgh is a fair claim to fame, but Pittsburgh has some really bad bagels.  Just a thought.I ordered a rye bagel with bacon, egg, and cheese ($3.99).  There was a ton of good, thick bacon on the sandwich, and that was AMAZING.  Plenty of cheese and the perfect amount of egg as well.  But the bagel was pretty much flavorless.  Rye bagels should have flavor.  If this place wasn't called the bagel factory, it would be different.  But the bagel was so whatever.  The bagels are also really small for a fresh bagel.I would definitely come back to the Bagel Factory, but I think they really should work on creating a more memorable bagel.They accept credit cards.
Dick's Last Resort=When we stumbled into Dick's we did not know that it is their intent to be rude and insulting.  I caught on pretty quick as I looked around and read the hats of fellow patrons some of which said:"daddy says I'm more flexible than mommy"" I swallow on the first date"  "moses popped my cherry"We caught on quick when a rude ass server came up and said "i'm hungover"  and thru down a bunch of napkins and silverware on our table.I said "perfect, so are we!"We all got along just fine!the servers point uninterested at the menus on the wall and drag their feet while they move from table to table. We had a great time listening to the heavy guy on the mic insult folks and do lap dances.  And yes - my daughter got one.I could not resist when he said "anyone having a birthday???"  I pointed to my girl.  She shook her head back and forth like she was possessed but I didnt care - i kept on hollering!The lap dance is a funny mockery of a very not cute guy in a very small red thong that is pulled out high on his waist so you can see it when he removes his shirt (all while dancing) to expose a big old belly.It was comedic to those of us that did not have big man ass in our faces.  Keep in mind my daughter is probaby 5'7" and maybe weighs 115 pounds and here is this big ass dude bumping and grinding in her face.  She was a good sport in the end and laughed with us as we watched the video.Her best friend got a hat that read "easier to get into than a community college" The food was actually pretty good for dive grill food and the drinks could use more booze in them but does not matter - we had a blast and left stuffed.It turns into a nightclub of sorts in the evening - we skipped that part of it.Are you kidding me? The first thing I wanted to do when arriving in Vegas was to get a drink. We saw Dick's and headed over while our room was finished being cleaned. The whole thing is that they treat you like sh*t. I guess some people are into that, and usually you can tell by who they date. Me, not so much. Basically the people refuse to answer questions like where the bathroom is, yell at you, throw food at you, and complain that there tip wont be enough when you leave. People also where stupid hats made out of paper that the waiter writes rude remarks on. Again, people like to look like idiots. There is a difference between being funny about it and being a complete jerk, dick is a jerk. The food is obviously frozen and heated up, just normal chicken strips and that sort of thing, nothing better than the school cafeteria.Awful service.  Terrible manners and treatment of customers.  My fellow doctors and priests were outraged at the language and waiting at this establishment.  Hopefully you can tell by my star rating and utter facetiousness that in reality, this place is fantastic.  As they warn you as you enter, you best know what you are getting into before you enter.  This themed restaurant is extremely fun to visit and dine at as they treat you miserably, with the upside that you get to do the same in return.  The service itself was actually quick and accurate, but you always get lip no matter what you order, compliment, or complain about.  The food is completely appetizing, especially good as an all-nighter/hangover recover food.  Good beef, chicken, and pork based sandwiches and burgers to choose from.  They have a full bar, of course, and serve all Pepsi products from the fountain.The Las Vegas Dick's do a great job achieving the desired effect and theme of the restaurant chain, better than the San Diego franchise, sorry to say, and their unique approach to customer service should be applauded.If you don't easily get offended by profanity or mockery towards you, then I think you will enjoy this restaurant.  It is located inside the Excalibur Hotel Casino in the Las Vegas Strip.Supposedly but not sure, this place is suppose to resemble an east coast attitude type of restaurant.  The satire is to act like rude waiters and waitresses without giving a sh*t about how the patrons feel about the service.  When you first walk in, the hostess asks you if you have ever been here or know what this place is all about. You could say yes or no while you are being seated. But ultimately you will see a sign that tells you as you kind of and can't help but check the restaurant decoratives around the walls.  Or you'll hear profanity being shouted by the servers... of course in the name of fun.  Believe it or not,  the food and drinks here are quite good.  We ordered a bacon burger, a local moco, and a rib eye steak along with a hurricane and a strawberry daiquiri slush, an iced tea, and a brownie in a cup topped with whipped cream and jarred cherries. The bacon burger was huge. It's prepared with generous proportions of a beef patty and bacon strips with lettuce and tomatoes served with french fries.  It was good.  The local moco was also delicious. The beef patty was also a good size topped with an egg with gravy and some hot sauce with white rice underneath.  It was tasty and I devoured it and wanted to order a second.   The rib eye steak was probably the biggest surprise of our meal.  I really did not expect anything special. I actually tried to persuade my friend to order something else. Oh boy, I was wrong! The rib eye was cooked medium, and the steak was quite big at 14 ounces. It was served with steamed vegetables, but the meat was delicious with flavor.  The iced tea is just iced tea,  but their spiked slushies are awesome.  It's sweet and is fruity... very refreshing but with liquor mixed in it.  However,  the liquor seems more camaflouged in the strawberry daiquiri though... haha.Fyi, all the food and drinks ordered is for three people. In case you thought I was a big eater, which i am. Haha. Dick's is a very fun place to hang out.  Good food and drinks makes a difference. The ambiance is very east coast like indeed along with its attitude.  But you must be able to not get offended easily from what's said, and be cool.  Our waitress was actually really nice even with her wise cracks.Enjoy your time there and cheers!
Los Dos Molinos=The only thing I will ever remember about this place is the icy customer service and the inflexible menu. I ordered a bean and cheese burrito since I'm a substitute kind of person and on the menu is said "absolutely NO substitutes!" - yikes! So instead of getting $9 out of me they only got $6. But lets talk about this bean and cheese burrito...I was under the impression that a bean and cheese burrito was basically - bean and cheese wrapped up in a warm tortilla and maybe some graded cheese on top. Well, this was not the case! Half way through my burrito I came across shredded beef pieces! I'm not a vegetarian, but if I was I would have had a heart attack! The first thing that came to my mind was "absolutely NO substitutes!" - but does that mean only they can substitute? Or is the cook just going senile? Either way, I didn't like that. Not one bit. I didn't really even want the bean and cheese burrito, I really wanted the taco salad, but I couldn't ask for substitutes so I was forced to pick the plainest thing on the menu and they go and add stuff to it! I did like that they left the water pitcher with us at the table...however, the table they gave us was the smallest table in the room. We barely had room for our plates and utensils, let-alone this big water jug. I felt cramped; and this was emphasized by the guy sitting behind me, because when he scooted his chair back a little bit - it nearly knocked me face first into my plate! Oh, and by the way, large groups: they "absolutely will NOT split checks" so this is not the best place to go Dutch. I will end on a positive note: ....did I mention already that they left water for us to refill our glasses? Oh...I did. Well, I guess I ran out of positives - Sorry.I've seen this place from the bus and now the light rail when coming into work for a while now.  Friday, I got stuck working very late, and my boss took me to dinner when we were done with our project as a thank you.She wanted something mexican, and close to the office.  She said that she loved this place, so she took me here.  Walking in, I liked the decore of this place.  Authentic looking, and seemed cute!  Thats where the niceities stop.We walked in and were seated.  The service was absolutely HORRIFIC.  I was blatently ignored, but my boss was waited on as if she were the queen.  I have a theory about why, but I dare not write it down here, for fear of backlash.  I had to scream at the server halfway across the resturant when he refused to take my drink order.  I was astounded!  When he took my order, it was as if he were doing me a favor...horrible.Food was HOT.  So spicy that I was unable to eat it.  Why cant they state that in thier menu?  My  boss thought it was hysterical because I turned 7 shades of red from the spicy-ness.  lol.  Anyways, the next day the food was better from my fridge, I just wasn't expecting a mouth full of spicy hot food.  lol.Anyways, I will not be returning to this craptastic shithole.  Never again.  Service was aweful, and the food was just WAY to spicy for me.  I can get Mexican food just as decent with substantially better service at a spice level I can handle at about a zillion different places in this town.Stay away from this place! Its horrible!It was March 17th, St. Patrick's Day. And like every good Irish guy, I decided to wear my pride and do what comes naturally: eat. Only, rather than walk the 3 blocks to Seamus, I instead called in an enchilada order to Los Dos Molinos. And this was after I read some of these reviews. I'm quite daring. You'd think I worked for the IRS.After hearing horror stories about the crazy hot and spicy red chile, I settled on ordering that for my lunch. Apparently, LDM has either tamed down the flame, because I was able to eat the entire meal without incident. Even the following day I wasn't getting afterburners ignited. So much for heat. But, the flavors were good, the price was great, and the adventure of jaywalking across Washington tied the whole experience nicely together. I'm looking forward to actually getting to eat inside this location, and not just rail it to a fro.A solid three stars.
Tonic Bar & Grill=Furry watch 2013 happened here. Seems to be a trend to come here during furry week for me. I think next time I'll go to Sonoma Grille and spend the extra $$ for friendly service and good food. This was actually the first time I had eaten here. I had heard the rumors of great sweet potato fries. Those rumors proved to be true. They were really great. Sweet with a touch of spicy. And whatever that honey sauce they served with it... I practically liked it clean. And stole my friends container of it too. But the rest of the experience, not so great. I ordered a veggie wrap as well and it was pitiful. Pretty much spinach with a few red peppers tossed in the mix and a dollop of hummus. It was very bland and really in sad shape. Our server was also not very happy with us towards the end. I will tell you exactly what happened so as not to confuse the situation. Was it busy? Yes. Was she friendly up until the check issue? Yes. Do I understand how things work because I've been a server before? Yes!So the problem... there were 5 of us ladies who, of course, did not have much cash with us. She told us at first the system "couldn't process" more than 3 cards and cash payment split between us. She left us to figure things out. She comes back and we asked her if we could pay with 2 cards and cash, and she said no, their policy is that during conventions or busy times, they just don't split bills or payment. A little bit conflicting? Yes. She also told us the policy is on the menu. Now I cannot attest to whether it is or not, but I would be curious to know. Now I understand that in some instances places prefer you to pay in cash in a larger group, but usually they will tell you that at the beginning of the meal. This did not happen. I guess what I'm trying to say was that there were holes to the story. Whether it is restaurant policy or not, I just don't think it was communicated properly. She was clearly frustrated with us and it was a bit of a frustrating situation. I could be persuaded to come back for the sweet potato fries, but I'm coming with cash next time, lesson learned!
In-N-Out Burger=I love In-N-Out, but this is the first time I've got to give them only 3 Stars.  I recently came to this location and ordered:Cheeseburger Animal Style, $2.25http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/in-n-out-burger-tempe?select=K7mA8k4ZMqZ0ga-DN0-wdQ#K7mA8k4ZMqZ0ga-DN0-wdQhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/in-n-out-burger-tempe?select=EUJfvJBibUcaWvjeggno5w#EUJfvJBibUcaWvjeggno5wFrench Fries Animal Style, $3.50http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/in-n-out-burger-tempe?select=MocfGFJGvCqJYX4_rR_7VQ#MocfGFJGvCqJYX4_rR_7VQSmall Soda, $1.40The Cheeseburger was perfect....had all of the flavor that I've come to love about In-N-Out.  The Animal Fries on the other hand were terrible....they were cold and chewy.  Unbelievable, because they cook it fresh....they must've left this order on the counter while they finished by Burger instead of giving me a fresh order of Animal Fries.  It was a little disappointing because I normally have a 4 or 5 Star experience at an In-N-Out.Oh well, maybe I caught them on a bad day?  Return Factor - 60%Of fast food burger joints few places are as well known in areas where they have absolutely no store presence as the chain "In-N-Out Burger". While visiting Arizona on a business trip I was aware In-N-Out Burger was a fixture in the area, and it had been well over a decade since the last time I had stopped at one. Since my first pair of visits to In-N-Out Burgers in California in the early 2000s, I've seen people wearing In-N-Out Burger shirts, read countless articles about the chain, and decided the next time I'm near one I'll give it another shot. My feeling in previous visits to In-N-Out was that while good, and inexpensive there was nothing exceptional about the food there. Would I notice something I didn't before?When I arrived at my hotel in Tempe Arizona I was immediately able to spot an In-N-Out location and visited several times during my two week stay. On my initial visit I ordered a 3x3 which is three beef patties and three slices of cheese served "Animal style" which is with lettuce, tomato, the beef patties being mustard cooked; pickle, extra Thousand Island style sauce known as "spread" with grilled onions. I also got Lemonade and animal style fries which added spread and onions to the top of my fries. Overall, I thought the burger was very good, especially for the price, but that even with the spread the fries were a bit lacking. My next visit I went in a slightly different direction, passed on getting any fries and just got a regular 3x3 burger without the animal style additions and a chocolate shake. I noticed that besides the lettuce, tomato and onions it didn't taste as different as I thought it would. I also obtained this through the drive-thru and was given a box rather than a bag, making it somewhat difficult to transport without spilling. The shake I had was excellent, and while I was in the area I tried vanilla,chocolate and strawberry shakes and all were good.My overall opinion of In-N-Out is this, if you've never visited one it isn't the legendary once in a lifetime experience you may have heard about. However, it is very good for fast food and is quite inexpensive. The most unique characteristic of getting an animal style In-N-Out burger is that it is unique tasting. Nothing exactly tastes quite like an In-N-Out burger, the sharp onions and more sour than big mac sauce thousand island spread give the burger its character. It might not be the best tasting fast food burger ever, but it has its own identity. I am going to give In-N-Out four stars.
SakeBomber Sushi & Grill=I got a call from a friend the other night that a new sushi bar had opened across from her  local laundromat. Not knowing exactly what to expect from a sushi bar called "SakeBomber" I diligently made my way down to Tempe to check this place out, hoping to find another great sushi happy hour (which runs Monday through Friday 5-7 p.m. as I write this review).I definitely got the nightclub vibe from SakeBomber. It was low lit with colored lights lighting the bar, there were flat screen TV showing sports and hip-hop music playing just slightly too loud (perhaps they're taking a page from the Ra play book).There was no wait for a table during the Wednesday night happy hour. I ordered edamame, a crispy california roll and a spicy salmon roll. My friend got a spicy tuna roll and a crispy eel roll. While we didn't do any SakeBombs (hey, you wanted a legible coherent review right?) we did enjoy some $1 warm sake.I'd love to write you something more descriptive here... but all I can really come up with is that "the sushi was pretty good." I enjoyed it, but it didn't knock me off my feet (although the spicy salmon was actually spicy, a nice change from most other places I've tried in the valley). The rolls were slightly larger than what gets served at Sushi 101 (what I would classify as SakeBomber's most direct competition). The only problem I have with this is that it gets difficult to get the entire roll in your mouth in one try.After reading everything above, you might be thinking to yourself, "Why the heck did he give this place four stars?" Price. Although this wasn't the best sushi in the world and I personally didn't care for the atmosphere, as I write this, the happy hour menu is probably the most reasonably priced I've found. Edamame and two rolls during happy hour  was only $11.I'm definitely going back to SakeBomber... not only do I want to try some things on the non-happy hour menu that looked enticing, continuing to go at happy hour will hopefully keep the sushi monkey on my back from continuing to eat a hole in my pocket.S has been on Yelp searching cool places for me to try during my visit here to the Phoenix area.Being away from home and wanting some comfort food, S suggested that I try Sake Bomber to get my sushi fix. The location was in close proximity to my hotel so I made arrangements for transportation to the restaurant. The staff at the front desk mentioned that the food there was pretty good.So, let's put that into perspective...I'm sure that there are many fine restaurants in the Phoenix area. When I'm visiting I love to experience restaurants (not chain) to get a taste of the local flavor. I'll have to say that SakeBomber is not the best representative of what Japanese food should be...I arrived during happy hour and the wait staff was very friendly and accommodating. I had imagined that I might be able to catch up on some reading while dining - but this was not the case. A patron of the restaurant, who thought he was being funny, was loud and demanding more drinks from the server. The dark interior, dim lighting and thumping music wasn't conducive to a serene dining experience. Oh well, I was here to get my sushi fix. I'm thinking that I shouldn't judge on appearances and maybe, just maybe, the sushi would redeem the thoughts that were going through my head.First came the gyoza and agedashi tofu. The gyoza was ok, but was very disappointed with the agedashi. I'm used to the agedashi dishes from Gombei or Hoshi's - piping hot chunks of creamy deep friend tofu, swimming in that wonderful sauce, covered with bonito flakes, grated ginger and radish. Instead I got chunks of barely warm firm tofu arranged on a platter with tempura sauce and sprinkled with a few green onions. I was hungry so, I ate it. I must admit that the salmon skin roll was the best deal of it all - 8 pieces of salmon skin nigiri with grilled asparagus and carrots. It was filling as well as yummy. I also had smoke salmon and hamachi maki. The fish was not the best I ever had, but I think that the sake I had during dinner helped the experience along with watching the snow boarding competition on the big screen TV behind the bar. I called the hotel shuttle to pick me up after dinner. I had to chuckle when the driver asked, "How in the world did you end up at SakeBombers?""You see," I told him. "It was like this..."Ah yes, American sushi.    White, frat boy sushi chefs.   The server was under 21 so her friend had to drop off the drinks as she followed here to the table.It's an alright place, not bad for ASU but that's where the buck stops. The asparagus app. was good. The rolls were good.  We didn't get sick, good.Smoking hot Asian hostess..... arrrrrrrr...............Fuck it - I'm giving this place 5 stars. It's far too easy to be a sushi snob I guess - which is funny since we're in Arizona - but I meet them all the time. It's also kinda funny to me how sushi-lovers love to hate sushi restaurants. It's like you ask a sushi fanatic where to go and they snidely scoff and mumble something about an exotic little place off the coast of wherever that they've probably only been to once if at all and suggest you might as well pick up a steamy dog shit off the lawn and eat that if you're going to eat at whatever place you were asking about. I think it's meant to make the rest of us feel stupid for not being an expert. Well I'm a novice - I've only been to about a dozen different sushi places probably less than 50 times. I like the stuff, but I'm not from Japan or anything... I don't have it in my blood. I just know what I like and I tend to get the same or similar things wherever I go. So given my experiences with sushi places and restaurants in general, I have to say this place is great. The servers were friendly and attentive, the decor was nice and kinda swanky without being overdone, the music sucked but wasn't too loud, and the food was quite good. If that doesn't make a 5 star joint, I don't know what does.We had a roll and a teriyaki chicken dish from the menu along with a small bottle of sake that we bombed. Everything was crazy good. Oh, and we had edemame as well. The roll was pretty huge compared to most places and the chicken dish was ridiculously huge. For all the food we had, the prices were pretty reasonable. To be honest, I expected this place to suck. The location, the outside, the name, etc... it all kinda gave the impression this wasn't going to be any good. Well, it was... so I guess... don't judge a book by its cover? This isn't a chain, it doesn't smell fishy inside (at least it didn't when I was there), and it's clean. Compared to places like zen32 or stingray, this place holds its own. I think it kicks Ra in the ass - and I kinda like Ra okay. I ventured into the bathroom and it was clean and nice, but a little hodge-podgey (2 different styles of sink)... nice though... and clean. I was actually a little shocked to see so many negative reviews after enjoying it so much... I guess that's the beauty of this site - it's all opinions, so nobody gets to be "right" and nobody has to be "wrong." If you're like me and you enjoy your Americanized sushi restaurant grills, you may really enjoy this. If you're a sushi genius, your mileage may vary.This place is awesome!My wife and I stopped in on a Friday night before heading off to the Tempe Improv. At first blush, it seemed a little dark. The decor is very black and red...almost like you'd find at some after hours club..only with more windows...or any windows, for that matter. But, it wasn't anything that was going to deter us from coming in.We were greeted by the hostess who was pleasant enough. She was certain to point out the current specials drawn on the dry-erase board located by the hostess' stand. On this night, the Baja Roll was the flavor of choice. We obviously weren't ready to make such a snap decision before being seated, but we did let the idea simmer while were shown to our table.Once seated, we took a look over the actual menu. There are several pages offering up varying concoctions, including dinner plates, sushi rolls, and even delicious cocktails available at the full bar. We knew we were about to run into a two-drink minimum in the very near future, so we opted to forego the drinks this time.After a few times through the menu, and after deeply considering the current special, we had made our decision. For both of us to share, we decided to get two different rolls, as well as an appetizer: The Playgirl Roll and the Baja Roll, plus an order of Mussels. The Mussels were the first to arrive. Perfect for sharing, and very nicely seasoned. The only downside to the mussels was that we didn't have forks...we had chopsticks. I am absolutely TERRIBLE with chopsticks, so I had to do a little work. Sure, I could have asked for a fork. But what would have been the fun in that, right? Plus, it made my wife laugh, and that's always an added bonus.After our appetizer, we found ourselves face to face with two beautiful creations. The Baja Roll came on a plate with a surprisingly spicy sauce in the middle of the plate. As the manager explained during one of her many trips to our table, the Baja Roll was kind of like a fish taco, but with a Japanese twist. She was absolutely right. Delicious! Couple that with our salmon, cream cheese and avocado Playgirl Roll, and our dinner was amazing!I'm honored to be the 100th review for this awesome Sushi spot. It turned out to be a fantastic date night dinner. Hopefully, we'll be back sometime in the near future, if only to improve my chopstick skills. I mean, I'm REALLY bad with chopsticks...comically bad.
Seviche=Any place that rewards my check-in with a tasty on-the-house Sangria is A-OK with me!  Especially since I would have checked-in regardless.  We had 8:30 reservations on a Saturday.  When we got there, there were a few tables open in this hip Cuban style restaurant.  Our waitress greeted us quickly and supplied our Sangrias within 5 minutes.  She inquired if we were ready and I said I needed a minute.  She left to attend to a much bigger party, and we were quickly greeted by another server who explained he would be helping because she was taking care of a bachelorette party.  He described the menu, how ceviche is made and was very informative.  However, when he left our original waitress appeared as the party table was wrapping up, I am guessing to go party a little more hardy... I decided I wanted to try the Fire and Ice Seviche with salmon.  She kind of shuttered, and said most people don't choose that with the F&I... Ok I love getting suggestions from the servers... She said most like crab or Ahi Tuna... Well then I will go with the crab... It was fabulous... I loved the balance of heat and citrus and herbs to cool it down.  Definitely a winner.   The drink I decided on next was a Manhattan featuring Wigle Whisky, holy snikes, it was almost as much as my main meal!  It was good, had a punch, but I couldn't blow the whole budget on cocktails!  Or could I??Next we both got a trio of taco's.  My husband went with BBQ Short ribs tacos, were as I played mix and match and got one BBQ Short rib, on Baja Fish, and one BLT.  We both really enjoyed the BBQ Short Rib taco but it was such a small amount of fillings in the shell.  The shell stood a good inch above where the filling ended.  Kind of disappointing there.  My Baja Fish was really tasty but it was a little dry.  It needed an aioli or slaw something.  Good flavor, just needed a boost.  The last taco, the BLT was by far my favorite.  Filled to the top with the pickled veg and romaine, and the pork belly boats sat on top.  I call them boats because they were big strips not bite sized cuts which I thought was way better than cutting them up.  The prices on our tacos were not bad but since the short rib one was so skimpy my husband was still quite hungry, so I talked him into getting dessert... HA!  Yea like someone really needs to talk him into dessert; ) He ordered the flourless chocolate cake.  It was good and he enjoyed it but it was a bit pricey for the size.  And unfortunately he left hungry.  I on the other hand was satisfied so I can't complain and I am sure we will be back to sample some other dishes.Never have I ever felt so uncomfortable that I walked out of a restaurant without ordering...until I came here.I showed up with a friend last Fri. night around 10pm after a Cultural District gallery crawl.  I suggested this place since it seemed interesting and different, it had strong ratings on Yelp, and they offered a free glass of sangria for a check in.  When we walked in, it was fairly busy and seemed understaffed, and there was no hostess to seat us.  Since we were planning to order a few drinks and some tapas, my friend suggested we sit at the bar, and I agreed, so we walked over and seated ourselves.  A guy who looked like the manager or owner walked over pretty promptly and handed us some food and drink menus, which we perused for about 10 min.Once we'd decided what to order, we set our menus down, and the guy who'd handed them to us came over to take our order.  The weirdness started when I said, "Well, I'd like to claim my free sangria since I checked in on Yelp," only to realize that the guy purportedly taking my order had disappeared!  I gave my friend a confused look, and he told me that the guy had walked off right after I said "Well," and joked that perhaps starting an order with "Well," was unacceptable in this establishment.  It was at this point that I realized that we weren't sitting at the bar--we were actually sitting at the chef's table (which is structured similarly to the bar)!  My friend hadn't known this when he led us over there to sit, and I only happened to know that this was the chef's table b/c I'd read that they had one.  Nobody, including the guy who "waited" on us, had bothered to tell us this simple fact, or to suggest that we may want to move elsewhere if we weren't planning on ordering entrees--instead, they just ignored us!  At this point, we both felt weird enough that we got up and decided to leave, and did so without further ado.I'm not sure if we were profiled as peons who didn't look wealthy enough to be sitting at the chef's table, or if this place was so understaffed that they decided to blow off anyone showing the slightest degree of indecisiveness.  Either way, the treatment we received was, quite frankly, unacceptable.  If the management thinks it's okay to ignore customers and make them feel uncomfortable, they won't have many of them left before long--not to mention any revenue.P.S. We left and headed over to the Harris Grill in Shadyside, where we spent a cool $50 + tip on drinks and food.I just want to clone and date me. Is that too much to ask?Solo date night: dinner and drinks at Seviche... So happy!! hehe (~o~)Seviche is a Latin American dish of raw fish marinated in citrus juice... onions...tomatoes and chilies and sometimes flavored with cilantro....delicious!!you have to order their tacos.!!!one of my favorite entrees was just munching on their specialty tacos...was very filling too!  pair with their signature mojitos perfect!Drinks is one of the most important part of my meals....i ordered champagne... mojitos and a sangria..WOW..everything was strong and tasteful!
Zabas Mexican Grill=This is right around the corner from me, and I go there often. The only reason why I would give this place 3 stars is because of the service. Otherwise, the food is good. It's my #1 choice over any other fast Mexican food around here. Their meat spices are good, everything is always fresh and I LOVE their queso here. A lot of people don't like this type of queso, but I love white cheese queso.The nachos are always my #1 favorite. Other than that, I usually get the rice bowls. The reason I have a distaste for the customer service - There is a couple of ladies there that are almost always rude. They give you a look like you're inconveniencing them and they act like they hate their job. It's cool, I understand. I hate my job too. But, I don't treat my customers like shit because it's my fault I hate my job, not theirs. There is one in particular that always is hateful. She never says hello, never asks what she can help me with and she has always screwed up my order. I tell her what I want, and she always puts something else. I hate to be a bother, so I never complain and I finally told her last time that that's what not what I had said. She seemed annoyed and I told her it was okay and that I didn't want her to change it. I don't like being rude to people, even if they're rude to me first. It sucks because I really don't like the other places around here, so I keep going back. I just mentally prepare myself before going in knowing my experience won't be the best. Maybe it's just me...
Buzios Seafood Restaurant=Búzios has been on my to try list for quite some time.  When I saw a Groupon for it, I bought one and planned to have dinner here on the night I was going to see Penn & Teller at the Rio.I had a reservation for 6:30 and I was promptly seated in an almost empty restaurant.  There was one table occupied and one person eating at the seafood bar.  I had looked at the menu online, but I took some time looking there, changing my mind, and then ordering.  I was brought a bread basket, served water, and brought an iced tea quickly.I ordered a jumbo lump crabmeat cocktail, the miso Chilean sea bass, and the 7 layer chocolate cake for dessert.  The lump crabmeat was the best part of the meal.  The crab was tasty and the cocktail sauce they brought had extra horseradish to mix in.  I really enjoyed this appetizer.The sea bass was disappointing.  It was on the menu under their "House Signatures" section of the menu.  It's described as sea bass with a house made miso glaze.  What I got was more of a miso gravy than glaze and it wasn't appealing.  When I tasted it, I wished I had ordered the plain sea bass.  The sea bass was moist and very hot (temperature).  The entrée comes with two sides and I chose cole slaw and garlic fries.  The fires were good but they had absolutely no taste of garlic.  The cole slaw was OK.When it came to dessert, I had asked my server if the cobbler was warmed.  He said yes.  I asked him if it was already warm and he said no.  I ordered the cobbler and asked that it not be warmed.  About 3 minutes later, he came back and said they ran out of cobbler.  I opted for the 7 layer chocolate cake.  I wonder if they really were out or if the cobbler was indeed kept warm and he didn't want to tell me that.Service was spotty during the night.  Empty Sweet 'n Low packets were not removed from the table until I put them in the empty crab cocktail glass.  Iced tea wasn't refilled as quickly as many restaurants of lesser cost, and the table was not properly bussed.  The waiter didn't remove the bread basket and bread plate before he brought the dessert.  After I had taken a few bites of the cake, a bus person came by and removed those items.And then there's the Groupon.  The fine print says not valid with any other..... including Total Rewards.  That means, they don't give you the TR pricing.  It's not that much of a loss to the customer and it shouldn't be that big of a deal for Búzios either.  $1 more for the appetizer, $3 more for the sea bass, and $1 more for dessert.  You got $5 more out of me for using a Groupon.  Was it worth it to you?  Also, the Groupon states that an 18% service fee (note they can't say gratuity anymore because of IRS rules) will be applied to the bill prior to discount.  I somewhat understand this, but my server got cheated a bit because I normally do 20%.  Not that much difference but hey, I'm getting back part of the TR pricing I couldn't have.  Finally, reservations were made through Open Table.  At any other restaurant, as soon as I check in, Open Table says I have 100 points.  As of this afternoon, my Open Table points are "pending".This apparently is the way Búzios operates.  Don't be business friendly with the customer.  Instead, challenge them and nickel and dime them every step of the way.  Groupons normally are sold by new companies to drive traffic and make a name.  The other reason is to help failing places.  Since the Búzios Groupon is an ongoing seller, I can only imagine that they're struggling to stay alive.What a mistake it was to come here!
Musashi Japanese Steakhouse="Wait till you try some of MY sauce?" says the chef to two ladies while standing over a pile of rice shaped like a dude's junk (The balls are even sprinkled with black sesame seeds).  Welcome to Musashi.Great spot to unwind with good teppanyaki prepared by talented, sometimes lewd, chefs in an unpretentious, fun atmosphere.The classic teppanyaki "show" is almost flawless in execution from years of experience.  Chefs effortlessly carry on a fun conversation while creating very consistently flavored and accurately cooked food.  Something very difficult to find in teppanyaki joints.Steaks are cooked to temperature and served with eight dipping sauces, many made on the teppan cook top.  Prawns and lobster tails are sweet and cooked right.  Well cooked veg.  Tasty fried rice (no comment about the chef's sauce).Dinner sets offer the best selection and value with most sets below $35.Other menu items?  Who knows.  This is a TEPPANYAKI restaurant.  Get your sushi fix elsewhere.Open till 4am.Note:  The Travel Channel's "Steak Paradise II" featured Musashi for their use of "imported from Japan Kobe beef".  Since the import ban of 2010 it's  no longer available.Musashi Japanese SteakhouseWhen in Vegas....some of the better restaurants are located just off the strip...that Musashi Japanese Steakhouse was just that.So, after dropping $400 on a Black Jack table (losing 7 out of  8 hands) in less than 10 minutes it was decided that it was time for dinner.  At least the room was comp.  Whisked away in a large black vehicle our party arrived at Musashi Japanese Steakhouse.  We were hungry, we were ecstatic....no wait, no line....what a way to go.  We were seated, drinks ordered and menus were served.Here is what we decided on:My Ex-Girlfriendhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/BcW7Z9lPmOB_8eS2lEuOqQ?select=O4JtnWgrryVq3aLDTTFYnQ#O4JtnWgrryVq3aLDTTFYnQ99% Rollhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/BcW7Z9lPmOB_8eS2lEuOqQ?select=O4JtnWgrryVq3aLDTTFYnQ#mfMYDmaLojuTHenrx-1BbANY Steakhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/BcW7Z9lPmOB_8eS2lEuOqQ?select=O4JtnWgrryVq3aLDTTFYnQ#wcfYoMtMWEiJctnRK8dpPgIka-Yaki (Baked Squid)http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/BcW7Z9lPmOB_8eS2lEuOqQ?select=O4JtnWgrryVq3aLDTTFYnQ#kMmweG5KHbbIklQFy0KWiABroiled Salmonhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/BcW7Z9lPmOB_8eS2lEuOqQ?select=O4JtnWgrryVq3aLDTTFYnQ#zPyvxdok-7JyeWyqJKUGmgIt didn't take too long before our food had arrived, but we were running behind schedule as we were....there was another table waiting for us at another event....so we still asked our server to please hurry up....sure enough our food began to arrive.First the Ika-Yaki.....for those of you who like Baked Squid, this was not a bad dish.  Next was the Broiled Salmon....the Salmon was very fresh and not over cooked.  Very moist and tasty as it was covered in Teriyaki sauce.  The sauce was just about right, not an over dominating flavor.This was followed by the NY Steak and Rib-Eye.  I have no idea what a NY Steak is doing in a Japanese Restaurant....but that was what we had ordered.  The Rib-Eye was a much better cut, soft and tender, juicy and topped off with some Teriyaki Sauce.  The NY Steak was done the same way, not too bad...I can't complain much about the NY Steak...just that my preference would be the Rib-Eye.As we were half way through our meal...the rolls began to come.The 99% roll came first and was all too good to not eat one piece but you just had to eat 2 pieces or more.We had one more roll coming.....and our server had just informed me that our Ex-Girlfriend will be a little late.  DARN!!  I picked up my phone and called my Ex....she's late as usual....Ok....I need to settle down a little....I should have gone for the Porn Star instead.....would have been rolling in style.  So finally our Ex-Girlfriend shows up and we just devour her as quickly as we can.   To my surprise it was very good.  Crab, avocado, spicy tuna with halibut tempura and spicy mayo.Next time I'm going for the Porn Star, she'll be at the table before the Ex-Girl Friend.  I'm also looking forward to their Kama Sutra roll next time.Overall, the meal was exotic, climatic with loads of orgasmic flavors.  Such an explosive meal....off to the next event.  Will be back for the Porn Star for sure!!Place was clean, bathrooms clean, not too loud and a nice atmosphere.  A restaurant to try when in Vegas!!  4 StarsMusashi Japanese Steakhouse was definitely my absolute favorite and best teppanyaki experience, ever. The Samurai Special II with NY steak and scallops was perfect for me! My food was cooked and played with at our teppan station by our beloved chef! Each moresel of food was exquisite! And even better with the sauces that were presented to us.There were a plethora of sauces and I had a hard time keeping track. Each one was delicious and unique, so I can't really give you tips on which one to go for. All Teppan entrees served with miso soup, salad, rice, shrimp appetizer, and assorted vegetables. We had a lot of fun with the shrimp appetizer! Chef Tsutomu made shrimp bunnies!We also tried the lobster fried rice, which was also very tasty!As for dessert, I highly recommend the tempura ice cream. Yes, tempura battered and fried vanilla ice cream! And it is just as great as it sounds. :)..and it's not just the food that makes this place great!Chef Tsutomu is such a ham. He's hilarious and good at what he does. He is both an expert cook AND an exciting entertainer. If you're thinking about dining at Musashi, request Chef Tsutomu! You definitely won't regret it!!!One of the better if not best Japanese Teppanyaki places I've been too anywhere (Including Japan itself) For those of you unfamiliar of what Teppanyaki is, it's the melding of technique and style with Japanese cuisine pan fried on a Teppan (huge) grill. The chef always puts on an elaborate show with acrobatic shrimp and flying vegetables to entertain and wow the guests.  You will always leave this place  fully stuffed and drunk (well at least me lol)!If you come to Teppanyaki restaurants often, you will often get tired of the same routine they pull, so it's best to go once in a while or bring friends who never experienced it themselves. But the food is always delicious so I don't mind some of the acts getting old really.My favorite is the Musashi Special, it comes with Filet mignon, prawns, scallops, lobster tail,fried rice and choice of ice cream all for $58. It's a lot of food so be prepared. Here is the list of the main Teppanyaki entrees.Musashi Special 58.00Filet mignon, prawns, scallops, lobster tail,fried rice and choice of ice creamSteak Lovers Special 90.00Kobe beef, New York steak and filet mignonKimono Special 22.50Sukiyaki steak and chicken breastGeisha Special 26.75New York Steak and chicken breastKatana Special 24.00Chicken breast and prawnsRonin Special 32.00Prawns and scallopsNinja Special 29.00Salmon filet and prawnsThey also have sushi and sushi rolls. I've tried a lot of them and all of them are very good comparable to actual specialized sushi restaurants. This place is also open late (4.a.m.) If you never tried Japanese Teppanyaki, this is a good first place to try!Teppanyaki is ALWAYS a fun time.  Can't beat food, drinks, entertainment and FIRE!  We made an 8:30pm reservation less than an hour before and were seated at a full table.  My wife got the filet mignon/shrimp combo.  I got the NY strip/salmon combo.  The fried rice is $3.50 and well worth it.  We were also served a bevy of vegetables including zucchini, onions, mushrooms and bean sprouts all cooked to perfection.  I actually preferred the sirloin over filet here since they chop it up and put a lot of sauce on it.  We were also able to try a portion of the scallops due to a wrong order and those were really good too.  I get Misti Y's "shabby" comment regarding the interior.  The teppanyaki area felt kind of basementy but you kind of forget about it once the chef starts.  The bar area seemed pretty makeshift too.  It wasn't exactly an area you'd spend an hour at.  On a side note, maybe it's me being a snob but I scoff at people that order well done steaks.  I know it's a personal choice that I should respect but why would you want to do that to a steak?  No less than 4 people at our table ordered well done!  Their raw cuts of filet looked quite different than the others that ordered rare or medium rare.  Lower quality perhaps?  3 people also straight up didn't want any vegetables even in their fried rice.  Grown people!  More for the rest of us!!I came here twice in one week for teppanyaki , but I will never come back after the second time. The first time I came here, my experience was so awesome! The chef wasn't that good at doing his little tricks, but he was still entertaining. It was during normal hours, and I fell in love with their fried rice and mushrooms. Three days later, I came really late at night during their happy hour. We ordered about the same amount food like last time. The server told us it's 50% off so we get half the portions, but it's the same exact food as the normal menu. So we ordered twice as much. Here comes the chef who looked at us like, "great some of my customers are 12 year olds." Just because we look young, doesn't mean you start downgrading your service (I despise servers like that, and yes, we do look like 12 year olds). I told him twice before he started that no onions on any of our food (my bf is allergic), and he said, "I'm going to put lots of onions." He said it in a joking way, but I said it again after just to be sure. He started doing his thing, and he cooked fried rice for the other customers first WITH onions and then he used to same grill to cook our fried rice without cleaning it. The previous chef we had was not like that. He acknowledged our request, and he put us first. Our fried rice had onions...good thing we're smart enough to check. He got even worse when it came to the veggies. He cooked the veggies all at once for everybody, and gave us veggies with onions. Then he goes, "It might have a little onion." After that I was so done. I wasn't going to complain anymore because to me this restaurant doesn't exist. I was planning on taking my family here for my graduation dinner, but no thanks. He didn't even give us any mushrooms...he gave all the mushrooms to everybody else. I love mushrooms. I thought we were supposed to get the exact same thing as regular menu. We paid the same amount we did for the regular menu. I hate this place with a burning passion. Please, train your chefs what "No onions!" mean, and how to provide service.WHERE: Paradise between Sands & Flamingo.WHEN: They open at 5pm and close at 4am I believe. My friend and I attempted to go there around lunchtime, and should have researched beforehand... lolWHY: If you are a Teppanyaki first timer like I was, it is definitely a must! Muahaha!WHAT: My friend and I randomly decided to redeem ourselves and try out Musashi when they were actually open, so we headed here at 6pm! We made reservations just incase (better to be safe than sorry), and it wasn't as busy as I thought it would be. Hallelujah! The decor was quite nice and intimate, we were seated, and ordered.The staff were all so sweet! From our server to our Chef (we had Chef Octavio) - phenomenal! =DWe were first asked the occasion of us being there, we replied "For Fun." I did not think my "for fun" answer would lead to such surprising consequence, but it really was FUN! I don't want to ruin it for you first-timers, so just get on in there and have fun! Lol. THERE IS DEFINITELY A SURPRISE WAITING FOR YOU... MUAHAHA!On the food-end of the spectrum, it was delicious! My friend and I decided to get the filet mignon/shrimp/lobster combo. It was accompanied with several sauces (I am a saucy type of girl. Lol), veggies to start with, and tasty fried rice to pair with the seafood and meat. While Chef Octavio was cooking our food in front of us, I was like a child embracing every cool moment1 Who would have ever known cooking could be such entertainment!!Overall, this experience definitely goes in the books!! From the workers, people, and food... FIYAHHHHH!!!Lost my daughters 12th birthday dinner reservation. Made no attempt to fix it, or attend to us anyway. Ignored us, laughed at us when we insisted they made a mistake. Lost my business forever, and that saddens me because the food is decent. Nothing makes up for messing up a kids birthday. She was truly disappointed, as were the other 7 people in our party. You really screwed us Musashi and I will never return. Nor will I refer you to anyone ever again.This has to be my favorite teppan yaki spot in Vegas! Every time I come here, service is always on point and food is always delicious! The last time I came here, the group I came with did the happy hour special. Definitely a must-try late night food place!I did the seafood combo that comes with miso soup, fried rice, shrimp, scallops and fish! It also comes with many different sauces made to order from the chef all for only $20! (Happy hour special) Because I went with a big group of early to mid 20's age, the teppan yaki chef made funny after-hour remarks! The chef was so funny and very accommodating. I went here for my mom's birthday as well a few months ago and I went with my family. The chef was so nice and funny.. he was not going to do some "adult" jokes. Instead, he cooked the fried rice in a heart-shaped form and was trying to make my grandma laugh! My family enjoyed it and they loved the food!I love this off-the-strip spot! A local hot spot, a tourist favorite, and you might spot a celebrity here or there! If you're in Vegas, you should try place!Musashi came highly recommended, after two visits, I can only say this place deserves NO stars.First visit. We asked for the "adult" show for a visiting friend.  Got two bowls of rice turned upside down with some round veggie on top and they called it boobs... great... I paid 20% more over Benihana for rice boobs?  The food was okay, so I'll give it another shot.Second and final visit.- 6 weeks out:  Made reservations for adult show for 7 at 10pm.- 3 weeks out:  Called to confirm reservation for adult show for 7 at 10pm. Confirmed.- Reservation:  Showed up 15 minutes before and checked in with the hostess, confirmed that we had reservation for 7 and for adult show.  She tells us to tell the server you want adult show.  She then proceeds to sit a party of 3 at our table... they had a 9 year old with them.  While most 9 year old nowadays have probably seen more internet porn than most adults my age, I did the adult thing and let the hostess know that she just sat a kid at the adult show table.  Apparently, according to the hostess, a 9 year old seeing a 2 foot long big black dildo with simulated jiz is, to her, perfectly fine.  I continued to ask for an kid free adult show.  After asking for the manager, I was told that she was not at the restaurant.  After further pressing, we asked to speak with the owner Tsutomu (AKA Tiger)... we explained our situation, about making reservations and blah blah blah... he couldn't give two shits.  Taking the high road, we decided to leave and not scar the poor kid.This is what I get from wanting to see a big black dildo at a Japanese restaurant.It is now my mission in life to divert any and all tourist away from this shitty place.We were looking to dine near the Hard Rock and my friend suggested Musashi. She had been here before and raved about how great the teppanyaki was.When we walked in there was no hostess, we walked up to the bartender and asked if we had to seat ourselves, he ended up calling a waiter over. My friend asked if we could do the teppanyaki, we were told we could but not until 9:30 p.m. because we didn't have reservations. We didn't know it was mandatory to make one. We had a show to go to so we sat down to dine in the main dining area instead. I ended up ordering the following items: Pork Gyoza- $4.50Shrimp Dragoons- $6.00NY Steak (Hot Iron)- $18.00The NY steak entree included miso soup, salad, fried vegetables (they no longer offer mashed potatoes), and steamed white rice. When ordering the steak it could either be served teriyaki style or just plain salt and pepper with a side of oroshi ponzu sauce. I opted to go with the salt and pepper. I ordered my steak well done and it was still very juicy and tender, I didn't end up touching the vegetables because they consisted of onions, zucchini (my arch nemesis), and carrots.The miso soup came with mushrooms, scallions, and little pieces of meat, it had a little kick, it was very flavorful. The salad was just iceberg lettuce topped with ginger dressing which was really good, it was sweet but not overpowering. The shrimp dragoons were a-okay, they're just like crab rangoons except they have shrimp instead of crab. I'll most likely skip ordering them next time. I ordered the pork gyoza steamed, but you can also order it fried, it was good, the pork had a nice salty taste. I really wanted to try the cream balls but they are no longer part of the menu. Our waiter said they were changing a lot of the things on the menu because I noticed some parts of the menu were blacked out. Our waiter was very attentive throughout the whole meal, we never even had to ask him for any refills because as soon as we were done with 3/4 of our drink, he'd bring more out. I was really happy with our service and meal. I will be back because I really want to try the teppanyaki but I'll make sure to set a reservation next time.
BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse=Located in one of the many shopping complexes ringing the north side of Phoenix, BJ's is a brewpub/sports bar serving up casual fare at bargain prices.Blame it on the lunch rush: service was at a crawl, though the waiter was friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. And the food was fine.I went with the Parmesan-crusted chicken sandwich, a chicken breast coated with Parmesan bread crumbs and served between a soft roll with lettuce, tomato, and a garlic dressing. A little heavy on the lettuce and tomato and light on the coating, but a good sandwich with particularly good thin-cut fries.I didn't get the chance to sample any of their dozen or so brews, but it looked like a solid selection. They brew their own sodas, as well.Although previously unknown to me, BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse is a part of a large, multistate chain.  Their standards of food and service easily identify this realization, in spite of the fact that it is stated on their menu.Not to be misunderstood, the turkey club sandwich that I ordered wasn't bad, and the requisite flavors were all there.  Sloppy assembly and plating, however, illustrated the plight of a kitchen slammed at lunchtime and simply trying to move to the next order.  To say that there was no "love" put into this sandwich would be an understatement.Our server (I believe that his name was Johnny) was apologetic- even funny- about how backed-up the kitchen was.  Yes, service was slower-than-slow, but a personable and attentive server made the extended wait somewhat bearable.Their desserts looked great, and I'm not a dessert eater.  Unfortunately, we wouldn't have had the rest of the afternoon to wait for them.So yet another restaurant chain is added to the list of those that I will try to avoid in my frequent business travel.
Cracker Barrel Old Country Store=While I actually find this place depressing, I give it 3 stars for 2 reasons. One, my parents LOVE to take me here when I'm hangin' with them in Sun City. Or as I call it, God's Waiting Room. Two, the best cheesy hash browns. Ever. In the world. While they serve all day and all meals, I've only had breakfast. Eggs, sausage, biscuit. All just fine. But it's the cheesy hash browns y'all. Mom loves the pancakes. And dad. "Best damn cup of coffee I ever had." Ok, pops. Better than Folgers. Really? And there's kitchy like crates and wicker baskets hanging all over the place. Yikes, who dusts that crap? Before you even step foot in the restaurant you are forced to navigate "the store". Oh Jesus Mary. The store. Full of like, Holly Hobbie meets John Deere stuff. Creepy weird. But oh, the cheesy hash browns.When I lived in Phoenix, I used to frequent CB quite often as the food was reasonably priced, breakfast or lunch was always good and service was stellar. I also liked the store in front of the restaurant and would often find things to buy from seasonal items to collectibles (long ago it was Boyd's Bears) and they had good candy.Well, I have lived in the Bay Area for well over 8 years again and this was the first time I have been back to a Cracker Barrel. This time was for breakfast with my Mom and daughter. The service, as I remembered was fantastic, the menu huge but with things from reasonably sized to giant portions and all that in between. This was the first restaurant I can remember that asked me if I wanted my poached eggs soft, medium or hard (soft please) and the cheesy hashbrown casserole was still as good as I remembered. I will be back when I come back to town next and I can't wait!Well shoot... I can't believe I haven't written a review of the Cracker Barrel yet!I was in AZ a few mos back with family and boy is it different from Seattle. Not in a bad way - Who doesn't enjoy warm, sunny weather? But I did notice that there are an awful lot of strip malls and chains here in AZ. Driving around looking for a place to eat we passed PF Changs, Chilli's, The Cheescake Factory, etc. All kinds of run-of-the-mill, not so special/memorable places to eat that you can find anywhere else in the US.But... the Cracker Barrel? I had to go again. The first (and only other time) I'd been to a Cracker Barrel was when I was 8 years old and visiting Orlando. That whole trip was so memorable for me because I spent it with my grandfather who took me to Disney World. One night we had dinner at a Cracker Barrel and I'd never experienced anything like it before. Rocking chairs on a big porch out front while you wait for a table, a gift shop full of stuff that you want - but maybe don't need - and classic, All-American fare. For cheap, too!As we pulled up to the one here in Peoria I spotted the rocking chairs and smiled broadly. It was just like I'd remembered! Through the gift shop you could reserve a table and shop while you wait. I found a cute AZ souvenir for my sister and within a few mins we were seated at a big table in a room that resembled a massive country-home family room. It was cozy, it was interesting, and the menu kicked ass. I got the Cracker Barrel dinner special that included a variety of small plates so I could try a lot of different items. There was pickled okra, chicken and dumplings, ham cooked two ways, corn, mashed potatoes, and more. Even though the food was just slightly above microwave meal quality, there was something comforting and awesome about it. Nothing blew me away but I just loved it anyway. Maybe it was the memories of being small and having never seen a Cracker Barrel before, maybe it was just the name Cracker Barrel... who knows! But I'd still pass up all those other chains for a Cracker Barrel no matter where I am.
Sidewalk Cafe=We should have gone to Le Burger Bistro, but by the time we sat down and peeked at the menu, we were too tired to change our minds.  The blue cheese & mushroom burger I had was good (and huge), but the onion rings were kind of icky and the restaurant felt like a throwback to Vegas in the 70's...as if time had stood still.  Plus, we showed up to dinner at around 7pm and it was like eating during the Early Bird Special at Denny's.  There are plenty of better restaurants within walking distance...I recommend you go elsewhere.Used to be a 24 hour cafe.  Now it's limited hours.  Food is okay but it's on the strip and cheap.Yelp's 365 Review Challenge 2015 #9 - #365 A classic Vegas favorite that's soon to close because Caesar's Palace has filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy. It's a pity that Caesar's Entertainment has nothing but bad news for their deteriorating resorts and layoffs to come. I'm glad to have had my last breakfast here as it will be the last of the classic affordable Vegas eats on the strip.My Dad was a Platinum Casino Rewards member so fortunately we didn't have to wait in the long line. Service was speedy and our waitress was very attentive with refilling our drinks. You had an option to eat on the buffet or order on their menu. Food was just average as well as the prices. It didn't break the bank at all. From the buffet I had scrambled eggs, bacon and some toast. Nothing over the top just the basic breakfast eats. The rest of my family just ordered from the menu and I wish I had done the same thing because their buffet had really limited selection. It was just like eating at your typical Denny's American Diner with some keno on the side. But unfortunately it will all be demolished for a new eatery with increase prices.
Shanghai Club=I went to the Shanghai Club for dinner recently with my BF... it was a weeknight and we chose it based on location and the fact that I felt like Chinese Food.  (It's conveniently located right off of the 101 and Shea in the Pima Crossing shopping center).  I'd been once before and it was decent so I was open to going again.  Since my last visit (which I realize now was over a year ago), they remodeled the place... it's actually a step up from what I remembered in terms of decor.  The service was attentive although the atmosphere was pretty quiet.  It was perfect for what were in the mood for: a quick, casual dinner.  We started with a bowl of Wor Wonton Soup for 2... I liked it because it had a generous amount of shrimp, chicken, veggies, and wontons inside a light broth.  I ordered the Spicy Eggplant and J went with the Thai Curry Chicken (and we shared both).  Portions were pretty big but we managed to eat almost everything... We both agreed that the Spicy Eggplant was much better than the Thai Curry Chicken; I'd suggest going to a Thai Restaurant for Thai Food and going with a more traditional Chinese entree if you visit Shanghai Club.Overall, Shanghai Club is just above average... I will return eventually... but it's never going to be a regular in our restaurant rotation!****For healthy eaters, Shanghai Club offers steamed dishes served with sauce on the side and brown rice too - you gotta love that!
Bongo's Bar & Grill=I've been performing here for a couple of years.  There's a comedy show every Wednesday and it's free.  But enough of the shameless self-promotion...Bongo's is a bar and grill.  There's a huge TV for whatever popular game is on that night.  (I rarely watch because there are COMEDIANS onstage!)The service is ultra-friendly, especially Kara.  It's typical bar food, but they have a huge menu.  There's something for everyone.  Me?  I'm quite partial to the cheese fries.  Yup.  Fries with cheese-in-a-can.  It's my guilty pleasure every time I perform there.There are regulars, like this one lady who feeds her kids then stumbles over to drink.  If you want a friendly, down-to-earth sports bar to hang out in, go to Bongo's.  If you're hungry, go to Bongo's.  If you want to laugh and eat and drink, go to Bongo's.  On Wednesday nights.  :}
India Palace=I just had a wonderful conversation during lunch with the friendly owners, Mr and Mrs Dosanjh.I commented that I always see them eat their own food right from the buffet table (unlike the staff at many chinese boofays), and he was happy to proclaim that he and she eat lunch there everyday -- his son two meals a day!And why not?  It is delicious, wholesome home cooking, after-all. When the people who created -- or inherited -- all of the recipes tell you that everything in the restaurant is made *from scratch*, while literally breaking bread with you, it really has a special meaning.I got to share my story about my grade school buddy, and let them know about Yelp.  Their friendly interaction is something I've already come to expect from the rest of the staff, so it was nothing shocking.Today's assortment of dishes was excellent, with all of my favorites, a spicy bean sprout dish I'd never seen before, and also more fresh veggies now than in my original review.  Veggie-potato fritters (can't remember the indian name) were zesty and not greasy at all.  Chicken curry had so much savory flavor without being spicy at all, it literally made my mouth water just sniffing it.  The Tandoori chicken aroma grabbed ahold of me in the parking lot where I first smelled it as I stepped out of my car, and had me floating through the air like a cartoon riding on the scent vapors, all the way into the front doors.  When the people who created -- or inherited -- all of the recipes tell you that everything in the restaurant is made *from scratch*, while literally breaking bread with you, it really has a special meaning.Fellow Yelpian Ryan C. organized a little luncheon at India Palace yesterday (see, it's not only ladies who lunch, sometimes it's us manly men, too:)I made the pilgrimage from OTowSco to the near reaches of NW PHX and met up with Ryan, Rand, Norm, Daren and Wes and we talked and laughed and we hit the boofay at India Palace pretty hard:)Pretty good boofay...not terribly extensive as far as the food selections go...but the available items were all well prepared, well seasoned and my lunch ended up on the happy end of the "Crap to Quality Ratio":)As we dug into our first plate of boofay, Ryan said "I hope everybody filled up on bananas and cheese"...a humorous comment about lubricative effects of the food at India Palace:)In a happy coincidence, he almost exactly described my breakfast yesterday morning...4 bananas and a  1/2 pound of Tillamook Sharp Cheddar:)When you get to be my age, the adage "never trust a fart after 50" isn't just a funny thing to say...it becomes one of the guiding principles in your life...so, bananas and cheese...all the curry's and tandoori's  and vegetarian squash/potato stuff and vindaloo's with basmati rice and naan in the joint aren't going to break through this particular firewall:-)Oatmeal would have just been throwing gas (no...gasoline, not GI tract methane) on the fire (oh wait...that would work too:)Although I'm not generally a fan of boofays (I really do think the "sneeze guards" seem to be just a suggestion to many of the people that I see rooting around in the boofay) this was a pretty clean and well maintained boofay...I had 2 plates of pretty decent Indian food and got a chance to relax for few minutes with friends and have a little light conversation:)Things stayed sealed up tight and I sailed through the rest of my day with the confidence, dignity and demeanor of a man who knows that everything is safely locked down:)Lunch boofay the other day with my brother and his coworker was one of the best tasting lunches I've had here.My recommendations: ask for Garlic Naan instead of plain, but be ready for fresh garlic breath all afternoon.Go several times, since the about half of dishes they have out vary from day to day.  I've discovered that sometimes I'm not a fan of the items, but have been glad to try new things, since I've also found some unexpected gems. (don't expect me to remember the indian name, though)Don't worry about crazy gimmicky coupon sites that just want to spam you all day.  This food is superb at the fair price they charge normally.  The owners are great, and staff is friendly and eager to serve.
Pamplemousse Le Restaurant=My absolute favorite restaurant! Pamplemousse is for lovers, it's classic romantic ambiance is unlike anywhere else. It is small, cozy, dimly lit, intimate, and the food and service is pristine without being stuffy. No paper menus-- the menu is recited by the staff tableside. The crudite, perfectly done duck confit, and profiteroles are all amazing, and the classic hard boiled eggs served in giant French country baskets in the shape of roosters are slightly paradoxical (as is the eclectic gay icon decor), which all add to its whimsical vibe. Substantial wine selection and knowledgeable sommeliers. Veg or fish option available (usually pasta or halibut). Parking is limited for Vegas, but there is abundant street parking. Ditch the strip and take someone you love here immediately!The French really is for lovers...and Pamplemousse is exactly the kind of place you bring two lovebirds together.  Seated very cozy in a corner booth, lights are dimmed perfectly to only enhance the lovelier features of one's face.Not only is a printed menu presented to us, the waiter recites the specials of the day.  Do pay attention because there are quite a few and you do want to hear the details of each.We love to sample and taste a variety of foods, so what better way than a few appetizers to indulge our French desires?A complimentary bucket of fresh vegetables and a dipping sauce satisfy the lack of greens in decadent dining.* Scallops appetizer - one of their specials.  Two giant scallops in butter and lemon that just melts in your mouth like a perfectly cooked scallop should.* Frogs legs appetizer - blah.  Nothing can help these dried out legs with no taste.  Tough pieces of meat and just a disappointment. Do avoid.* Escargot with fresh Garlic and Parsley ($14) - It's not the snails that are so delicious, it's the butter and garlic concoction that has you dipping your bread into each little pool of heavenly goodness.  And don't be shy about mopping up all the tasty drippings, the waiter will be sure to bring more crusty bread just for the occasion.* Homemade terrine of fresh Foie Gras ($18) - Reminisce of our trip to Paris...a side of peppery arugula leaves to challenge your palate.  The salt and pepper mixture only complements the foie gras that leaves you wanting more.  The cooked apples were unmemorable in enhancing this indulgent dish.* Grand Marnier Soufflé with Vanilla Ice Cream and Whipped Cream ($13) - Beautifully presented tableside with the soufflé popped and ice cream and whipped cream are scooped on top as they melt and drip into this not-overly heavy dessert just perfect for sharing.Service is top-notch with beverages refilled without requesting and silverware brought out for each dish.  Don't bother coming with a large group, enjoy this more romantic atmosphere with someone that you plan on getting intimate with! (Photos of our appetizer journey posted!)Wwwwwwwwwooooooooooowwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww!!  This place is awesome!!!  My wife and I went for our first wedding anniversary after such great reviews of this place and it was right on the $.  We couldn't believe the nice place we walked into on that side of Sahara but it's like you're transported into a different place where no one is in a rush..a meal is a MEAL and it's first class all the way.  Our eccentric waiter, Keifer, was funny and entertaining although I am not sure how anyone remembers the specials of the day after 1 listen...so many to choose from!!My wife and I both agreed the French onion soup was the best we've ever had!!  I never actually thought it could ever be this good!  We went with the specials for entrees.  I got the fruit de mare which consisted of pasta with shrimp, scallops and a lobster tail with lobster cognac sauce over the whole thing...unreal....and $29 to boot which isn't bad at all!!  My wife went with the veal and that was incredible.  Best veal ever.  We also pre-ordered the amazing baked souffle and they also gave us a nice extra dessert for our 1st anniversary.  All in all just a wonderful way to eat with the one you love.  Keifer suggested we come back for our 2nd anniversary but I honestly think we won't be able to wait a whole year to come back!!!French food can tend to get overly complicated and annoying, however this classic provincal french restaurant is perfect in everyway.It opens only for dinner @ 530PM Located on E. Sahara, we were greeted by the head waiter and then allowed to chose where we wanted to sit, we chose a quiet knook that was hidden for an extra romantic touch.  Le Pamplemousse only serves wine, champagne and beer.  We ordered the baked goat cheese in a puff pastry and the tomato basil soup along with this Frank Sinatra favorite, panchetta with fettucini alfredo (not french but great with the pancetta).  The soup was better than I ever thought, I hate tomato soup but this was great. The goat cheese was very good also. Our main course was a peppered filet and crispy duck leg confit with duck breast. My boyfriend couldn't finish eating the entire filet, which is usually unheard of and the duck was falling off the bone (in a good way) and cooked perfectly with a great reduction sauce to accompany.For dessert our server, Evan, brought us out a grapefruit (pamplemousse) sorbet which had champange in it and also a creme brulee for my birthday.  Sadley they didn't sing, but it was fantastic anyway. It felt as if all the creme brulee I had ever had were a joke compared to the one at Pamplemousse...so amazing. Also to top it off, we ordered the Lava cake, which was also very good, per my boyfriend.We cannot wait to go there again and eat something completely different.  The wait staff is great and entertaining by telling old stories of old vegas, make sure they show you the bullet proof walls where mafia used to sit. :)If this restaurant were in a different place with a different wait staff, this would be a five star review all the way. The food is exceptionally good.But let's start out our dining experience with getting to the restaurant. The website states that it's across the street from the monorail. Technically, it is. It's also about two sketchy blocks down Sahara. Is it me, or has the area surrounding the Strip really become run-down over the past 10 years? My colleagues were looking at me like "what kind of crappy restaurant are you taking us to" as we made the trek. When we walked in, it looked like a place that once upon a time was a nice place, but it's struggled to keep up with the times.Then there's the service. A smarmy know-it all Maitre 'd/waiter took care of us. Don't ask him for anything that's not on the menu; he will yell at you. The rest of the wait staff looked like they walked in from the set of Goodfellas... you got the feeling that these guys had screwed up everything they had ever done so they were thrown into the restaurant where they could presumably do less damage. So we had bread thrown onto our plates and were constantly being growled at when we weren't listening to the Maitre'd berate the staff for doing things wrong. At any moment, I expected Gordon Ramsey to walk in and start filming Kitchen Nightmares, call this guy a donkey, and march him outside to cuss him out.But the truly bizarre moment came when our customer (who I will admit is Chinese and her English is fair but not great) asked if she could have a salad as an appetizer. Smarmy guy got downright rude and told her no, we don't serve those. We will give you a vegetable plate. Customer looks at us quite perplexed. Our international sales manager tried to explain that the lady would like a salad, and perhaps you could prepare one for her? "Alright, fine, since you don't understand how we do things, we'll just do this now..." and pulls out a giant basket of vegetables and some dijon vinaigrette to dip it in. "There, now are you happy?"  Several awkward minutes after we had our fill he returned to take our order.The entrees and soup were nice. Had the service not been so awful, we might have a better feeling about this place. The much hyped chocolate lava cake was overcooked, so there was no molten center. It was a poor ending to a comical meal. 15 years ago when my boss last dined here, this was a fantastic restaurant, but like the neighborhood it's in, it's in decline.I had not been to Pamplemousse for many years, so, armed with a Groupon, a return visit to this venerable classic French restaurant seemed in order.  The dimly lit interior, with mauve and white linen tablecloths gives off a romantic vibe, but tables are very close together.  There was a small hiccup at the beginning of our stay when I was told that I had to choose between use of a Groupon or Open Table reservation but could not receive credit for both.  That solution was easy, since Open Table reservations made through the Yelp site are not eligible for point credit, and I had already paid out money on a Groupon that was set to expire within just days.  So, the Groupon was used, and the Open Table reservation was cancelled by the restaurant.Nevertheless, we were seated right away, and not too long afterward were presented with a very nice basket of crudites and a mild Dijon Mustard Dipping Sauce.  I enjoyed fresh red cherry tomatoes, celery sticks, cauliflower florets, radishes, green onions, hearts of Romaine, onions, and zucchini.  I saw that the couple at the table next to me was also served green olives on a silver dish, but we were not.  Complimentary slices of bread were good and crusty, and, with butter spread over them, enhanced the early part of the meal.  The crudite basket substitutes here for salad.Escargots Bourguignone featured very good escargots in a buttery, white-wine-based, Scampi-like sauce served in recessed areas on a ceramic plate likely made for the purpose of serving this or a similar dish.  French Onion Soup was very hot and pretty good, but cheese clotted into knots inside the broth.  Lobster Bisque contained no chunks of lobster, and was just okay.A serving of Chicken Cordon Bleu was small but quite cheesy, filling, and very good.  It was accompanied by a Madeira-wine-based sauce, but I chiefly enjoyed my entree just as it was, along with a good Puff Potato and an excellent-tasting creamed spinach-topped cooked tomato and very good Bechamel-covered Cauliflower.I arrived with a mindset to have a leisurely meal, and it was that.  But, after a long interval with an empty glass, I asked for more Iced Tea, and instead my glass was simply taken away.  Later, after another request, the Iced Tea was restored.  I don't think the delay getting Iced Tea refills was intentional.  The Consumer Electronics Show was in town, and the restaurant was bristling with demanding patrons.Ending our meal on a great finish, Diane and I enjoyed a made to order Chocolate Lava Cake which was simply superb.  With a hot chocolate core, this moist cake resembled a cross between plum pudding and a souffle, with the hot Chocolate Sauce tasting almost like rivulets of Hot Fudge.  The dessert was even better mixed with Vanilla Ice Cream and whipped cream.Owner Georges Laforge even dropped by our table while working the room to greet his guests.  This was a very pleasant meal, and a fine way to spend a Friday night.  This time I won't wait so long to return for my next dinner visit!Pamplemousse is different than the average Vegas restaurant!...and I love that!Come here for an old-school (almost vintage Vegas) feel!Come here for outstanding service!Don't come here is you are all about French food and want an incredible meal :(The food is A-Ok.  If you do come here, go for the tasting instead of ordering entrees.  I have a soft spot in my heart for duck confit.  I ordered the duck...I was not happy.  I also tried the Grouper in a classic French White wine butter sauce...This was much better.Some people may also feel that the atmosphere is cheesy...I preferred to think of it as classily dated.The wine list is not that extensive, but has a better price-point than most French places in town...but again may leave the French wine snob in your group wanting.Wow where to begin? I guess at the beginning. Ok so im a chef from san diego in town leaving tomorrow and remembered i had a groupon i needed to use before I left in the morning. So I   made my reservation at 430 for 530 on a Sunday night and explained I had a groupon. The maitre'd explained 6 would be better or the kitchen and I figured no problem. Plan was; apps and wine to start. Had a big late lunch but we wanted some munchies for one last, all night run at craps and roulette. Upon arrival I noticed the parking lot was full so we ( girlfriend and I ) were excited because we figured full lot means great place. We were seated by Keifer ( the maitre'd ) into a small corner. I didn't mind. There was tinsel hung on all the walls. The place reminded me of a kitchen nightmares episode but again I wanted to see the menu. I looked at the menu and know my girlfriends tastes so I ordered for us. Perry , the beyond pompous waiter, took our order of foie gras, fettuccine ala George, and French onion soup and a Stella. He asked " all appetizers " I said " yes sir " thinking nothing of it. He whipped himself around quite flamboyantly and proceeded to walk away. I thought nothing of it nor was I made aware of any issue. A few moments later Keifer brought out my gf's Stella to the wrong table and being that I was so close to the table next to us I heard him mention something about you can't just order 3 appetizers. My girlfriend caught it aswell and we knew they were talking about us. Perry proceed to come behind Keifer very quickly and hiss something about that's the wrong table. And as they walked to the back the looked like 2 children arguing an making a scene in what is already a small place. We were laughing at their behavior. It was embarrassing for both of them but perry was the one heard throughout the place " I CANT BE 2 PLACES AT ONCE!!! ". Really, priceless. Lol. So we now realized there was an issue perry was too afraid to bring up to us so he asked Keifer to take care of it. Now Keifer comes over all red faced and sweaty from embarrassment w the Stella to the correct table and tries to explain we either have to order an entree, a 5 course or a 4 course prefixe menu in order to use the groupon. I tried to explain it was fine we didn't NEED to use the groupon and it was all good but he kept trying to sell me on his " wonderful salads that come w the pre fixe menu " lol. I tried to explain again we weren't hungry for mains. We wanted to try the apps and be on our way but again he was insistent we order main or the pre fixe. He was insistent " there has to be a balance in the bill " which I though was funny because I had already told him we didn't NEED to use the groupon. By this time I was insulted embarrassed and about to get angry. (The guy opened the menu on my charger plate, stood next to me and WALKED ME thru the menu!!  Wtf!?! I'm a grown man I can read. Lol. ) So I told him we'd gladly pay for the beer and be on our way. Keifer explained the beer was on the house and there would be no charge. So I said " I thought there had to be a balance on the bill?" My girlfriend was more insulted than I was so she left the full beer there. I've been in the food biz for 13 years. Never have I seen anything so mishandled. A) why not address the issue of a main course before or while I'm making my order??? I told you twice I had a groupon B) after explaining we would pay for it out of pocket would you continue to try to sell me something I emphatically refuse. C) why didn't the management word the ad more carefully?? This is the fine print: Reservation required. Dine-in only. Must purchase a food item. Party must have 2 people or more for $50 option, 4 people or more for $100 option. Not valid for online bookingI think 3 apps constitutes a " food item " why not write " an entree must be included in purchase "? Or " there must be a remaining balance AFTER you've used the coupon in order to use this coupon" ?? It's pretty simple.  Bottom line: 1 star because I can't give 0. Yelp won't allow it. The food was probably great but ill never know cuz ill never go back and ill tell everyone I know everywhere I can no to either. Thanks for reading. Happy dinning.Oh la la! Pamplemousse is so fancy and so French, but not in a snooty way at all!  This is very much a Vegas throwback to the days of yesteryear.I have visited Pamplemousse (which is Grapefruit in French, in case you were wondering) on several occasions.  I had heard about the place growing up in Vegas and was excited the first time I ate here, as well as the other visits I have made to this restaurant.  It is definately a different dining experence than what I am used too, but it was fun.  This restaurant is one of those places from Vegas' heyday that you always hear about.  Bobby Darin (the singer) actually envisioned the resturant and helped it get it started! Don't you just love Vegas trivia?  So yes, this place has some history to it, which is rare in this town.  The wait staff here are what make the place special.  They have a ton of stories about the place and really make the whole dining experience come to life.  If you are lucky enough to get Keifer as your server, you will hear all about the stuff that went down in those walls.  It is fun to hear stories about Frank Sinatra and Debbie Reynolds and all of the celebrities of the past.  I am a youngin' and wasn't in Vegas back then, but I love the history of this town, especially juicy gossip!  Everything I have tried here has been really quite good.  It isn't going to be your fancy, ultra modern French food that you find in restaurants today, but I think they cover the classics of the cuisine.  If you like escargot or haven't ever tried it and want too, try it here.  I really enjoyed the way Pamplemousse prepared it...I mean it was soaked in butter and garlic, what isn't to love?  My foodie friend loves the Coq au Vin and has gotten it both times were have gone together. I always get the steak because I am all about the meat, but the bites I have sampled from friend's dishes have always been yummy.Pamplemousse is located off of the Strip and doesn't even look like a restaurant, so you have to keep your eyes open for it when you are driving by, otherwise you will miss it for sure.  It is right off of Sahara at the entrance to a neighborhood, so keep that in mind when you are visiting for the first time.  Also, it is a small place, so I would recommend getting some reservations.  They are on OpenTable, so you can even gets your self some points booking it yourself, if you have an account  (OT is free, so get an account, if you don't have one already!).  You can even request Frank Sinatra's table if you want.  It isn't always available, but worth a try anyway.  Pamplemousse also pops up on Groupon from time to time, so check there too, because it never hurts to save some cash.This was without doubt the best menu offering of Restaurant Week that I experienced, and every course was very well prepared.We began our dinner with good French Bread and a Basket of Crudites in which all vegetables were fresh and crisp.  Also served was an excellent Olive Tampenade.  There was a long wait for fresh-brewed Iced Tea; when it arrived the tea was strong in tea flavor, and my second glass of it was noticeably smaller than the first.  Go figure!The ambiance was romantic, as Diane and I sat at a small wraparound love seat booth.  This is great for a second or higher date or a happily married couple, since legs are likely to be locked together throughout the meal.Escargots Bourguignone were lemony, garlicky, and delicious.  An added La Soupe A L'Oignon Gratinee with Swiss Cheese (for I'll never pass up French Onion Soup offered at a French restaurant) was hot, cheesy, and well deconstructed.For my entrée I selected Veal Medallions Normande with sliced Baked Apples, Light Calvados Cream Sauce, and Mixed Wild Rice.  The veal was well pounded and barely fork tender with al dente carrots.  It was delicious with the sauce and the best moist and fluffy Mixed Wild Rice I have had.  Meanwhile, Diane enjoyed her veal medallions with very good fluffy Mashed Potatoes.   For dessert I enjoyed topnotch smooth and rich Belgium Dark Chocolat Mousse with heavenly Frangelica Chantilly Cream (Oh yeah!), while Diane delighted in Grand Marnier Souffle with both Vanilla Ice Cream and Chantilly Cream.  During this RW meal, portions were big for one diner, with a four-course meal generously priced at $50.13.  Service was attentive and excellent.  Above all, diners got to select among several fine dishes from an inventive and creative menu that was quite well executed in the kitchen.Five stars all the way!I have been wanting to go here after 4 years.It's been a number of factors as to why I hadn't gotten around to it, but with a belated Valentine's dinner (due to my work schedule), I finally got to experience the restaurant.I can honestly say that it is one of the finest dining experiences that I've had in Vegas.The place is extremely "Old Vegas".  It just looks it.  It just feels it.  From every facet of the building.  Ambient with low lighting, it looks like a little French cottage on the inside.  The waiters wear tuxedos, and refer to their boss as "Chef".  The pacing of everything is leisurely (not that you should rush it - clear your schedule for the next two hours to get the best experience, as European dining is not rushed as it is).Keifer was our server.  You want Keifer.  Keifer will take great care of you.The missus and I got the tasting menu, a five course experience that is... well, let me explain it better through the food.Course 1: Crudites.  Not a salad, but a big bucket of various fresh vegetables with a Dijon vinaigrette.  Everything tasted garden fresh and was plentiful.Course 2: I tried a pastry filled with various seafood, and covered in some amazing sauce.  The missus has escargot.  Both were devoured instantly.Course 3: Granite. French sorbet doused in champagne.  I nearly cried at this point.  Between three excellent courses, and the prospect of two more, I think I discovered that Heaven was actually a kitchen.Course 4: I got the prime beef.  The missus got the duck breast and leg.  The beef  sliced like butter upon contact with my knife, and came with fries and this rich gravy.  The duck was incredibly sweet and moist.Course 5: I got dark chocolate mousse.  The missus got the creme brulee.  The mousse was rich and delicious.  You could just taste the cream in the brulee.All of this went with wine, of course.The tasting menu does offer other selections (check the website), just so you know.  The service was impeccable.  The music selections for the atmosphere were appropriate.  I got exactly the experience that I wanted from this restaurant.  This really is one of the "Top 3" dining places that I've experienced in Vegas.There are meals that are simply made, and then there are meals that are crafted.  Pamplemousse understands and respects food as an art form.If you have not been as of yet, set aside the money and time to go.  I often make glib, witty comments about places I venture to, but I can only say this for here: Go.  Just go.Sacrebleu! What a hidden gem. This French restaurant is off of the the strip, near the Stratosphere. Apparently, it's been around since 1970 and judging by the decor, I believe it.We did the special 5 course menu which was only $56 and if you've done tasting menus around the strip, you know that's an incredible deal. It comes with a vegetable basket and baguettes, an appetizer, a palate cleansing dish, an entree and a dessert. The lobster bisque appetizer was amazing. Definitely the piece de resistance. I had the lamb shank for my entree and it was aight. I would try something else if I went again. The Grand Marnier soufflé for dessert was also outstanding. Tres bien!Considering the only employees in the place was one waiter and one chef (who I assumed was like the chef in the Little Mermaid, back in the kitchen singing "Les poisson les poisson, he he he, hoh hoh hoh!"), we had excellent service. The waiter played the part of host/busboy/server/food runner all in one and he was great. A little bit of a character, but he had that situation.My only complaint was that it took like 20 minutes to get our check after the meal. I think they like the guests to stay a long time for ambience but I was ready to peace out at that point. 5 courses is a two hour affair and my attention span had maxed out.Overall this was a fun, kitchy experience. I recommend this place to anyone looking for unique night out.It took a Groupon to bring me back...curse you Groupon! I looked at what others on Yelp had said at the time of this Groupon purchase...I think that some of my friends may have been high when they ate here.  Either way, I came again and I've learned my lesson this time. The food is two stars across the board. There is no evident French technique in place here.  They aren't using outstanding, quality products. Their sauces aren't balanced. They have a pathetic selection of French wines for a French Restaurant. etc., etc, etc.The only reason to come here is for an atmosphere that you won't get at most places. Le Pamplemousse is true to its 1976 roots. A two-toned pink & burgundy palette dominates the space, and though the carpet was changed a few years back it looks and feels like everything else has remained untouched...literally your ass gets the "privilege" of feeling the springs in the cushions if you are "lucky" enough to sit in one of the booths. We had this "opportunity" for a few minutes until a cockroach decided to come out from behind the cozy booth and tried to take up occupancy next to my wife. This happened shortly after we arrived.  I wish we had taken this occasion to vacate the premises. Alas, we were very hungry, had a Groupon, and failed to make the most of this auspicious circumstance.We shared a Creamy Tomato Soup, heavy on the cream--this was the best part of the meal for me. My wife enjoyed the raw vegetables in the crudité a little more. For our entrees we shared the forgettable Duck and Wild Mushroom Ravioli and caped the experience off with a heavy yolk included soufflé that we left unfinished just as we had to every other item we shared before that other than the soup. At any price it was pretty bad.  At a hundred dollars some would consider it awful for sure.
Bazic Bar & Restoyaky=Bazic Bar & Restoyaky serves up what I would call Korean bar food.  It's located on the second floor of the Pacific Asian Plaza.  They have a bunch of random Asian dishes that are meant to be shared with friends over a few drinks.  Their specialty though is their fried chicken deep fried in olive oil!  As a result, we had to try it!  We got the Leg and Thigh Special, 5 pieces for $7.95.  It came with a basic cabbage salad with Thousand Island-like dressing and a side order of pickled daikon.  The BF is the connoisseur on fried chicken and he thought it was pretty good.We also got the Sweet Rice Crust Soup with Seafood for $17.99.  It's good enough for about four people to have a small bowl each.  The waiter will come with a big bowl of about four to five rectangular pieces of rice crust.  And then he'll pour the thick soup (more like gravy than broth) onto the rice crust.  It's filled with octopus, calamari, and veggies.  Pretty tasty and the rice stays crispy because the soup is so thick.  (There's a Chinese version called sizzling rice soup, except that soup is more broth-like and the rice may not be in rectangles.)We didn't get any kind of bowl to grind our own sesame seeds like lena d. or Mike C., so maybe that's only if you order the katsu, which we didn't.  And we also came for dinner which I think is a different experience too.I'd definitely want to return to try out their other Korean goodies, but I would prefer going with a larger group so you can order more stuff.  Their portions are meant to share, so it's hard when it's only the two of you.The artwork in the bathrooms makes for interesting conversation (especially the men's room) and there's also a Luxury Music Studio in the back.  (Is that for karaoke?)  There's also a little bell to buzz from your table should you need the staff, that way you don't have to wave them down or go looking for them yourself.Then swing by next door to Dessert Avenue to have some Fried Ice!  Yum!Overall, 3.5 stars.Its Monday evening around 9pm and I get a call. I've just gotten home from work and changing out of my work uniform. I get a call from these chicks that I work with and they are going out drinking. Drinking? On a Monday night?! Freak! Apparently, its their "Friday" since they have Tuesdays/Wednesdays off. Sure I answered. I don't start work until noon the next day... So it should be fun.They chose Bazic, which I have seen many times before but never eaten, so I had no complaints. One of the chicks is Korean so she will know what to order... And they've been there many times before... I arrive there around 10:15ish and the place is pretty crowded. Not standing room only crowded but most of the tables were full. The Korean chick asks if I like beer, and I tell her that I'm not a big fan (due to an incident when I was younger) but will drink hard liquor if we order it. Whats cool is that they have this large beer tube (google it) if you like a lot of beer. Instead of the beer tube, we just ordered a 40 oz bottle of Hite, which is Korean beer. I've never had this beer before and was pleasantly surprised how clean it tasted. There was absolutely no after taste. Leo likes it! The Korean chick also ordered food for the table and the rest of us just went with it.We ordered the sliced pigs feet, spicy raw squid, spicy ramen noodles, udon noodles, and two more bottles of Hite beer. The food was amazingly good. To be honest, I personally wouldn't of ordered these dishes if I was ordering, but I'm thankful that the Korean chick knew what she wanted and knew what was good.Overall we had a good time of eating, drinking, laughing, and drinking... Haha. They actually have Karaoke rooms in the back which you can rent out to get your jam on. Unfortunately, we didnt get a chance to put on a show. Darn. Maybe next time. Would I come back? Definitely.Vegas Yelp UYE Karaoke Extravaganza!SITREPWhat a good time it was at Bazic Bar & Restroyaky.  After the wonderful Fremont Street Experience, we knew there would be some Yelping madness we would want to engage in after Midnight.   But after that crazy fantastic time, we indeed wondered if we would have any "juice" left to manage this task as we planned to attack the early morning (Midnight - 3AM) with renewed vigor!!SETUPOrganized by our very own Seattle Yelper Clover A., this proved to be a good location to have a "meet-up" with Yelpers from different cities.  [First we had to get there!  LIMO RIDE:  While at Fremont Street Experience, we went by the Golden Nugget, and there was a bored limo driver who looked at our crazy group and decided then and there that he wanted to be part of our madness.  We had to get to Bazic QUICK for set-up, and so we negotiated with him, and he shot us over to our Korean Karaoke Bar destination in no time.]BAZIC ROOMSIf you are familiar with the Rock Box in Seattle or Rurulala in Sacramento, it is a very similar set-up.  Big rooms.  Nice physical plant layout of couches and sectionals.  Decent serviceable equipment.  It had the potential to be Karaoke at it's very best.  KARAOKE BOOKS & EQUIPMENTHowever, the books were JUST in Korean!  There were some English-language inserted pages, but that was an obvious afterthought.  In addition, we were somewhat limited in our selections it would have appeared, but we did manage (for the most part) with those selection of English-language songs in the narrow band of yellow and green pages.  And then there was the tech itself - such as the controls - which was all overlaid in Korean language and no English to be found.  Made it difficult for us to read the stereo & equipment controls and it did become a nuisance to have one of the guys come and adjust/modify sound levels, feedback, distortion-issues whenever they did arise instead of being able to take care of the issue ourselves.MY PERSONAL FAVESI got to belt out my Def Leppard and Linkin Park Standards, so I was dam happy.  I even smoothed out the end of the evening (er, morning) with the Beatles "Michelle", so it was all good.THE FOOD & DRINKThere was an ample supply of all kinds of chicken appetizers, beer and sake to keep our energy up, so no complaints in this department.  There were also some sweet-potato fries which were powdered with sugar so that they were sweet, and not savory the way I prefer them.  Ah well.  I still ate them and enjoyed them because I haven't met a sweet potato fry I do not like.PRICINGInteresting to say the least:  unlike the Karaoke I hit in Sacramento, San Francisco, and Seattle, this establishment has a sliding-mechanism that takes into account the consumables factor.  If it was just Karaoke, the room rental was $40 per hour.  However, if we consumed more than $100 in drinks & food, then the room rental would go down to $20 per hour.  Since there was a group of about 14 of us, and we were there from 11am to 3am, we made sure to get more than $100 in consumables that we would probably have gotten anyways, but Clover and I did buy drinks at the end to "get us over" that last bump to $100 so we could default the hourly rate down to $20 an hour.  [Note to self:  I HATE doing math when I'm trying to concentrate on singing!]KARAOKE CABBIES!Now this was different: it was 3AM at the end of our stint, so this place does something interesting for it's customers - the servers / chefs double as cabbies!  SERIOUSLY!  Since we are "quite a way into" Chinatown-Vegas, it would take a while to get a cab out there.  However, two of the establishments associates got two vehicles:  one to take part of our group back to PLATINUM, and another to take my group back to STRATOSPHERE.  A total win!THE LOWDOWNAll-in-all, a good experience.  I don't like to nit-pick the little things, and also have great respect for cultural traditions and cultural business-choices.HOWEVER, given this establishment wants to do business with a mainstream English-speaking demographic (it's in Vegas, USA, after all), and given that one could reasonably expect that there would be a preference for more mainstream English-language music by a significant customer base of English-speakers, I'm just saying it would be prudent (as a BUSINESS owner or BUSINESS manager, etc.) to make sure to supply better books and readable tech that is readible in English.  If on the other hand, the point is to discourage English-speaking patrons from coming here to enjoy Karaoke, then don't change a thing.  Frustrated customers just won't return.  However, we hardcore Karaokers will find a way to manage, even if a bit more grumpily.All-in-all, a 2-STAR experience.  However, I'll be honest & say I am bumping it up to 3 STARS because of the courtesy the gentlemen showed us in getting us back to our hotels at the end of a lonnnnng night in the weeeee hours of the morning.
Jersey Mike's Subs=There is a $6.99 lunch special from 11-3 weekdays that gets you a regular sub and a drink. Not bad since most of the regular priced sandwiches are about $7 anyway. The inside is clean and it's being run by a father-son team. Father was wiping down tables and making sure customers were good the son was slicing meat and cranking out sandwiches. I like the original italian and get it pretty much every time. The sandwich has a good amount of different meats and just tastes good. This place is way better than Subway any day. I get it "mike's way" with the addition of mayo. Get a shore points reward card and start earning free food with every purchase.This Jersey Mike's in located in kind of a cramped shopping center. I've stopped by this location a couple times now and and am glad to have a decent place to grab a sandwich for lunch when in the area. The employees inside are nice. I don't always remember my Shore Points Card, which accumulates points with each of my purchases towards free food, so it's nice that I can just give my phone number and they can look it up easy that way. I don't know if this is the only location that does it because I haven't seen it at other locations, but currently they offer a daily lunch special from 11 am to 3 pm that costs $6.99 and gets you any regular sub and drink. I like the "Original Italian" and "Club Sub" the best. Mike's way of course! The Italian has 6 different meats. I'd rather pay a couple dollars more to eat subs here rather than Port of Subs or Subway because the meats, breads and cheeses just taste better. They also had some "Chocolate Chip Cookies" which I never knew they had, so I got some and they are good!You can place your order over the phone or online (you have the option to enter your shore rewards points online) for convenient pick-up.This location recently closed for a brief time and has reopened under new management. I have been in a few times since the change and it's been a much better experience. I used to come by a lot and liked the previous owner and his son but they really let things go in the end sadly. The current people working were really nice and made my sandwich just the way I asked. The giant size can easily be shared with someone else or used for 2 meals. My favorite sandwich is the Original Italian and I get it Mike's Way with the addition of mayonnaise. They take coupons here and run different specials. Having the shore rewards is a nice thing if you eat here often because you can get a free sandwich or wrap after so many purchases. I'm glad that the rewards program is still around and hasn't changed. I decided to do a review update so others know about the change in owners, quality of the food and service and that they are finally back open.
Subway=The tally was $13.35 before my son said he would like to add a soda, now the total would be $15.14 said Perla, the sandwich maker/cashier, presumably she was reading off the register as she said that.  As I was paying, I asked her if the receipt was in the bag, she said yes.  Seeing I was ACTUALLY looking for the receipt, she said: "Oh, it's here". The receipt was on the register all along and it seems like she didn't want to give it to me at first, but she grabbed the receipt from the register finally.  As she was handing that receipt to me, she asked how old my son is, (she wasn't friendly at all prior to that moment), so I answered her question meanwhile forgetting to look at the receipt.  Back to the hotel, I happened to see the receipt, it was ACTUALLY $12.65 as shown on the pic.  I also realized she didn't give me a receipt for the sandwiches I bought the night before and she overcharged me more than $2 as well.  I know it's only a few dollars, most ppl don't even bother checking or asking for a receipt.  I see a lot of taxi/limo drivers here, and I wonder how many ppl have left without a receipt.  Speaking of receipt,  Subway has a slogan, "If we don't give you a receipt, you get your sandwich free".  The register automatically printed their current sale code which I wasn't aware of, each Subway has it's own price and various codes from time to time.  Either way, discount or no discount, we pay the receipt amount, plus whatever the tip amount, isn't that the whole point of receipt?  We had been here before, the service was good generally.  Hopefully this is NOT their common practice.  Two stars for them opening 24 hrs.
Las Pupusas=Maybe my taste in men has helped me feel less awkward in situations or restaurants like this. Having once had a Hispanic boyfriend allows you to escape the awkwardness of being the token Asian in an establishment, but when you end at Las Pupusas with your Asian brother, the discomfort is inescapable - in fact, it is exponentially multiplied. With the intrigue of pupusas lingering, the both of us were willing to endure the uneasiness. We sat down - ordered a plate of plantains and three pupusas - mix, cheese and pork.The Mexicans have tortas, the Venezuelans have arepas, the Salvadoreans have pupusas. All of these things have some similarities: take some dough, throw in either cheese, meat or both of these things, and you're done! But mind you, even though these are only $1.75, they are huge. When they came out, we were stunned. Eating them, the flavor is just as big the pupusa itself. The mix with beans and cheese was the best in its simplicity. The cheese was another favorite with that salty cheese that oozed out and made a crust. The pork was not our favorite - its texture grounded to a pulp and flavor just being 'meh'. Throw on some of the slaw they give you, and one pupusa could be a meal in it of itself. The plantains, on the other hand, were also just as good. Perfectly fried up, fresh, and teetering between sweet and savory - they were my first plate of plantains and certainly not my last.Consider me a Hispanic food hipster, but as I grow older, I am now branching out into these lesser-hyped, obscure cuisines. It's places like this that perpetuate my interest and hunger to try the new and unknown. While initially uncomfortable, I now take the amount of discomfort to directly correlate to the deliciousness of a place - in this case, it's damn good.
Yunnan Garden=Superb! And a shocker to some degree. (more on that in a bit)Can't argue with the reviews already given.I don't know what region the food is of origin, but Spicy is it's foundation.And it's tasty!!A Saturday lunch.3 tables active. Two other couples, and one big family. I was not the only tourist looking patron. But I was outnumbered. And thats GOOD!Maybe 15 total tables in the place available. Nice size in my opinion.Good clean room too.Yes, new owners. "wun yeer now thank yoo" (no offense intended)Spicy & Sour Noodle Soup, $5.95 (like spaghetti w/ chili broth, and herbs)Wontons tossed in chili sauce, $5.95 (YUM, nice garlic hints)Sliced Chicken w/ Szechwan Sauce, $8.95 (YUM YUM, spicy smoke flavor  trails off w/ a sweetness, YUM)Yes the rice is done w/ perfection as a goal. Details, all in the details.The "shocker"........This menu is as authentic as I've ever seen. Reminds me of times in San Francisco's Chinatown when I might have ordered off a menu to be refused by the wait staff  "No no no no, shaking their head". You see, I'm a big tall Gringo looking dude......they were just protecting me is my guess. Saving my fragile "naive" palate.Yun Nan Garden offers what I think you can't get many places in SF anymore. At least spelled out on the menu, here they are.Chongqing Spicy Frog.Blackened Pepper w/ Eel.Three Flavors (Squid, Fish, Black Sea Cucumber)Chickens Intestine w/ pepper sauce.And the afore mentioned Pigs Ear.Don't be afraid though. You will just be missing out on some tasty meals.I like the location, easy in, and easy out. Great parking!!Just below Spring Mountain, 3rd driveway on the right off Valley View.Yun Nan will be on your right, far corner of the first building. (mid lot)7 days a week, 11am - 10pm.And they have 2 additional locations:Monterey Park, CA. 301 N. Garfield Ave.Hacienda Heights, CA. 1229 S. Hacienda Blvd.Enjoy!!For my first review of 2009 I really wanted to find a 5 star place but I guess this one will have to do! It's hard finding 5 star places anyway so a 4 star review is just as good I'll say.For some odd reason, everywhere else besides Orange County seems to be able to get Yunnan/Sichuanese food right. San Diego has awesome Sichuan cuisine and now we've found something in Vegas as well.We decided to try this place out after reading the reviews and I'll have to say, yelp didn't lead us astray!We started off with the appetizer buffet station where we got the ma la sliced beef and the tendon. I saw this table with a plate full of chilis so I asked the waitress what it was. She told me it was the 'spicy chicken'-- la zi ji. We got that cuz I wanted something super spicy. Then we got a dish for the young man, dried tofu with Chinese chives. I also like 'mi xien' a Yunnan speciality. Sichuan province and Yunnan province border each other so the food is similar --spicy as hell, mostly, featuring the Sichuan peppercorn.The la zi ji kicked my ass! I mean I can eat spicy foods -- ie habanero -- but man this spicy chicken was super spicy. Maybe because the entire dish was filled with dried chilis -- about 70% chilis to 30% chicken. I was glad I ordered the other stuff which contained no chilis to balance out our palate.When your mouth is in flames, take a few bites of the mi xien and drink a few sips of the broth. It really calms your mouth down.All in all, a really nice meal. The gals there were sweet and came around many times to make sure we were enjoying our meal. I would definitely come back here again!!Yun Nan Garden was brought to my attention courtesy of my fellow yelpers.  The Husband and I tried once before to check out this 'authentic' Chinese restaurant hidden away in the Spring Mountain area but arrived when it was closed.We were on a mission and had a (small) crowd with us.  Taking no reservations, the five of us arrived around 6:30 pm on a Friday night.  With plenty of tables available, the waitress seemed conflicted as to where to put us.  In the end, a round table in the middle was where we ended up.Our menu:   * Boiled Beef with Szechuan Sauce ($9.25) - Arriving in a large bowl, pretty tasty stuff that you need lots of white rice to eat with.  Lots of spice and oil, but pretty good and is amongst their specialties.* Wild Pepper Tofu ($7.85) - Soft tofu with lots of flavor and gravy.  Another good choice!* Eggplant in Garlic Sauce ($7.85) - Really good as well, although not the favorite of the bunch.  * Local Style Dry Pot Chicken ($9.25) - At least that's what I think we ordered...it arrived with a fire going on beneath it.  Others really enjoyed it, but it was okay to me.* A pork or chicken dish with green bell peppers - It was a good dish, without the gravy.  It had hidden heat amongst the green bell peppers because green chilies were hiding in the dish.I had low expectations on service, and you really don't come here for service.  No one spoke or understood any English, which was a major problem.  Only Mandarin speaking only!  We thought they forgot about a dish because it took so long, and we think they really did.  It eventually came out at the end.Our second visit was a party of five again and this was our menu:* Boiled Fish and Beef in Szechuan Special Sauce ($10.25) - Any of their "boiled" things in Szechuan special sauce is a good choice.* Wild Pepper Tofu ($7.85) * Local Style Dry Pot Chicken ($9.25) * Potato ($7.85) - The Husband saw a lot of people ordering this on our first visit, so we had to get it.  It's potato that's been stir-fried without the spice.  It's a light dish and we liked it so much that it inspired us to make it at home.  (It comes out different at home, more like Chinese-style hash browns when I do it!)* Sauteed (Garlic Sauce) Seasonal Vegetable ($7.85) - The vegetable was snow pea shoots which are always good when cooked with garlic.* Pork Intestines - Stir-fried with lots of veggies.  It was good, but we just ordered too much food this time around.Service was better the second time around, only because there was one waitress who spoke and understand English very well, AND she spoke Cantonese, which helped since my mom was there.  But everyone else who worked there just looked at us as if we were aliens whenever we tried to ask about anything.  I also had some problems getting my credit card receipt.  They gave me one to sign, but nothing to keep.  When I asked for it, it was a big deal to get a copy and I think it's because they really didn't understand that I just wanted my credit card receipt.Go with a large group so you can try more things.  One dish for every person should be an ample amount.  The food is pretty authentic and there's a definite heat in it.  Most diners are native Chinese and this place definitely fills up by 7:30 pm.  Just don't have any expectations with service or anyone speaking English.3.5 for really tasty and authentic Chinese food but negatives for crap service.(Pics posted!)After beginning our recent dinner at a nearby restaurant and knowing that we were going to leave unfulfilled, The Husband and I suggested Yun Nan Garden to our friend who is always curious to try something new.* Boiled Beef with Szechuan Sauce ($9.25) - We knew we wanted something with their specialty sauce, and we've ordered this dish twice before.  It's always been a winner, so why not go for it again.* Bean Curd Fish with Szechuan Special Spicy Sauce ($9.25) - We asked for a recommendation for fish, and the waiter suggested this one.  It has a very similar sauce as the beef dish, but it also has peanuts in it too.  Loads of spice again!* Home Style Potato ($7.85) - We wanted a potato dish and thought it was the same one we've ordered before where the potatoes are cut into strips and stir-fried.  This dish is different since the potatoes are sliced and boiled, it sits in a chicken broth with jalapenos.  It was good, especially against all the heat from the other dishes, but we wished we had gotten the other potato dish instead.When you eat at Yun Nan Garden, you have to be prepared for the heat.  Our friend said he liked spicy, but had no idea it was going to be this spicy!  Bring on the water and tissues!  And for anyone hoping to skip the rice, impossible here because you need the white base to slop all the spicy goodness to slurp up!Service was better this time.  A male waiter seated us and took our order.  Another girl brought our food, beverages, and our check over.  We had minimal contact with the wait staff this time, so maybe that worked in our favor.We had plenty of leftovers from the two spicy dishes, but then it  might be because our friend couldn't handle the heat! Haha!3.5 stars.BEST CHINESE IN VEGAS. When all the Chinese tour buses drop off their passengers at Yun Nan, you know this place is good.FOOD: Chinese restaurants in Vegas are either unauthentic, too salty, or leave a bad taste in my mouth. Yun Nan is authentic and will kick your butt with flavor. There is so much to choose from; the menu is huge! I haven't had the opportunity to try more than a few dishes. The Noodle dishes I could live without.... but their Mapo Tofu is the best in town and their white fish seafood dishes are ALL delicious.SERVICE: The service isn't bad. Its just hard to communicate with the waitresses. They don't speak a lot of English. If you can't speak Mandarin... just order using the numbers. CREDIT CARDS: Minimum $20I have been to many Chinese food spots in town, and this place blows them away!Reason why?  My personal reasons...I prefer Vietnamese food when I crave fresh, Japanese food when I want flavor, and Thai food when I want spice and depth.  Yunnan delivers on ALL three!We tried the stir fried Eel with dry pepper....the eel was very flavorful and the dish was spicy!  It had a nice consistency and tons and tons of taste going on!  The portion was huge and they did not skimp out on the goods!   Check out the pic :http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yun-nan-garden-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#roxUo3o8u3yg7px8D7wgawHad the salt and pepper shrimp, and it was good, just thought it would be full head on and done a little differently.  Also thought they would/should have been larger at $12-13 for the plate.  I wouldn't order these again, unless I can specify that I want head/shell on.  Pic :http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yun-nan-garden-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#7M6BnswF5BV-esTvISeL8gLastly, tried some fried egg and green onion dish.  It was light and flavorful.  Wanted something that wasn't spicy, and this filled in well.  Also a generous portion and inexpensive.Service is typical authentic Asian.  Just friendly wave if you need anything and you will get it fast....just don't expect service like you would in an American establishment (auto/fill drinks, check on food, getting bill etc), and you will have a great time.I WILL be back again.  Even their non spicy dishes are packed with taste, and blow away any other spots I have tried in town thus far (Chinese food wise).2 words describe my experience at Yunnan: pleasantly surprising. I'm half-Chinese and I'm very picky when it comes to Chinese food and Americanized "Chinese" food makes me sad.A lot of Chinese people told me about this place but I've been putting off giving this place a try since I heard most of the items on their menu is spicy. I don't do spicy.I was browsing through the menu and sure enough, 90% of the items on the menu had not one, but two peppers next to their name! Yikes! I saw the spare ribs with garlic didn't have the two pepper symbols and I love garlic so I chose that. The garlic was minced and crispy fried and the flavor was just great covering the spare ribs. I sprinkled the fried garlic on the other dishes we got including the MaPo tofu. I think tofu is the only thing I don't mind eating spicy. It was good and it took several bites before my nose started running.The shocker on the menu was the Chongqing Spicy Chicken. The big plate was at least 50% red peppers. I was very afraid and highly intimidated until I tried a small piece of chicken. The chicken was lightly breaded, fried and super crispy. Reminds me of my Chinese grandmother's fried chicken. To my surprise, it wasn't spicy. I mean, there was a bite to it but not a kick. It was absolutely delicious and enjoyable. This was my favorite out of the dishes we tried and I'll get this again.The service was ok. A lick of Chinese might help you a lot. I was watching and listening to Shawn and our server's interaction and it wore me out!I don't know what's happening here. This is one of those places that you read all the glowing reviews, you go try it yourself, and you think you must have gone to the wrong place. Upon sitting down, the waitress came over and waited at our table for us to decide on a dish, little weird but ok. I chose the Kung Pao Shrimp and my friend chose the Yunnan Style Dried Beef. What came out was shrimp in a pile of oil and my friends dish was even worse. It tasted like beef jerky from a 7-11, and it resembled Shit on a Shingle. $11.99 for each dish and PLUS they charge you for rice $3 extra. I didn't think my shrimp was spicy at all. My friend couldn't finish her plate is was so salty. Then the waitress comes back around with our bill and stands there until we pay. This situation was bizarre. Too many other places in Chinatown to ever give this place a second try.This place gets better and better. And busier, I might add. This is Szechwan Chinese food at it's finest. Short recap - this is a get in and get out kind of place. It was INSANELY busy last night and they were trying to just get people seated, served and get them out. Again, don't expect excellent customer service here, just expect the best Chinese food you may ever have here in the states. It's the best. We brought my boyfriend's parents here last night and they haven't had much authentic Chinese food, and they were very impressed. The best thing we had last night was the Rice Noodles w/ Sweet and Sour soup and spicy pork stew. I can't even begin to tell you how amazing the taste is with this soup. It's a perfect blend of spices, herbs, the cilantro that gives it that nice topping and just the pork itself...mouth watering. We also shared:Cured pork with green beans, which was okay. It was more like cripsy dried out bacon. It was the only thing I've ever ordered that I wasn't a fan of. Cumin Lamb, always a favorite. Not too spicy, but the cumin in it is very strong. So be prepared. Garlic Shrimp, good, but not my favorite. A good dish if you can't have soy. Chongqing Spicy Shrimp, awesome. This is one of the most recommended dishes and I see why. It is friend with tempura, but it's so bold, spicy and full of flavor.Overall, I absolute LOVE this place. It's so good and the prices are still very reasonable for the amazing quality this place has. They raised the prices by $5-7 per dish. But again, it's so worth it. Be prepared to wait, but also be prepared to be amazed. This is Chinese like you've never had it. You'll never wanted Americanized again.This spot is hidden around the back of a Chinatown plaza next door to Mayweather's boxing gym, but had a bus full of Asian tourists parked outside? Found that super bizarre.Ordered takeout based exclusively on the Yelp photos: won ton soup with spicy pork and the garlic pork spare rib dish. Didn't glance at a menu prior, surprised my total was $25. Other reviews state that prices have risen in recent months, and it certainly doesn't make me want to rush back.WON TON SOUP WITH SPICY PORK: Generous portion, boxed with noodles and dumplings separate for at-home assembly. Spicy broth with plenty of cilantro and pork, tasty dumplings and generous portion of noodles.GARLIC PORK SPARE RIB: A little underwhelmed by this. I'm a huge garlic lover and the plentiful crunchy-fried version in this dish was sweeter and more understated than I expected, it's used more for texture. Did not finish this dish.Service was typical for the area. Location is clean and organized. Other reviews mention the tour bus visits being a regular occurrence, which would be a deterrent for me. I might return for a dine-in visit another time to try different dishes.
Chipotle Mexican Grill=Was in the area and was hungry for Mexican Food, so I stopped by this Chipotle to grab some lunch.  It's a typical Chipotle.....if you've never been to one before here's a breakdown:You select your menu item...ie Burrito, Taco, Quesadilla.  Then you instruct the employee making your meal on what ingredients you'd like on/in your item.....ie Pinto/Black Beans, Guacamole, Sour Cream, Salsa etc.I decided to go for a Chicken Burrito w/Pinto Beans, Guacamole, Sour Cream, Pico de Gallo, Hot Sauce, Rice.  To wash it down, I got a bottle of Izzle Clementine Soda.The Burrito is huge and was delicious.  I really like their Hot Sauce at Chipotle, it has a nice kick to it.  I devoured the entire Burrito, then enjoyed my Izzle.Overall Value - I always get great value for my money at Chipotle.Will I return?  I like this location, I'm sure I'll be back.
Koi Restaurant=I was expecting to see a celebrity dining here like they do in LA, but we were there on an early Sunday evening and there were only a handful of other tables occupied. Like its other locations in LA and NY, the interior of the gorgeous restaurant is zen-chic. The floor to ceiling windows provided an amazing view of Bellagio Lake. We asked if we could be seated in the lounge facing out to the lake because there were several tables inside - and all unoccupied, but unfortunately they were "reserved for friends of the owner." Disappointing. Our booth was pretty nice though, and we were able to get a glimpse of the water show every now and then. The food was pretty tasty, although nothing was mind-blowing. It may have been because we stuck with ordering rolls, and not the signature dishes like miso black cod or Kobe beef filet mignon. Our friendly server suggested his favorites to us. We had the scallop roll, dragon roll, baked lobster roll and crispy rice topped with spicy tuna. The baked lobster roll with cream sauce melted in our mouths and was hands down our favorite. The crispy rice with spicy tuna was supposed to be their most popular dish, but the texture of the spicy tuna was odd. We weren't quite sure why it was so popular. It was super spicy though! We ended our simple meal with a simple dessert - mango mochi ice cream with blackberries. I'm sure Koi is hot and happening on Friday and Saturday though, so get your fabulous self over there on those nights! They totally have the potential of being 4+ star worthy.The first evening we arrived in Las Vegas for my birthday weekend, my wife and I wanted to eat something different but familiar so we weren't overwhelmed to question where it came from. Luckily, after our first afternoon outing, we went back to our hotel room at Planet Hollywood and found a discount coupon for 15% off dinner at Koi sitting on top our pillow. I bet it was strategically placed there by housekeeping, but nonetheless a great idea. I immediately made reservations for 6 PM through Open Table to take advantage of accumulating dining points and to make sure we had a table. No problems there.The restaurant is located upstairs next to Holly Madison's Peepshow. A couple of tables and sofas were placed before the hostess check-in booth. When we arrived for our reservations, the restaurant was dimly lit. The host walked us through the restaurant and sat us in a booth. At 6 PM, there were only two other couples and a handful of people at the sushi bar, but I figured people were still sleeping or getting ready for their evening events.The waiter was very polite and courteous, answered all our questions, and made suggestions after we asked what was good. After reviewing their extensive menu, we ordered:Seafood Miso Soup $8, Miso soup with bits of clam, squid, tofu.Crispy Rice(Tuna) $16, Uniquely made, these Tar tare styled tuna over a crispy rice sushi were a hit with us. The rice was crispy outside and chewy inside.Fresh Oysters on a Half Shell(6) $24, 6 flavorful fresh oysters over a bed of ice garnished with lemon slice and dipping sauce.Edamame $5 Lightly Sea Salted.Grilled skirt steak $28, Piled high like a log cabin, the succulent slices were stacked 3x3, garnished with Alfalfa and paddling in a tangy reduction sauce.Bowl of white rice $3, Got rice?Total Bill = $77.18 before tip. Priceless.Each appetizer and entrée plate was nicely decorated and simply beautiful. Pictures are proof, but tasting is believing. Therefore, I must encourage you to visit Koi at Planet Hollywood in Las Vegas. My first experience here demands a return visit the next time around.Came here with my girlfriends and hubby after watching a show at Planet Hollywood. Some guy stopped us downstairs and gave us a bracelet for the club later that night. We decided to check it out and ended up going in for the happy hour. I'm not really into sushi but I must say I enjoyed them here. Chef Tim sent over some shots for all of us then dessert samplers after dinner. I enjoyed my time here but did not stay very long for the club portion. I do plan on coming back for happy hour if we ever see another show at Planet Hollywood.This review is for my experience in the main restaurant (as opposed to the lounge, which turns into a nightclub at 10:30pm).  Ambience:  great!  Loved the decor and setting. Service:  friendly,  attentive, not pretentious--our server was great!!!!   The bar service would be my only complaint and it wasn't enough to dampen our evening whatsoever.   The pours where a little weak and as the restaurant became more crowded, bar service slowed down.  Food: delicious!!!!   Black miso cod, skirt steak, teriyaki chicken (for me:) and tons of sushi.  Sorry, not sure what rolls we ordered, but all the die-hard sushi eaters at the table had zero complaints and every crumb got devoured which praise.  The cod was a stand out as was the shishito mashed potatoes.  I loved the whole experience and can't wait to go back.Such a letdown. My big 30th birthday dinner bonanza here felt more like a 29th birthday whatever. You know the difference I'm talking about. Don't act like you don't!We thought 8pm reservations on a Saturday night would mean a full restaurant, trendy vibe, and the restaurant's best servers. You know, 30th birthday-worthy treatment. Nope. If there were other people dining at Koi, they were nowhere near us. The lighting felt like being at the bar at 2AM when the fluorescents are kicked on to scoot everyone out. And our waiter had no clue what was on the menu. He tried describing the sashimi the way a freshly-pimpled teen might try to describe wine. "There's like notes of flowers... and the texture is like, raw..." Just stop.The sushi was also underwhelming. We did the larger chef's selection and a few specialty rolls. The pieces on the chef's selection were really fresh tasting and worth the order. However we all felt pretty disappointed by the specialty rolls. Not a ton of flavor, but a lot of mayos and crunchies. Like what you get at the supermarket. Or Walgreens. Fortunately the cocktails were strong and smoothed over the meal and service; but for over $100/person I needed more. Yes 'need'. It was my 30th birthday and I NEEDED that top notch celebration. Skip the namesake of Koi and try another sushi restaurant on the Strip.
Metro Pizza="Hot Dough in So Faux"When I was a kid in upstate New York every Saturday was pizza night. Dad would call Jocko's in East Rochester and order a large pepperoni and a large green pepper. Ten minutes later we'd pile into the Chrysler Newport and forge through snow, rain or sleet to get them. Once back home Dad would set up the bridge table for Sis and I and the two of us would watch TV in one room while Mom and Dad watched in another. My sister and I would watch Emergency and the parents would watch Lawrence Welk or something. It was always fun and each of us looked forward to it every week.Well, these days I live in So Faux, Nevada, aka Las Vegas, where precipitation is almost as rare as an occupied strip mall.Dad's Chrysler is gone and I drive a Crown Vic LX with leather interior, known city-wide as THE Chick Magnet.I have a bridge table in a closet somewhere but I usually eat dinner over the sink.And Saturday night television? Usually whatever movie is on HBO or Showtime if I'm feeling too cheap to order Butt Sluts on PPV.Sadly, take-out pizza is no longer a weekly affair. Somewhere along the line I started buying frozen pies at Smith's. Some of them aren't too bad, you know. DiGiorno, Freschetta and Paul Newman's come to mind. Even Tombstone makes it into my oven sometimes.Yet every so often I miss the days of take-out pizza on Saturdays. It just isn't the same with frozen pies, metal sinks and Butt Sluts. And on those certain days when I long for both yesteryear and fresh goodness, I pick up the phone and call Metro. And do you know what? It's always the same: One large pizza. Half pepperoni, half green pepper.My mouth waters as I drive the Crown Vic LX with leather interior down 215. And after parking THE Chick Magnet I'm always warmly welcomed as I stride into Metro Pizza, usually by two bubblicious brunettes with scintillating smiles. The brunettes even offer me complimentary soda if I'm early, and they ALWAYS ooh and ahh over the Crown Vic LX with leather interior. I just smile and say thanks and pay the 22 bucks. I even beep the horn as I leave the Metro lot, the brunettes at the window blowing kisses as I fade into the night.Sigh.They pine for me.(Or is it just the car?)But, alas, they cannot have me(or the car), for my heart belongs to Butt Sluts.The scent of hot pizza drives me wild as I traverse home, so much so that I frequently open the windows regardless of the weather. Desert wind tears at my thick mane, the drivers beside me jealous of my looks, locks and LX.Upon returning home I do what many consider unthinkable: I place the pizza, cardboard and all, inside a 250 degree oven. I like my pizza hot, and thou shalt not microwave Metro.On occasion I blister my mouth but do not care. It's worth it. The chewy crust is to die for and I love fresh pepper slabs, the pepperoni reminscent of those sub-zero Saturday nights near Lake Ontario. I even forego the sink when I consume Metro and sit at my cherrywood table, sprinkling slices with oregano and red pepper, staring at the telly and wondering if Jocko's is still there. I suppose I could find out but I prefer not to know. I might be saddened if it wasn't, or disappointed if it wasn't good anymore. I even scan the channels for Emergency and Lawrence Welk. But I never find either. Probably just as well. Someone once said the past is in the past because that's where it belongs. Perhaps they're right.Anyway, when I'm done eating I always have enough for another meal, which usually means brunch the next morning. Sometimes I eat it cold, sometimes I heat it in the oven. Depends on my mood and the temperature outside. But rest assured, it's always as good the following morning as it was the night before.Even if Butt Sluts or Lawrence Welk isn't playing.I'm a fan and didn't even try their pizza.I've had Metro Pizza bookmarked, then I took it off, then I put it back on, then I finally tried them.  I was seeking this place out every since I read an ROTD on it from last November.  Never found the time and wasn't in the area to ever try them until now. Let's start with the restaurant itself.  It's bigger than I expected. One thing missing from most reviews is the size of this restaurant. I expected a small typical pizza joint with your checkered red/white tablecloths and gaudy decorations all over. Boy was I totally moted!!  This restaurant is classy, spacious, clean, and well lit.  Because of what I experienced walking in, I assumed a pricey menu.  My first thoughts, sure glad Terri R. is paying for lunch this time. Then I reviewed the menu and was brought back down to earth.  Bang for your buck for sure! Metro Pizza has a large selection of pizza, stuffed pizza, salads, calzones, platters, dinners, and one type of soup (Minestrone).  I didn't want to feel too heavy for lunch, so I opted against pizza this time.  I'm not a huge pizza guy anymore anyways.  I chose their Chicken Parmesan Sub w/Garlic Fries ($9.25).  This is served hot, melted cheese, and just the right amount of sauce on top of about 8 oz of breaded chicken breast.  Simply delicious, portions big, and the chicken breast tender.  I washed my parmesan sub down with their garlic fries and glass of water.  In about 10 minutes, my meal was devoured.  One thing about Italian Restaurants, either there's too much sauce which sometimes sogs out your meal or there's not enough where you're wanting more.  At Metro, they had it just right, not too much, not too little, and definitely not too thick.  Since I'm a new fan of Metro's Parm Sub, I'm sure their pizzas are good too.  Service was great from start to finish. Our food was also prepared and served with little wait. Voted "The Best of Las Vegas" 7 years in a row!!!  They obviously don't need my review to keep their status, but they got my 5 stars anyway.I asked my kids what they wanted for dinner. Well what do you know they wanted pizza. Shocking news. Well, it just so happens that Metro Pizza just happens to be in the same plaza we were in so off we go.As soon as we come in to what appears to be a full house, we are greeted warmly by the host and showed us to our table. Right away our server hands us menus and gets our drink orders. Great first impression so far.We order the Domenica Salad, Garlic Romano Fries, and a large thin crust half Pepperoni half Gotham. The Domenica Salad has romaine lettuce, salami, ham, provolone, cucumbers, onions and tomatoes all tossed in their own house dressing and served with a fresh-baked garlic knot.The Garlic Romano Fries has shredded romano cheese and real sautéed minced garlic. No vampires will attack you after eating this.And for the star of the show, a large thin crust half Pepperoni half Gotham pizza. On one half you got just about every topping they have and on the other half just your basic pepperoni. The crust itself seemed like it was hand tossed at first sight, but as soon as you take that first wonderful crispy bite, there is no mistaking it is genuinely thin crust. With thin crust, usually a lot of toppings tend to make it limp. Not this style, the overall slice kept its shape. As for the service, lets put it this way, if you don't have to ask for anything, that means everything was on point. This was one tip I didnt mind going over the standard. Great service is few and far in between it seems so I dont mind showing my gratitude.So there you have it. Great food and great service. Finding both in everywhere you eat is usually a low percentage. If I am in the area, I will ask my kids.........no what I meant was I will tell my kids we are having pizza.10 years ago Metro would have gotten nothing but 5 stars from me all around. As I know they make a great pizza-pie, I have recently been let down by the consistency. I placed an order for delivery not too long ago. My total came out to $50. They forgot my ranch and gave me the wrong pizza. When I called to politely let them know, I was offered $15 credit. The large pie they messed up was more than $15, so I am confused on why this amount is appropriate credit. Basically a way to get me to spend more money there, cuz ain't no one eating there for $15 solo. I was grateful for the credit, but expected more. The quality of products, and customer service is almost always at 100%. I have never had a complaint about service. The prices have gone up over the years, but at least they have not cut corners on using high standards.Over-all, yes I will dine here. But it use to be my 1st choice, and I can't say that now. There are quite a lot of old school, east coast style, pizza joints popping up around town, Metro may be the OGs of their trade, but they still need to step their game up to keep up with the competition. Especially in Henderson, when Bistro pizza is right around the corner.
Tropical Breeze Cafe=Starved yes... They gave me a  hoof off of a steer! You call this Prime Rib? It's a dried up piece of meat...harder then beef jerky.... Not even close to Prime Rib... It needs dozens of Au Jous to soften this rock hard prime rib.And...quit calling this hoof....prime rib...I guess eating food in Vegas is like gambling with your tummy.Maybe something might be good in here... But...I suggest you use your stomach to find out. My stomach is out for temporary repairs...
Bomberos Cafe & Wine Bar=Thank you to future yelper Christina P for insisting on meeting at Bomberos for our lunch meeting today.  As Ayesha said previously, it is adorable, unique, intimate, and perfect!  Since we met for a late lunch, it was pretty quiet in the restaurant and we received personal attention from both Oscar and our waitress - i felt so special!Since Christina P is a regular, I asked for her favorite items (pretty much everything on the menu), listened to the salad of the day (which sounded delicious), and then since I was having a hard time making a decision, we decided to split a tuna and a veggie panini sandwich.  It was a great decision... the kitchen split them for us and the were both delicious!  The tuna is not creamy; it's flaked and the perfect consistency with capers and vinegar - we had manchego cheese melted along with it... like a Cuban version of a tuna melt!  The bread was toasted perfectly - crunchy on the outside and moist and soft on the inside.  The veggie version includes artichoke hearts, roasted red pepper, tomato, basil, and manchego cheese too - everything tasted fresh and light.  Although the servings are pretty generous, so I managed to get full without cleaning my plate.  Paninis are served with potato chips (the kind that taste crunchy and salty and you know they are not good for you but you eat them anyways) and pickles (which I requested more of because they were also so good).It was lunchtime, so we stuck with water but I will have to return to enjoy their wine selection in the future.  That, and the live music, back patio (which is beautiful), and the welcoming atmosphere and friendly service...Thanks again, Christina, for selecting Bomberos  - I enjoyed your company and our lunch very much!I was in Bomberos for breakfast this morning, and I was told they now carry Coca Lite!  So much better than Diet Coke - I had no idea I could find it anywhere in the US!  How great is that?Also, Bomberos is now using MJ Breads and Tammie Co pastries... not too shabby, huh?Wow wow wee waa! What a nice place.  Didn't eat any food, but I will next time, I promise.  Tried three wines, including their special house Pino, and all were fabulous!   Great patio, ---no REALLY great patio! Good service. Rockin' good looks. On a Thursday night, only about 50% full, so it's not like Postinos where you have to wait 30 mins for a table.You might say I'm a "regular." I absolutely love Bomberos and can be found there with my laptop on a Saturday morning for breakfast, having a lunch meeting during the week, unwinding at the bar after a long day at work or on the patio enjoying the company of friends late into the evening. (Although, not THIS week, because it appears they are closed from 12/22 - 12/28. Making up for it with a free wine tasting on 12/29 though...)Truly, there's little to add to what's already been said:Hands down it's the best patio in the Valley - water features in the summer and an awesome fire pit for the chillier months.Live music on the patio most Saturday nights gives people a chance to relax or get up and get their Latin groove on.Inside is urban chic but unpretentious and lets you feel cool for being there no matter how cool you are.Breakfast portions are generous and the coffee is awesome (said the self-proclaimed coffee snob).  By the way, my favorite breakfast option made a short appearance on the menu but can still be ordered: salami and Swiss omelet - egg whites only with home fries... yummy!Lunch offers a half salad - half sandwich option and there's always a "salad of the day." (I can't pick a favorite panini or bruschetta because they're all good but I can say putting manchego on the tuna makes it even better!)Free WiFi and it's VERY quite during the day making it easy to have a meeting or catch up on some work.I remember sitting on a crate in the building that is Bomberos before it was a wine bar and drinking a bottle of whatever my friend picked up from Orange Market at the corner and dreaming about what it would be one day... Christi and Oscar have done a superb job in their first year and I'm so grateful to have such a great place as my neighborhood hang out!Bomberos, a Norwegian based group, playing what they like to call "obscene, disgusting punk", was formed in 2002......ooops my bad, Bomberos are Fire Fighters in Chilie...incidently my second favorite south american country..stopped here for Chrissy's surprise birthday party hosted by the fabuloso Amber and Teh "Cool Kids"...so what is my take on Bomberos? well i found it to be very comfortable, i feel kinda lame to write a review on a "Cafe & Wine Bar" if i didn't actually eat or drink anything. but the environment alone deserves 4 stars. it is truely an enchanting spot. everything they served looked awesome and there was nothing but Hmmmm's and "Yumm" and from the previous reviews i tend to believe that most of them are not over exagerated.  i look forward to returning sometime soon. for what i consider to be outer limits of my bubble, it's certainly not off limits. i will let Bomberos put out my fire any time. as long as it's with a nice Chilean Lager.Yelp!So, I had been here before, for all of about 10 minutes and wasn't able to sample any food or beverage. On Thursday last week I was able to get the full experience. I was taken here on a date. That's right, someone took ME here. That was a nice change of pace. We got there around 8 on a Thursday night and the place wasn't too busy. we sat inside right next to the roll up doors. The place used to be a firehouse. So there was perfect weather. We started the meal with drinks. She ordered a bottle of Sauv White. I finally got to try an Argentinian Malbec, full bodied(well that is what the waiter told me). The malbec was very good. I tried some of the Sauv, it was very tasty also. I usually don't like whites, but it wasn't too dry. We shared a small bowl of marinated olives. Kalamata and Green olives, very good. I ate most of it. For the main course I had the Salami & Manchego panini with pesto. OMG!!! This thing was awesome! Very toasty and buttery. I had half of it with a salad. The salad was simple greens with flaky tuna. Now, this could have been canned tuna and anyone who knows me, knows I hate this with every ounce of my being. With that being said, the salad was excellent. The tuna was marinated in vinegar and capers and took away a lot of the nastiness. It had a simple balsamic vinaigrette on it. I was very impressed with the food and ate every bit on my plate. For dessert we split a flourless chocolate souffle. It had a very large, ripe strawberry on top and a huge dollop of fresh whip cream. If you like chocolate, get this and you won't be disappointed. We finished up the food and headed to the patio. The patio is cozy with several fire pits and lots of seating. This would be a great patio for a day drink or to unwind at night. I have always wanted to try mate,pronounced Maw-tay (thanks Z), a traditional South American tea. It was very good, but on first taste reminded me of a cigar. Ask them for honey and put it in. Very good. They bring out a thermos type thing of hot water so you can just keep refilling. I highly recommend it. This is a little gem in the heart of Sunnyslope. Great patio, very warm interior, great service, and great food. The food menu is small, but I bet everything is done to perfection. Large, interesting wine list for the wine aficionados out there.  I love when little local places blow me away.I absolutely despise feeling like I've been judged not worth someone's time due to their assumptions about my financial status based on my outward appearance.And this time it wasn't even by a girl in a G-String on a pole!Okay, so anyone who reads my reviews knows I'm not regularly dining high on the hog, but don't the beautiful rich people slum around in workout gear sometimes, too?So after a recent run down Central Ave, one of my K9's and I decided to partake in a little of the awesome concept Donald S calls RETOXIFYING.  A little snack and some wine out on the patio sounded great to me, so I went over to Bomberos.It was early in the day, so they weren't at all busy, there were only a couple of other customers either inside or out.  I walked in and out between the patio and the inside seating area several times over a few moments, purposefully contorting my face into the restaurant patron's "where do I go?" look.  Since the server's work station and door to the kitchen area were in that narrow hallway, I actually was in the way of the couple of servers who were there trying to move to and from the two dining areas.I did not get greeted at all, either before or after I had to stop one of them and ask for a menu. I sat and reviewed the menu for a several minutes, all the while continuing my confused, helpless patron routine.Nothing.With nary a peep out of the servers, I walked away.My tendency to frequent $ instead of $$$$ places comes less from a lack of means than it does from my countless experiences that what you get for your $$$$ is often not worth it.  If I have a 2* experience at a $ restaurant, I may be a little upset, but if I have a 2* experience at a $$$$ establishment, I'm going to be postally pioughd.Bomberos may treat you like one of the Sunnyslope Elite, if you show up looking like you are one of the Sunnyslope Elite.  Maybe then their overpriced wine and admittedly tasty looking nosh might seem worth it.  (It IS all from South America)  Without friendly or at least minimally cordial customer service, they can stuff it up their stuffy butts.I ended up stopping at a nasty dirty nearby Sonic (limited options due to the dog, remember) where both the order-taking electronic voice and the rollerskate-less carhop both had the decency to ask me how I was doing that day.Still loving Bomberos...~ They've added some pannini including a cantaloupe, prosciutto and mint which is a refreshing choice with a salad. ~ $8 now for salad, panini or bruschetta OR a 1/2 pannini and half salad at lunch! ~ Happy hour from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. gets you 1/2 price wine by the glass or $4 for beer (all imported).Finally made it to Bomberos for an after-dinner glass of wine.  I was really surprised at how small the place is!  I love that!  And the patio is so nice we opted to sit outside.  Seemed like a good idea at the time..until we realized it was 95 degrees outside and the breeze had died down.But I enjoyed my glass of white wine.  I couldn't tell you what it was beyond something South American.  Glasses average $10-$12, so it is a little expensive, but I would gladly return.  Can't wait to try something from their menu next time!we're talking ridiculously delightful, here.  we're talking about an adorableness that is surpassed only by the hugely adorable morning barista, Sam, who put up with the idiosyncracies of my extended family with ease.this place is so f$%#ing cute I can't stand it.  It has a smallish inside with free wireless, a coffee bar, and a small but well-appointed menu that is just full of delicious stuff.  There's a huge outside patio which has some good tree-shade so that it's palatable even when it's a bit too hot to sit outside under other circumstances.We had some of everything when we went.  The panini are served with this thick (in size--it wasn't very dense at all) bread that is buttery and flaky and golden all at once, and really good ingredients.  My mom got the melon and prosciutto panini.  I got the veggie panini (tomatoes, red peppers, artichokes, etc) which was really great--my personal preference would be fewer red peppers but I just plucked them off.  There's a chimichurri panini.  All really good.  There's a panini (I'm guessing the singular of panini is panino but how pretentious should I get in this forum?) with mozzarella and tomato and basil.  Yesterday was vegetarian day, and there were plenty of options for that.They also offer bruschetta, where you choose from a bunch of different options--mostly the same as would be available on the panini, so a lot of the above possibilities--and that received rave reviews as well.The wine was half off.  The cappuccinos were tasty (I hear).  Sam was charming.  What more can I say?Ah--one more thing.  They had a flourless chocolate dessert from Tammie Coe, which was my first experience with a Tammie Coe item, and it was reeeeeally good.  It was called the Chocolate Sensational and it had a few berries around the rich chocolate thing.  I would add more berries if I were god.  But I'm not, I keep getting told.One final note.  There are a couple reviews that bash the place for slow-ish service.  I would just remind everyone that this isn't ihop--this place has a south american (and in my opinion, european) feel and if I can tell you anything about service in south america, it's don't be in a hurry.  I know, you rebut: we live here. in north america.  But that isn't the point.  The point is this: you go to this place to get a taste of what such a restaurant would be in south america.  it's clean, it's cute, it's small. the food is excellent, and surprisingly well priced.  It's like your own little foreign exchange coup!  Moral: Bomberos is the mad note.  Go there and relax.  You're too uptight, anyway.Returned for a recent breakfast, and can't stop thinking about how much I enjoyed it.  I did an omelet, which was great, but I LOVED their coffee.  What a nice morning.Now that they're doing happy hour, i need to get back here in the evening, especially now that it's nice enough to really enjoy the patio.One time, before we became "official," I walked into a UYE at Bomberos and gave Dallas G a high five. That's right, instead of a hug or kiss on the cheek for the man who had graced the sheets of my bed many a times, he gets a high five. It was awkward. Realllllyyyy awkward. I'm so smooth.... So, thank god Bomberos has such a dope wine list and attentive service, because I most definitely needed the Chilean Riesling to take off the edge of that massacre!They have an amazing bruschetta plate, a tasty breakfast wrap, perfectly brewed Illy coffees and they even let me bring in my own cake when it was Chrissy P's surprise party!The patio is amazing whether you want to lounge out on a Sunday morning and read a book on the comfy patio furniture or sit with a romantic date by the fire. I also hear that they have free wifi. Score!Winner!! (Unlike me, who gives awkward high 5's!!!)
Yellowfin Japanese Restaurant=I had always been a 5 star fan of yellowfin, until one day.I am probably one of the more tolerant restaurant customers giving servers, and restaurants the benefit of the doubt.  It's true that sometimes servers have bad days and are grumpy, and that's no problem, we've all been there.  There are also sometimes mistakes in food, and likewise, a chef or sushi chef could be having a bad day.Still... when I was serve edamame in my lunch bento... and there were literally maggots coming out of the edamame... i was pretty horrified.  It was definitely one of those situations where you know the food is old.  The edamame was lifeless, brown, old.  And to my surprise, there were maggots in it having at it.So being as tempered as possible, I alerted the server who apologized and took it away.  I was expecting one of two things... 1, the server (or owner) will come to the table, apologize, and comp my meal.  2, nothing will happen until I receive the check, and the meal will be comped on there with some kind of apology note.By the time the check came, neither of the two happened.  Giving the restaurant one more chance to make right their wrong, I politely asked if I could get my meal comped since there were maggots in my food.  The server responded politely that the owner said there was no way for anyone to know there were maggots in the edamame.  Even though the edamame was all pretty much opened up with maggots coming out of them when it reached the table in the first place.So... there you go, I gave every chance for them to make right their wrong.  Suffice it to say that getting maggots in your food is a totally unacceptable situation, they took it 3 steps too far by doing nothing about it before the check, on the check, or after the check.  By principle alone, and from fear that the rice, or even fish are likely aging beyond their safe tolerance levels, yellowfin gets a 0 star if I could give them one for committing egregious health code violations, and donig nothing about it.
MORE Buffet=I had a myVegas comp for the buffet and used it last night.  I was surprised by the get your own drinks, but that's OK with me.  I didn't have to wait for anyone other than myself.I started by doing a walk through of the entire area to see what they had.  I ended up starting with salads.  I had macaroni salad-pretty standard and OK.  The western salad was shredded lettuce with red bell pepper and fresh jalapeño rounds.  This salad had a nice kick and was quite good.  I also had some couscous which also was good.  I did find some bread sticks by the salad station.  In the regular roll area, they had standard large rolls.  They were out of butter packets so only small margarine containers were available.  The breadstick didn't need it.I then went to the carving area and he had a new piece of beef.  This is not prime rib.  It looked like it was a rectangle of beef and it looked well done.  When I asked the gentleman where had all the nice rare meat gone that had been there when I did my walk through, he cut the beef in half and gave me a nice slice from the less done inside.  I got a piece of bok choy, some hush puppies, and a macadamia crusted chicken breast with apricot.  There was no  macadamia nut flavor at all.  The apricot gave the chicken some taste rather than being plain chicken.I then went to the desserts.  They had a fairly nice selection of the small plastic cups that are appearing in buffets everywhere.  My first plate had a panna cotta with a lemon top filling with a fresh raspberry, flan with a fresh blackberry and some chopped nuts, and a small container of chocolate trifle.  The panna cotta and the chocolate trifle were great--the flan less so.Second dessert plate had a macadamia nut cookie, a small pastry filled with vanilla cream and another fresh raspberry, and the star of the desserts, an Oreo cookie cheesecake.The buffet was OK.  For the $22 they charge, you're not getting the kind of fare you'd get at the Bellagio or other property but they also charge $10 or more.  I wouldn't drive to the Strip to pay for this buffet.  We have a lot better choices in our locals casinos not on the Strip.  But for a comp, it was a nice dinner.  And I really did like the fact that I got more iced tea anytime I wanted without waiting.Finally, every time I left my table, it was bussed before I got back.  That's not something that happens at all buffets.  I saw several people leaving last night without leaving even a dollar for the bus person.  I know I did most of the work, but he cleaned my table before, during, and after my dinner there last night.  He and the other wait staff deserve a tip!There's something for everyone here. I find that most of the 1 and 2 star reviews are filled with nothing but negativity... If you're looking for exotic cuisine, stuff Gordon Ramsay would actually compliment, this isn't the place for you, and I don think they are trying to be. The food is fresh and the people are friendly. I'm not an exotic foodie so this place is A-OK by me. It's pricey for just coming in for one meal; but they have a $35 all day pass that would get you into here and the Excalibur buffet as many times as you want all day - if you are staying in the vicinity all day it's a good bargain to prepay for all of your meals. I take all of the bad reviews with a grain of salt. I've worked in the service industry for 10+ years... Everyone can't please everyone - there is nothing egregiously bad about this buffet.The worst buffet ever, don't do it! I usually read Yelp reviews prior however a friend decided to treat me and it was their last minute decision. Just say no! If you re staying at Luxor I recommend you eat somewhere else because the selection and quality of food is HORRIBLE! I sampled quite a few items and everything was bad. A lot of the food was cold, not cooked well and tasteless. There is no selection and it must be the world's smallest and most sorry excuse for a buffet!The name says it all, MORE BUFFET because you will be left feeling that there must be MORE than this buffet has to offer!The best thing to eat at this buffet was their ranch dressing.The best part of my night was when I grabbed 3 sugar cookies and stuck them in my tits and walked out.We always come here if we are on a family Vegas trip because the kids love the food. If I'm on an adult only trip I prefer the bayside buffet at Mandalay Bay. Only because it's classy and has comp drinks. Let me say beer and wine lol. Here at MORE the kids like the huge amount of breakfast food and the large selection of of different food that they have. Right now I have one kid eating waffles and breakfast potatoes. The oldest is eating seafood for breakfast. He has had sushi, crab legs, and shrimp. I had breakfast foods and before we leave I always have a salad.  They have really good salads here. The prices are good, but my meal is always comped here. Get MyVegas and take a lot of trips to Vegas and get your Mlife card upgraded. It helps when it comes to paying for meals. When we were at the counter to pay the guy even comped a few beers. They are super sweet here.
Hana Japanese Eatery=At last, a sushi bar that isn't a hot spot, and isn't completely devoid of atmosphere. It is the perfect balance -- clean, but comfortable, sophisticated, yet friendly. What's more, the food is EXCELLENT.I have been there three times so far, and I have yet to find complaint with the food. The sushi is fresh and fantastic. Hana orders whole fish, straight from the coast. The ahi I had was glossy and ruby red; the flavor delicate. It had the perfect texture, with just enough "give," so that one does not struggle with biting it, and not so soft that it lacks substance. It was also a generous portion, draped over a small, but flavorful rice ball.Their tempura has lovely and light batter, and it enrobes fresh, crisp veggies, and sweet, tender shrimp. The miso soup is also good, and they don't hold back on the goodies. For once, I found that tofu can have flavor!When I ordered the bento, it was filled with all sorts of treats! Some I could not even identify. I am embarrassed to say, I was well and truly stuffed, when I finished eating it all. Surprisingly, the prices are very reasonable! Nigiri goes for about $3-$5, maki about $5-$10, noodle dishes $80-$10, and entrees $12-$15. I have only been during lunch time, so I don't know if these change for dinner.That all said, since it is brand-spanking new, and its staff is still learning the ropes, Hana struggles a bit with service. Sometimes entrees come out poorly-timed. Sometimes you have to wait for your dishes to be cleared. You might get a bit thirsty, waiting for your refill.But it is worth it. It is so worth it. Check it out!So about 5 months ago I had a normal life, you know a dope little condo, a nice girlfriend, even a little pup, but what my life was really lacking, was a dopalicious sushi joint in my life and as if my eyelash wishes came true Hana appears, I can easily say its the second best sushi joint in Phoenix (right behind Yasu) and honestly if Hana could figure out a way to make there sushi rice a little more enjoyable I would easily pass the crown. There fish must be caught in Garanda Parks lakes thats how fresh it seems (I know horrible reference but they have great fish) and the statement BYOB is bob spelled with a y and who doesn't like bob (which will save you cash money son, plus there is something liberating about drinking 40's in public). So if you want to have ultra fresh sushi without all the garbage glam that most sushi places throw in your face, while drinking some steel reserve with a date who you are trying to convince that you once lived a normal life, than this place is perfect for you yo.What the heck am I missing here?  The rice again was ooey and gooey again on my last visit, sticking to the roof of my mouth and having a waxy feel about it  .... I guess some people like it that way?   I was hoping that it was just a fluke the first time but now also the second time.  Other people's review I trust give it more stars.  I just don't get it.The sushi is ok-good, not worthy of a 4 or 5 and if you're OK with crowded, noisy, bustling places then Hana is for you.  The staff is very nice and will be as accommodating as they possibly can. It is BYOB and they will keep your drinks chilled for you. However, it is not the perfect spot for an intimate dinner or first date. You will find yourself muffling your ears and trying to compete with the noise level from every table in the room. Unfortunately my party was seated next to a large table of inconsiderate, obnoxious, cackling chicks who for some reason felt the need to constantly scream WOO HOOO throughout the entire evening. Don't get me wrong I love seeing people have a great time but this was not cool at all. My ears are still ringing from all the screeching. So here is the low-down on what we had:Tempura - 2+  Bland at bestSquid Salad -  3+ Shrimp Tempura Roll - 3, Fell apart and gummySpicy Tuna - 3, so so.. Lacked the burn that I'm used toVolcano Roll - 2, Gobs of mayo.. Gag!Baked Green Muscle - 5+ very good.I just wish the Sushi was great enough for me to overlook all this petty crap but it just wasn't. Sorry.I had to reflect on our dining experience at Hana before writing a review.  We had great company while dining here and that certainly colors the experience as a whole.First thing, Hana is BYOB so either don't leave your beer sitting on the counter when you head out like I did or go with cool folks like Kevin H and Marian H who bring a six pack and are happy to share!After reflection I decided that Hana merits about 2.75 stars.  They are better than average but in some important ways they fall short.We did not have any sushi so consider this review for the dinners only.We started with miso soup.  It was very *(salads arrive)* good.  Marian and my wife Audrey were cold every time the ventilation kicked on so the soup was a *(server tries to take Audrey's soup before she is done, is politely rebuffed)* nice warm-up.We were about to start on our salads and *(Audrey and Kevin's shrimp which comes with the steak arrives)* the chef or manager (I'm not sure which) came over and offered to provide several dressing choices so that we could try different ones.  I went with the *(Kevin's steak arrives)* ginger dressing, although the miso dressing was nice as well.  The shrimp which comes with the steak was served nicely arranged on *(server asks if I am done with my salad)* a small plate with lemons, they tasted very *(Audrey's steak arrives)* fresh and delicious.  Marian and I each ordered a tempura dinner.  They arrived and were nice and hot.  The veggie assortment was *(rice bowls arrive)* very good and the shrimp was tender and flavorful.  I found the pieces of fish to be overdone and one bordered on chewy.  The tempura treatment here was good but heavier than most.Throughout the meal two things were occurring that detracted from the overall experience.  The blower would kick on and the cool air was focused against the wall and right on Audrey and Marian.  Kevin and I were cool on one side, warm on the other.  We jokingly discussed changing seats from time to time when we were done on one side and needed to warm up the other.  I suggest an 8 foot ladder and some tweaking of the vents would correct this issue.The food had no pace and toward the end of the meal it become clear that they wanted to turn our table.  Lingering over dessert was not a welcome option.  Water refills stopped toward the end of the meal.In summary:  the food was pretty good, the pace of the food and service was rushed and random, company was excellent and the atmosphere was warm//\\cold//\\warm//\\cold//\\warm//\\cold.Ate here months ago.  Was excited to finally find a Phoenix sushi venue, and one that also offered brown rice as a sub for sushi dishes (don't quote me on this however, since it has been many months and I may be recalling another venue).  One item did impress me, and that was the complimentary appetizer that was comprised of tempura'd chips with perhaps a squid salad topping (?)  I should have just ordered another serving of this!  Instead, I tried an Ao Yasai (mixed gourmet greens with ginger) and a sushi roll w/ brown rice, the latter I thought was price-y considering the very small portion given.  I was so unimpressed by its unexciting flavors that I don't even recall what kind of roll I tried!  Pretty sad, I know.  I told myself I wouldn't go back, but I would like to give Hana another try, perhaps for lunch and/or dinner with a group of friends and have apps and wine/sake!Oh hell no.I don't understand the hype. I was totaly grossed out. I love sushi but did not like this place at all. It was overpriced, the menu was limited and the fish was a little too fishy for my tastes. It was like a lot of the sushi places I visited in Japan - but it was NOT like the good ones.I know Hana is one of the most authentic sushi restaurants in Phoenix, but that doesn't mean EVERYTHING has to be covered in mayonaise, does it? I hate mayo. The Hana roll was supposed to be a "house specialty" but it was just about as special as the Shrimp roll at Safeway. The Hamachi Kama was a highlight, but might have been a bit over cooked. The tuna sashimi was chewy and rough. Ew! Sashimi should melt in your mouth, not take longer to take down than roadside beef jerky. Also - green tea in a can? I can get that at Lee Lee's market. Fresh brew it or gring it up in a bowl or something. No cans please.I DID dig all the punk rock lesbian servers. The contrast of small Asian men to big lezbot women was priceless.I have had good and bad experiences at Hana in the past, and overall, I like their sashimi choices, but last night was the final straw. The wait staff is very hit and miss, with most being fun and friendly but a few being the typical 'cooler than thou' hipster wanna-be types that seem to plague Central Phoenix restaurants these days. I can overlook the BYOB (which honestly I find annoying in a sushi/Japanese restaurant since I love an ice cold martini with raw fish) and the sometimes attitudey service, and even the ho-hum rolls offered (nothing special, really). But what I cannot overlook is the ridiculously overpriced items and the blatant overcharging. My partner and I were going to order the oysters, and when we were told it was $9 for 2 oysters we politely declined with more than a bit of amusement. 2 oysters, really? Durants, which has amazingly fresh oysters, presented incredibly, and is one of the priciest restaurants in the area charges $13 for a half dozen- in a far better atmosphere. Ok, so then I order the Chirashi bowl, which apparently is not on the menu but they will do it anyway. I always get the Chirashi as it is my favorite item at sushi restaurants, and Hana does a very nice one indeed- for $35!!! Of course you don't know this until AFTER you get the check since it's not listed anywhere. I understand that I ordered it and I should have asked, but honestly I have ordered this a hundred times from SF to LA to NY (and even at HANA before!!) and have NEVER seen it more than about $20-22. Locally, it goes for $19 at Stingray, and $17 at Sakana (which btw is much better). Anyway, I have never in my life complained about food prices before so it is a little weird having to write this, but I truly feel Hana is fleecing people and since they were the only game in the area for a long time, they think they can get away with it.  We'll see what happens now with Stingray opening up nearby, and Moira downtown, along with a few other newbies scheduled for openings in 2010. Competition is a great thing! Some advice for sushi lovers: it's a bit of a drive, but Sakana is still hands down the best sushi in town- with a full bar and dinner for two in the $50 range, including drinks.I think I have found my new favorite date night sushi joint.. Last week the illustrious David B.  was recommending Hana to the ole plus one and I .. being the adventurous couple we are ,we invited our sushi friend Paul and family to  join us to try somewhere new.. First Note : Hana is small groups are not their forte..although they nicely accommodated our large 7 person group.  After being seated we took in all the specials on the board and began making sushi plans .. Second Note  : Our waitress had a difficult time understanding our order, not sure if it was language barrier, ordering a little unusual , the larger party or what... daughter doesn't want any wasabi or garnishes on her sushi...  after getting order ins  , it wasn't long before some lovely  sushi began coming our way.  Unfortunate Waitress did not understand daughters order and it came with ta daa  onion garnishes .. the owner (?)  came out and rectified the situation with finesse..We ordered for hubster and I : Hana roll  a tasty roll with friend shrimp sticking up all over  good stuff, rainbow roll  clean and traditional,  Vegas roll , nice touch because it was fried but not doughy or overly  breaded like some places get it , and a tasty  hot volcano roll  , not the fave but still  a good roll, we also had tako salad our favorite extra at japanese restaurants , theirs is a sweet yet vinegary concoction  that me happy loved it.. Friend   Paully ordered  a seared maguro dinner that looked tasty.  All the food was refreshing and delicious  but here is where it went wrong  Third Note , traditionally in a restaurant when you have a big party of people done with their food  and they are staring at the wait staff and fidgeting with the empty plates and suck on the ice cubes you bring them the check ...guess our waitress did not get that memo... we sat and sat.. finally the womenfolk took the kids across the street for Mary Coyle ice cream to let the men wait in peace. Fourth Note, how do you negotiate the 20% gratuity already added in when the service wasn't up to par?   Well once again owner ? Lyn came to our rescue and rectified the situation .. Hats off to Lyn who did an outstanding job of smoothing over a bad situation.  Because of her we will go back and give Hana another try  just with a smaller group and not the same waitress. Oh and BTW  they use Sweet Republic for their ice cream .. got give that a try next time...SETS THE STANDARD FOR JAPANESE FOOD OUTSIDE JAPAN. _DON'T_ MISS IT.It's been a long time since my initial review of Hana. In fact it was one of my very first on Yelp. I opined on my five-points requirement to get on my sushi-worth-eating list, and those first visits did not fail to impress. I spoke about my personal scale of very good, excellent and life changing sushi. Indeed, Hana is always excellent, and i may say _usually_ life changing. Over the months Lori, Koji and family have shown me the the secrets of Japanese cuisine and the delight of specially-ordered ingredients, like:-- real Japanese Kobe beef.-- live ama ebi-- live scallops-- live giant clam-- daikon delight-- zaruten soba-- miso ramen-- monkfish pate (ankimo)-- oysters on the half shell-- bento box delight-- hamachi kama-- natto maki-- hawaiian walu sashimi-- shima mackerel-- wild salmonAnd that's just the specials. Hana SETS THE STANDARD for quality, every time in its-- Toro sashimi-- Fresh Salmon-- Maguro so red, i've heard it called beet red.-- Ika-- Tamago-- Seaweed Salad-- miso soupAnd if you're feeling adventurous, many Americanized-craziness dishes abound for your culinary quest:-- Mt. Fuji roll-- Volcano roll-- Pride roll-- Lobster roll-- Hana rollSERVICEhas matured into an approachable and almost joyous pride to be able to share their food with their customers. Restauranting can be such a gritty grind, but Koji, Lori and the team present their carefully chosen ingredients with love and passion every day. Besides the excellent food, it is that passion which brings me back night after night, week after week.I can see that despite my instructions against it, you all HAVE told your friends about Hana. Please stop spreading the news! There just isn't enough room for us all. LOL. Enjoy.P.S. Check out their website for social-network specials on Facebook and Foursquare. By the way, don't bother trying to oust me as Foursquare Mayor; it's a lost cause!What's raw, slick and makes you feel good all over? It's sushi! From trendy scenester food to its current mainstay presence, sushi has been a part of the dining scene for ages. Even with time this time spent, sushi is still very much exciting to enjoy.For me, Hana Japanese Eatery puts the amore in enamored and the fat into infatuated.With a solid menu of offerings and loads of daily specials there's plenty to keep things fresh and engaging. When I'm eating my way through the valley, almost 8 out of 10 Ill order the special when offered. In this experience Ive been able to try amazing off menu items that were seasonal or the chef was feeling whimsy that day.Not to whimsy but fully fun and interactive, Edamame ($3.95) is always a must for me. There's just something about biting into each pod and sucking the soy beans out that I find satisfying.Like something out of a dream, the sashimi, nigiri, and rolls were served on a small boat. This beautiful presentation just goes to show how attention to detail goes well beyond the food. Such things like wasabi get special attention, Hana's pickled version will make you quickly forget about the traditional paste variety. Putting the wasabi to good use, the Blue Fin ($20/$20) was ordered 2 ways, sashimi and seared, the first being my favorite, each bite almost felt like eating butter, that tender. Such favorites as Octopus ($10) and Crab Nigiri ($5) were as pretty as they were delicious.Loving rolls with contrast and crunch the Shrimp Tempura Roll ($8.50) filled both counts easily. However its special cousin, the Lobster Roll ($20), takes a California roll then is adorned with large pieces of battered quick fried lobster meat, no skimping on the good stuff here.Hot dishes on the specials menu are expertly prepared. Scallop Edamame ($10.95) takes the sweet tenderness of scallops, then is battered and rolled in soy beans and lightly fried. The texture of the buttery soy beans meshed well with the sweetness of the scallop, a must. More special menu love was felt with the sauteed Giant Clam with Scallops ($16.95). Tempura Udon ($9.95) was ordered off of the regular menu and let me tell you, those chewy noodles are simply addicting.Ive never heard the words Japanese and pizza in the same sentence before. So after our server described the Okonomiyaki ($18.95), it had to be ordered. More like a thick savory pancake in taste but the looks of a pizza, this was certainly a surprise by taste and by oddity. The top of the Okonomiyaki is sprinkled with bonito flakes which move and quiver when exposed to heat. So when it was sat down in front of me I couldn't help but stare at the movement. Yes, I was a little freaked out but how cool is that?Hana An Mitsu ($6.95) was the most perfect ending for the style of cooking. This refreshing dessert made up of aloe vera and was accompanied by oranges, blueberries & red bean paste, reminded me of an exotic fruit cocktail. If chewy and creamy intrigue you try the Ichigo Mochi Ice Cream ($4.95). The chewy rice mochi shell encapsulates your choice of ice cream, very different and tasty.Hana doesn't serve alcohol but feel free to bring your own wine, beer or sake, they wont charge you a corking fee, which makes that scallop even sweeter.I had the distinct honor of dining at Hana this past week under the special care of Lori, the owner.  I should preface this review by stating that I'm a travel and food writer who has traveled to more than 40 countries and all 7 continents....I'm a chef in Dallas...and I was in the top 5 on season 2 of MasterChef.  So the fact that my dinner at Hana was one of the best and most memorable dinners of my entire life should carry at least a bit of weight!  Phoenix, you are SO lucky to have this establishment.However, it wasn't the first time I had dined at Hana.  Scarcely 3 months before I had eaten sushi there with a local friend while passing through on my way to LA.  For her, Hana is the best place to get sushi in central Phoenix.  I had to admit, I was dubious about eating sushi in Phoenix, but the freshness and perfect presentation of the sashimi we ordered was stunning.  Still...for virtually all their regular customers, Hana is a sushi joint.My second experience was quite a bit different.  I was a guest of the owner, and she and her chefs took us through a 15 course menu that consisted of both strictly traditional Japanese presentations, and contemporary twists.  For more than 2 hours, the courses kept coming.They started with small bites...refreshingly simple, yet somehow complex, despite only 5 or 6 ingredients each.  One was a shooter on a base of Meyer lemon with monkfish liver, quail egg, bonito flake, and caviar.  Hot dishes soon followed...tempura lobster with a hot salted tea for dipping.  (It made me cry, it was so delicious.)  A custard of egg white and dashi broth that hid scallops and shrimp and crab at the bottom...so delicate it basically evaporated in my mouth.  (And I cried again.)There was no sushi on our table.  That doesn't mean there wasn't raw fish!  A mackerel was brought to the table, and we plucked off juicy delicate morsels of incredibly fresh fish.  (It's eyes were so clear it appeared to be looking around the room at me.)  Once we had finished, they whisked the skeleton off to the deep fryer, and returned the crispy bones for us to munch on.The fact that the chefs at Nana have the skill and ability to produce this kind of world-class meal just blows my mind, when I formerly thought of it as a mere sushi bar.  And the fact that it is BYOB...I thought I had died and gone to heaven.So here's what YOU need to do, next time you're ready for some food that will blow your mind:Walk into Nana.Ask for Lori, the owner.Tell Lori that Ben Starr sent you.Tell Lori how much you'd like to spend on dinner, whether that's $20 or $200.Tell Lori to show you something amazing.Forget about the menu.  Let the experts decide for you.  Lori will make sure you go home full of food that you will dream about that night, and tell friends about the next day.  Americans are not accustomed to dining this way, which is a shame.  There is a vast trove of knowledge, skill, and creativity hiding in the Hana kitchen.  It would be a crime to go there and order a California roll!I am still resonating with the memory of this meal.Ever since I have moved back from Japan I have been looking for some place that feels and tastes like home. Because, that is what Japan was for me. It was home. I loved the people and the culture. The way the earth and the ocean offer the other balance there. The night life and let us not forget ever, the food. Well Hana is not it... :PBut it is still pretty damn good. I love coming here with my mom. I am always trying to push her to eat something new! She is typical fraidy cat and wont hardly touch sashimi which is delicious here. One piece and she's out. I have ordered tuna tataki here (one of my favourite meals in the world) but I don't think it is on the menu, and for me they over sear the fish. I like it just lightly fire kissed. The rolls here are pretty typical. Avocado and cream cheese to satisfy my mother and cover up any real flavor of the fish. The miso is really very good here. Its always hit or miss with miso in the states... Usually extremely too salty, but here has always been good. The tempura platters are shazaam! Fun and delicioso. In conclusion, i suggest you give it a try. Don't forget to bring your own booze, an empty tummy, and an open mind!Hana has without a doubt the best sushi I have ever had. I was blown away at how good it was. The Salmon Sashimi was so fresh and delicious! Every roll we ordered was just mouth watering goodness. Only complaint is that the Edamame is served cold, I've never been a fan of that. Not even a big deal.This quaint little neighborhood sushi bar has charm that stretches for days. Our group of 4 came here Friday night for dinner and business was bustling. We had to wait around 15 minutes for a table which wasn't so bad considering how busy it was.The menu is very stream lined but the focus is still always dedicated to the freshness and quality of their sushi. We enjoyed salmon sashimi and uni sashimi. The spicy tuna roll was delightful and the spiciness did not overcome the fresh flavor of the tuna. One of my favorites, unagi nigiri, did not disappoint! We definitely plan to return here. Our go-to will most likely be the scallop dynamite, which our friends ordered and we tried and loved. The uni oyster shooters were fun and yummy. It's a great way to introduce people who don't usually eat uni to enjoy the unique melt in your mouth texture. I'm slowly starting to enjoy uni since we order it so much. I think I could get others addicted to it too!
Top of Binion's Steakhouse=What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas right? But I have to share a secret with you and it's OK to tell your friends.  On nearly the top floor of the Binion's Casino and Hotel you can find a wonderful steak house in the heart of downtown Vegas.  Sure, you can go to another steak house du jour along the strip and be treated like a piece of meat or you can come here and enjoy one.When the elevator door opens on floor SH (Steak House), prepare to step into a time machine whisking you back to the early days of Vegas.  A maitre d', classic dark dimly lit decor and red vinyl booths will welcome you.  The Prime Rib was delicious and the Caesar salad was yummy.  My only suggestion for improvement was the dinner rolls were a bit dry.  Other then that, the Binion's Steakhouse was simply a classic experience and a nice way to escape the crowds.The glass elevator ride on the way up presents a unique experience and a nice view of the Stratosphere and some parts of the Vegas Strip. This, along with attentive service and classic steakhouse ambiance promises a great meal. I was disappointed.While the lobster bisque had some nice lobster chunks, the bisque's texture was gritty. I ordered the Filet Mignon (8oz for $36.95) crusted with bleu cheese for an extra few bucks to be medium rare but I received it overcooked. It was more medium/medium well than medium rare. A third of it was stringy and chewy. The bleu cheese crust well-complimented the steak but the green beans that accompanied the entree tasted watery. I expected more.[3.5 stars]Vegas was packed...with the strip looking like the perfect-feeding/multiplication-ground for a zombiepocalyse that emergency measures were immediately taken to get both the lady and I out...QUICK...before disaster strikes. So zipping away from the strip, she immediately asked where we were headed. GOOD OLD VEGAS was my immediate reply. Pulling her trusty iPhone out, she started looking at destinations to check out. Five minutes later, we were keen on Binion's Ranch Steakhouse as it promised "great service with a great view over good food".The parking lot was unsurprisingly empty and the old-Vegas almost-prehistoric feel permeated the air. Fine...fine...it wasn't exactly PREHISTORIC but definitely a drop (not a leap) back in time. It was a feeling similar to staring at a much-beloved-386 computer (if you're even old enough to know this) after using and getting accustomed to a spiffy-oh-so-hot-and-bank-breaking Alienware or MacBook Pro for several years. Yet, seeing a 386 computer once again doesn't mean I would back away. Rather, just like I used to grab my little box of 5" floppy disks in anticipation to stuff it into the floppy drives to begin playing DotT (Day of the Tentacle - and if you remember and have played this game...you immediately get an additional Yelp fan who will read and UFC your freaking reviews), I held the lady's hand and eagerly made our way through stale-tobacco-scented corridors to the elevator that would port us up and back in time.We reached and entered the elevator without seeing a single soul. As the ascent began, the zombiepocalypse image returned. Crap, did they attack old Vegas first and we just stupidly volunteered to become fresh ingredients in their gruesome-human-buffet? GREAT...@#*&^$*&@^#!!!!!! Elevator door opens and we walk right out to see...a cool-demeanor-well-dressed-gentleman with a smile on his face that immediately implied no such harm has descended upon this area - yet. Of course, that reassuring welcome and asking if we had reservations and such immediately removed all the zombie crap in my mind and refocused my attention to this...nostalgic feeling. Where are we? I almost thought I had grey hair with a backed so hunched that complimented a croaking voice. (Ok, just kidding, I should describe something like Elvis instead...).Our table overlooked the city in the evening lights. Although, I can't say it was mesmerizing or romantic in the least, we did somewhat enjoy the difference and spent some time pointing and figuring out the area while discussing what it probably was like 30 years ago.Service was spectacular...and very accommodating. My lady has certain refined preferences with her vegetables and meat (unlike the recycling/food-processing plant that I am that eats everything up and then complains after as necessary) and our server made sure every single part of it was met.The food wasn't as spectacular as their service and fell in the "decent" category. Both the New York and Rib-eye steaks came out done exactly the way we wanted them cooked...the former being medium well and the latter completely alive for the blood craving diner. Steaks were under-salted but that is not an issue in my books as a little toying with the salt dispenser on the table immediately got it exactly to the requirements of our differing palettes. The overall experience was decent and I would recommend a visit if you (a) want to get away from the overwhelming crowds on the strip; (b) crave a decent steak; (c) want to view old Vegas from atop a building without getting a room; or (d) want to port back to a different era.Just on the name alone I have to give it 4 stars.  Add the great food and service and it is a total winner.  I have been here more than a few times and always enjoy my visits.  The view of the mountains is outstanding and the service was perfect.  I had a rib eye steak that was cooked to perfection and as a starter had their version of French onion soup.  Very good.  History 101.  When this was owned by the Binion family all the beef that was served was raised on their ranch.  I sometimes wish for the good old days of Las Vegas knowing they will never return.  But the vibe is still here.
Nora's Wine Bar and Osteria=I'll be the first to admit that when it comes to food I have a little bit of OCD. I live to eat and plan my day accordingly. When my coworker suggests we go to Nora's Wine Bar for lunch, I'm on their website at 9:30 AM plotting carefully what I'm going to order, salivating over the delicious list of food. I came in with mind made up - the lamb chops ($12.50) or the grilled chicken thighs ($9.50). We show up and not only is the menu ridiculous (a leather menu?!), but it has no descriptions and it's COMPLETELY different from the website menu found here (http://www.noraswinebar.com/lunch.pdf ). Hey Nora's, we're in the internet age - keep your website up to date!I settled on the ribeye ($17), my coworkers got the chicken milanese and the salmon with pasta. We started with some bacon wrapped dates. Dates were tasty but can't compete with FireFly. Salmon eating coworker seemed happy, chicken eating coworker was disappointed (the chicken milanese at regular nora's is WAY better), and my ribeye was fabulous. I was pretty bummed when they showed up with diced up ribeye, but it was legit. It was cooked medium-rare as requested (no easy feat on diced meat) and I was happy with the microgreen salad despite how heavy on the dill it was. A delicious filling lunch, but for $17 it should be!They'd get 4 stars for the tasty ribeye, but the service was atrocious! The restaurant was packed and they had 1 waiter. Ridiculously under staffed. I look forward to trying them again - hopefully they hire some more staff in the meantime and fix their website !
BURGER BRASSERIE=I thought the burgers and drinks here were delicious.  They have specialty burgers that are sorted by "country," which mostly meant there was some type of special cheese/ingredient that classified it that way.Anyways, the burgers were juicy and very satisfying, and not that overpriced considering this is Vegas.  The drinks, on the other hand, were very expensive but quite good, including 1 watermelon flavored martini that I don't remember the name of.  If you stay at Harrah's or any of their hotels, they usually give you a coupon here, which is why we came.  Glad we did!Don't get fooled by the Trio of fries!!!If i see a fries sampler, i always want to get all of them. It said on the menu- waffle fries, steak fries and petit fries. You would think petit fries would be shoestrings (a neighbor made the same mistake), but they were just mini waffle fries. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/AjWFFZN8KwyqJzzi0DyEsw?select=F4NLspbB1o4xetDmIEKmXQ. You're better off just ordering two different kinds. We ended up too full and not even finishing half of the trio order. Good to share though between 4 people or more. I got the signature burger Le Paris. Comes with brie, caramelized onions and bacon. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/AjWFFZN8KwyqJzzi0DyEsw?select=5ZAFIRT5zqm6FeTlTH-9zg Tony got the Le Blue http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/AjWFFZN8KwyqJzzi0DyEsw?select=t3WtvkSrPOn7tGN-TZwrLw with blue cheese, avo and bacon. The burgers were decent, but at 12 bucks each, i wanted Uhmaaazzing and they were not. The hefty burger patty was perfectly round and flattened, but i like my hamburger kind of mishapen so you get those nice charred marks around the edges. Service was friendly, everything tasted ok, but i wasn't wowed enough to add to my vegas favorites. Inside the Paris Hotel. Buddies: please chime in on your best burger in vegas!Came here for dinner and left disappointed. It was a 15 minute wait to be seated which didn't bother me, but there were plenty of open tables and booths. We ended up being seated right near the entrance in front of the window. After asking to be moved to one of the other open tables we were told it would be a longer wait. WTH??? Our server was great, but running around taking care of too many tables at once, so I guess they were short staffed. I ordered the "Chopped Salad" priced at $13 and it had chopped romaine and iceberg lettuce, salami, cheese, tomatoes, avocados, cucumbers, celery and croutons. I asked that the red bell pepper and Italian dressing be left out. I wanted just extra blue cheese dressing, but my salad was tossed in the Italian dressing anyway and still had blue cheese dressing on it. I don't have an issue with the cost if the salad since it was a nice portion and had a lot of yummy sounding things in it, but all I tasted was a big pile of chunky bitter blue cheese, celery and really gross Italian dressing. Hubby had an overpriced $22 burger combo and said the burger tased frozen. The peanut butter shake he got I shared with him and that was actually good. I would just skip this place and go down the street to Tacos El Gordo!This place was good, not great. That being said, I did end up going back in the same weekend lol. I think my expectations were too high, I was expecting  one of those gourmet burger places that had really high quality food and that's just not this place. Unfortunately, the fries and onion rings are a frozen product ;( The service was average, the girls are busy and working lots of tables so I get it. The positive? My Le' Paris burger was delicious!! It had Brie cheese, carmelized onions and bacon on it, the combination of those flavors was awesome!! I would probably go back for a quick bite without a wait.My opinion is that this is an older Vegas restaurant that used to be poppin' and now it's lost some of that hotness that's so important in this city! I would guess that this gets a makeover into a different restaurant in the near future! MY GO-TO: Le'Paris Burger!We usually end up here for a late lunch. The menu has changed a little bit, but most of the expensive burgers and salads remain. The beer list is decent but leans towards the mainstream. Once you get over the fact that you just shelled out $15 for a burger with Gruyere and caramelized onions and it didn't even come with fries you'll still enjoy the food.Service varies. I've had great servers, and I've had ones that aren't too swift. But the eye candy is great, and there's sports from every angle. The milkshakes with booze are fun, too.It is easy to miss this early adopter to the "gourmet" burger craze currently in full swing. Burger Brassiere is located in the walkway that connects the Bally's and Paris hotels. While actually closer in proximity to Bally's, it is in fact part of the Paris property.   it is as much a sports bar as anything with a large bar area booth seating throughout the restaurant.  You are never out of TV view and there is always a game playing on the flat screens. I like Burger Brasserie for a few reasons, they do have a quality burger and some clever sides at a reasonable price, they have a beverage HH everyday from 4-7, and they offer discounts to total rewards members. The biggest complaint is just the noise level and the fact they can get very busy to the point of it effecting service.Anyhow it is a great place to grab a draft and a burger and enjoy a game. In my opinion it beats the sports book at both Bally's and Paris. I have been several times over the years and it's been a while. My last visit recently was a pleasant reminder that they do a reasonably good job of the sports bar theme with some very nice comfort food. I mixed it up this time and ordered the very rich and decadent  French Onion Burgercaramelized onions, gruyère gratinée.  It comes dry so the condiments are up to you.The burger was cooked perfectly and the bun was pillowy soft. A touch of Dijon Mustard and this puppy rocked. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/burger-brasserie-las-vegas#r_s8PTg5rBhtgUoGTZZwGAhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/burger-brasserie-las-vegas#nbckoyMUu_oHOtiWLOXziQThe cheesebuger mac n' cheese bites are sinful to be sure, and a great appetizer to share. They are filling and pack a calorie punch so be prepared. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/burger-brasserie-las-vegas#VCe6IjVG4RZVXkdidCyV_AI will definitively go back for a spot to watch that game in an inviting, quality venue like BB every time. Did  I mention they are pretty consistent? Well they are and kudos for that, see you again BB.
Great Harvest Bread=I am here every week now.Walk in. Don't look at the menu yet. Wait. You just looked! Don't be impatient, I understand the urge. We get anxious when we're about to eat delicious carbs. Walk up to the counter and ask for your free sample. They'll slather some butter on it if you want to get crazy. YUM. My favorites are Cinnamon Swirl, Pumpkin Chocolate Chip, Cinnaburst, and Hummus Wheat. They have a list of their daily breads baked for each day of the week. These are available as whole loaves. You can also customize any sandwich.The staff is very friendly. If you buy a loaf and want it sliced up and bagged, just ask. This location has been giving a free giant, and I mean GIANT cookie with your Yelp check-in. They're nice and soft, YUM. Even more sugary carbs. My son loves when I pack Great Harvest bread in his lunchbox. I don't blame him, so I stop in here every week now. Completely worth it.We have been here several times and this is a good place but unfortunately like most bakeries like this one in town, for some reason they put cinnamon in a lot of their breads which means I cannot try it.Some people are lucky and some are not.  I got the not card on the cinnamon...The sandwiches are very good and they do have some bread I can have.We did ask if they use NON GMO ingredients and one worker said she did not know and the other said, 'Uhm, yes we do use NON GMO ingredients.I have not verified this so if you go here you may want to ask.  They do not advertise anywhere in the place about organic ingredients or NON GMO, so we found it odd they would say they do and not have it posted anywhere.Obviously GMOs do not stop people from eating things they should not and like I said this place has never disappointed, it would just be good to know that the employees working there have a clue as to what they are serving you and not have to guess.This is still a good place and you should seek them out if you have never been here.
Chili's Too=Haha! I didn't understand why a lot of people kept saying to me,"Breakfast of champions!" as I walked out of here with my early morning breakfast at McCarran airport.With airport food, it's always a fine balance between price and getting something edible. In the end, my Chinese Thrift Gene allowed me to get a plate of wings for a calorie laden breakfastNot bad for chain food and the crispy warm wings assuaged some hunger pangs. l like the the dips tooThere was an area of seating nearby, which was in a less hectic part of Terminal B, so a nice place to start your day off with an early flight
Focaccia Fiorentina=I love this place. I wish they had dinner hours. It's a little loud. But other than that, it's by far my favorite place to eat lunch in the heart of downtown. It's so consistently good. I believe it's family-owned and as such nothing has changed in years, which is a wonderful thing. I highly recommend the Vodka and the Fiorentina and the mushroom-sauced daily special when they have it. And the manicotti. And the calzone. Oh, you dirty little calzone... It is what it is and what it is is sooooo good.For some reason, I always worry that 3-stars is a bad thing. It's not, really. Just an indication that it's good but not great. Foccacia Fiorentina represents this philosophy, to me. While I've not had a bad pizza here, they do require thinking ahead enough to call in my order before I walk over, thus maximizing my lunch hour. But if I'm just walking around looking for something to jump out at me, not such a good thing. Such was the case for my most recent visit to FF. Pressed for time, I decided on two pasta dishes--one a creamy cheese and mushroom sauce, the other a balsamic vinegar mixed with fresh basil, tomatoes and mozzarella. Individually, they sound very good. But the reality fell short of my expectations. Maybe if I'd gotten them in separate containers it would have felt differently about my meal. I'll stick to pizzas in the future.Focaccia Fiorentina, it sounds like a string of italian curse words but it tastes like a gift from the heavens...I went down here with Melissa because I had purchased a $2 coupon from that online place (wink wink) that let us buy $35 worth of food for only $10. Needless to say, after all the restrictions of the coupon (minimum 2 people, dine-in only), we had enough food for an italian army! Still, it only cost $10 and I was hungry!I got the #3 sandwich which had Genoa Salami, Moz, Tomatoes, on (you guessed it) Focaccia bread (pardon my french, er... italian). She got the #6 which had Turkey, and a bunch of other stuff that I can't remember.  We also ordered the Penne (something) Vodka.  You know you're an alcoholic when all you remember is the vodka part! Oh, and a large greek salad. Finally, we passed our $35 minimum and we sat down with all this food.People were staring at us all hateful like we stole this food from ethiopians or something! Geez! I didn't know there was a law against ordering this much food. We weren't going to eat it all there, I promise! We got boxes! Yes, Plural!The food was great, the lady that greeted us, not so much. We must have interrupted her break, because she was giving me the stink eye. Yes, can I order the #3? Ugh! Did you see that?!?!Why is it that Italians have the best of everything? The tastiest sandwiches, the tastiest pasta, the tastiest bread, the tastiest men... ahem, sorry. got carried away.  But its true! Everything about italy is awesome. Pizza! Anyway, this place has pizzas too. Maybe next time!
Teriyaki Madness=Conveniently located in the same parking lot as 24hr Fitness.  This Teriyaki Madness is perfect for your post workout meal. If you're at the gym and dreading that PWO shake, then this TMAD is perfect for you.  Besides, whole foods is a lot better than shakes anyway.  Trust me, whole foods will bring density to your muscles.  Like all other TMAD's, this one has everything chicken breast. Even their katsu is made out of chicken breast, not minced chicken.  Their teriyaki chicken is flavorful, but I usually opt for their chicken breast by itself, with vegetables, or with brown rice. My most recent visit was with Terri Elite and we shared a chicken breast w/veggies.  The meal was filling and because we didn't have the sauce, it was plain.  But remember, we chose to eat it that way. Want flavor? Have their chicken with the sauce. I also had the benefit of talking to the owner, Dean, a couple of weeks ago. He's very professional, cares about his business, and most importantly, his customers.  I'm a fan of TMAD's and each location has it's perks. When it comes to taste and service, I still think the location off Craig Road is the best.  When it comes to size of the restaurant, the Centennial location wins.  When it comes to convenience from one of my gyms, this one takes it.  My only issue is that this TMAD is one of their smaller restaurants.  It's a good thing that they weren't too busy when we ate here.  They were also out or didn't have broccoli in stock.  TIP's:  -Gym goers get a discount.  I keep forgetting this.  But still think that the cashiers should ask us, especially when it's obvious that we just came from the gym. -Order ahead if you're in a rush or if you are requesting brown rice. -This place also serves salmon
Mediterranean Hookah Lounge and Cafe=There's a lot to love about the Hookah Lounge and Cafe once you get past it's tough exterior shell. (Seriously close one eye on the drive up the hill no matter which way you go and avoid looking around too closely as you go inside. Once through the door, eyes open. Take it all in.) [1] But let's be honest, a lot of things have a tough exterior and delicious insides. M&MsStar FruitCornucopias the list goes onI suggest you start your evening in the bar area. The Friday I was there, there were some inexpensive drink specials, and the space is so large that even when I arrived around 6 it hadn't filled up. You're not going to get the full experience sitting at the bar, so after a bev or two (you can take unfinished drinks with) walk over to the cafe part. There's another bar (win!) and a smattering of tables. The menu has a number of options sure to please anyone's propensity for Mediterranean. I got the shaved lamb plate and couldn't polish it off, it's seriously huge. Your meal will start with some pita and Zatar (look it up) which is an uber authentic way to get things going. Didn't stay for the hookah or for the belly dancing. I get super uncomfortable when those ladies get close. Personal space please, personal space. [1] Don't actually close one eye. That would be dangerous. Unless you're trained.
Lotus Garden Cuisine=Sweet and Pungent shrimp (Aromatic) is simply Amazing! I have not been able to locate a Chinese Cantonese style restaurant here in Vegas that has it! I have to get my fill of it when I am visiting Los Angeles! Not anymore, now I can have it anytime I want!Everything was marvelous, the won ton soup, the almond chicken, and moo goo gai pan! There chicken is top notch, all white meat and big generous pieces of it!The service is Fantastic!This was my first time and certainly will not be my last!Mmmmmmm I am just about ready for a few more of those mouth Orgasms!I finally found a Chinese restaurant that has decent, quality food. If you like eggplant, you must try the spicy eggplant dinner! The eggplant is cut in chunks with noodles and some vegetables. It has a great flavor; I was pleasantly surprised.Another great entree we enjoyed during this meal was chicken egg foo young and beef and snow peas. The egg foo young consisted of thick pieces of egg omelets with chicken in a tasty sauce topped with chives. The beef and snow peas entree consisted of a lot of fresh snow peas, onion, watercress, and carrot. Although the food preparation is fairly quick, the table-side service (e.g., refills of hot tea, more napkins, check) is slow. When we were in, only one server was on the floor handling everyone in the small restaurant dining area. Regardless, she was nice and the atmosphere was comfortable, clean, and nicely decorated. This complemented the dine-in food experience.I will be back - next time for take-out!
The Foodbar=Perhaps it's just me. Perhaps I confuse easily. I mean, I could never even finish a TV Guide crossword. But the layout at Foodbar is a little freakish. ORDER HERE. PAY HERE. It's an upscale cafeteria style, that looks oh so cool and stylish but navigates like a maze and left me feeling like the dorky high school guy who wants to sit with the jocks but ends up with audio visual club. I wasn't quite sure where to go, it's very clean and modern, yet quite cluttered. The curried chicken salad was delicious as was the buttermilk chicken salad. Were they expensive? Well, it's a new Scottsdale restaurant, so yes, and I wasn't surprised. But $8 for a little dish of chicken salad? Hmmm. The parmesan risotto cakes were also good and came with a field green salad. Ham and brie baquette, well, not too inventive and quite dry and hard. The food is delivered to the table. When ours arrived, the server didn't have silverware for us. Oh? We're supposed to get it? Didn't know. Hate that. All in all, it was OK. Worth checking out again. At least now, I might know where to walk, stand and pick up my silverware and the other kids won't make fun of me!
Paradise Buffet & Cafe Restaurant=Here's my recipe for a perfect Vegas trip: Three parts obscenely cheap to one part ludicrously expensive. The $10.99 champagne brunch at Paradise Buffet is the perfect flavor for the obscenely cheap part of that recipe. Are there even cheaper brunch buffets to be found in the City of Sin? I'm sure there are, but this is the perfect three star buffet for me. For the most part, it's what you'd expect from an $11 buffet - some of the stuff sucks, some of it is okay, the bacon was dishearteningly bad, but the prime rib was surprisingly delicious. They do tout themselves as a "seafood" buffet, but... that seafood wasn't looking too hot, so I stuck to the carving station.And, of course it wouldn't be called a champagne brunch without the champagne.... that they bring to you in these awesome plastic champagne glasses (not flutes, but the older saucer lookin' ones). And, boy do they keep it comin'.... and comin'... and comin'. It's not one of those places that proudly declares endless champagne and then a waitress is nowhere to be found. No sir. You'll be lucky if you EVER see the bottom of that little plastic champagne glass here.All of this in the lush, dark, tropical setting of The Paradise Buffet. A-OK through and through.Now I'm not a buffet kind of person, but I wound up here this evening. Now why people would go here baffles me. The servers in the front are rude. No hello, hi, please, thank you, or you're welcomes from the lady Shirley. I felt like I was in a cattle herd waiting in the line and getting my way to the front. Lucky for me I had great company so I put up with it.We got seated and went up to the buffet. This was the smallest buffet selection I have ever seen. (which I guess could be good because the food was awful.) I took a little bit of the buttered noodles which were so hard and crispy. nothing like a flimsy noodle should be. The beef in the asian dishes was extra chewy. I sampled some of the taco meat, mexican rice, and beans mixed all together on my plate and got a piece of plastic in my mouth. yes, you read right. PLASTIC in my food. I was instantly turned off from anything else. In order to please my party I ate a slice of pineapple, some cottage cheese, and the wimpy salad bar. As for dessert in the ice cream section they give you warm bowls. it melted my poor vanilla ice cream into soup.This place just left me disgusted and sick to my stomach. That is hard to do but they sure did it.Thanks paradise buffet. I will not be returning and you can keep your plastic with your rude employee's.
Pho Little Saigon=Stay away.  That's all I can really say.  My mistake was not reading all the other yelp reviews before trying this place, otherwise I would have just said no.Looks can be deceiving and this place is pretty busy with large parties taking over the tables.  Not only is there a regular menu, but if you look around, you'll see pictures with numbers posted on the wall.  Good luck trying to find out what they are because they are listed on the menu and there's no pricing.  When we asked a waitress about a particular picture on the wall, all she could really say about it was that it was fish.  (Uh, we could tell that it was fish, we wanted to know what kind of sauce or how it was cooked!)In the beginning, the wait staff was on us to order but since we were taking so long, it's as if we were forgotten.  (How could they miss us with their bright yellow menus still in front of us?)After passing on their expensive pho ($6.99 to $7.99), I chose the Com Ga Hai Nam (Hai Nam style chicken with seasoned rice) for $8.99.  Initially, I had seen an entrée version of this dish and was going to inquire about it, but since I wanted the seasoned rice, I chose to go with this option.  The Big F is a big fan of Com Bo Kho (Beef stew with steamed rice) for $7.99, but usually sees it served with a French roll instead of rice.  As we waited for our food to arrive, the wait staff at a nearby table was attracting my attention.  Although I couldn't hear what they were saying, their actions were speaking louder than their words.  They were talking about clearing a table and apparently the previous diners left their barely touched strawberry shake on the table.  I'm not sure what the busboy did with that shake, but he sure didn't toss it into the garbage right away like he should have.  What really bothered us was the plate of pho garnishes that were returned to the kitchen for further use.  (How do I know he did that?  Well, he had a cleaning cart with a garbage can attached to it and he dumped all the other garbage in there.  But he made a point of taking that plate of garnishes and bringing it back to the kitchen.  That looks suspicious to me.)When my plate of Hainamese chicken arrived, it looked awful.  (Check the photos out for yourself!)  First off, it looked like leftover chicken all thrown on a plate and covered with scallions, ginger, and cilantro so I couldn't see the banged up chicken underneath.  And there was no skin left on my chicken!  Part of the dish is the tasty skin, and it looked like they gave me the healthy version!  Once I got past how little chicken I got, I noticed something else was wrong.  Uh, where is my seasoned rice?  There's a huge ball of white steamed rice on my plate and the seasoned rice is half the dish!  When I asked the waiter about it, he said they ran out of the seasoned rice.  When I explained that was why I ordered the dish, he went to the back to the kitchen.  He came back reaffirming that they did indeed run out of seasoned rice and he would give me a discount on the dish.  I was hungry, so I ate what I had in front of me.  It was far from special.The Big F's beef stew was just okay, and he's had a lot of the stew in other places.  He was initially turned off because it didn't have the same color that he was used to.  He pointed out that there was a lot of MSG in it too.  I also saw him pour soy sauce in it, so I knew that it was not hitting his taste buds.When we went up to pay, I noticed they didn't give me any discount.  I had to ask the waiter about it, and he took $2 off the total bill.  (At least he did that!)In the end, bad food with average service and suspicious kitchen practices.  Although they offered a few unique family dinner options, you won't see us walking through these doors again any time soon.  Keep on driving, there are plenty of other better Vietnamese restaurants along Spring Mountain.Cash only.Update: After posting this review, someone contacted me saying their wife worked here part-time.  He mentioned that they do not resell the smoothies, but they do reuse the pho condiments since they are a bit expensive.  The last I checked, bean sprouts and limes were not expensive.NOTE: I'm only reviewing this place based on what I heard and experienced. I didn't get a chance to eat here, but I do have an AWESOME story to tell...You know wassup..after the club..where do you usually hit up?! The spot that's open 24 hours or hella late. In San Diego, it's usually Denny's for me. I have many memories from there (good and bad), but mostly good. =)In Vegas...it was "Pho Little Saigon" for us! Now..I have been to establishments for pho post-clubbing and it is always PACKED full of asians. We sure love our pho! Usually, it is the go-to spot to sober up and grab some good eats, even though everything does taste good under the influence of alchy.Half drunk and feet in major pain from the shitty heels that I wore, I dashed to use the restroom while everyone was seating. Again, this place was practically empty and wow so was the restroom. Very rare for a female. Oh! Joy! I get to pick my own stall! The BIG one! I do my bizz and I noticed the cool electronic hand towel machine. Wait..no paper towels are coming out. This is automatic and sensored?! Is it broken?! Oh wait..a light on the bottom right was visible so I do a circular wave and WABAAM...paper towels pop out! Woohoo! Pretty awesome feeling when you're typsy!Next thing you know another girl (from the club I assumed) walks in slightly typsy as well and was about to get paper towels and I noticed she was having a difficult time getting the paper towels to come out.  Feeling like an "expert" by now, I showed her how to operate the machine and in amazement she was pretty impressed that I was able to figure it out and she couldn't. She kinda felt dumb. haha So..my head was kinda getting slightly big at this moment and we both were about to depart the restroom and as I was exiting I went straight out the door into the MENS RESTROOM!! Well..ALMOST! Oh man! I stopped just in the knick of time and she looks at me and we both laugh uncontrollably! I didn't feel so smart anymore and she didn't feel so dumb. =/Head over to where my group was and told my little story and all were amused or from what I recall at least. Wasn't slightly hungry since I ate prior to clubbing, which wasn't very long since I couldn't groove much to the music due to my CRAPTASTIC shoes! Ugh! Anywhoo, I noticed poor Melly Su was somewhat enjoying her soup until she accidentally spilled it on her legs..SUPER HOT..like boiling HOT! I only touched the bowl, and it was waaay toooo HOT!! No bueno. I think that may have woke/sobered her up though!What the PHO?! I know. These pho jokes are getting old, but I had to slip one in there. It's kinda like tradition. Anywhoo...No mmm's or ahhhh's from the group of friends so I thought maybe it was just A-OK. Soup is just soup sometimes. Oh ya..I also recall Melly Su telling my pal, "Chris-Chan" to eat her burnt eggroll. haha! It seriously was beyond burnt! As typsy as I was..I even knew it wouldn't taste good. Who you foolin' "Little Saigon" ??? GHETTOO!!The End.**Okay..so maybe not an AWESOME story. Maybe it would sound better under the influence??? Oh well..still worthy of a review right?! heheThere is little doubt that this is the best Pho restaurant in Las Vegas. I think the reason why there are a lot of bad reviews here on yelp is because  a lot of Pho restaurants on Spring Mountain  have the word "SAIGON" in their title. There is "Pho old SAIGON", "Pho SAIGON 8", " Pho SAIGON" "Pho Huong SAIGON" "Pho Vietnam SAIGON", and even another "Pho Little Saigon" that is an unrelated restaurant. .  I think most the people are confusing this place for another restaurant because there is no way you could dislike the food from here. Everyone who follows my weird and profanity filled reviews knows that my favorite food in the world is Miso Ramen.  The Pho at PHO LITTLE SAIGON is the only Pho in the world which I would eat over Ramen on occasion.  Obviously, I would still rather go to a place like "Anime Ramen" where everyone knows your name after only your 1st visit, and your bowl of noodles practically comes with a show + entertainment....but  sometimes I'm just in the mood for cilantro and a clear soup.I recommend everyone to try the Rare Steak Pho.  They use a very high quality cut of steak. I think it might be petite sirloin because it was extremely soft tender and just melted in your mouth. It almost had the texture of Filet Mignon. What I really liked was how the steak  was blood red. They don't even cook it, they just poor the hot soup over the meat and serve immediately. The broth is crystal clear and clean. It looks like the water off the coast of Hawaii because you could see clear down to the bottom.  The top of the broth is full of natural oils. These oils are common in soups where you had to boil bones for over 20 hours. They are purely natural and are a great visual indication of the high quality.They use Red Onions instead of generic onions! Red onions make the Pho taste so much better than the regular brown onions. They are definitely not cheap here. You get over 1/2 a pound of free bean sprouts and basil. You ask for extra limes and they literally hand you the whole lime(and it's a giant lime).  Most places like "Pho So 1" and "Pho Kim Long" give you half of even a half of a lime wedge.  If you ask for extra onions, they literally slice the whole onion and give you the whole thing. The service was very quick and fast. I think it's worth mentioning that they are Cash Only. So don't blow all your cash at the casino..save some of it and bring it here. It is also worth mentioning that they are open 24 hours/ 7 days a week. From now on, this is the only Pho restaurant I would ever go to in Las Vegas. Not only is the food great, but you don't have to sit next to the typical drunk-degenerate-immature Vegas Club Douche like at  "Pho Kim Long". And you don't have to be ignored and treated like crap like at "Pho So 1". PHO LITTLE SAIGON also better fits my lifestyle. It's open 24 hours, it's atmosphere is more quite and relaxing, and the service is alright by me!COCKROACHES IN MY FUCKING SOUP! Stay away, I'm seriously fucking sick to my stomach right now. They are still trying to charge me even after I showed them it floating in my soup, mind you I've been eating it already. I told them I'm not giving them anything. I mean pest control is not that hard and if you have a problem take care of it. How dirty does the back have to be for this to happen. NEVER AGAIN!Writing this review as I leave this place and sadly If I could give this place no stars I would. Keeping this review short and simple... Came here with 8 friends on a late night and found a baby cockroach, in one of my friends pho after he was half way done with his food. I don't know what's worse but the fact the cockroach was in the pho or the fact that everyone got the same thing and it was the same broth? I guess thanks for the free food? Never again will I come here!!Very rude and not helpful at all. I was looking for a dish with snow peas and he said they don't have it because of holidays and to try pho Kim long.I explained how I went there and management told me they don't sell snow peas and his response was "us too" when on the menu there are about 3-4 options WITH EFFING SNOW PEAS.I've come here once before and thought id try a second chance but after this and all their health code violations NEVER AGAIN.
Zest of India=Do NOT go here!  It used to be Taste of India or something like that.  I went out of my way on a weekly basis to go there.  Until just last weekend.  Ugh.  The pakoori were plain old fried veggies.  The Chicken Tikka Masala had chunks of...something white.  The chicken itself seemed ok (how can you screw up tandoori???) but I will never, EVER go there agin!NE corner 32nd St and Greenway.*sigh*
Stax Burger Bistro=I like the burger tapas concept thing they have going, but the entire time I was here as I sat on the patio, I laughed at the "Under Construction" sign of Delux under plain view smack dab across the street on Scottsdale Road.So of course during my meal I couldn't help but draw comparisons to Delux.  Granted, it probably would have happened anyway, but regardless, I found the constant reminder amusing.  My friend Maya brought me and some out-of-towner friends who ooed and aahed over the place.  "Sliders are so trendy!" I exclaimed to the group as we basked in the stench of the Scottsdale canal from the patio and watched as sceney passersby and diners enjoyed the Saturday afternoon.  I immediately felt like hurling, not sure if it was over the stench, the half-joking insipid exclamation I made, or the poseurish crowd - inclusive of a blond Scottsdale broad in a baby blue jumpsuit with matching blue flip flops. (We saw that blue Smurf atrocity later at Giligin's, naturally.)Back to Stax -- the 3 oz. burgers themselves are good...not excellent, and not bad either.  They offer more variety in burgers than Delux:  salmon, turkey, ostrich, veggie, etc.  The meat was cooked well done on one and a little too charred on another - the buffalo.  The highlights here are the toppings and customizable add this, add that option (incl. cheese, sauted mushrooms, caramelized onions, tots, sweet potato fries) which opens up a number of possibilities.  I really liked the toppings on the buffalo - muenster cheese, peach bbq sauce, pickled shallots and an onion ring.A friend asked our server how many to order to equal a typical hamburger and her answer was 2.5, so basically two or three.   Ahh, there's the rub.  The sliders are $4 - $5.  Ordering three will mean you spend $12 - $15.  Yikes.  Definitely more expensive than an oft-criticized-as-expensive Delux.Service here was solid if a bit slow to start.  My friends' margaritas came out very quickly, but the Diet Coke I ordered took about 10 minutes.I would come here again, if for only the dipping sauces. Garlic, aioli, pesto, chipotle.  Crap, they were all excellent.I actually love the food here.  Everything is fantastic but I have decided to write a review for another reason.  3 weeks ago I ate at Stax (as I have many times) and my final bill was $25.10 and the person who ran my card (turned out to be the owner) charged me $77.10.   Overcharging by $52.00 is quite a bit but would not have deterred me from going back if it was settled appropriately.  I noticed the charge pending and decided to wait a couple days and hopefully once the charge cleared it would be the $25.10 I had expected.  The charge ended up clearing for $77.10 and I called Stax to inform them of this and was assured that the overcharge of $52 would be readily returned to my account.  I waited about a week and still nothing.  I decided to go in and speak with an owner/manager directly.  After waiting 20 minutes for the owner to get off a personal phone call with someone he seemed to be in a dramatic relationship with, he finally was available to "help" me.  I explained what had happened and he seemed annoyed that I came in to bother him with something like this; asking "Umm this is a hassle for us, why didn't you just call your credit card company?"  I asked if I could just get cash since I was here and the refund had never been processed.  He said no and that he would "work with his accountant to get it settled."  He even tried to take my only copy of the receipt and when I said I was going to keep it he got even more annoyed asking "You don't trust me? I'm the owner."  All in all I have waited another week, called my credit card company who stated they have to give Stax 30 days to refund my money since they initially said they were going to, and nothing has happened.  I'm so very disappointed with how this situation was handled and that the owner clearly does not care about keeping costumers that have been frequenting his restaurant since it opened :-(   I know this is not a food review but although I love the food here I will not be returning to Stax since I have been treated so poorly.  You would think that an owner of a small private business would be bending over backwards to keep his clientele when he makes a mistake of this magnitude.  I guess not.It took me this long to make it to Stax and I was expecting to love it!  The concept is a good one... a la carte little miniature burgers of all kinds including turkey, veggie, beef, bison, and chicken.  Plus, several salads and sides that are meant to be shared including sweet potato fries, onion rings, and more.  I am still a little bummed as I write this review that my experience was just mediocre.I met my friend Laura for lunch at Stax per her suggestion.  When I arrived, she was waiting for me inside and although it was busy, there were a couple of open tables.  We asked on of the hostess/waitresses if it was ok if we sat there and she said yes.  No more than 2 minutes later, another waitress came over and said "Excuse me, we're holding this table for a big group and we're going to seat them here as soon as this other table is finished" (said while nodding at the table next to us).  She then escorted us to another table that was not yet cleaned off from the previous diners.  It took a while to get the new table cleaned, but it wasn't that big a deal as I was busy catching up with Laura.  But once seated the service continued to be horrible.  Our waitress seemed rushed and took our drink orders but it took forever to get our drinks.  Then, she finally took our food orders and disappeared for a really long time.  I did enjoy the salad I ordered when it finally came (I cannot remember the name but it had spinach, corn, tomato, and cheese in it) and I had a bison burger served with it as well.  Unfortunately, Laura thought she ordered two burgers but was only given one... when she wanted to add another to the order, it took forever to flag our waitress down and even longer for her to get her 2nd burger!I know this review is only based on one experience, so I am not giving up on Stax... I will go back - I have to try their sweet potato fries after all!  I just hope that my next visit to Stax is better than my first one!The great thing about Stax is when you want a burger, but not a whole big, giant, regret it by the end of the meal burger (which ABSOLUTELY has its place) their 3 oz. servings hit the mark!Today was my first visit and I enjoyed the buffalo burger as advised on the menu (topped with BBQ sauce, cheese and an onion ring). The petite sandwich was just enough to quench that hankering. The table shared the spinach-artichoke dip (super creamy and loaded with spinach) and some sweet potato fries (called sweet pots and served in a mini-fryer basket) with the "spicy" (not to be confused with the chipotle or jalapeno) aioli. Every thing is a la carte including the dipping sauces, but the prices are reasonable. Three of us had burgers, shared the fries and artichoke dip and the bill was $30 (before gratuity). We all left satisfied.The happy hour features some $3 food options to match the $3 beer and sangria. Some of the house cocktails sounded marvelous and are $6 during happy hour. Looking forward to my next visit!Kangaroo! You heard me. Last night I tried a Kangaroo burger at Stax. Um, 5 stars for that alone.  This place is awesome. I am so glad I finally tired it. The whole concept is great. The smell is intoxicating, even in the parking lot.  It's like hamburger utopia. You mix and match different types of mini burgers, usually two is enough if you order sides.  The exotic meat section blew me away and I just had to try the Kangaroo burger. I believe the selection changes frequently. I also got the turkey burger, which I really enjoyed. The patty had spices and bell pepper mixed in and the pineapple made it extra yummy with a touch of sweetness. I tried a bite of my dinning partner's buffalo and that was pretty tasty. The bread on these little guys is top notch too and grilled to be slightly crispy around the edges. The mini burgers were hefty. Honestly, they really weren't that mini, I only got through one and a half.  There were some other big hits with me. The sweet potato fries rocked. YOU MUST GET THEM.  Okay, so Fez still has the best, but these are my second favorite. I also love the cucumber water, so much better than lemon. I hate that sour crap in my water, but the cucumber is so refreshing. The only thing I didn't care for was the Mac n' Jack. It wasn't bad, just not my style. Too spicy and not creamy enough for me, it wasn't worth the calories.  The service was great too, my waitress was extremely sweet and helpful since this was my first visit.  I can't wait to go back.The decor/atmosphere rocked, the food rocked, the selection rocked, and of course- I rock.I was torn on how to rate this place. I guess If it is based on burgers alone it would be 1 star for flavor and price for that little gross thing. If it was based on customer service 5 stars for sure, sadly it is by far the best service Ive had in a whileSweet potato fries are for sure a 4 star probably the best damn friesThe burer though jeeze that thing sucked. I know they have salt because the fries were perfectly salted. For som reason the burger had absolutley no flavor at all.  Scratch that it had an overwhelming flavor of fat but no salt or seasoning. They put 2 pieces of an onion on ther even though I paid like a quarte and didnt even get one full slice. If the slider and I really mean slider is like 5 bucks the topping should be free..ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THE MEAT WAS FLAVORLESS AND OILY  IT WASNT EVEN GRASS FED. I could go on and on about that awefull waste of a cow but really the fries were that good I would go back, just for the fries. I would never put another piece of meat from that place in my body. I just cant get over the price and the non existant flavor. USE SOME SEASONINGS PEOPLE oh and free topping come on. .25 cents for  2 finger nail clipping size pieces of onion. after paying 5 bucks for about 1 oz of meat that tasted like flavorless oil I just cant say anything good about the burgerIt was Stax for lunch today. Out on the patio (heated for our enjoyment...it was too doggone cold today..can the Scottsdale CofC do something about that please?).Our beautiful daughter Whitney is moving to Old Town Scottsdale, and she had to come over for a walk-through. She called and asked if her dear decrepit father (me!!!) was available for lunch, so we walked up to Stax.I have been here several times before and I always enjoy it.We got some totz (which is similar to a Tater Tot, but with a "z", so hipper), and sliders (a sloppy joe, a chicken, a kobe beef and a veggie).Everything was well prepared, and well timed. The service was really good (it's been a little bit uneven at times in the past, but I say "judge slowly"). They even brought a sampler of some of the aioli's to try with the totz, as well as with the sliders, no charge! Very nice touch!The only down side to Stax is that it's a little expensive for sliders, esp compared to places like Chicago Hamburger, etc. But this place is not a hole in the wall. The atmosphere is really pleasant, Stax has a full bar so I can get a marti with my sliders, they have totz, there's room to sit down comfortably and the people watching is, as always, great.You will enjoy Stax (that's not an order, BTW, just an observation:) )I've been back to Stax a few times recently... and actually twice in the past week - so, it's time for an update and a bump up in rating from 3 stars to 4.Service has been consistently much better than it was my first visit, and the food is consistently fresh and filling.  If you order a bunch of things ala carte like I do, the bill will add up, but you get what you pay for... it's worth it.  I've continued to order the buffalo burger but I've branched out and tried a few different salads, the brussel sprouts, and broccoli.  I like that there is a wide variety to choose from and that you can custom create basically whatever you'd like.I also love the cucumber water!Still haven't tried the sweet potato fries - they are extremely tempting though, so I am sure I will go back soon to try them when the craving strikes.If you haven't been yet, Stax is worth a visit.  Enjoy!my boss asked me where we should go for lunch today and i was already a nervous wreck thinking he was going to fire me or something. why did he want to go to lunch??! i've been here 4 years and we have never had lunch. i think i got an ulcer worrying about it yesterday. anyway, i panicked and just started listing things that I knew would be close to work and some how stax popped out of my mouth. instantly i started thinking to myself  'oh, crap, why did you just say that? i hope he doesn't say he wants to go to stax' and then he was like 'hmm, stax sounds good' CRAP! so whatever, i'm an agreeable girl. and i did, afterall, suggest it... kinda.  we got a table and i ordered water w. lemon and he had a diet coke. when his DC came, i remembered another reason for hating this place. the DC came in a stupid bottle. i hate that they do that. its like they just want to find any reason to charge you for something stupid. i bet they wanted to charge me for my lemon slice, too. which, by the way, is the dumbest, lamest lemon wedge. you can't even squeeze it. totally pointless slice of lemon. i wasn't hungry so i just ordered a little burger and it looks so sad and wimpy on the plate. he took a bite of his chicken and put it down and it totally looked raw. so i look at my boss and he has this look of disgust on his face. sure enough, it wasn't cooked. he lost his appetite.they comped our meal but now he won't ever go back either. that makes another person i know of who will never eat there again. we left and the waitress came running out to ask if we wanted the receipt?? that's funny. so you didnt notice us the entire time to notice that my water was empty or his DC was gone? you didnt notice us when my boss tried to track you down to tell you his food was raw so he had to bring it to you?  but you notice us the second we leave so you can chase us down the street to give us a receipt?? ummmmmmmm. ya, i hate this place.
Olive Garden Italian Restaurant=I only ever go to this Olive Garden when I have a gift card. The couple of times I ate inside the service was terrible and too many things went wrong to mention. I did bring it up to the manger. I decided from then on out I would only use the curbside to go and only like I mentioned, if I have a gift card.I decided to get the "Soup, Salad & Bread Sticks" deal and a side of the "Alfredo Dipping Sauce". I found the curbside parking and waited. And waited. And waited. I know it doesn't take that damn long to ladle some soup in a bowl, gather some bread sticks and container me some of that store bought salad mix. So, I got my food and headed home. I thought the salad looked yummy but it didn't taste yummy. The soup was good though. I loved the bread sticks and alfredo sauce. I just wish for $3.75 they weren't so stingy with it! They give you this cup that could clearly hold decent amount yet they put like a little layer in it.The curbside is convenient if they can bring your food in a timely manner.

We sat at the bar where there was a happy hour special, with mini sliders and drink specials - all of which were lovely.  The service up to this point was pretty good, and we had great time chatting and noshing and drinking.The bill came (it was $60 something) and the four of us each threw down a $20 and a few bucks so there was close to $90 to cover our bill plus tip.We proceeded to walk away and as we were trying to decide which direction we should go, the server comes running after us telling us that we were trying to stiff him!  Huh?  I thought maybe we miscalcuated the tip - so I reached for my wallet, when he tells us that we only put down $40...not $90 that I *KNEW* we put down.After an *intense* discussion, the moment where one of my friends started to demand a manager, the server tells us to wait where we were, so that he could check to make sure that nothing was left under a napkin or something.  Magically, he checked with the busboy and the busboy "accidentally threw away" the rest of the money.Um, I call BULLSHIT.  We should have stuck around and demanded to speak to a manager anyways - but we were on a short timeline to get a lot of shopping done so we left...but I seriously regret not calling a manager over, because seriously, that is some shady shenanigans!!!!!!!
Stripburger=Thanks, Yelpers!  We never would have walked around the corner and found this place if not for you!Since it's called Stripburger, I was hoping there would be strippers, boooo for no strippers!  Yes, I get that it's on the strip, hence the name, but I'm always hoping for strippers.....Good sliders - why am I the only one in love with the buns here?  Maybe I'm just a carb slut, but those buns are GOOD!Good fries, hey if you're having a burger, you must have fries!GREAT milkshakes!  And with a SHOT?! (and by that I mean 2 shots...) How cool is that!?  Decent service, good people watching, nice to sit outside.Good place to have a nice, inexpensive lunch!$2.00 Specials at the bar at Happy Hour. Great Cheap Late Night EaTS!Sliders,Onion Straws,Fries and beer $2 eachI went for the full-size burgers this time however, we ordered the cheddar & mushroom and the greeen chile burger.-BOTH were fantasticThe warm potato chips with cheese & onion was quite delicious as well!!Service is good, the atmosphere is great for people watching and is really nice in the fall here in Vegas since its an outdoor bar.Be sure to check them out this coming weekend 10/17 at Desert Breeze Park at the BITE of Las Vegas!!Saturday: The bf & I are driving up & down the strip & noticed the words "Burgers, Shakes & Cakes" in neon green letters. It was 12:30 am, we're starving & had just been told Mesa Grill closes at 11 pm (this is Vegas, baby, why would anything close that early?) Stripburger to the rescue!Atmosphere: circular design with bar in the middle & tables on the perimeter. Lots of neon green lighting (like they're on St. Patty's Day overload.) Music is a super upbeat & is a mix of R&B & hip hop (Rhianna, Kanye, Fergie.) Wherever you are seated, you'll have a pretty good view of The Strip.Service: Hostess was a very concerned Asian girl who explained why there would be a few minute wait & checked on us to make sure our waitress had come by. Waitress was quick & efficient-loved her.Food: Extra yummy. The bf & I shared "the threesome" (fries, extra thin onion strings & something I've been wanting to try-fried pickles) & a banana shake (good size for sharing, lots of *real* banana flavor.) I ordered a chicken burger with bacon, BBQ sauce & caramelized onions (flavors are fantastic-i definitely recommend this one ) & the bf had a cheddar bacon cheeseburger. Total: $33 (not including tip.) I could give Stripburger a big ole' smooch for being open til 2 am.We arrived in Vegas just in time for lunch. After checking my mother's luggage at the Wynn we roamed around looking for a place to eat. Being hungry and a bit cranky we decided to go somewhere before I got to the "Feed me now or it's off with your head" stage. Lo and behold a burger joint across the street! Stripburger is an all-outdoor eatery with shaded tables and of course: full bar. The friendly hostess greeted & seated us quickly. Scanning the menu, two things quickly caught my eye: the green chile cheeseburger and the pickle fries. H ordered the hickory burger and my mother settled on the daily special which was the bacon cheeseburger with small fries. We ordered a side of fries (the burgers do not come with a side). The pickle "fries" came out first but were actually chips instead of spears. I was expecting spears and prefer them over the chips but these fried sour pickle chips were pretty darn good! I have come to the conclusion that the best pickle to batter and fry is the good old sour dill. Sliced thin and coated with a light crispy batter, these pups didn't last long. Our burgers arrived and Whoa Nellie are they huge! My burger was laden with roasted Hatch green chiles, melted pepper jack cheese, tomatoes, pickles, lettuce and onions. The burger was thick, juicy and full of flavor. Grilled to perfection and served piping hot once I picked it up it never kissed the plate again. Fries? What fries. I was too busy with my burger. I did manage to try one and it was a-ok. But really you don't need no stinkin' fries! H declared his burger superior to the Cheeseburger in Paradise found you-know-where. The staff's friendly and they work together well. I spotted several heaters for when the weather is cold but have no idea what they do when summer hits L.V. If you are looking for a quick, cheap and insanely great burger look no further than Stripburger.Went to have dinner with some co-workers and we all agreed on Strip Burger! It is located right beside the fashion show mall, towards the strip.  It is also an outdoor setting, so beware come summer time!! There are about 10 burgers to choose from, and all are about $10 each, without fries! So, I'm guessing that's pretty pricey for just a burger. I recently tried the Southwest chipotle burger, and the burger was A-ok!! I'd have to say the famous blue cheese burger is what keeps me coming back!! Another must-try are the onion strings!! An order can be shared until it is all gone! =DThe chocolate shake is also magnificent! You can just taste and feel the chocolate bits melt in your mouth!! I wish there was a happy hour, or maybe there is? One that I don't know of yet!I must admit, I expected an over priced tourist trap with mediocre at best food. Instead, I received an extremely delicious buffalo chicken sandwich and sweet potato fries. The food was very much on point, albeit still pricey. The sandwich ( a la crate) was $9.95 + sweet potato fries which were around $4.00 and a Stella which was also around $4.00. But, my friend works for Apple at Fashion Show so our gracious waiter gave us 20% off discount which brought our bill to $24 combined. This was reasonable price to pay for a delicious sandwich with a beer and fries on the strip. Our server was very nice, but the hostess and the bartender looked bored and snobby. Yawn. Also, be prepared for the OBNOXIOUS drunk foreign tourists. All in all not a bad place to grab a delicious burger and a beer and people watch.HAPPY NIGHT!The Happy Hour starts here at 11pm and goes until close...I love Vegas! You can really find a happy hour at any hour in Vegas. I can not believe I am reviewing this place because it is my secret place to go to and just veg out alone.  One of the managers at Mon Ami Gabi told me about this place 6 years ago and I always come down for some cheap $2 beers (Happy Hour) and a little dinner. Amy the bartender is really nice and I've seen her on past visits but I'm sure she doesn't remember me.  You might think she's unfriendly at first but once you start talking to her you will then realize how cool she is. She works her butt off at the circle bar. Running around keeping customers happy and also making drinks for the servers tables. The burgers here are good but I wouldn't expect anything less from a Lettuce Entertain You restaurant. Plus Chicago chains rock!!! I know...spoken like a true Chicago Boy! Hey I've got to stand up for my city! I have no idea why they haven't opened this concept in Chicago. (I'm not a fan of there M Burger...the rip off version of In n Out)My favorite thing here is the butter salad but now it seems to come with romaine and spinach. The salad is nice and large. It is worth the money because you will feel full. I know what your thinking...a salad in Vegas...yes after everything my body has been put through it needs this. I also enjoyed the onion rings too. I know it's an app but it really isn't for sharing because there's only like 6 rings in here. So get your own basket! No really get your own!This is just a great place to chill out and relax. I also love that it is outside too. There is not much of a view unless you like looking at Steve Wynn's billions towering in the desert sky. The food is priced reasonable for Vegas and the Happy Drinks will save you a bunch. Until next time strip burger.Lettuce Entertain You sent me some coupons for 5 of their restaurants in town and Stripburger was the last of them that I had never been to.  Today, I stopped in for lunch/dinner.I opted to sit at the bar and chat with Rebecca, the bar keep and my server.  She got me an iced tea while I looked at the menu.  Good server, very pleasant woman!I had looked at the menu online and was all set to order the burger I had chosen when I did a switch and went with the mini burger sampler.  This consists of three sliders--the blue cheese burger, the whiskey BBQ burger, and the cheddar burger.   I asked for the burgers to be done rare and they were.  That was a bit surprising because of their smaller size.  They cooked them the way they should.  With the burger, I got an order of garlic, herb fries which was large enough to feed me and the two other people at the bar.While waiting, I enjoyed the people watching which is a big draw for this place.  Being on the corner of Las Vegas Boulevard and Fashion Show Drive and with all seating being patio seating, it's a great place if you just want to have a drink and watch the tourists go by.  Of the burger sampler, I liked the blue cheese and the whiskey BBQ the best.  All three were good, but these two were better.  The fries were excellent.  So much garlic, good herb seasoning, and lots of salt on my part and I was set.My iced tea was refilled without asking.  I'd bring my wife here sometime if it wasn't so difficult to get to.  It is outside at the farthest corner of Fashion Show Mall.  Maybe I'll just go back myself.Cool lunch spot on the strip for a casual and quick meal. Ordered the pickle fries to share, a big green salad, the famous cheese burger, and an orange whip cocktail. The food was average and not something that I would go out of my way to eat again. The fried pickles were good; something you'd only be able to get at a fair or carnival. My only complaint about the dish was that the pickle slice wouldn't hold to the breading, so I was left with a chunk of fried breading after each bite. The big green salad was fresh and light. The croutons on the salad were house made and also very fresh. I enjoyed the lightness and acidity of the avocado dressing. My dining partner ordered a cheeseburger which was great in terms of flavor and presentation, but not comparable to my favorite LA spots. The cocktail was refreshing and well made as well. The service was average for being on the strip. Our waitress was sweet and made a few recommendations on our orders. The ambience was also nice because even though we were technically sitting indoors, the view of the strip and the openness felt like I was sitting in an outdoor setting. Overall, good place to grab lunch if in the area but otherwise not something super memorable.My daughter and I had a GREAT lunch here!!!  It's on the corner of the Fashion Show mall across from Encore/Wynn and is all outside/patio dining.  Don't fret--the misters on the patio are cranking and we were borderline cold on a July afternoon.  The caesar salad was perfect for splitting and the burgers/sandwiches were a good portion.  We both loved our lunches (minus a tad too much pepper on the burger) and we left full and happy.  Looking forward to the construction in front of the mall to be done to enhance the ambience a bit, but all in all a good choice for lunch.
TENDER Steak & Seafood=70+ visits and Tender continues to deliver!!!This is my goto spot to unwind in Vegas.  Why?1.  Top notch service especially at the bar.  Bar staff is incredible.  Perfect if your dining alone.2.  Simple food done right.3.  Well chosen "special" ingredients (like their butter... ask them about how its sourced, and the game).4.  Very reasonable prices. (Expect to pay less than $100 for a couple of drinks and dinner especially with all the discounts they give you just for walking into the Luxor).As always, the rule with Tender is, if its different, order it, else keep it simple.The charcuterie and deli meats (different) is outstanding.  It includes wild boar sausage, duck ham, and antelope pastrami with a selection of mustard.  Wow!  The salmon sampler (simple) is also well worth the try.  Both are large portions and can easily be a light meal if you pair it with a drink.For mains, its all about the meat.  Take your pick of the cuts and different producers.  This is the short list:  American Kobe from Mishima Ranch, Durham Ranch Bison, Strauss Farm veal, and free-range Berkshire Heritage pork.  Any cut.  All incredible and take the classic flavors of each type of meat to the limit. You will notice this immediately.Finally, if you're adventurous, have the wild game tasting or if they have it as a special order the elk chop.  I can't even describe how good these dishes are.Skip the sides unless you are really hungry.RECOMMENDEDAn incredible steakhouse.   Outstanding food.  Solid wine list.  Excellent service.  Stellar value.(Sorry this review is long, there is a lot to share).It's in Luxor.  Stop laughing.  Once you get past the lobby (hey, you can't hide the fact you're in a giant pyramid), renovations have made the casino as contemporary as any.  Five years and 120+ visits;  Tender continues to impress.  Innovation keeps the menu exciting.  Rapidly changing seasonal specials showoff the chef's commitment to freshness.  For summer, the heirloom tomato salad with over a dozen varieties of fresh, vine ripened tomatoes dressed in olive oil and sea salt with micro basil and slices of uber fresh, milky mozzarella just incredible.  A full blown tomato party in your mouth.  The salad is large enough for two.For bison month, a charred bison carpaccio topped with a spicy aioli, arugula salad with roasted peppers and sweet corn finished with a touch of sea salt.  Incredible!Other killer starters, the charcuterie of game and deli meats (bresaola, finochietta, wild boar sausage, pork coppa, lamb prosciutto and antelope pastrami) with cornisons, assortment of olives and mustard, an excellent take on the classic.  The chilled salmon tasting, a true standout; hot apple wood smoked salmon topped with black truffle "caviar" on a bed of pesto, edamame, and sea asparagus.  Wow!  An explosion of flavors, oily salmon, earthy truffle, herbaceous basil, the back taste of the pine nuts, the crunch and oceanic flavor of the sea asparagus.  Perfect.Outstanding steaks at all quality and price ranges.  The Bison ribeye is very hard to pass.  Deep meaty flavor, low fat.  JAPANESE KOBE A5 WAGYU.  The real deal.  $95 / 8oz.  I doubted it, I saw it, I tried it.  Yes, yes, yes.  Extremely well trimmed.  Request it cooked below rare.  It's an ethereal experience, seared goodness on the outside, chilled, tender with melting fat on the inside.Something different?  Wild game platter remains excellent.  Berkshire kurabuta pork chop (order this medium) near perfect heritage pork flavor.  Sweet, tender, and porky!  Finally the bison osso buco; tender perfectly braised, deeply flavored bison on a bed of enriched mashed potato and tangy bbq onions.  Incredible balance.  The marrow is a special treat.Tip:  check out the sides.  Roasted bone marrow glazed with a veal demi an insane value at $5, Hudson foie for $10.  Add it to any steak or have it alone with some bread as a starter.Sure, missteps do happen but are always corrected with no fuss.For the absolute best service on a casual night out, eat at the bar.  Friendly, very knowledgeable bar staff who aim to please.  The music in the lounge a little loud, but it keeps the energy up.Great wine program with the lowest markup on the Strip.  Huge by the glass pours.  Wines by the bottle near retail.  Check out the Captains' List for clearance wines below retail.Snub the Luxor all you want, you will be missing a great restaurant.Tender was good.  I don't know if I would crave to go there again. The service was excellent. Our server was very nice with a sense of humor. They did however get the cuts of meat mixed up and cooked them the wrong way. We did not bother to correct it.  My steak was cooked the way I wanted.  I also asked for extra butter to which they forgot. The oysters were good. The Mac n cheese was probably the best thing I ate.  I love truffle.Review #500Allow me to preface this review by thanking Yelp for providing me the opportunity to become part of such a friendly and positive social community.  I am thankful, as well as grateful, for all the acquaintances and friendships that I have nurtured and developed over the past five years.  Since becoming a more active member last year, I have attended numerous enjoyable and lively events, met many fun and humorous people, gained knowledge on the art of photobombing, co-hosted three UYEs, and established new friendships.  Though this review is about a restaurant, it's significant since my meal at Tender was with two wonderful friends I met thru Yelp.  At the same time, my main purpose of traveling to Las Vegas was to meet and reunite with old/dear friends.  And so, I dedicate my 500th review to Yelp, good friends, good food, and good times.  Now, on to the review:a TENDER moment.Truly some of the best food and service I have experienced has been in the gambling capital of America, Las Vegas.Many thanks to fellow yelper, Rod U., for introducing me to his "kitchen" while vacationing in Las Vegas recently.  Located on the casino level of the Luxor, the bar area is inviting while opening up to the remainder of the spacious restaurant.  Though Tender doesn't look very grand or large from the outside, surprisingly the restaurant stretches farther within (as I soon found out after a visit to the restroom).Since Rod had dined here numerous times (and actually regained his Dukedom during the trip), I allowed him to take the lead on where to sit and what to order.  Rod's area of choice:  the bar, of course.  Now, for those of you who are not fond of bar seating, I implore you to rethink your decision.  Bar seating is quite enjoyable and entertaining to say the least.  It was clearly no surprise that Rod knew practically all of the bartenders working on both of our visits.  Mike and Robin stand out, particularly, in my memory for their outgoing and social personalities.  FOOD:*Tomato salad (shared):  A special consisting of various types of tomatoes from the Napa Valley served with mozzarella cheese and spattered with olive oil.  It was exquisite.  The perfect start to our meal.  Recommended if available.*Chilled salmon tasting:  Three types were served including house cured gravlax, hot apple-wood smoked Skuna Bay salmon, and cold smoked Atlantic salmon.  Absolutely delicious.  I'd order this appetizer again for sure.*Lamb Tasting:  This dish included lamb rack chop and lamb loin porterhouse.  Served with couscous and rosemary garlic lamb sauce.  Having only tried lamb once before, I decided to be adventurous.  The lamb was prepared well, and I enjoyed this dish immensely.   Cuts and portion size were just right.The second dinner/visit with Rod and Terry K proved to be more enjoyable, humorous and full of laughter.  It seems its always a party with these two whether in Hawaii or on the mainland.  Of course, we all sat at the bar where we could engage in good conversation with the staff and amongst ourselves.  Plus, another round of drinks is quicker to order at the bar (*wink).FOOD:*Escargot (shared):  A nice start to the meal.  Small portions shared between the three of us.  *Bone Marrow:  Generous portion that looks intimidating, until you realize the actual portion must be separated from the bones themselves.  Very delectable.  For those that have yet to try bone marrow, take a chance and do try it at least once.  *Pork Chop:  I was shocked when the dish was finally set before me.  The portion is a behemoth certainly.  My fear was I wouldn't be able to make a dent after all the appetizers we ordered.  The meat was tender and preparation just perfect.  DRINK:  Martinis and wine were the beverages of choice for dinner.  An extensive wine list is available.DESSERT:*Espresso martini:  The perfect end to a delicious meal.   That is all.SERVICE:  Friendly, accommodating, meticulous, with superb attention to detail.  And I'm not just talking about the bartenders.  All staff we encountered exhibited such exceptional customer service.  Waters were readily refilled, rounds of drinks were quickly provided when requested, plates were cleared away and silverware replaced in a timely manner.  Appetizers and entrees were also delivered within a reasonable amount of time from when orders were placed.  There were some great conversations had with the bartenders especially, as they asked about where we were going and what we planned to do while in Vegas.  All the while they were also seeing to other patrons and filling drink orders for the restaurant.  Just an outstanding showing of camaraderie, teamwork, and exceptional service overall.  A job well done.BOTTOM LINE:  A memorable and delicious meal shared with two wonderful friends, whom I never would have met were it not for Yelp.  Cheers to good friends and good food!!Located in Luxor with nearly three-hundred seats and the sort of pandering service that describes everything as 'beautiful' or 'amazing,' despite evidencing zero knowledge of the province or preparation technique involved in the cuisine, it was finally on Saturday that myself and two friends sat down at Tender - the combination of a gift certificate and one of the few menus in Las Vegas to offer wild game making up for everything service and the humid, stagnant space lacked.Heralded by some as a hidden gem, while others find the entire Luxor property almost entirely irrelevant to Sin City's culinary landscape, it was just after 5:30 that our trio sat down in one of several dining rooms and with heavy wood speckled with rustic décor beneath low lighting the upsale specials were largely ignored, a focus on the cheese menu showing far less unique options than those suggested online (and described, oddly, as only available 'at the bar',) leading to a three course menu - one friend's Oysters Rockefeller completely forgotten when the waiter tried to push 'outstanding' tuna tartare while the rest of the order trickled out slowly with minimal description, but excellent execution from the men and women behind the grills.Having reached out through social media in order to understand how the wild game menu had come to be in such an unexpected space it was not long after warm bread and aromatic pesto arrived that GM James Clare stopped by to say hello and subsequently fetching Chef K.C. Fazel, a gracious man with obvious passion for his products and preparation, the story of Tender's relationship with farmers up north as well as the Chef's Midwestern upbringing soon had me all the more interested in what was to come - not even the frequently empty water glasses, 80F+ temperature, or ongoing "beautiful," "wonderful," "excellent" verbiage being fed to each and every table around enough to bring me down.With the aforementioned oysters forgotten, course one began with two appetizers, and as one friend was treated to a rich broth teaming with tender oxtail, caramelized onions, grilled bread, and cheese that ranks amongst the best I have ever tasted my $19 slice of duck liver a true first glimpse of things to come - the foie gras' sapor more intense than generally seen amongst steakhouse fare with the crispy rice cake providing a texture-rich base more than amicable to sopping up both the offal's residual oils and a drizzle of port wine and juicy red fruit.Moving on to mains and sides, it was after some delay that seven plates arrived tableside and although presentations were sorely lacking, save for the young man who described the seafood tasting, it would be nearly impossible to find fault in anything save for mundane potatoes - the smoky bone marrow portion exceedingly generous given the $6 tab while both the crispy duck bacon and thick, cheese-imbued rice were equally well prepared, all of them dishes best shared.Speaking to entrees, for myself the beef was a bit humdrum, though the sear and center were both on-point medium rare, while both tastings were every bit as good as the quality of sourcing, the whitefish admittedly a touch fishy thus allowing both salmon and scallops to steal the spotlight while each constituent of the wild game trio was peerless, the Osso Buco tender and full of funk while both elk and boar delivered on the chef's promise that even his leaner cuts were bound to impress, the latter particularly impressive as smoky saline notes met a perfect foil in housemade chutney.At this point feeling the effects of a full stomach combined with the restaurant's toasty temperature it was in an elegant iced coffee presentation that I indulged while my tablemate fancied tea and genuinely unable to resist dessert the team at Tender had me at the words "Bread Pudding," the sizable round swimming in a pool of boozed up bananas beneath slowly melting ice cream - an excellent dish its own right but certainly no match for the torched s'mores cake, an absolute stunner that was neither too sweet nor too heavy, something I only wish could have been said for a fallen-on-arrival soufflé that was worth neither the twenty minute preparation nor the calories involved.Flying well below the radar given its gaming-floor adjacent location in Luxor, Tender is at once the sort of 'big meat' place that many envision when thinking of the typical Vegas steakhouse AND the sort of place where a largely unheralded chef has been allowed to carve out a niche that few would expect - if only the front of house could be brought up to speed with the team in the kitchen there is little doubt that this diamond in the rough could shine amongst the city's best.Review #500"For those who believe, no proof is necessary.  For those who don't, no proof is possible".  Stuart Chase.Personal Musings - What makes a restaurant great?  Cutting edge, imaginative food?  Michelin quality service?  Magical ambiance?  Dare I say, as a foodie, they all contribute, but Michelin stars, James Beard awards, even yelp stars mean jack $hit.  Great dining experiences are based on the company one chooses to share the meal.  Everything else just plays a supporting role.  To some, it's the neighborhood deli down the street or the okazuya of their childhood.  To me, simply the place that I have celebrated more evenings with friends, old and new, forged more new relationships in a new city than anywhere else...170 visits.  Solid food.  Outstanding service (especially at the bar).  Comfortable ambiance.   When a rare problem arises, it's corrected with no fuss or excess intrusion.   Nothing get's in the way of a great time.New management is currently updating the menu and the wine list.  Many old time favorites are gone, replaced by simpler dishes and seasonal specials.For starters, the seasonal heirloom tomato plate (over a dozen different types of tomatoes dressed in EVOO, topped with pink Himalayan sea salt and micro basil) is a must.  Colorful and playful for the palate.  The contrast in sweetness and acidity between the different types of tomatoes is very pronounced.  The exotic mushroom soup is also outstanding.  Mushroomy flavor in a broth seemingly including bone marrow in consistency and flavor.   Fresh oysters and a classic shrimp cocktail round also make for good eats.This is a steakhouse and the beef shines.  The A5 Kobe is the real deal.  Ask for the certificate if you don't believe it.  Offered in both a filet and boneless rib eye, absolutely delicious and the lowest price anywhere on the Strip.   Very tender, sweet, with a clean beef flavor.  Very buttery.  Order it simply seared (below rare) for the best experience.   A good selection of cuts from different producers including an outstanding bison rib eye.  All are perfectly seared, cooked to temperature, simply seasoned with salt and pepper.Other standout mains include the always delicious wild game trio (venison osso bucco, elk medallions, and wild boar rack chop) and the full size, perfectly braised and sauced venison osso bucco.  Solid sides including a very fairly priced bone marrow ($6).  Great albeit huge desserts, try the souffles.Very good selection of wines by the glass; massive pours.  Well chosen wine list with reasonable Vegas resort pricing.Experiences ready for the making.Bravo.
Great Wraps=After the Walk to End Alzheimer's at the Fashion Show, several of us decided to go to the food court for late breakfast/early lunch.  All of us opted for Great Wraps.  I stayed to watch our things at the tables and when some came back with their breakdfats from Great Wraps, I decided to go there too.The breakfast special was $4.99 and consisted of 2 eggs any style, 2 bacon slices or sausage links, a bagel, and some hash browns.  The order was done in about 2 minutes.The eggs were cooked as asked-over easy.  The sausage was standard and the hash browns were a oblong patty that was briefly deep fried.  The breakfast came with cream cheese for the bagel but it wasn't buttered.The breakfast was OK.  A couple of things stand out.  In the need to be fast food, the bagel was only toasted a little.  I don't want it black but neither do I want most of the bagel to be just off white toasted.  Also, the hashed brown patty could have been fried a little more.  I guess to move customers along, the cooking is done a minimum amount of time.  It was OK, nothing more.
Fulton Fish Frye=While walking through New York New York, I was excited to see this place. I love seafood and knew I had to try it out. They sell fried fish fillets, fried chicken planks, fried shrimp, fried calamari rings, fried clams, and clam chowder.First off, their fried items are fresh. It doesn't come frozen when they fry it. You can actually see them dipping the items in batter and frying it. After seeing all of this, I couldn't wait. However, it was a bit of a let down.We ordered the fish and chips, fried clams, and clam chowder in a bread bowl. All of this came out close to $30, with the addition of the add on meal. For $4 more, you get a large drink with a cole slaw.I really wanted to try the clam chowder. That's my soup of choice. I just wanted it in a cup. They only offer it in the bread bowl so I was forced to get it. The soup was good. It had chunks of clam and potato in it. It wasn't overly salty. I ended up throwing the bread bowl away.The menu was misleading. I ordered fried clams, I got fried clam STRIPS. Most of the clam strips were tiny and it was all breading. The fries that it came with were huge and crispy.My husband's meal came with two big pieces of fried fish. I tried a bite of it and it was the best thing that was ordered. The fish was moist and smooth on the inside of the hot, crispy breading.
Aloha Hawaiian BBQ=I've been here a few times and this place is just not that good. If you're looking for authentic Hawaiian food, this will definitely be a disappointment. First, the staff aren't really attentive or helpful. They kind of just take your order. No personality and not very welcoming. For foods, the chicken Katsu that I've ordered a few times had a very bland taste to it. The outer coating was more soggy then  anything. The sauce for the Katsu had a different taste to what I'm used to. It has a very watery texture to it. It comes with Mac salad which taste like pure mayonnaise and on the salty side. You probably wonder why I've ate here a "few" times like i mentioned in the beginning if I didn't like it. Well, the beau kinda likes this place and it's pretty close to his house so it's convenient when we need something quick and close by. But def not my "to go" Hawaiian joint.
Tandoori Times 2 Indian Bistro=Indian food in Arizona.I think Tandoori Times is a solid Indian restaurant for great saucy masala, soft and tender fish, hot crispy naan, and super flavorful chicken.But minus points for Justin Y. to receive an unpleasant bathroom experience after T.T. and the food took literally forever to come out. I really did appreciate the ALL YOU CAN DRINK self-serve chai teaI liked it. JY didn't.
Kapit Bahay=I was stuck in traffic on the strip - no surprise!  But, I was SO hungry after my flight that when I saw the word 'Bahay', I became so excited and did a jacked up turn to make it into the parking lot.  Stepping inside was like heaven.  Especially to a person delusional from hunger.  They have all the Filipino food you could imagine...honestly, it was that big of a selection.  After much debate, I decided on the kare-kare (ox-tail in peanut butter) and sinagang (tamarind broth soup).  With a heaping pile of steamed rice.  Under $10.  Deal alert!  The kare-kare was realllllly good.  (ALMOST as good as my mom's.)  You know how some places skimp out on the peanut butter?  Nope, not this place!  Peanut buttery goodness.  Sinagang, yum.  It had so many veggies and such a nice broth that it balanced the heaviness of the kare-kare.  I think I sat in the booth for a good 10 min after I was done eating. Food coma at its finest.I'd been craving Filipino food recently, so I decided to stop in here to satisfy that feeling. Kapit Bahay, located in the Chinatown Plaza, probably has the most authentic traditional Filipino dishes I've had in Vegas so far. The name of the restaurant, which loosely translates to "neighbor's house," is fitting because the interior decor might remind someone of a traditional Filipino household. The inside is small and does not have a lot of tables, so it fills up quick. The staff was super friendly to me and was quick to serve, despite it being a little busy in there. Just on the other side of the food line, there's a grocery area where filipino snacks and other products (eskinol, efficascent oil, etc.) are sold.They give out big portions at a good price, so it's pretty affordable (even if you do decide to get extra items or things from their grocery section). I had the kaldereta, pork adobo, and their chicken tinola. All were very flavorful and SUPER close to how my mom makes filipino food (but let's be honest, nothing ever beats your family's cooking).They didn't have labels for their food, so you'd either have to ask about them or know for yourself what you're getting. I don't think their menu is set, so it's basically whatever they decide to cook that day is what they'll be serving. I'm pretty sure they always have the popular "staple" dishes like Adobo and Lechon available all the time. Overall, I think this place is definitely for those people who love filipino food in the style closest to it's roots (and yes, sometimes being "too oily" is part of that). The food is very authentic, affordable, and you get good portions! A must-try if you want to try food that reminds you of home.
The Coffee Shop=*note, sleepless night, just finished my first pot of coffee, so this review might suck*Hard to find, no sign visible from the street, most people rush past ignorant of it's existence...Even my Sons family who had lived here a year before us had never been there, and he married a coffee person.Welcome to my "Third Place" I make a fine "cuppa" at home, but a day I don't stop by here is a day that I feel a lack in my life. By far, my favorite coffee house in years, and here it is in Gilbert Az? Really? Here? Thank you Starbucks, for convincing the Masses that paying more than a quarter for a cup of Joe was acceptable, even mainstream! Lovely space, well decorated, by a person with taste, flair and fun, NOT by a committee or a panel or by customer survey. , lots of wood, with a sitting room in the back for your lazy hanging out needs. Ratty recliners? Not here, Nice... VERY nice leather chairs and sofa with driftwood tables scattered about. Nice artwork on the walls, mixing family photo's, nature photography with understated rock and Roll pictures. (having a pic of Jim Morrisons grave is cool, having a UNPRETENTOUS picture of Jim Morrison's grave is worth a star of its own, there is a fare farmers market out front, but for myself, I like to park in the rear and walk through the garden and patio... It's a oasis amidst the sprawl, the explosion of colors and aromas are a extra treat that shouldnt be missed.This family understands that the atmosphere, the music, the creation and integration into the lifeblood of the community is what makes a coffeehouse so effen awesome.and effen awesome it is! And probably most importantly... full of the exact friendly faces you need when getting your java on. Homemade sugar goodness is available. It's the sort of thing that one dreams coming from your own kitchen, but with a tad more color and odd combinations (Coffee and Cigarettes cupcakes anyone?), to intice you in. Displayed in the front case, drawing you in like a moth to a flame,  like Teri Garr in Young Frankenstein... wholesome goodness you want to introduce your Mom to, yet you know it's soooo bad for you... It's gonna kill you, but your urges make it impossible to say no.*ahem*Did I mention awesome cupcakes?Oh, I guess I just did.The "real" food is quite wonderful as well, and worth the trip on its own, you simply cant go wrong, the open face omelet is magnificent, sandwiches quiche, burrito's etc, all normal food, but with a flair and style that make every bite full of extra-awesome.One downside... success.Alas, they were discovered and won a much deserved "Best Of" award for Phoenix, since then they have had to hire more  people and the family has had to move into the kitchen to keep up. The service has not diminished, the only downturn is has been in my beloved coffee. they still remember my families order, but sometimes its not as good as it was, and I view that more as a sign of how much they spoiled me before than anything else. Business is booming, and they couldn't keep up so they had to hire. It's normal that new people need to be trained, and that any amount of training will not equal years of experience.As other coffeehouses fight and cut corners in these tough times, it says a lot that The Coffee Shop is growing and healthy. Still, with that all said, this is my favorite coffeehouse in years, This is a perfect companion to Joes Farm Grill next door. (many reviews on Yelp and elsewhere) Together, they are reason for my Bride and I to want to move to the Agritopia subdivision they are a part of, just to be able to walk there in the morning, along the tree lined streets (rare around here in a work of cactus and ... dirt)Tucked away in Agritopia, The Coffee Shop can be hard to find. Maybe that's a good thing.I found The Coffee Shop because I like the restaurant next door -  Joe's Farm Grill. And when I found out it had free wifi, it quickly became my office away from home (of note, as appears to be typical everywhere else, there can be a shortage of electrical outlets at peak hours. Just club someone over the head and take theirs. A more sophisticated approach may be to hand them a five, tell them to go buy one of the DELIGHTFUL pastries and take their plug while they are at the counter).The coffee is great, the pastries are to die for and the patio / garden area makes you say, "Toto, we're not at Starbucks anymore".This place is a gem, and their pristine outside patio is perfect for morning lattes when there is a scent of chill in the air.The wife and I popped in based on an article she had seen.  I know the following statement has no business being in a business review, but the cashier had the bluest eyes I've ever seen, and it took everything in me to refrain from asking if they were real.The Lemon Whoopi was a great little cream-filled, sponge cake cookie.  But the real shining star was the Cinnamon Cupcake.  Amazing concentrations of cinnamon sugar were dispersed throughout the cupcake, delighting me bite after bite.  The frosting was creamy, with a little crust of sugar, adding to the consistency.  It was simply wonderful.I simply must try to recreate this award winning pastry.  So Joe, if you're reading this, we can do it the easy way, or the hard way.  You could bestow the recipe for this little treasure, and I could sign an NDA, and it would be our little secret.  OR... I could assemble the greatest axis of cupcake aficionados this side of... um, a place that would be notorious for cupcakes?  Then, after purchasing hundreds of these treats, and returning most of them to my team for careful analysis, could come up with the same recipe.The ball is in your court Joe, but be forewarned: I wont wait forever before soliciting my hench-women.PS: Applications now being accepted for cupcake hench-women.07/07/10Had coffee and some sweets here w/ a friend, and after much anticipation on trying the fare here, I was a bit disappointed w/ what I found :(  I decided I'd try a couple of scones and a berry coffee cake, and a cup o' joe.  I really enjoyed the coffee, but the pastries?  Not so much.  The coffee cake wasn't sweet enough, and I found it to be too greasy.  The scones, also a bit on the greasy side, were so flat, they looked like cookies!  Out of the two, I liked the butterscotch best.  However, I wouldn't order these again.  A few hours later, I decided I'd go back to write some reviews and have another cup of coffee.  I went back up to see if there were new additions to the display, but was turned off when I saw a couple of flies crawling over the cupcakes.  (((shudder)))  The clerk manning the counter followed my gaze and saw the flies, but didn't shoo them away.  Tsk, tsk.  Turned me off on trying anything new.I am a big fan of Joe's Farm Grill and The Liberty Market (a little less of Joe's Real BBQ, but I've only gone there once, so a return visit may change my mind), so I'd like to give their sister company The Coffee Shop another try.  The sandwich and salad menus look delicious, but most of the selections are off-limits to me.  But... flies in the sweets counter?  I don't know if I can stomach another visit :(It was a perfect day to sit outside in the patio enjoying the Bacon & BBQ sauce cupcake from the Food Network "Cupcake War" Challenge.  The thought of BBQ sauce on a cupcake doesn't sound very appealing, but surprisingly it wasn't too bad.  Joe's BBQ sauces are good by itself.  The cupcake was moist and with some unique flavors.  I just couldn't resist not trying it.   The view of the farm was gorgeous too.
Trader Vic's=I spent a lot of time thinking about reviewing this place. I held off for a lot of personal reasons. 1 I used to work here. But being unbiased...There are a few things I'm bitter about but it's mainly with the owner. Most of my friends refuse to deal with Trader Vic's because of me. But overall....If you're on the strip it's easy to get to. But if you park in PH Valet...Not so bad. If you park in Miracle Mile Parking...It's like a Lord of the Rings quest. Ya if you don't know your way around - you can walk in circles. When you get there, the hostess stand is in front and you can't tell if it's a restaurant. When you walk in, it's a little more posh than most other TVs. Apps: I like the coconut chicken. I hate the prices. I like the Kahlua pork sliders....but it's not Kahlua pork. It's like pork in a sweet sauce. The food is not cheap. Believe me for the quality and size of portions - it sucks. Lobster Potstickers YUM. Satay is ok - I mean I've had authentic - so when I taste this stuff, it's just ok.Main courses: My faves are usually the chef specials. They had Ribeye once which was great. All in Fried Rice was good. Not worth 20 bucks but it's not bad. It's hard to say. I haven't been there since February - so I don't remember the food....so its kinda forgetable?Breakfast is good if they still serve it. The waffles yum. The stuffed french toast is amazing....Drinks: I developed the Wasabi Mary. So of course YUM. I also developed the Coconut Raspberry chocolate Frappe. YUMMai Tai is good if made right. Originally they use Fresh Lime Juice - this place uses lemon concentrate for some reason. You have to order it from scratch otherwise they use a Mai Tai syrup for speed. Most of the other drinks. Taste the same all citrusy. The bowls eh can be worth it usually they have 6-8 ounces of liquor in it. But its better between two people otherwise there's no point to getting a buzz. So definitely one up on the view. But it's true - this place is boring. They run out of liquor a lot. It's not FUN like it used to be. Eh...View one star, some drinks half star, some staff, half star.
Sammy's L.A. Pastrami & Burgers=Good Burgers,Great HotDogs(Sabretts) and Piled High Pastrami!!I went here after a fellow tweeter recommended  it as the BEST burger OFF the Strip in Las Vegas.(RE:RT @Spcialt:--Best Off Strip burger is Sammy's Dog Shack!)It's a cute little shack in the Food4Less parking lot-they have a small outdoor patio area and a drive-thru so it's mostly take-out.We ordered a hot dog, a patty melt and an LA pastrami with an order of Garlic Romano fries and a Large Lemonade=$28!The service was great-fast & friendly-we sat outside and ate since it was a cool afternoon(rare in Las Vegas in August)The food was great, the portions were huge-The biggest PAstrami sandwich I have seen. THe hotdog was great and the patty melt was good too. NOT the BEST burger in Las VEgas but damn good.NEXT trip I'm trying the Ribeye Sandwich & a Fruit Smoothie!!WHERE: Located on Decatur & Flamingo (in the same plaza/area where food4less is at).WHEN: Monday-Wednesday, 10:30am-7pm. Thursday, 10:30am-9pm. Friday, 10am-10pm, Saturday-Sunday, 11am-8pm.Sammy's L.A. Pastrami is known for their pastrami sandwiches & burgers, which has been placed on hold on my "to-try" list! They also serve handmade lemonades, hotdogs, and fries!This small joint deserves way more credit than it gets!! One of my homegirls, @Jessica, recommended this place to me about a week ago. Since then, I've been TRYING to wait patiently until the day I finally get to test it out! This was it!It is a family-runned business and I got to speak with one of the family members (shout out to Brian!). First and foremost, the service was incredible! Brian was indeed USEFUL, FUNNY, & COOL!! He was extremely patient with my friend and I (since I was a newbie, I was asking a bunch of questions. Lol) So... be nice!! =)& TO THE FOOD: On this journey I got to try...-Pastrami dog: a beef dog with mustard, cheese, & pastrami on top! Absolutely unique & tasty!*There are more dogs @ the Decatur location if that's what you are craving =)*-Fried Zucchini & Mushrooms w/ranch: C'mon now, who has fried mushrooms?!! BOMB!! & this was also the first time I've tried fried zucchini, DOUBLE BOMB!-Garlic Romano fries: Extreme crisp perfection! The fries are also perfect size. There are small, medium, and large options (they are pretty generous servings, so you'll get your money's worth!)-Handmade Pomegranate Lemonade:  This definitely caught my attention!! =D While we were waiting for our food to be made, our drinks were given to us (AND REFILLS WERE INSISTED!- THAT DESERVES A 6TH STAR IN MY BOOK). Zestyyyy!The menu is beautiful, the descriptions will surely make your mouth water, and the food is definite REALITY! Enjoy!!What a shame as my first review was a well deserved 5 Star rating!Oh Sammy baby...what has happened to you?I had been bragging to my boyfriend who is a big fan of anything Pastrami so we finally had the time to stop by and get our grub on...eh hem I mean attempt to.We walk up and place our order for two LA style pastrami sandwiches, order of garlic fries and a large soda. He says $30 dollars as I am handing him my two for one coupon he says "ugh" then says OK $20 dollars. Yes I shit you not he actually groaned "UGH" after presenting him with their coupon.Anyhow, I have a bad feeling from the start. This guy is sweating buckets, he is blinded by the sweat in his eyes that he drops our cup on the dirty ground and picks it up and fills it. Wow! He hands us our drink and says 20 minutes. He did not bother washing his hands after just handling our money as he begins throwing stuff on the grill for the order that is before ours.This guy clearly did not want to be here working that is for sure!We go and stand on the side of the building where the door to the kitchen is open, bad mistake as my bf started to add up all of the health violations. I was embarrassed as my experience picking up food here previously was a world of difference. Where was the mature sweet couple who was smiles behind the counter at? The people that were so full of life and excited to explain and suggest menu items? They are a thing of the past I suppose? :(I swear we waited 10 minutes and still our order had not been started and at that point all I could think of was how bad this guy needs a shower and how I will throw up if I see him touch my food with his bare hands after seeing him break health code upon health code violation.The kitchen was disgusting and not once did we see this guy wash his hands. His behavior was odd as well, he clearly was angered at having to work it seemed as he was slamming stuff around in the kitchen. We waited...waited...waited....and then I was to the point of just flat out disgusted so I walked right up to him and said I would like my money back as we have decided not to dine here. He said "how much you give me"? I replied 20.00 he reached into his pocket and gave me 20.00 and that was that nothing else said. He actually seemed happy that he did not have to bother with making our order.The end...What a disappointment, not sure if they sold the business or what however I can tell you this is the beginning of the end for them if this keeps up!I will never be back in fact you could not pay me to come back to this hot mess of a once great operation!!!So sad...I have recently discovered that very yummy things come from tiny little buildings. The menu here at Sammy's L.A. Pastrami & Burgers offers a variety of options for such a small place. The outside is nothing pretty to look at but sometimes it is those places that surprise you. There is a small seating area near a walk up window if you want to enjoy your food outside. There are easy to read menus along the building of the drive-thru it is just hard deciding what to try from it. My man had to try the "L.A Style Pastrami". It was a BIG hit! It has pastrami, mustard and pickles on a sub style roll. They have 3 different sizes with the extra large being $12.99! I wouldn't recommend the extra large unless you plan to share with somebody or plan to have more then 1 meal out of it because he got the large at $9.69 and it was almost too much pastrami. Not that he complained or didn't finish every bite because he did! The guy at the window said the bad for you fried foods were all hand breaded and that they use fresh ingredients and I was craving something I could dip in ranch so I chose the "Variety Platter" at $7.99. I picked battered zucchini slices, fried mushrooms and fried mozzarella sticks. The zucchini was the best part! It really wasn't greasy and had great flavor. The fried mushrooms were good but I can't say I would order them again. The mozzarella sticks were perfect. The batter tasted good and the cheese wasn't rubbery like most places it was really stringy and super good. The ranch was thick and creamy. I really like this place and will be back regularly. There is plenty of options for burgers or chicken sandwiches. They also have a philly cheese steak that looks like it would be good. The menu says their shakes are made with "thrifty" ice cream. The "Garlic Romano Fries" are on my radar for next time.Plan to wait a while while your food is being made. It is being made fresh so it does take some time.When you come here be prepared to wait a bit for your food. It is well worth the wait. The food is prepared fresh and the dressings are made from scratch. They have a walk up window, a few seats outside and the drive thru. I used a $14 for $20 yelp deal and the guy took it with no problem. I ordered a hot link with pastrami, jalapenos, and extra mustard. It was freaking delicious. I also had garlic romano fries and split a pastrami melt with my wife. The fries live up to the name and everyone should order these. The pastrami had great flavor. The pastrami is really the star attraction here if you are going to try anything and it comes in different sizes. I asked for a side of ranch for the garlic fries and they were out so the guy suggested some other sauce. I said sure and it turned out to be a perfect pairing. It tasted like thousand island but with no pickles or relish it was just sauce and good! Everything was great and The yelp deal just made it better.7/5/2014  4:15 PM  Saw a Yelp review from Brandon (yesterday July 4th) & figured they were OPEN! They were OPEN alright.. The doors were WIDE open, no bug screens, lady on the phone was sweeping with a broom used on the interior of the establishment. Then sweeps the garage out the back door that was propped open. Uses the same broom on the concrete outside... NO HEALTH GRADE POSTED.  My boyfriend having worked in the food industry in the past takes one look at it & says, "if you feel like getting sick, SURE! Let's go".  I figured it was like the one on E. Tropicana... NO. The one on Tropicana makes this place look amazing.Now we get to the front and I'm still being optimistic.  She's still sweeping & sees us standing there patiently waiting.  She gets off the phone, I smile ask her how are you.  Just being my usual friendly self. She hands us a menu that's greasy... Gross.  Boyfriend takes one look at it & says, "Nothing looks appealing on this menu but I guess I'll try the wings".  She tells us there's no wings.. Okay then I'll just stick to my original order of Pastrami Chili Cheese fries (I've had them once at the other location, strangely delicious despite the weird idea).She tells me the total is $13 and some change for a large order of Pastrami Chili Cheese fries. I said that's fine, hand her my card. She never once asked for my ID when it's written on the back (instead of my name just in case it's ever stolen).  I usually hand them my ID if they need to compare signatures.Here's what breaks my optimism.  She opens the freezer, turns the cold water on the faucet, doesn't use the soap dispenser in reach. I guess to her she "washes" her hands in the cold water & grabs the paper towels to dry off.  I then with a disgusted look on my face, asked her, "do you have SOAP back there?", eyeing in the direction of the empty soap dispenser on the wall.  She turns to me and says, "EH? Soap? YEAH Yeah", then DIPS HER HANDS IN THE SECOND SINK WITH STANDING WATER.  "See I wash, there's soap".  My face went from disgusted to HORRIFIED, one of my biggest PHOBIAS is standing water. My stomach turned & flopped a few times as she continues to "wash" up.She asks me, "want me to cancel?", I replied "YES".  She hands my credit card back to me (I'm shocked I even got it back, I would of never known).  She tells me, "Okay, no charge". We walked back to the car & left.INSTEAD we went to Roberto's in Spring Valley. Cross streets Rainbow & Sunset.  We spent about the same amount as they were charging here.  MINUS all the health code violations & they had an A grade posted as we walked in.  DON'T GO HERE!!!!!!
The Steakhouse at Camelot=I'll just come right out & say it. Service sucked! Period. From the moment we sat down & weren't serviced, to the times we had empty glasses & weren't serviced, to the times we asked for bread & weren't serviced, to when we got the $300+ bill and it took them 10 or more minutes to pick it up. BUT, the food was great. So weigh it out, folks... Bad service but great food... Bad service but great food. Some (myself included) would say we expect both. In which case, look for fine dining elsewhere. It's Vegas, baby. There are plenty of other choices, just take your pick. ....and Good Luck ; )
Gluuteny Bakery=I end up at Gluuteny every single time I visit Squirrel Hill because I want to love this bakery, and now that I've tried almost all their offerings in the way of prepared goods I can safely say, "It's okay."  Their brownies ($2.50) are the best thing they make in my book: they're better than most "normal" brownies. So good they don't taste gluten-free? Hell yeah, I'll make that claim!The pumpkin and lemon loafs ($5) are addictive: I ate one small loaf in a day...by myself...and then I ate another one...don't judge me! The pumpkin tart ($2.50) is also really good.The muffins ($2) come in blueberry, orange cranberry and chocolate chip, and are on the spongy side but their flavor is spot on. The cookies ($2), however, aren't done right; the sugar cookies are slathered in what can only be described as a suspicious amount of frosting. The other varieties, like chocolate chip and walnut chocolate chip, are just too crunchy to be enjoyable. What can I say? I like soft cookies.If you're gluten-free this is a good place to stock up on pizza crust and pancake mixes, bread, muffins or any other pastry mix your heart desires; the lady in front of me bought fifty bucks worth of stuff!The girls behind the counter that rock some of the cutest haircuts in all of PGH are willing to answer any questions or explain that you need to cook the pizza at a higher temperature to get the crust the right texture. Plus, you can order birthday cakes.I have tested out a lot of Vegan and Gluten-free desserts over the last few years, and they can range from being terrible to great.  Gluuteny kind of falls right in the center quality wise for me, although they do fill a much needed void in Pittsburgh.  I came in here to test out some goods to decide if I should buy treats for my godmother here for the holidays.  I always taste test GF options before gifting because too often they are not good.First, the staff is very friendly.  I tried a sample of a garlic cheddar bagel while making my selection, and while the garlic was a bit overpowering, it was pretty good in the scheme of GF goods.  I decided to order a double chocolate cookie ($3.99).  The price was skewed a touch high, but the cookie was very large.  It could easily be dessert after two or three meals.  The actual cookie was lacking in flavor, though.  There was a slight after taste, and the texture didn't quite line up.  The cookie was clearly covered in sugar, and I wonder what exactly is going into these cookies.  Overall, it was OK, but I won't be purchasing any gifts here.  They do hit on my pet peeve of not marking prices, which is a real downer.  Also, it is unclear which options are vegan.  $8 card minimum.
Z's Greek=How did I only give Z's three stars the first time I was here?  This update is overdue as I have been here 2-3 times since my first review.They have been consistently delicious and fresh.  4 star all the way.  The atmosphere is ok, nothing special.  Free wifi is a bonus.  But the quality food makes up for it by far.Three stars?  What was going on?  I'm going to have to have a talk with myself and get back to you on that.  Three stars?  Seriously?I was a virgin until today... that is a Z's Greek virgin!  So was Christina P!We decided to try it for the first time together... and I think we were both pleasantly surprised.  I'm actually rounding up from a 3.5 rating since I'm in a good mood... but if you're in the mood for Greek, I recommend trying this place; especially if you don't care much about atmosphere.  The place itself feels a bit like a fast food restaurant.  It's a fast casual concept where you order at the counter and they bring your food to you.  They also check-in to make sure everything is ok; extremely friendly staff.We shared a hummus appetizer and I had a large Greek Salad with chicken.  Christina went for a falafel pita.  Their pita is fresh and moist and I ate more than my share of it... the hummus is good too but maybe missing a little something.  My salad was perfectly dressed and came with lots of chicken.  The chicken wasn't the best I've had but I'm extremely picky when it comes to chicken; i ate most of it anyways.  The prices are extremely reasonable.The reason I am rounding up my rating?  WiFi and drive through... yes, they have a working drive through and I can guarantee I will be taking advantage of that sometime soon!I will be back; nice to have another solid Greek restaurant in my 'hood!A welcome change from the boring assembly line of "kronos" style gyros.  Everything here has a fuller flavor than more other Greek restaurants.  A particular hats off to their pita. Four stars and a big Opa! to these guys.Best. Gyro. Ever. Yes, they have plenty of other items on the menu, but for me, their Gyro is the gold standard by which all others are measured. A typical visit to Z's with my FFY* consists of reviewing the menu, considering new things and then deciding to get what we always order. If it isn't broken, don't fix it!  My personal favorites are: Gyro - Z's is generously filled to nearly bursting with juicy and flavorful Grecian Delight. No Kronos here, like so many others serve. I like mine without the tomato and onion, so I can enjoy the cool lettuce and perfect amount of tatziki, embraced by a soft, warm, pillowy pita. I have yet to finish one, but have certainly enjoyed trying! Falafel appetizer - crisp on the outside and tender inside, these falafel are complimented by a side of hummus and warm pita. If you are really in the mood for a decadent and potentially heart-stopping treat, try the Z's Crazy Fries. These fries, topped with cheddar and Feta cheese, are fantastic when dipped in tatziki! While this family-run restaurant is not going to blow you away with its beauty or ambiance, you will keep coming back for the food and the friendly staff. Now if I can only convince them to move a bit closer to where I live... * FFY - Favorite Former Yelper
Shabu Shabu Paradise=I am always in search of good shabu shabu / fondue / hot pot places, and Shabu Shabu Paradise in Henderson delivers!Their menu is only shabu shabu, which can be a good thing and bad.  If your dining companions aren't into cooking their meal themselves, then this place won't work for them.  However, they can always stuff themselves on the appetizers like cod fish, salads, and beef misoyakiAll entrees come with a green salad, rice, selected veggies, tofu, noodles, and three dipping sauces.The Big F went for the King #18 ( 1/2 Beef,  1/2 Shrimp, and  1/2 Scallop) for $25 and I went for the Jack #1 (Original Beef) for $18.As the water, lightly seasoned with seaweed, heats up, a small green salad with yummy dressing starts you off.  Feel free to ask for more because they are more than happy to give it to you!Then your table gets set up with your rice, various raw veggies and food, and your three dipping sauce.  The first being a peanut sauce, then a ponzu one, and then a spicy ponzu-like one.The pot is split so you don't have to worry about your dining companion stealing your food! When the water starts to boil, start adding the food.  I don't recommend adding all the food at once, but rather a little bit at a time.  I like to swish my beef around just to cook it a tad before dipping it into the various sauces.The beef and shrimp were great choices, but the scallops got rubbery too quickly.  (Reading Steve X.'s review, I wish were given soy sauce and wasabi so we could have eaten the scallops raw as well.  Bummer!  At least we know for next time!)What makes Shabu Shabu Paradise a step up above Swish is that they also give you additional veggies without charging for it!  It seems a bit ridiculous to be charged for what is considered inexpensive veggies when you're cooking it yourself!  And to close it off, complimentary ice cream with fruit cocktail is offered!Service is great - the waitresses are really sweet and friendly about bringing you additional things as requested or when they see you need it.  It can get a bit hectic when the restaurant fills up as it started to on the Saturday evening we went.They have about three tables for four and one long table that seats about 10-12.  You'll definitely see us back here again when we're in the area! (Pics are posted!)I'm upping my stars to "five" because Shabu Shabu Paradise is just a great spot to eat at!They have since added "sukiyaki"-style as an alternative option to the seaweed broth for shabu shabu.  It's not the kind of sukiyaki where the plate is sizzling and the sauce is thick, rather it's the flavoring of the broth is now different.The Husband ordered the Queen Half Pork and Half Beef Dinner, (You can easily substitute the meats for each other, chicken for pork or beef, etc.)  while I had the Jack Scallop Dinner.  When my plate arrived, we were both very surprised with how much scallop came out.  Laid out ever so nicely, the quality grade is definitely sashimi-style.  (After reading about Steve X.'s experience, I was certain to ask for some wasabi and soy sauce so I could it raw.)As Calvin L. mentioned, the noodles given to you are tofu noodles and they are SO good!  We definitely requested more of that because it's  yummy and definitely not something you see often.Service is always exceptional.  Sometimes it can get a bit busy and you have to wait awhile longer, but the staff are so nice and friendly.  The wait can easily be overlooked.Overall, Shabu Shabu Paradise is a bit pricier when you first look at the menu.  But in the end, when you get unlimited salad, rice, veggies, tofu noodles, and free ice cream dessert (vanilla with green tea powder this time), it's well worth it!We're more than happy to eat there when we're in the area!* Check out their website because they have Monday night specials and daily specials too!We just love  this restaurant, even though there is another shabu-shabu restaurant closer to us.  The Wife usually orders the "shabu-shabu style"  seaweed based broth, while I always order the "sukiyaki style" soy sauce based broth.  Both are mild in flavor.  The broth is placed in a stainless steel bowl on top of an induction cooker in front of you.  They have also creatively crafted a bowl shaped in a yin and yang, so that two people can enjoy both broths at the same time.  What a great idea!You select the type of meat, poultry or seafood you desire.  I get either beef, pork or a mixture of both.  The Wife usually orders the raw sea scallops.  We found out that the scallops are sushi grade and not the tiny ones.  Forget cooking them in the broth, we just eat these neatly sliced and scrumptious raw scallops after dipping them straight into a mixture of soy sauce and wasabi.  Another great thing about this place, is that the vegetables are unlimited.  Also, the salad is so tasty.  It's has this awesome dressing that is mayo-based, tangy, and has a slight sweet finish.  I usually end up ordering at least 2-3 salads because of that damn dressing.  The main reason why I love this place is all about those tofu noodles.  This was where I had this type of noodle for the first time.  I always go insane and ask for heaps of it.  It's unlimited!!!  It's all about the texture of these noodles.  This noodle is perfect for shabu-shabu because no matter how long you leave it in the boiling hot broth, the noodle it's texture.  It does not get mushy.  It's so hard to describe its texture because it's slippery and soft but has a slight crunch to it.  It's like eating jellyfish in a jellyfish salad.  It's out of this world for my mouth!!!!  (i mean the noodles....hmmm maybe also the jellyfish salad, but i love both)  Because of the mild flavor of the broths, after cooking each piece meat, vegetable, and tofu noodles, you are able to flavorize them by dipping them in either a peanut based, a ponzu, or a spicy ponzu sauce.  I love the spicy ponzu sauce because it has a good amount of heat and is just so tangy.  I highly recommend this place.  The service has always been excellent and the flavors and quality of food has been so consistent for the number of times we have gone there.  I can't wait to go back there again!!!My first shabu experience!Thank you Misti and Bobby for taking me to Shabu Shabu Paradise on Sunday night when I arrived to Vegas...From the salad to the seconds and thirds of veggies, I really enjoyed the meal.  I went with Jack (Single Portion) #2 - Large Shrimp Shabu-Shabu ($20).  It was a lot of food, and so much fun to cook up myself.  I enjoyed the dipping sauces too.  The nice thing about this cuisine is that despite eating a lot, I didn't feel overly full.  The food is pretty light, which I love!I will have to return, however, as I just read on Wikipedia that "Once the meat and vegetables have been eaten, leftover broth from the pot is customarily combined with the remaining rice, and the resulting soup is usually eaten last." ---- I didn't know this!  I left all of the leftover broth instead of eating it like soup!We skipped dessert and opted instead to treat ourselves to foot massages.  What a fabulous night!The Skinny: great service, reasonable prices, and a great ponzu sauce has me coming back again and again despite the lengthy drive - 30 miles, yo! (4), service: efficient service where a glass is never empty without asking, a waitress always asks whether you want more... (4.5), value: lunch is a better value for your dollar but dinner is also quite reasonable (4).High marks goes to all the Yelpers who love this place. I've been dying to try out Shabu Shabu Paradise and my hubby indulged me after being away from Vegas for 6 agonizing weeks. Due to my late flight in (which I won't even get into because it was possibly the worst flight of my life - whole different story), my hubby called ahead to ensure that they would take us in. The lady informed him that as long as we got into the restaurant before 9:30 pm, it would be okay. Sweet!So we squeeked in 15 minutes before closing and were welcomed (genuinely) by the waitress. She never left a beverage unfilled and kept bringing us all the accompaniments we needed without asking for it. She was the most efficient waitress we've had in a long time.Portion sizes for the meat are Jack ($18; only one choice of protein), Queen ($18 for 2 choices of protein) and King ($23 for two choices of protein) and they serve finely sliced kurobata pork, organic chicken and high quality beef. Seafood (scallop, shrimp) are extra. Veggies plates are unlimited and include: green onion, sliced bamboo, carrot, napa cabbage, tofu (medium soft), and tofu noodles. Mushrooms are an extra $3 as a side or can be ordered as the vegetarian only option ($12) and the choices include shittake, enoki and maitaki varieties. Your meal will also include unlimited salad and a bowl of ice cream for dessert during dinner time.Shabu shabu here is the thing to order - a simple broth made with seaweed (kombu) served with the freshest vegetables you have and the best quality meat you can find. The ponzu is fantastic - the strong citrus flavouring of yuzu really comes through and tantalizes your tastebuds. So good! The sesame sauce adds a sweet richness to the cooked ingredients. Spicy ponzu has quite a kick - be forewarned!The sukiyaki is similar to the shabu shabu however the broth is derived from a sweet soy sauce. You eat the sukiyaki without any adornments.There are a couple reasons though, this restaurant does not get a full 5-stars.First, the waygu beef is sliced a little too thin for my tastes. When you have something as luxurious as waygu, it is best served in thicker slices for you to enjoy the melt-in-your-mouth-ness. When sliced so thin, it is hard to tell the difference between wagyu and regular beef due to it's tendency to be overcooked. (FYI - cook the meat only to pink if you ordered wagyu - otherwise the cow will haunt your dreams for such an egregious insult). Tip: try the wagyu during lunch time as it's more affordable in combination with the 20% lunch coupon.Secondly, the sukiyaki broth a little thin for my tastes - I really like a slightly thicker flavoured broth.  Finally, the dessert was rather poor considering the quality of the other parts of the meal: a scoop of ice cream with either chocolate sauce, green tea powder, or strawberry sauce then topped with canned fruit. To be honest, some small slices of fresh fruit would have been more preferable.Overall, the experience fulfilled my craving for an Asian soul food winter staple. Coupled with some really great lunch/dinner coupons, it cleared up the sniffles better than chicken soup and is good on the wallet! 4 star review.Shabu Shabu Paradise has been our favorite place for shabu shabu for quite awhile now.  We go there often, and we love that the waitress remembers specific details about how we like our food and condiments.  (Specifically, the evening waitress since we see her the most.)This year, I haven't been able to indulge in their raw scallops, so we've been ordering their beef only.  (Pretty soon though, I'll be back on the raw scallop diet!  Yes, you can eat their scallops raw - ask for some soy sauce and wasabi.)  Sometimes I'll pick the mushroom option for a little change though.They also have raw garlic paste which is nice to add to your ponzu sauce, be sure not to add it to your broth because it'll boil over and make a mess! We love their salad and dressing - no iceberg lettuce here!  And we love the free refills on that!We love their veggies and of course, can't get enough of their tofu noodles.  Yes, free refills on all of that too!Most recently, we did the whole split plate charge (courtesy of reading Bobby Y.'s review).  It says there on the menu that they'll charge you $6 for a split plate and here, it's so worth it!  We ordered one item from the Jack menu and paid the additional six.  This worked out well since I wasn't eating that much beef and the Husband could have it all to himself for the most part.  Meanwhile, I still get my fill on the salad, rice, veggies, tofu noodles, and dessert too!  Not a bad way to spend $6 in my opinion!And you can't help but love that they give coupons out every time you visit - it's hard getting there within the next 20 days though.  Their lunch prices can't be beat either - free beer or soda?! Wow!  (And as one friend pointed out, it's a real full glass of beer...not a tiny little one.)***3 STARS***Not to shabby for decent shabu shabu!I've had shabu shabu back to my home-home (SoCal) and although I may not be an expert, I do know that it isn't supposed to be THIS pricey! I was visiting my grandma and had bookmarked this place since it was only a couple blocks away from her neighborhood.[atmosphere]It may seem a bit dark inside due to the red walls and such, but the tables and environment is clean and well kept. It isn't quite as fancy nor hole-in-the-wall, it's somewhere in between mom-and-pop and neighborhood local spot.[devour]*Q-8 1/2 SHRIMP & 1/2 SCALLOP ($20, **3 STARS**) When you receive your order, you would think, "THAT'S IT?!?!?!" Lo and behold, your order also comes with unlimited veggies, 3 dipping sauces (sesame peanut, ponzu and spicy), and a bowl of white rice. After cooking your fresh shrimp and scallops in the seaweed broth (shabu shabu) alongside with the unlimited veggies, you're full and you didn't know it. If you wanted to add other additional stuff like ramen ($3) or shitake mushrooms ($2) or other items, it will cost an additional arm and a leg. I had always thought that stuff is a given and comes with your order..... I guess not!But was my dish worth $20? Probably not! I think it was worth $12-$14 at the most. And if you want prices like that, you would probably have to go here during their lunch hours. [imbibe]Green Tea was as expected - divine. Glad they didn't use fake stuff here! ($2)[service]Awesome! We were well taken care of by our lovely waitress. She was able to answer all the questions we had on the menu. She was very kind and considerate and couldn't have asked for more! (**4 STARS**)The flavors here were okay. I wouldn't say it was the best nor the worst. In addition, the prices were a bit steep for shabu shabu. I liked the fact that the food wasn't salty, but felt there needed some additional seasoning somewhere. If I were to come back here, I would try their sukiyaki instead of the shabu shabu. It may be a better choice. And if I were to also come back, it would be during lunch since the prices would be more reasonable.Yelp 2013 100 for 100 Challenge - Review #43Although this place is technically in Henderson and not Las Vegas-proper, I'm going to say it------ I think Vegas does beat SF in all forms of Japanese food. It was hard for me to find a quality Shabu place in Vegas that even matched what I was used to in the Bay Area, but Shabu Shabu Paraside has blown everything out of the water for me!This place isn't huge by any means, so reservations are a must. At first I thought we were lost, since we ended up at a strip mall where nothing else looked occupied. Luckily, the Best of Las Vegas sign confirmed we were in the right place. I never have been able to finish my plates of meat at any shabu shabu place, but I finished the Jack-sized portion here because it was simply delicious and mouth-watering. The veggies are fresh and AYCE. The one con I would say is mushrooms don't come with it, but they can be ordered as a side for $3 (and you get your choice of two different kinds). Their ponzu sauce has a very bright flavor, their sesame sauce tastes like the best aspects of Kare Kare sauce (Filipino dish with a peanut sauce base), and their spicy sauce was unfortunately too spicy for me, but I'm sure does the trick for those requiring that kick of heat. They have an array of ice cream options for dessert and they gave me a great idea of a dish to do at home - vanilla ice cream with matcha green tea powder on top. Service here never left us wanting, even when it got super busy. One server was juggling everyone effortlessly and never missed a beat. I will definitely be making the trip out to Henderson to enjoy this place again!.. Honestly, as soon as we left, I was already eager to go back.
Diablo's Cantina=When did the Wheel of Sin become the Wheel of Suck? Seriously, when I started going to Diablo's for happy hour the wheel had many awesome items for a mere $2...fast forward to 2011 and the items on the wheel are $5 and $7. Um, since when is a $7 shot of Patron considered a good happy hour deal? Or how about a $5 Pacifico? With all of the other awesome drink deals on the strip I am saying adios to the Wheel of Suck.Walking down Las Vegas Blvd on a sweltering summer afternoon, passing all of these more or less rock bottom priced beer and drink places, we made The Mistake of Massive Proportions and went into Diablo's. Why? It looked good from the outside. And it had those two magic words: Happy and Hour.We ordered two margaritas, chips and salsa. In Vegas. Where drinks are more or less free. The Diablo "margaritas" were more like watered down 99 Cents Store Lemon Lime sodas and the chips came with three tiny wasabi-sized bowls with non-spicy salty green sauces. The bill: $32! I asked, "Isn't this Happy Hour?" But my real question should have been, "Happy for who?" Oh, and the $32 included a $4 CHARGE for the chips and salsa!!! WTF!!! When was the last time you paid for chips and salsa? Uh... never! Moral: Don't judge a book by its cover. Especially when it's called Diablo's. Better you go sell your soul somewhere else.I came in for lunch with two girlfriends while staying at the Monte Carlo - we were starving and Diablo's looked pretty cool from the outside.  I ordered a shrimp salad which literally had exactly 3 shrimp sliced in half lengthwise then flipped over (cut side facing down) to appear to be 6 shrimp.  That, however,  is the least of my complaints.One of the girls ordered tacos and asked for Tapatio. You know, a bottle of Tapatio.  She received a side of 3 salsas.  When she pointed out that this wasn't what she wanted the waitress told her they didn't have any and walked away.... adding a $6 charge for the salsas she delivered.My other friend ordered a hamburger.  It didn't come with mayo so she asked for some.  The waitress brought a small side of mayo... adding a $3 charge to the bill.  (Notice a pattern here?)About halfway through the burger my friend wasn't looking so hot. She said it tasted funny.  In an instant there she goes running to the ladies room to vomit it back up...  She came back to the table  practically green.We reported this to our waitress who obviously didn't care at all or apologize - she simply rolled her eyes, took the burger away and dropped off the bill. After noticing that we had still been charged for the burger in addition to the $6 salsa charge and $3 mayo charge we asked to speak with a manager. The manager approached our table with attitude and before we could even tell him that the burger made me friend sick he said that he already knew and he "tasted her burger and it tasted fine to me - maybe she threw up because of alcohol."  I explained that we hadn't started drinking yet - it was only lunch time. When I brought up the charges for condiments. (Seriously?! THREE DOLLARS FOR MAYONNAISE?!) I told him "I've never been charged for condiments at a restau-" he interupted me and said, "Well, we do."  I told him they should at least tell people instead of just bringing it out then adding it to the bill.  He snipped back "Oh, well I guess you expect me to comp the whole bill then?"  I wasn't going to argue with that.  "Yes, that would be great.  Thank you."  We threw down some cash for the tip only and walked out. I'd give them a zero rating if I could. The food made one of us sick, they charge for everything to pad the bill, and the manager that I dealt with was a rude prick. I wouldn't go there again if they paid me.A seductive female devil sporting a two piece bikini, thigh high boots and a pitch fork surrounded by flames & palm trees got my attention.  While staying at the Monte Carlo on Las Vegas Blvd we thought we hit the jackpot having a Diablo's Cantina attached to the hotel.    The food was kick-ass, I will give them that.  The guacamole was creamy, packed with just the right amount of heat and was topped with diced tomatoes & a sprinkle of fresh sea salt.  We also ordered the chicken nachos, holy shit they were huge.   They had to have weighed at least 5 pounds.  Fresh crisp tortilla chips layered with melted cheese, shredded chicken and lines of sour cream.  Seated at the tables closest to the side walks enjoying the people watching we were spotted by a couple we knew and they joined us for some drinks.  They asked the server to bring us another round clearly saying that the round was on them.  The server not only charged them, but when we received our bill, we were also charged for the same drinks.  I explained to her that you already charged the couple who left for those drinks, and as good as they were I did not lose track of how many $7.50 margaritas I drank.  She then played dumb and sent over the manager.  The manager showed up running his mouth like he wanted to fight. Already having had several drinks & knowing how little the LVPD tolerates patrons beating up a manager of a bar no matter how rude and obnoxious he was, I simply smiled, stiffed the waitress on the tip & left.Until the incident with the blatant double charging of the drinks and the unnecessary attitude from the manager I thought the food, drinks & atmosphere were 5 stars!! Just a heads up to Diablo's staff, dumb clueless servers who hustles there customers with her pimp like manager's support gets you very few stars.The service is so horrendous it's laughable. The food is mediocre at best. Came in with a party of 7. The place was busy, but not insane. I ordered a skinny margarita. Not bad. After I got my drink I had decent expectations. Table got guac and chips. Not very good albeit expensive. My chicken quesadilla was greasy and tasted like canned chicken. My boyfriend got fish tacos, and they were a little better, but bland. Our server was basically non-existent. My friend had to ask three different ppl for a lemon for her water. The food runner brought her some, after a ridiculous wait for our food. We would have ordered more cocktails, however we didn't get the opportunity to. Don't even bother. This is Vegas. There are much better restaurants. My wallet hurts from the price gouge.Disclaimer: this is only for the bar area and drinksCame here during the early evening hours before our dinner reservations elsewhere. Seated at the bar we ordered beers and margaritas. Service didn't not disappoint and the drinks were great. The margaritas may be on the pricier side but you get what you pay for. Quality then you don't need quantity! We'd return for drinks next time we are in the area.We happened to be on the strip to try a different place of dining.  Every time we walked by it smells so good so why not try it.  We were greeted and seated immediately.  We had great service here with a friendly waitress and quick food delivery.  The dining area has much seating for the Vegas visitors with the bar located near the front.  There are plenty of tv screens around the entire place for a big game you just can't miss.  We decided to split the Combo Nachos which had steak, chicken and cheese.  We were actually going to order something else when we were informed how large the nachos were.  She was right.  This could be easily split between two or three people.  Just because it was a huge portion doesn't mean it's great.  They were very bland to me.  I tried adding hot sauce but their only hot sauce available was burn your stomach hot.  Pretty disappointed. If you need a drink you'll be safe ordering here but if it's food you are looking for, I'd keep searching.There are degrees of devilish creatures. There are some that are bad ass scary ones like Lucifer himself; and, there are some who are cute and not scary at all like Casper. Diablo's Cantina was neither or. In the world of devilish creatures, this Mexican restaurant is more like a creak in your wall that you brushed off thinking that it was nothing and wasn't paranormal activity. It's forgettable at best.We ventured out to find cheap food and ended up here. After all, how expensive could this be? Some tacos and a glass of pop and free chips and salsa? Yeah, we were dead wrong. The diablo has spoken and this must have been what selling your soul to the devil actually felt like because the diablo for sure robbed us.First off, chips and salsa weren't free. What kind of Mexican place is this? "El diablo." *shaking hands in the air* No devil would give you shit for free. Remember that.Well, one thing free is scantily clad waitresses. Luckily, they did have hot bods so it was okay to dress minimally like that. It went with the whole devil temptation thing and if you succumbed to it, you would probably get apple instead of taco and condemned to all eternity to jail.Our server was a dude and dressed complete with full length pants and shirt. WTF man. Where's my temptation? He acted smooth and flirty but nope. Unless he showed up wearing short short and midriff top, I ain't buying his act.I ordered quesadilla and pepsi. My coworker ordered tortilla soup and steak fajita. All tasted okay and edible. They weren't the best thing we ever ate but it was okay. No devilish punch or tickle or red trident stuck us in the gut. It was just okay. The check came. Mine was close to $30 with tip. My coworker's was over $40 with tip. Not okay. Diablo's Cantina.. You are truly evil for taking too much of our money and didn't give us chips and salsa. Hope you burn in hell!
Ay-Chung Noodle=I am a fan of Taiwanese food and this place was pretty good. They offer a number of authentic Taiwanese dishes ranging from porkchop rice, oyster pancakes, fried stinky tofu (not a fan of) and other dishes. I happened to order the fried fish with rice dish which came with preserved vegetables, rice, fish, a hard boiled egg and napa cabbage. Simple dish but delicious!I can say this is a pretty good spot for Taiwanese food and is pretty cheap.Attention! Attention! Here is my list:Appetizer:1. Stinky tofu2. Fried crispy chicken 3.

Cheeburger Cheeburger=Cheeburger, Cheeburger!It's a restaurant called Cheeburger, Cheeburger!!The little kid in me squealed with delight. Like pasghetti and sammiches, cheeburgers are one of those willfully mispronounced foodstuffs that bring back a little nostalgia. They remind me of those rare days when we'd all pile in my chain smoking babysitter's Caddy and cruise to McD's for cheeburgers, cheapo happy meal toys, and a romp in the pee covered ball pin. Urine, second hand smoke, and cheeburgers. I couldn't fathom a better combination at that age.Then again we didn't have Cheeburger, Cheeburgers when I was a kid. If we did I'd be eating my kid's meal out of a super sweet pink hot rod that looks almost identical to the Barbie mobile, sippin' my hand shaken soda and munchin' on a cheeburger, American, ketchup. I'm in my twenties but I still wanted one of those little card stock car boxes, even if my taste in toppings has become a bit more adventurous.Just because my tastebuds have matured doesn't make me any more decisive now than I was then. Not a good thing with a place that boasts 50 or so toppings for you burger (or chicken sandwich, or salad-- they're all based on the same "every order is a special order" model). I didn't even attempt to figure out what kind of fancy pants shake or soda flavor I wanted (100 flavors, people! 100!!) and just kept it simple with a glass of water in a mason jar. The fries vs. onion rings debate was also too heated, but a basket of crisp and delicious frings came to the rescue. The onion rings were thin and lightly battered, definitely the better of the two options, and the fries were fresh cut and uber greasy, just how I like 'em, even if they were under-salted.In the end I went with a Classic green chile cheddar burger with the traditional fixins (lettuce, tomato, onion, mayo, mustard, ketchup). It was cooked to a perfect medium and the price was right, ringing in at about 5 bucks. I agree that the top bun was way too big in comparison to the bottom, but I solved that by shaving half of it off so I could wrap my mouth around that thick slab of meat, because let's face it people, the bun is just filler. It's all about the meat. It was messy and juices were dripping all over my face, and I must have gone through at least four paper towels, but hot diggity damn, it was a great burger.The smallest burger possible (the Classic) is about five ounces or so and they increase incrementally until you reach the big mamba jamba 20 ounce 'nother nail in the coffin coronary on a bun. I can't even guess how many pieces of cheese it takes to cover that beast. I did however witness two people finish this outrageous burger while I was enjoying my dainty (by comparison) fare. Both gastric champions had their pictures taken with a gigando stuffed cheeburger (I would have worn it as a hat), and then had their image pasted on the wall of shame...err...fame.My inner child's parting words are: "Cheeburger! Cheeburger! Go eat cheeeeeburgerrrrrs!"My more mature counterpart: "Ahem, a myriad of combinations are possible between burgers, shakes and sides, variety enough to satisfy even the most discerning of palates and leave everyone...CHEEBURGER!!!"P.S. Fuck Red Robin in its bony little chicken wing. This place is miles ahead of that bland dump.
Sushi Twister=I wanted to eat Ramen today, but the Ramen world is just so complicated.  I can't go to Monta anymore because the tall Japanese girl who works there figured out who I am and she has been treating me real bad since I posted that bad review about the place. I can't go to Shuseki anymore because it turns out the psycho old man from Ichiza eats there every night, and he is still pissed off at me because a few months ago  I made a very unflattering impersonation of him. I don't want to go to Anime Ramen anymore because ever since Ryosuke went back to Japan, the service and food has been bad. I hope he comes back soon. So, I was just about to go to Yagyu for Ramen when I remembered that SUSHI TWISTER is owned by the same dude who owns RAMEN SORA. So in my head I was like: "Maybe Sushi Twister will have Miso Ramen since they are owned by the Sora people!". The very thought of me eating AYCE Sushi and Sapporo Style Ramen at the same time overstimulated my brain. I was very disappointed when I arrived at TWISTER to see no Ramen on the menu. But, after ordering two pieces of Nigiri and having a great conversation with the Japanese sushi chefs, my disappointment left instantly. This place actually has AYCE TORO! I have NEVER seen that before. But according to one of the workers, the AYCE TORO is like a random promotion. Some days when you show up they will have it, but most days they won't have it. So coming here for the AYCE TORO special is like gambling. The Tuna nigiri has the highest quality Tuna I have seen in years. It wasn't even Toro but it had that fatty marbling. The fish was so shinny that the light reflected off it like a shard of glass. The Tuna literally just instantly melts inside your mouth. The Eel Sauce with my Unagi was very strong. I don't know how they get the sauce to have that certain kind of deepness. I love places that make their own tempura sauce. Places that use that generic bottled stuff suck. SUSHI TWISTER has possibly the best Tempura sauce I have ever had. They got the best Sushi Rice on the face of the earth. It's seasoned perfectly! Many people don't have the sophistication to notice small details like that, but because I am so awesome I can.My personal favorite "Ichiro Mashita" roll is the Dead Dragon. You should try it! I also want to point out that this is the only AYCE Sushi place I have ever been to that puts wasabi in the nigri. Other AYCE Sushi places don't do this because they market their restaurant towards "westerners". I am actually really happy that I came here today. I had a very entertaining conversation with the a chef named Hiro. And all the workers were really great to me. When it comes to AYCE Sushi, Goyemon can't touch this place. Also, I rather come to small independent places like SUSHI TWISTER or SUSHI ON RAINBOW any day over one of Martin Kollefs multi-million dollar bankrolled hipster/douchebag sushi orgy places.UPDATE OCT- I've lowered the rating from 5 stars to 4 because one of the sushi chefs accused me of being "HOOTO". When I told him that I didn't know what that was, he began to describe the person. Eventually I figured out that he meant Hootie B.... I was like: Are you f*cking joking? Do I look like a middle aged man with a Korean wife? Apparently, he thought I was "Hooto" because I told him about how most people on Yelp want to kill me. Don't get me wrong. I am a big fan of Hooto reviews and his Sysco comments always have me rolling on the floor laughing, but how the hell do you confuse me as him?Ok, over the course of the last few months my love affair with Sushi Twister has intensified. Like any relationship, we have had our ups and down, but managed to beat the odds and continue our romance. The food is consistently delicious and the fish is fresh. Their rice to fish ratio still bothers me a bit, but I'll let it slide. There are times when the services is spotty (an older female server will leave you hanging for quite some time), but there are times when the service is pretty flawless. This weekend we had a young gentleman as our server as he was on top of his game. Their selection of nigiri is great and choices of baked and regular rolls vast. My favorites are Friday the 13th, Cowgirl, Oh My God, Ecstasy, and Rum Jungle. I also really enjoyed their baked mussels. I am two stamps away from a free AYCE meal...oooooh yeah!This review is mainly about their customer service. Dined here with some friends on a Friday night. Unfortunately for us they close at 11, so coming late in the evening we were left with an hour or so to eat. When we were seated our waitress seemed a little annoyed, which was just really upsetting. She stressed that the kitchen would be closing in 45 minutes and that she would just rather have us acye-ers place all of our orders at once. We did just that. She made frequent visits to the table and occasionally threw in comments such as, "Anything else? We all want to go home, you know."  No one at my table seemed to take offense, but I, however, found it very disrespectful. The restaurant was not yet closing so for her to just hate her life and take it out on poor, innocent customers was just rude.  It's unfortunate because the food was pretty good. I just can't get over the fact that our server had such a foul attitude the whole evening. It's like: Relax and smile a little. Everything's going to be OK. They have set such low standards for customer service that I can't bring myself to rate them more than three stars. Regardless of how good their food was. Meh. Sorry, not sorry.The night was young and the family was hungry. The family needed food fast. And I am not talking about plain restaurants, I was talking about delicious sushi chaos! So I knew the perfect place to tame the wild beasts of a family was the one and only, Sushi Twister!  It is also owned by Ramen Sora in Chinatown.The trip was a little farther than our home. It was on the other side of town and in a sketchy area. As we got there, we were disappointed and excited because of the long wait in line. It took 20 minutes! But once we got inside, the waitress brought our drinks in a jiffy. Now comes the sushiness you've been waiting for!So we started with a large order from the AYCE menu, the long wait had starved us. We got the usual rolls like caterpillar, dragon, and lots of salmon nigiri along with some of  their special rolls like the tiger yamazaki and the sushi-twister and ninja. The "salmon loves lemon" was slightly tart when eating with the slivers of lemon, but was oh so good! The crispy vacation roll was crunchy from the garlic flakes with a nice bit of spicy from the tuna.  The orders came so fast that we had to order MORE! We ordered the yellow mango with shrimp though the yellow mango was a bit overpowering. The baked scallop appetizer was a little too burnt on top and a bit oily for our taste. Baked mussels were also pleasing. The ordered chicken skewers brought us accidentally to another dish called the pork katsu with a tasteful sauce. All the rolls had good consistency.  The overall experience with the dishes were outstanding, just like the staff's fast and friendly service! The interior of the place was a tad bit tight, thus creating the long line. There was a projector screen which had the Sochi Olympics showing. It was a nice size for entertainment. The atmosphere was busy and the chef's were making those great rolls. The prices are comparable in town with kids 8 and under for half the adult prices.Overall the service and sushi overcame the long wait and trip so I gave them 5 stars. In the end we came home happy, stuffed, and satisfied!Before my Seattle trip, a friend and I had a sushi craving. The wonderful think about living in Las Vegas is having the option to go to AYCE (All you can eat) sushi joints. I've heard some really great things about this place from friends and neighbors. The best thing is that it's located right up the street from my house. This meal was a brainer. This joint is located on the southwest corner of a very busy strip mall. Walking into the restaurant, you'll notice that it's cozier inside than it looks outside. The joint has a few sushi bar top seating, a couple of high top tables and a few other table seating. Staying in place for a couple of hours, I've noticed that the servers do a good job turning out the tables so there's no wait. Speaking of our servers, they were very efficient. They always came by the table to see if we were alright and if we needed anything else. For the most part, good service. For my meal, I decided to get the All You Can Eat option for $26.95 per person. If you're going to have a few rolls, this would be the best option. Keep in mind though, this is one of  the only places I've noticed that holds everyone to the 1 hour limit. Whenever I go with the AYCE option, I tend to chow down on a lot of Nigiri sushi as it's usually a lot ala carte. On this visit, I went with the salmon, ahi and tako nigiri. The serving size was good and the fish was fresh! For other options, I went with chicken katsu, baked mussels, mochiko chicken, shrimp tempura and gyoza. All dishes were good. The katsu used white meat but had a nice crunch to it. For my gyoza, I asked for it steamed. It was flavored nicely and cooked nicely. Overall, the food is definitely worth returning to. The food came out fast, the service was nice and everything was super filling. If you're willing to eat in an hour and then leave, come down and check them out!Auntie Em, Auntie Em! It's a twister! It's a twister!!I've been hearing a lot of people say to me that Sushi Twister makes some of the best sushi in town. Well,not quite. But, Sushi Twister is making some good sushi over on the east side of Vegas. First, for those living on the east side near boulder highway and Trop, and around that area, this might be your only option for AYCE sushi. And, it's not really such a bad option.After walking in and sitting down at the bar, I was later told by the sushi chef that  Sushi Twister is owned by the same people that own Ramen Sora in Chinatown. I was expecting a lot, and I think that they delivered nicely.Ordered too much to analyse bit by bit, but will try to give an overall impression. I thought the fish and seafood quality was good, but not great. I also thought that the rice was a tad bit on the slightly sour side. I also thought that their signature sauce that they put on many of the apps and nigiri, sort of a yuzu-type soy sauce, was too sour as well. As for the apps, I really liked the chicken karage, it was crispy, well seasoned, and cooked very nicely.So, I like this spot, but it's a drive from me so i'll stick to my favoritos. But, for those that live in the area, this is a super solid option for those who don't wanna travel to Spring Mtn. Rd., but would still like some quality sushi.To me this is the best sushi place on the Eastside of las vegas.  More important when I have a sushi craving it's not far from where I live.  Upon entering, the employees are there to greet you and as you leave it's almost like they are greeting you again as weird as it sounds.  One thing I love about this location is that it's open until 11 pm.  It's definitely not fast food but It's made and cooked pretty quick.  I love going here at night because of the ambience and the atmosphere.  It's dark but not too dark and it's perfect for casual conversation.  I love the teriyaki chicken with salad.  Nice healthy meal  I've been during the all you can eat sushi and left stuffed.  Service is very fast even if it's busy.  I can honestly say I haven't nada bad experience there and love going when I can carve out the time.
La Piazza al Forno=A friend of mine has been recommending this place for some time. She is a big fan and is trying to  slowly sample everything on the menu. So today we decide to give it a try. Now I just wish it was a wee bit closer to our house.  You  walk in off Glendale Ave. and it's very comfortably decorated  with a clean Italian style. It reminded me of Pizza A Metro with more room , and decor.  There is a large brick oven in the front  that gives it an authentic flavor. All the servers were very nice and treated us like we have been going there forever. We ordered a  cheese pizza for my daughter and a "Italian stallion " pizza for us.  The crust was very nice chewy , with a light oven char that I really liked , a bit of tomato sauce , cheese and very different Italian sausage. Very tasty. My daughter loved her pizza , she was thrilled , I was afraid it would be too upscale for her. But she was so enamored she about bit my husband hand off when he reached for a piece. We are  anxious to try some of  the  other items , they brought a basil and cheese pizza by our table that smelled heavenly. we also saw some great pasta dishes at other tables.Well, at  first I thought  this might be a BUST,  and had it not been for the lovely gentleman Danny and his guest Lindsay with whom we sat next to , it would have been. We entered the pizza place because all the raves we had been hearing about the pizza, to our diappointment we where greeted by the hostess, with " we are out of Pizza", how the heck do run out of pizza, this we said to one another. So we asked for a menu and sat down at the closest table to see what we might like to try, the stuff crab shrimp as an appetizer looked fantastic the couple next us had just received, so we decided to try it and a ceasar salad with grilled chicken.   Not but 5 min after we order the waitress comes back to say " we are out of stuffed shrimp too!", Holy cow what kind of joint are you running. This is where it gets good, Danny- the gentleman next to us , offers of the last shrimp from their order and says" don't worry we ordered THREE pizzas- we will share them with you, just order something else to try" with that we ordered a meatball sub.  Thanks to Danny we had the cheese pizza- AMAZING,the vegitarean- ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS, and the white pie-YUM YUM, as for the ceasar it was a 3 out of 5, the dressing needs some work but the grilled chicken was really great, and the meatball sub was just average.  We will definately go back , the pizzas' are FANTASTIC8/11After visiting Cerreta's candy factory, I thought I'd knock another eatery off my list of places I've wanted to visit for many years.  La Piazza joins the ranks of Matt's Big Breakfast and Pizzeria Bianco as being the only places, that I can recall, where there was a wait to get in!  No, correct that, THIS is the only place I can recall, in the US, where I've been to that there was a crowd waiting to get in before store hours began.  Correction, again: La Piazza and Todai (in Schaumburg, IL) are the only two places I've visited, here in the US, that I can recall that had a line of people waiting to get in, in my last 20 years of life thus far.  I can't claim that I've lined up at Matt's or at Pizzeria Bianco before they opened for business...What a cute place!  Really liked the atmosphere here (wine cabinet, murals, brick walls, etc.), and the staff seemed to enjoy their jobs.  Well, most of them did, anyway...  But why don't we just get straight to the food?!  Hmm?I ordered the La Piazza Bianco http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-Dnh48f029YNugtMKkkI-Q?select=Oadu8QvsrHJU-4PMfLTjYw#Oadu8QvsrHJU-4PMfLTjYw, which is comprised of ricotta, fresh mozzarella and basil, garlic, and garlic butter sauce.  The cheeses looked so beautiful and exquisite (!), but the pizza came out charred in so many places.  Unfortunately, there wasn't a hint of crispiness to its crust ANYWHERE, and this is no exaggeration.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-Dnh48f029YNugtMKkkI-Q?select=fV3E74fisRXUvjU85CalOQ#fV3E74fisRXUvjU85CalOQ  The pizzaiolo's excuses for the lack of crispiness were that the fresh garlic sauce and homemade cheeses caused the crust to be more soggy than his other pizza varieties, and bec. the restaurant just opened, so that the brick oven was not hot enough.  His mother offered to have another pizza done, as she didn't want to see anyone dissatisfied.  I asked if perhaps rolling the crust a little thinner would be possible.  The second pizza was clearly much better... http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-Dnh48f029YNugtMKkkI-Q?select=sbGKg7yJwLmX4wlhWsEJRQ#sbGKg7yJwLmX4wlhWsEJRQ  Loved the thinner crust, and the crust's edges on this one were crispy!  (The butter garlic sauce caused the main areas to be soggy, but at least there were crispy areas.)   I wish I could've videotaped handling the slice of pizza of the first one... it folded without the slightest crunch or flakiness.  If you're a crispy thin-crust lover, I suggest you specify this before ordering from here.  While my beef was due to the sogginess of the pizza crust (I didn't even mention the burnt areas- I didn't think there was any need to!), the ingredients, however, were of high quality!  I was so disappointed that the matriarch took the remaining slices away- I only had about one and half slices' worth of toppings to enjoy :'(  Most places I've been to that offered to correct grievances left the original items on the table, gratis.  She did, however, offer complimentary dessert.  Their cheesecake is fantastic!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-Dnh48f029YNugtMKkkI-Q?select=dUlITiNdAY5kue075cevJQ#dUlITiNdAY5kue075cevJQ-Service has improved a lot since my last visit.-Greeted and thanked by Hostess.-Pizza is still outstanding (order the Italian Stallion, it's the best!)-Pizzas came out pretty quickly.-Some tables are too close, do I need to be touching elbows with the stranger at the next table?-Parking was convenient.Let me preface this by saying I have been in the service industry for the better part of 20 years. I understand how restaurants work as far as service, reservations, repeat customers, etc. I was so extremely disappointed in this place. Here's my story: While looking for a centrally-located place for the fam to dine, we came across this pizza parlor and remembered seeing it on TV. On their website it states they take reservations for parties of 6 or more so I called to make a reservation. The gentleman that answered the phone took our name and phone number and then proceeded to let us know the rules: 1. They won't seat you until your entire party is there (not really understandable since they pushed tables together and could have easily separated them should our party not all show up) 2. They only hold the table for 10 minutes (kind of understandable since so many people flake out on reservations, but 10 min is a little short, especially if there's traffic) and 3. We had 1.5 hours to eat because another party was coming in. He asked if #3 was an ok time-frame. I said it was up to his kitchen and how fast they can pump out the food - they did good.  He said there was only one table in the restaurant that could sit 6 or more.  However, when we arrived they were pushing tables together on the patio to accommodate a party of 6 and they had another large party just in side the patio and we sat in a different location, so not sure how he thought there was only 1 table for large parties.  Plus each table is a 2-top and can be combined with x number of other tables to accommodate - there was plenty of room inside the restaurant.So after hanging up I already felt like they didn't really want us there. Four of the six of us arrived a slight bit early.  We introduced ourselves as the reservation and they promptly corrected us by saying they don't make reservations, they just hold the table and our table would be given away at 6:10 if the entire party was not here. Right at 6pm we called the other two who informed us they were 3.6 miles away (according to their GPS) but they still wouldn't seat us. We explained they were only 7 min away, but they said it didn't matter and asked us to wait outside in 100 degree weather sweating our a$$e$ off. They never offered water or anything to drink. Just literally shuffled us out the door and proceeded to ignore us for the next ~7 minutes. Sign #2 they didn't really want us there. Since we were in 3 cars and not familiar with downtown Glendale, we decided to stick it out. The other two arrived and we were seated back by the bathrooms. Sign #3 they didn't really want us there. The restaurant was not packed, nor did it get packed while we were there so I'm not sure why they couldn't seat us or even let us wait inside in the air conditioning. The ONLY reason this place rec'd 2 stars rather than the 1/4 I would have preferred to give it is because of our server, Sandy. She was AMAZING! We wanted wine so she made some suggestions for both red and white. The table took her up on all that she suggested. She was polite, timely, funny, professional; she just rocked. She saved the dinner for all of us. Thank you Sandy! The food was fairly good. We ordered the fried ravioli (REALLY good) and bruschetta as apps. The salads came next (ok to split with someone - they are fairly good size). Definitely ask for the dressing on the side. We couldn't eat half of ours because it was absolutely drowning in dressing. The pizza was pretty good. Be careful of the pies that have garlic on them - they are large pieces of garlic so you definitely want to make sure your date likes garlic too. ;-) We won't be back nor would we recommend this place to friends. We will tell them our story and let them make up their own mind. And we will definitely have them call ahead to see if Sandy is working because she really did save the night.I admit I was hesitant to try La Piazza al Forno, since typically I try to avoid restaurants 'as seen on the Food Network'.  Well, in this case, a couple of visits for Saturday lunches proved that I was wrong - this is a small restaurant that creates big, wonderful flavor!  Over the course of two visits, we tried:Pizze Bianca ($12) - certified Neapolitan pizza - oh yes!  The thin yet chewy crust was graced with homemade mozzarella, extra virgin olive oil, ricotta cheese, basil and plenty of fresh garlic.  Four Cheese Ravioli ($9) - this is a simple yet completely fantastic dish - three cheese ravioli is baked, topped with a red cream sauce and mozzarella.  You will definitely want to use some bread to enjoy all of the remaining sauce from this dish!Panino ($7 + $1 additional for a slice of Proscuitto) - basically pizza crust-like bread with mozzarella, tomatoes and the additional proscuitto inside, served cold.  I was hoping for something more along the lines of the Schiacciata Romagnola served at Cibo.  While this was good, I wouldn't order it again.  Zeppolis ($4) - a very large portion of hot, puffy 'donut holes' sprinkled with powdered sugar.  No, there weren't any leftovers.  ;)So I really love the crust...really love the cheese...but this place needs to work on their customer service.The first time we visited they wouldn't seat two of us at a four top until our other friends arrived.  We would have spent more $$ on some drinks, but even though they were not busy they wouldn't seat us.The second time we had a better experience, but after moving tables to be father from the door (and cold air coming in b/c they wanted to leave it open) our original waitress who brought our drinks was upset and said..."well now I can't help you" because we were in a new area.The third time, though, is the ultimate in tacky service.  Our night was great with awesome pizza....half of us coming from the E Valley for a get-together with out-of-town relatives.  It was great...until after we paid the bill...  As we sat there visiting and enjoying our night, drinking the wine and pop we had paid for, our waitress comes up and asks us to leave.  She said that we were sitting at the only 4 top...and that a wait list was forming.  As we walked out and I think "Is this really happening?  Did I we just give her a 24% tip just to be asked to leave?" I see another totally empty 4 top and only 2 people waiting to be seated.Wow...for a place that claims to be straight from Italy, they should know that in Italy restaurant owners let their customers eat and talk and take as much time as you like.  I'd have to say that time number 3 was it for us...we'll go to Grimaldis, Pizzaria Bianco, or Spinatos the next time we want pizza.Long term friends of mine saw this place on DDD and had been wanting to try it the next time they were in Phoenix without a family obligation. Well that opportunity happened when I was going in town and Saturday was the only day they had off.My friends drove down from Camp Verde, picked me up from my Grandma's in Sun City and we embarked on Downtown Glendale. I hadn't been to this part of Glendale since I was still living in Phoenix almost 10 years ago now. It was crowded in the whole area when we arrived and at first I thought maybe it was the Farmer's Market, but then realized this was early February and this meant we were stuck in the Chocolate Fair crowd (also meaning not the best time to go to a place for lunch that had been on TV). Since I was technically on "vacation", waiting to eat at a place my friends were so excited about meant I could relax, but what was irritating is that the "hostess" advised to all who put their name down to stay within the direct vicinity of the restaurant as the entire party had to be together. It was a cold and windy afternoon and there was no waiting allowed inside. I did a quick peruse of the surrounding businesses and it seemed as if very few if any had changed. There are still a ton of antique stores, Haus (whatever the German restaurant that was also featured on DDD and other restaurants. It was actually nice to see the old timey feel was still in the neighborhood. After about a good 35 minute wait, we were shown in to our table. The restaurant itself is small and it seemed as if the menu and service was going to be impressive. We all decided to try a couple of salads and a couple of pizzas. They chose one of each as did I. My girlfriend had a glass of Reisling and her husband had his 3rd choice of beer (they were out of the first two choices). I had icd tea and after asking twice for "fake sugar", pulled out my own Grandma stash. It wasn't until someone other than our server came around to refill my tea that Splenda was brought. Long time ago, I was a waitress so this alone tends to piss me off -hence mark off for customer service. The salads ordered were the spinach and caprese. The spinach salad was pretty good but should have been tossed. The caprese was sad. Really really sad. We all know that February is not tomato season, but under ripe beefsteak tomatoes cannot be saved even with house made mozzerrella. For a "foodie" restaurant, this should not have been on the menu at all given the season. The pizza's ordered were the Bianca and the Italian Stallion. I have been to Italy. I have had pizza in numerous places with ovens like these and though it was good, I was not blown away (sadly either were my friends). The Bianca was very mild in flavor and benefited from a splash of balsamic. The outer crust was good but the rest of the pizza was soggy on both-either because it needed to cook a bit longer or because something topping wise was too wet. Our server was friendly taking our order but we never saw her again until the end when she asked if we wanted dessert. I loved spending time with my friends, wished the food was a bit more exciting and super happy that little old Downtown Glendale is popping!Oh man I had such high hopes for this place. Well lets just get into it. When wegot there we waited about 2 minutes before being acknowledged then after finally being greeted we were shown to a table that was 2 seats and very close to another table with people. So I asked if there was anyway to move us to another table in which I pointed too. Only to be told "oh umm if I sit you over there and a party of 3 or 4 come we will have to move you". Being so perplexed by this answer my wife and I sat and stared at each other for a moment.  Then still wanting to give the restaurant a chance we ordered. We got stuffed shrimp and a Bianca pizza. Well the stuffed shrimp was fine I wouldn't order it twice. The pizza was also very bland and just not what we expected. Feeling a little dissatisfied with the whole experience we just left after that.I never thought it would happen. Guy Fieri betrayed my love and did me wrong. My heart is heavy. **cue woeful harminica**Hubby, daughter and I embarked upon Piazza al Forno after watching triple D and seeing the menu online. We got there and were seated next to a large group that was incredibly loud. So not the restaurant's fault they were obnoxious. But, the waitress would talk to us in her "inside voice" which made her sound like Charlie Brown's teacher. Project, woman. Project!The service was just so lacking. If you are clairvoyant, this is a good place for you. Those of us less gifted need not attend. She asked us if we were ready to order several times and saw we were clearly struggling to decide. Never offered menu info or a run down of specials. She didn't even offer a wine list! This week has sucked, so imagine my horror upon thinking this place was dry as no one ever alluded we could have a glass of wine or presented a list! Mama needed some wine. Help a sister out. Our food came and we got the fried ravioli, baked spaghetti and the Italian Stallion. Nothing was even remotely worth writing home about. The baked spaghetti gave me the sense that they made a whole mess of spaghetti early in the day and threw it in the overn to heat it up when needed. Viola! Baked spaghetti!When we appeared done she just brought us our check. Apparently, my brain waves caught on with their psychic vibe and told her we wanted to get out of dodge.  She never even asked us about dessert or brought back a menu. So, we went to Gelato Spot and I had triamisu flavored gelato. Done. Wanted to love this place but it was so lackluster. So many places in the valley are better.What is better than having pizza for lunch?  Following it up with pizza for dinner!  I had this placed bookmarked and decided to try it out on the way home from work.  It's located in downtown historic Glendale which looked pretty cool.  I found parking around the corner on a side street and walked half a block to the restaurant.  I walked in, was seated, and placed my order.  I went with the Margherita D.O.C and a Diet Coke.  Here is how it was...................Margherita D.O.C ($10.00) -  This is simple and straight to the point.  San Marzano Tomatoes, Olive Oil, House Made Mozzarella and some Fresh Basil.  So simple yet so delicious.  The pizza was perfect!  The tomatoes, fresh mozz and basil did wonders to my mouth.  The crust was nice and salty and chewy with a nice char on it.  It was foldable and everything held together well.  This is one of the times where I was damn close to ordering another pizza.  It was phenomenal and one of, if not the best Neapolitan pizzas I have ever had.  It was a pretty large "personal" pizza too and the price was right!Diet Coke ($2.50)-  They serve Mexican Coke products here.  They bring you a bottle and a glass with ice.  It was refreshing.  No refills though since its sold by the bottle.Service was fantastic!  The hostess, waitress and even owner? came by and asked how everything was.  It was pretty much a perfect meal!  I will be back in the near future!  Now that I think about it, I definitely should have ordered another one..........my mouth is watering just thinking about how great it was!  Fantastic pizza!
Gordon Biersch=Can somebody please give me a tongue scraper??? Quick! The taste (or lack thereof) of the crappy $9 bloody mary is piercing my tongue! One of the things that irks me the most, is when you go to a restaurant, spend ten dollars on a "signature" cocktail and it tastes like garbage. In this case it tasted like water tomato juice, with a sprinkle of pepper. And a massive celery stick that engulfed the glass. So you say, you should drink beer when you go to these places. You're right! But then don't put crappy drinks on the menu, just to fill up space. All in all, we are in Scottsdale after all...there are a million places to go that have more to offer.. I left after the drink. You got me at "hello?" No, not so much.
Cafe Rio=Cafe Rio, WTF happened to you??? You were one of my favorite places to eat. Now, I must resort to someplace else. On our last visit, I decided to just get a chicken tostada because my usual chicken salad would have been too much food. Plus I wanted the crunchy tostada shell. So here's where it gets bad. I order the shredded chicken on the side because I didn't want the juices making my tostada shell soggy. As the girl proceeded to put the chicken in a separate cup, she made a comment about how she hates when people get the meat on the side. The guy next to her then made a comment about how he agreed. Um, I'M STANDING RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU IDIOTS,  I CAN HEAR YOU!!! Then as the guy puts the lettuce on my food, he doesn't let the water drip from the lettuce. So all this water ends up making my tortilla shell soggy. Just what I didn't want. Then to top it off, as I'm eating my food, the chicken is way overcooked and super mushy. And there's a puddle of water at the bottom of my plate. See picture. I've noticed over my last few visits to this location that the employees don't seem to give a crap about the food they serve. They're just there for a paycheck. No care or quality. I love their food, especially the tortillas. But now, I might have to drive to a further location if I want my fix.
Go Raw Cafe=The makers of Rawmakery foods. I don't recommend their pre-packaged stuff. If you're raw (I was for a time), they use Braggs Amino Acids in their crackers, which is not raw and contains soy. Also, their crackers have a distinctively rancid taste and smell, as the fats in the seeds and nuts used in their products go bad quickly. Aside from their pre-made stuff, this is one of the few places in the LV that offers raw essentials: raw coconut oil, nut butters, raw olives, dehydrated fruit, etc. The restaurant fare is good, but I wasn't feeling the overpriced mock-entrees; I recommend the salads instead. The organic house salad with cilantro dressing is fantastic, and their dehydrated toasts are very good. Juices, smoothies, and the self-serve salad bar are all fresh, organic, vegan, and simple. Service is above average. Overall, a great organic vegan lunch spot for when you're in the mood to eat something living.I had Go Raw on my to do list for  years but never got around to it until recently. Let me start with the good the female  working the counter was very friendly and welcoming after I told her it was my first visit. She suggested juice ( Green Zing- granny smith apples, lemon, ginger) based off my bitter/tart palate I described to her. I ordered the green zing and the gimme the beet 'cheese" burger with a house salad. The juice was made rather quickly.  I was really looking forward to it. Tasted like motor oil and was "luke cold" pretty disappointing start to my first experience but no biggie. The beet burger came out and I really enjoy veggie burgers especially house made.  The "living bread"  it came on had the thickness and consistency of beef jerky but tasted like tree bark. The beet burger itself was only slight less disgusting.  I  came into raw very hungry so for me to say it was terrible is mostly shocking to myself. The house salad was the best part as it was mixed greens kale and a flax seed oil garlic dressing that was just OK and that's rounding up a bit. The salad was by far the best part of  and otherwise awful meal.  I ate the entire  meals as I was hungry. After eating I was literately turned off by the thought of more food even if I went  next door to get a slice of pizza. They do not refrigerate or cool  or heat items to keep with the "raw" theme. That didn't seem like a big deal to me but only added to the awful tasting tree bark flavored meal I just ate. I like the concept of "raw" and natural yet they put to go items in plastic bags, plastic cups that are not made of corn or anything sustainable or green.  They have bottled juices and vitamins in a refrigerator as you walk in but then everything tastes "luke cold" as if nothing is refrigerated that you order.I wouldn't wish Go Raw on my worst enemy. If anyone wants a free  get juiced card with a stamp on it, it's all yours.   Skip it  and thank  me for saving your taste buds later.I am a big fan of Go Raw Cafe, BUT this particular location on Windmill I do not enjoy going to and that is because of the service. I do not like to mention names but this lady never makes me feel welcomed there.  I always feel I am bothering her by asking her a question about something or even if I do not ask a question and I am just ordering. The last two times I have been there it has been pretty bad and I swore to myself I will not go back for a few weeks. I like to eat at a place where the staff is happy I am there.  What I do love about this location is the salad bar.  They always have amazing stir fried veggies and brown rice.  I get a scoop every time!  Its pretty pricey here so expect to pay over $10 for anything you order.You have got to love this place. It's the only cafe thats truly raw and organic on the eastside. They also have another location on the westside by the lakes. I buy all my supplements here and super foods such as the most amazing goji berries and other Go Raw products. The green zing is my favorite juice and I usually ask that they take out the apples for my personal preference. If you love smoothies get the superfood smoothie in a bowl with granola. To die for. I would get it every time I went.  They soak their nuts (for optimal digestion) so it's truly made with care. Such a treat. Oh and if your really looking to indulge I recommend the cookies and cream which is coconut and cacao blended. Yumm. In regards to the raw wraps my favorite is the portobello mushroom wrap. Spot on. If your looking to elevate your health and gain energy, Go Raw is the way to go and you can learn so much from this place. They also have a huge book collection including recipe books, books focused on certain ailments and other cool topics. I probably bought most of the books from there. Good luck on your health journey and I hope you love this place as much as I do !!!disclaimer to start: I have been to quite a few raw/live restaurants. (wooohoo!) And DEF a ton of vegan ones. As that is my lifestyle. Not to mention the fact that as a part of my business, people pay me to create healthy recipes. Not only for people personally, but cookbooks, blogs, etc...including raw.   I have  even taught people how they can prepare delicious raw & vegan food at home in a class format.On that note:We were excited to check this place out and taste another fun take on raw amazingness.  And sadly, from the moment the cashier opened her mouth the tone was set, it seemed. She was flippant & rude... especially when we asked to get almond "cheese" on 1 side of the "pizza".  The man and I both wanted to try and I am not a fan of nut cheeses. (or fake cheeses in general... or fake meat. For me... it freaks me out that something is not being what it truly is. I could prob say that's how I feel about fake people too! haha!)  That brings me perfectly into my biggest point...Technically "raw" is anything under 119 degrees... SO, you could potentially  have warmed items that still maintain the delicious nutrients that all raw food offers. AND--- our fav places in LA do this.  For example... the biscuits and gravy do not come out ice cold. Same as their pizza. The pizza was ice cold. And apparently every thing they serve is that temp. Or room temp. That really turned me off. I really don't know any time I would say... ohhh, I am totally craving a cold enchilada. I spoke with what seemed to be the owner to ask a few questions and of course... he was offended and will prob reply to this post. But alas... I am hoping it causes him to re-evaluate the temp? the service? As I know it is probably super easy to not have any worry regarding temperature.  The Buckwheat bread it came on was great! BUT--- we could've driven to whole foods and bought the same bread ourselves and assembled our cold dish at home. (especially with the price point so high)The menu also said it came with "walnut sausage". Throwing small pieces of walnut on a cold piece of bread does not a sausage make. Another one of our fav places at home has an incredible walnut sausage... that is a delectable mix and packed with flavor... not just the walnut.Which brings me to ANOTHER item on the menu they call "fries".... we were like... cool! Let's see the fun spin on "fries" done raw. Come to find out these are merely avocado slices. Just. Avocado. I LOVE avocado. If you say it's avocado. But don't tell me it's fries.SO---  in a nutshell---the flavors were actually quite good. BUT--- I could buy at the store and assemble at home. (was hoping they built more ingredients in house, especially with the price) Don't tell me things are NOT what they actually are. "walnut sausage pizza" is not cold store-bought bread with nuts on top. Fries are NOT avocado. And please make a disclaimer somewhere.... ANY where on the menu that says all of our food is served cold or at room temperature. (I know its a RAW place... but I know RAW... and it doesn't have to always be cold or room temp.)  then, we would know what to expect and probably really truly enjoy our experience. Also--- a little kindness and maybe a crack of a smile goes a real long way.I'm not fully Vegan or Vegetarian, I still eat meat around once a week but I'm slowly getting there! I was looking for a new place to try that would help boost my studying so I was looking for someplace that had a lot of fresh and healthy options and I came across Go Raw Cafe on Yelp! Located on Windmill and Eastern in the shopping center with the Smith's located right next to Tups. Walking in, on the right you see a ton of books and supplements about raw eating, vegan eating, etc., on the ceiling were a bunch of hanging plants and near the back there's a salad bar. There was only 2 tables sat with 2 people at each table when we went and there was no one at the counter. Since it was the first time I'd been there, I didn't know whether to just sit down or go to the counter so I went to the counter since I saw a handful of paper menus. I grabbed one and started looking through it, I wanted to walk to the salad bar to see what they offered but I didn't since I felt a bit awkward not really knowing how to order so I eyed the Salmon Roll: Mock salmon, mustard, alfalfa sprouts, tomato, avocado, enoki mushrooms, yam "rice", garlic, & ginger as something I wanted to try but there was no one at the counter so I started looking around. Finally one of the ladies sitting at a table talking to a guy gets up and goes to stand behind the counter and just stares at me. No hi, nothing! Not even a smile! So I said "Uh I'll try the Salmon Roll" and she says "Sold out" Okay uhmmmm..."the Veggie Roll?" and she replies "No, out of Seaweed" Dang okay...then I start looking at the menu again and I hear her let out a heavy breathe. Wow! How Rude! Then I saw the "Salmon" Cakes w/ "Fries" & Veggies $15: "tartar sauce" accompanied by garlic flat "bread", House Veggies, & your choice of avocado "fries", or jicama "fries". and my boyfriend orders the Blood Transfusion $8.50: 2 oz. Wheatgrass & Coconut Water. She rings it up, we pay and then she walks back to sit with the guy she was talking to so we sat down. My boyfriend told me he was planning to get something to eat also but didn't want to deal with the rude lady. By that time we kind of already lost our appetite. Trying the food, the veggies were very good, nice and fresh and I also liked the avocado fries. I never received the garlic flatbread and as for the Mock Salmon, it was extremely sour and kind of smelled a bit rank. I finished the veggies and avocado but left most of the mock salmon. My boyfriend's drink was really good but I mean it really was just coconut water and wheatgrass, you can't really mess that up. Overall, I would want to come back to try different items on their menu but the really bad service just kind of turned me away from this place for a while.
Marketplace Café=I was a little embarrassed to admit to my co-workers that I REALLY wanted to eat lunch at Nordstrom Cafe! To my surprise they were equally as delighted and it was a nicer alternative to the hum drum food court experience. The cafe is located on the third floor of Nordstrom's right next to the young women's clothing department. I adore Nordstrom Cafe in my hometown of Honolulu and was very happy to see that the quality was right on par. I always order the angel hair pasta with spicy shrimp and it was EXACTLY what I expected. I always request that there be no spice added and they were more than happy to accomodate! Move over McDonald's because Nordie's has got the duplication process down to another level! (Photo: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cafe-nordstrom-scottsdale?select=8KOO0n8EuWaUWGK_Ha4Z3g#8KOO0n8EuWaUWGK_Ha4Z3g)Although the restaurant was smaller than I expected, service was wonderful, food was delicious and the only thing which went wrong was they got my friend's order mixed-up. But of course in true Nordstrom Cafe fashion, they apologized profusely and fixed it right away. You are my cafeteria style home away from home Nordstrom Cafe!!!31 Yelps Challenge: #10/31I love having a late lunch after a successful shopping day. I prefer to come here over the food court since it is so much more relaxing.  The service is so attentive and I can enjoy my meal and rest my tired feet for a bit.  I usually order the Cilantro Lime Chicken, light on the dressing or the Grilled shrimp and arugula salad with sweet corn.  I guess I like all my meals with a little sweetness on them. Today I felt like a grilled cheese and tomato soup. I was splurging since I have lost some weight. They don't offer that choice for adults, but how awesome are they. The let me have the kids meal, with the beverage and the side of fruit. I was in heaven.I can honestly say that there's nothing better than shopping and having a small bite to eat at the Nordstrom Cafe/Bistro. It's pretty much tradition that Stine H. and I would grab cups of soup and buttered noodles to share whenever strolling through Nordy's so this place brings back many nostalgic memories.I love the Tomato Bisque and the French Onion soups and the little toast served on the side is crisp and perfect for dunking. This time around I wanted something a little heavier, the Spicy Shrimp Angel Hair Pasta is perfect and you can even half the serving to share. The pasta was perfectly cooked, topped with tangy marinara and big pieces of shrimp! The food is way better than anything you could get in the food court- for obvious reasons. It's just simply delicious.The atmosphere is pretty quiet, the view and natural light makes it comfortable for eating and the service here is great. From our cashier to our server, they do their best to make your time spent in the cafe as pleasant as possible. I always tip and the little mint chocolates that come with the bill is always a great touch.
Hachi=38 for under $8 is the way to go! i brought my mom here for a nice dinner and we ordered: tea, veggie fried rice, LSD roll, crab salad, chicken dumplings, edamame, veggie tempura, and beef skewers for $57. the servings are very generous and not what you would expect for a classy place like this one. if you are used to dropping a grip for the atmosphere and presentation, you will get more bang for ya buck here. troy was our server and was supa sweet! great personality, attentive, informative, and a comedian. actually, come to think about it, everyone was really great. =) i am definitely looking forward to heading back for some mo' LSD roll, that shiz is good!This is a beautiful restaurant located inside of Red Rock Casino. We arrived late and actually were the last ones to leave the restaurant, but never felt rushed by any of the staff. Everyone from the hostess to our server was very attentive and friendly. I had Miso soup and we shared three rolls: Q, EE and Hachi... I found them to be extremely delicious. The fish was fresh and the rolls very well put together. The prices range from $11-18 per roll from what I recall. No AYCE here! They have few specialty cocktails and several beer choices..oh yeah, and a huge sake list!I loved it here 2+ years ago when Iived nearby (pre-Yelping), and I still love it.  While the menu has been redone and missing some of my old favs, the new menu had some interesting new items, and thus, I now have a few new favorites.  The decor and lighting are really gorgeous, romantic and colorful.Amazing:------------1A.  Salmon Carpaccio (absolutely amazing; wafer thin gives it a super soft and tender texture), with sesame oil, ponzu, and sesame seeds.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4ugJ4F8jDJ9-2dEiZ47wLg?select=J0FFzxNuH4TF0jexP2tY3w#J0FFzxNuH4TF0jexP2tY3w2A.

Yellowtail Jalapeno (great flavor in ponzu and fresh cilantro, not too spicy, and fresh fresh yellowtail) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4ugJ4F8jDJ9-2dEiZ47wLg?select=J0FFzxNuH4TF0jexP2tY3w#A6RULrkYC9QaU7vKrZracgThe Norm/expected:--------------------------1N.  Spicy Tuna on crispy ricecake (great presentation, tobiko, avocado, chili; ricecake was too crispy, and while tasty, I've had it better many times elsewhere)  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4ugJ4F8jDJ9-2dEiZ47wLg?select=J0FFzxNuH4TF0jexP2tY3w#lsZKgmNnGTA6yz0y6oo0xQ2N.  Shishito peppers (in a miso sauce, all mild)Meh:-------1M. Albacore Sashimi (with Crispy Onions in a CItrus Ponzu sauce; great presentation, but its more complex than it needs to be, and it hides the tuna...that's my goal for sashimi, hello!)  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4ugJ4F8jDJ9-2dEiZ47wLg?select=J0FFzxNuH4TF0jexP2tY3w#KGCR_WyqmS6CdQvpjsSGwQ2M.  Saki - Nigori Genshu (Murai Family).  I wanted a cold, unfiltered saki, and received a thick-as-a-milkshake one, that's sweet.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4ugJ4F8jDJ9-2dEiZ47wLg?select=J0FFzxNuH4TF0jexP2tY3w#vRFiQLLbInhEkYdlAhr5wgService:----------Everyone was super nice, BUT, everyone I spoke to was newly hired (all less than 3 months).  Beside the manager (who was super and recommended the White Lotus Roll), the server and the assistant were very young and unseasoned, and I don't believe fit Hachi and it's lovely appearance and price-point. Plus, no Bernie, the girl with the dragon tattoo (see my earlier review, posted 11/3/2011).Summary:------------Food is still a 5.0, prices are fair, and I love the decor, but the service dropped it one star.Lounge Review:Sometime after my third lap around the tables, this place finally caught my eye.Looking to satisfy my craving for whiskey, I was really hoping to find some nicely aged Yamazaki but secretly hoped for Hibiki.I reluctantly had to settle for Black Label neat and decided to wash it down with a side order of tempura.Tempura was crisp, light and delicious.They served an avocado tempura that was a rather half-assed attempt to try something different or a stroke of genius; considering how good it was, I'm thinking it was the later.
Winchell's Pub & Grill=First of all, this is not the donut house.  That's what I was thinking when the homegirl chose Winchell's for lunch.  Come to think of it, she's always choosing a pub for lunch. Pros:-Cheap eats.  Food here is priced pretty good.  Example:  8 oz filet for $21.99.  Ton's of daily specials and lunch specials. -Wide selection for a bar, grill, and pub-Taste:  I say you get what you pay for.  Nothing taste really bad, but not excellent.  Again, it's cheap.  -Dining room seating or bar seating-Video Poker if that's your cup of tea-Plenty of parking. Cons:-Smoking:  It's a bar and pub, should be expected.  -Dark inside-Service is not the best.  Took a while for our orders to be taken, even longer for the food to arrive.  -Wide selection of food, but not the best place to if you're watching your cals.I tried their 8 oz Filet and cup of chili.  The filet was little dry and tasted close to a NY Steak.  Still got my protein from it, so I was happy.  The chili here was my highlight. It's topped with onions and also has a little kick to it. I almost got seconds, but figured that it was best that I didn't since I was trying to keep the calories a little low for the day. Overall, the 3 stars means that the food here is just okay.  Don't let the 3 stars discourage you.  Winchell's is a good place to hang out with friends and even get a meal in. I'll probably be back again to meet the homegirl for lunch.  Otherwise, I just don't see myself going out of my way to eat here.

Nine Fine Irishmen=Nothing personal against Nine Fine Irishmen...this review is more about ALL Irish pubs in general. WTF is the big allure with Irish pubs? Drunk, aggro mooks swilling dark-ass beer and eating grotesque, high-sodium high-fat carb-heavy food in a frenzied, fake-ethnic Animal House atmosphere. WHY???????I was coerced into having lunch here the other day, and it was GROSS. I thought I'd be OK just ordering a good old-fashioned cheeseburger. Little did I know, the Irish apparently slop garlic mayo all over everything, and even a simple cheeseburger isn't good enough without adding a layer of some kinda weird flesh-bacon on top of the regular meat patty.Aside from the food, I find the atmo at Irish pubs to be INSUFFERABLY ANNOYING. All that dark wood paneling, hearty waitresses, manically jovial Irish music blaring from the jukebox....it's my own private version of hell! Secret fact about me: I looooove holidays, but on St. Patrick's Day I crawl into a hole and HIDE -- all that green beer and all those drunk idiots make me want to VOMIT.The sole exception to my anti-Irish-pub stance is O'Shea's...because it's more of a shithole dive bar than a pub, they keep the wood paneling to a minimum, Irish music is almost NEVER played, and my friend Brian works the door in a leprechaun costume. I'll reserve my VERY infrequent Irish-bar hankerings for O'Shea's! With any luck, I will never set foot in 9 Fine Rí Rá Paddy MacGillicuddy's Krazy Old-Tyme Potato-n-Whiskey Shack again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Ugh!Like many things in Vegas the Irish bar Nine Fine Irishman at New York New York sounds much cooler than it really is, but the pub does provide an alternative Vegas experience. The bar is laid out like a house with plenty of secluded tables. At Nine Fine Irishmen, the Smithwick's Irish Red Pale Ale Beer is cold, the Jameson Whiskey free flowing, and the Irish band lively.Olivia Z. and I came to enjoy the band. It wasn't very busy, however, since there are only about 8 seats with a view the options are to stand & watch or find a table around the corner. We stood for awhile and then floated from table to table as better spots opened up. The upstairs was closed for a "private event." The outdoor patio provides even more space.We were dishin' out dough at the tables inside of NY NY. A few hours in with the house consuming our money, it was agreed, consumption of food was absolutely necessary. ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY. The ambiance is 'pubbish' with stained wooden floors and walls, head stones, mirrors, marble pillars and dim chandeliers. Very subtle and nice. Being a quarter Irish, I'm always drawn to places like this. It gives me a false sense of feeling, that perhaps, this is what it might be like over yonder. We were sat in a neat little sofa style seat adjacent to the restrooms. I don't mind this.. In fact, it was quite the scene. The entry / exit door for waiters / waitresses / bussers and so on is conveniently  placed side by side with the restrooms. I couldn't count how many men and women walked into the kitchen dazed and confused. Even the restroom entrances themselves were a little confusing, with dudes going in the women's and women going into the men's restrooms. Good times.I was about to order a chicken pot pie and my sister the Shepherd's pie when a waitress walked by with an individual chicken pot pie. These things are ginormous! They're served in a tin pale that's stuffed to the top! The proverbial 'muffin top' so to speak. We ordered the chicken pot pie to share, drunken onion rings and each had a cup of Colcannon soup. The appetizers were delightful. The drunken onions rings are marinated in a bloody Mary / beer batter mix, fried and served with spicy honey mustard. Scorching temperatures had us waiting on these bad boys, but I have to tell you, they were really good. I didn't catch the hints of bloody mary flavoring, however, the spicy mustard sauce made up for that. The Colcannon was what the doctor ordered. The weather during the day had been in the mid-70's and evening hours around the low 40's, so the soup compensated for the cool weather and warmed me up instantly. Did somebody say bacon!? Resting inside this creamy soup delight, Irish bacon is topped on pureed potatoes, cabbage and leeks. The chicken pot pie took the cake though. As mentioned the crust spews out of the top of the tin pale it's served in. Light, flaky and buttery.  The crust's solid defense was no match for my fork's offense.  The chicken was succulent, salty and tender. And wow.. The sauce / stock the vegetables are mixed in was probably one of the best tasting things I've ever had. Period. There was cheddar in this pie, which I've never had in a pot pie, and it (along with a few other ingredients) created an orange like cream that was too tasty! I was full, but kept eating.  Flavor in every bite and never EVER lacked it. Great service and GREAT food!This is an ok place. I do not share everyone else's enthusiasm for it, but it is perfectly acceptable for a casual meal. The layout is odd. There are many odd sized rooms. In the evening they do have live music often.The food is ok. I ordered the Irish Nachos. They consist of fried potato slices topped with beer cheese sauce, chives, aioli and green onions. I chose to add steak. You get a good amount of food. It is more than enough for a meal for one. Several people could also spit it as an appetizer. The chips had solid flavor and were crisp enough. The toppings were all ok.The service was ok. Our server was not rude, but also not overtly nice. It also would have been nice for her to come by a little more frequently.
Tequileria=My brother and I always come here when we fly out after visiting the family at Christmas.It's our little tradition, getting shots of Agavero and nachos before we head back to our own ends of the country.  If you are looking for a shot of something at Charlotte Douglas, this is a decent place for good tequila.
Veggie Delight=Lychee Slushie Boba. Extra Boba and Lychee Jelly. My standard mantra as I enter Veggie Delight.One of the only purely vegetarian establishments in Las Vegas, Veggie Delight is the savior of our weekly "what do we eat tonight?" predicament. Their Vietnamese sandwiches (pork chop, crispy chicken and spicy chicken) are amazing. They come in soft french bread and have mayo (or vegenaise), soy meat (trust me, it's good here) and a little pickled salad of sorts with cucumber, cilantro and carrots on it. It's a very filling and satisfying sandwich. They've started to offer their sandwiches as part of a lunch special. About 5 bucks for a sandwich, soup and hot/cold tea. Very very reasonable. Yes, this is not a ritzy place. It's actually very far from that. The staff here is seriously challenged with grasping the English Language and the menu ...not at all appetizing. But voila....the food they come up with is amazing, consistent and very satiating. Service is efficient (remember the language barrier but pointing to pictures on the menu helps lots).Our favorites are the following:Vietnamese Faux Crispy Chicken/Pork Chop/Spicy Chicken SandwichesBasil Faux ChickenTaiwanese Faux Beef Noodle SoupFaux Pork Skin Hand RollsFaux Spicy Chicken. All in all, this is a great everyday meal solution. Not too heavy, expensive or pretentious. And of course, their Lychee Boba is to die for. Remember to order it the way I do (See above).Day 19 of vegetarian month...why didn't I come here EARLIER?? This place is awesome! Yeah yeah its a hole in the wall but what vegetarian/vegan can say no to a menu like this? After going through all the awesome Yelper reviews/recommendations I got a take out order of: Vegetarian pork skin rolls: I probably would've believed these were actually crispy pork skins if no one had told me. Great appetizer that was tasty but light. Vegetarian Black Pepper Beef Steak with Special sauce: This was great. The consistency of the protein was as close to beef as I've had at a vegetarian joint and the sauce was great. Vegetarian Fish Steak with Mixed Vegetables: They shaped the protein like mini filets of sea bass with black skin etc but it was still tofu in the end. Not bad but the "beef" was way better. Sauce was sweet which I wasn't so into either. I'm curious to see how they do shrimp and pork chops so that'll be what we go for next time. We'll certainly be back before Jan end since I am running out of home vegetarian recipes that are satisfying haha.veggie delight is great veg find in a meat-centric town.  thank you for again showing me the way, yelp!pros:- all vegetarian- cheap, depending on what you order.  this is vegas, after all...- tasty, fresh, and very unique food- pleasant servicecons:- location is a tough to find, and you absolutely have to drive to it (note: just because it's on wynn road in NO WAY means it's located near the wynn!)- very casual atmosphere... clean, though- slight language barrier, but friendly service once you realize this- weird dual pricing depending on if you want your dish vegan (more expensive) or vegetarian (cheaper for some reason).  when i asked our server what the difference is, she replied "dairy".  dairy in chinese/thai/viet food?  that seems odd... especially when you see the menu items.based on all the yelp love, we ordered the veggie pork skin rice noodle salad.  holy shit, this was AMAZING!!!  super flavorful, crispy, full of fresh veggies, and not heavy.  yum!!  we also ordered the basil chicken because i just love this kind of dish.  it was really good and came with fresh vegetables, including broccoli, carrots, and snap peas.  we requested brown rice with it instead of white rice and some hot sauce on the side.  delicious!   both these dishes were very unique tasting, and the pork skin noodle salad was unlike anything i've ever had or seen.  we finished everything and left with happy, full bellies and ready for a night of boozing, gambling,and other unmentionable activities.  ;)looking forward to coming back next time we're in vegas!If I had the power to move mountains, my first item of business would be to pick up this little place and move it from Las Vegas to Maryland. As high-profile as our hotel's restaurants were, the availability of eating options for non-carnivores was lacking. Me being just under a few months old as a vegan, I thankfully was able to trust in my handy dandy Yelp app to locate vegan/vegetarian places in the area and was led to Veggie Delight. At first I was a little confused reading the menu because all over it I read options with the words "chicken, shrimp, beef, pork" in them. After looking at the pictures and reading the reviews, I was even more excited to learn of and even more anxious to experiment with several of the meatless options and see their take on carnivorous selections. I was tickled at the fact that it likened many of the Chinese carry outs I'm used to in that they boasted Chinese and American cuisine. Had they've included soul food, I surely thought I was back in Baltimore.I purchased the Basil Leaf Chicken entree, Spicy Chicken sandwich, Pork spring roll and Shrimp spring roll. My least favorite was the basil leaf chicken. I could barely finish half the container, it had way too much ginger in it. The meat used in it was also not cooked as thoroughly as I would have preferred. It needed to be crisp as opposed to soft and rubbery as the meat seemed to squeak while chewing. My favorite was the chicken sandwich. There's this carrot mixture they use as a topping/spread and the seitan had a nice spicy sauce/marinade that was a great match to the sweet tasting wheat roll the held it together. For the price paid, I would have liked a bit more of the "chicken" mixture but if you were eating this with any type of side (chips, etc) you would be satisfied. As far as the spring rolls were concerned, what the other Yelpers stated holds true-go for crunchy!!!  The rice paper wrapped round the rolls became sticky and hard to maneuver without everything falling all over the place. It's unfortunate that the shrimp roll doesn't come crunchy. Perhaps some suggestions should be made to them about this. The contents inside were great matches though and the shrimp substitute was delightful. The pork roll had some type of mushroom appeal to it but the color matched and the taste was convincing once you poured the complimentary chili oil on it. I also purchased an avocado slush and boy was it delicious! The variety in both flavors and milks (soy or almond) they offered was great and the cups they serve the slushes in are vacuumed sealed so as to prevent spillage. Veggie Delight is quite a treasure and I will surely be back the next time I visit Vegas.
Rachel's Kitchen=Today's lunch choice was Rachel's Kitchen and let me say... It was like eating a Julia Childs meal without all the butter and well without anything like Julia Childs would make.... It was awesome and healthy.We have decided at work to order nothing but good foods for now on and the first choice was Rachels Kitchen. I Personally had the "440" This amazing mound of goodness has the following ingredients:Grilled Chicken Breast Goat CheeseAvocadoRoasted Red Peppers Roasted TomatoesRomain Lettuce. On a crispy chibatta roll with a fresh salad with a balsamic vinaigretteAs you can see, No mayo or any sauces but between the goat cheese and avocado you do not need it. For those of you that know me, I am not a huge sandwich person and this was one heck of a sandwich. I would invite ole Rachel into my place any day to come whip up one of these bad boys!!Another plus was that the entire order was made to perfection No mistakes and not just sloppily through in boxes like some other places we order from. Knowing that this is the first time we have ventured into our new healthy options folder, I think Rachels will be a consistent part of our lunch schedule especially since the menu seems to offer tons of healthy alternatives to a Double Double heart stopper or a quick Cardiac quesadilla!!!Came in for a quiet Sunday breakfast with the BF. Location dining room is clean and well-decorated with bright and cheerful colors, and the fresh fruit salads and parfaits on display in the refrigerated case are eye-catching and make a good healthy impulse purchase.BF works nights and is a heavy eater in the AM, while I usually don't have an appetite at all until the afternoon. He opted for the grilled chicken sandwich from the Lighter Side section of the menu ($13) while I kept it simple with a peachberry smoothie- wish the calorie count for the smoothies was listed, too, as I found it odd they weren't listed in the Lighter Side section, but the fresh-squeezed juices were, with counts.My smoothie came out first and was flavorful and mostly creamy, just a touch icy. Portion was good, and I liked that it came with the domed bubble lid, so that the portion was not cut short by snapping on the flat lids as they are often served elsewhere. Nothing more annoying than seeing a giant, fresh smoothie being poured from the blender, only to have a heap of it get tossed out because it doesn't fit in my cup!BF's sandwich was next- plated with a side salad with balsamic dressing. Salad veggies were fresh and dressing tasted homemade. The sandwich though, we had mixed feelings about: it was topped with grilled veggies (eggplant and roasted peppers?), and the veggies themselves were delicious. The chicken was in two small, flat pieces and was fairly dry. While the flavor was fairly good, this simply was not a $13 value for a sandwich. What we received did not justify the price. Having seen the product, this is not something I would pay over about $8 for.I love to support local businesses, and especially ones that offer healthy options, but it really frustrates me to see places jumping on green/healthy trend and jacking up prices an unreasonable degree when their product doesn't justify it.I have been meeting a friend here for breakfast every time I come to Vegas. We love the wholesome food selection and the outdoor seating on nice mornings. The food is really consistent and I have had a variety of breakfast items on the menu. The service is generally good. You order at the counter and the server brings your dish out to you. No follow up they I've ever seen. This time, my son had ordered a smoothie that we had to return to ask for and he was disappointed in his meal, the protein lover's scramble.  He felt the portion was small and that it had a very small amount of chicken and bacon in the meal. The Protein Lovers Scramble is 3 eggs scrambled with chicken, bacon and cheddar cheese. My friend and I each had The Favorite:  3 eggs scrambled with goat cheese, spinach, sun dried tomatoes and avocado.  We had the seasoned potatoes with it as well.  We both were happy with our plates.  I thought it had very good flavor and the portions were good for us as well. We checked in and got free, super large muffins as well.  I didn't try one, but the consensus was that they were delicious!I will come back to Rachel's again. It is a bit pricey but I like the healthier options available.
Taggia=Taggia can put on an awesome spread of gourmet appetizers!  Wow!I attended a Yelp event at Firesky recently and I was very impressed with the food and service of Taggia.Oh the olives!  Just the spread of olives was wonderful by itself.  Great variety.  Then the proscuitto, the artichokes, the sun dried tomatoes, the cheeses...all delicious.We'll be back for dinner soon!I try not to revisit restaurants with eh service, but since this is very conveniently located with my hotel (the Firesky) I didn't have much of a choice. And so I had a lunch and a breakfast at Taggia....2 days in a row!Lunch: This was the scene of the bad service experience. Our waitress gave us the dinner menus (instead of lunch) and forgot 1 of the 2 pizzas we ordered. Fortunately, I had the organic greens salad to munch on while I waited for my lost margherita pizza.  Once the pizza finally arrived it was a tasty thin crust (just how I like it), but nothing to special to Yelp about.Breakfast: The very next morning. Fortunately, a different waitress was more "with it' this time around. I ordered the spinach and mushroom frittata from the breakfast menu, but switched it up a bit by adding swiss cheese and asking for egg whites (to balance out the cheese).  She got the order right even with the changes (whoo hoo), although the frittata once again wasn't anything special.I wouldn't go out of my way for bad service and mediocre food, but wouldn't hesitate to grab a bite to eat here during future visits at the Firesky.05/08/10Friend and I had a fantastic dinner here- my first time back since attending a Yelp event held at Firesky Resort months ago.  We chose to dine outside as it was a nice afternoon.  (Also, the restaurant just opened for dinner, so no one was dining indoors, yet.)  We were hungry, so by the time our server arrived for our drink orders (just water, since we had some wine at the bar and reception areas) we also placed our entree requests- the wild salmon sounded divine, so we both wanted it (she w/ fingerling potatoes and I subbing asparagus).  When it became apparent that we weren't going to get bread unless we asked for it (we waited at least ten minutes-- we were there early... we were hungry!), we asked if complimentary bread was available.  (It was, and with delicious marinated olives, too!)Words cannot do these beautiful entrees justice!  As you can see from the photos, the salmon I had was so juicy.  The textures were exquisite-- starting at the perfectly-crisped skin, nicely seasoned; then immediately underneath it, the seared, buttered flesh; through the flaky layers, until you reach the tender medium-rare center...  There, there- I'm getting waves of goosebumps up and down my arms and neck just recalling those moments!  And the accompanying vegetables were equally splendid!  Crunchy, yet dainty asparagus spears flanked by olives, grape tomatoes, artichoke hearts, and fennel!  Mmm... I think it's time to check out restaurant.com for a gift certificate for another meal here soon :)  Didn't know acquaintance James Siao is Taggia's "chef de cuisine"- what a nice surprise!  He was so sweet to offer my friend and me a complimentary dessert to share.  All the desserts on the menu that night sounded great, but it was no contest-- we had to check out the tiramisu!  Taggia serves up a terrific version-- a marvel to look at, and so many layers to tantalize the tastebuds... So cool and creamy, and the cocoa used was of very high quality.  This dessert was packed w/ so much flavor, yet it was very light-tasting (and very light in the tummy, too!).  This tiramisu lived up to its name- a perfect pick-me-up!Can't wait to go back!Located right inside Firesky, I don't think many locals even realize this is here. After a failed attempt to dine a restaurant nearby due to an hour+ wait, we decided to check out Taggia across the street. It's one of those restaurants that have always been on the list but we seem to forget its there. The ambience at Taggia is exactly what I like in a restaurant: an open patio overlooking waterfalls, ponds and a pretty pool. It was the perfect Arizona fall evening and ideal for outdoor dining. The waiter introduced me to a new cocktail, whip cream vodka and soda. It tastes like a creamsicle and was delicious! We started with calamari and ordered the crab raviolis and shrimp risotto for dinner. When I was ordering my meal, the waiter asked me whether I wanted a house or Caesar salad. The way he said it gave the impression that a salad was included in the meal. However, something didn't seem right since it didn't indicate that on the menu, so I awkwardly asked. He then quietly answered me saying no, a salad wasn't included. Typically when a waiter asks whether you want a house or Ceasar, it means that a salad is included but in reality, he was being little sneaky by trying to get me to order a $10 salad thinking it was included. I would have been pretty unhappily surprised when the bill came if I hadn't caught on when I ordered. The ambience was a four star, the food was ok, but the prices were pretty steep for the meal we got and the waiter tried to pull a fast one with the salad comment which tainted my experience. My food was good though and like I said, it was great ambience. However, guests should be warned that if a waiter offers you a "house or Caesar salad," know that it's not included with the meal and that will cost you $10 extra dollars.
Beach Cafe=A neighborhood cafe serving up breakfast and lunch fare in a laid back beach-like atmosphere.Sure, they have swimsuits hanging from the ceiling and a tiki theme going on.  Walking in, the waitress told us to sit wherever we wanted.  Using our Entertainment Book coupons, we thought we were restricted to the Breakfast menu only.  But the waitress was nice enough to let us use it for anything on the menu, which we definitely appreciated!I chose the Del Mar Melt ($7.95), which consists of their homemade tuna salad with melted Swiss cheese and tomato on perfectly grilled sourdough bread.  Their tuna salad has crunchy bits of celery and was to my liking.  French fries also came with my order.The Husband saw their Specials board, which meant he was getting the Chicken Fried Steak Sandwich ($8.75).  For those who crave a chicken fried steak but it's too late in the day, putting it between two pieces of bread easily does the trick.  The sandwich had lettuce, tomato, and mayo, with their homemade gravy on the side. French fries also came with his order.  I didn't see any complaints coming from him as he ate it all up! We also had a BOGO free smoothie, so we took ours to go.  My choice was their Sunburn smoothie ($4.50/16 oz; $5.25/24 oz) which consists of passion fruit, mango, peach, strawberry juice, and crushed ice.  It was a super sweet smoothie, which had me wondering how much sugar was in it.  The Husband had their Tropical Passion smoothie ($4.50/16 oz; $5.25/24 oz) which had guava, passion fruit, and mango blended with crushed ice.  He said it tasted like baby food, which was a good thing.We went on a Tuesday and they had a steady stream of customers - those taking a leisurely solo lunch break or colleagues gathered together to enjoy their tropical iced tea.  It looked like there was one waitress and she was busy the whole time we were there.  I did have to ask for refills on my water, but only because she was constantly moving around. Overall, Beach Cafe served up a decent lunch.  I don't know if we would be inclined to go back without a coupon though.I have been a loyal customer for three years. I called today for delivery. After an hour I called to check up on the order. The owner was frazzled and condescending.  I said, "Please don't condescend me. I have I right to call and check up. I get that your slammed. I have a business too. "Her response was incredibly odd. "No, this is my business. I will cancel the order and never order from here again. Then she hung-up."I have my own business that has survived and thrived in Vegas for 27 years.We do 250+ events a year and 6000 daily deliveries. I am speaking from experience. When a small Mom and Pop operation is blessed enough to experience a rush;1.  It is the RESPONSIBILITY of the owners to properly staff themselves.2. Maintain prompt and courtesy service to their customers.3. Remember how they got there (and this is ia SMALL operation and pretty pathetic that they can't handle a Sunday morning delivery by noon) is through repeat customers.Here's how I tried to help their business..1.  I have referred this restaurant through my own business as a caterer for countless weddings and events. 2.  I have passed out their cards at my shop located on off the strip. 3.  I have verbally endorsed them throughout my social circle. II really routed for this place in this economy. When my family has been in town I have taken them there and introduced the to the owners and staff.My support is withdrawn.I was disappointed with the service and food here.  I came in for breakfast on a Friday ... not busy at all, which I can't understand why the service was so bad.There is only one server who doesn't seemed thrilled to be there but she was working.  She wasn't rude or anything but she wasn't happy either.  There was another girl who stayed posted behind the counter watching tv ... she must be the owner or something because she didn't do anything or interacted with any customers NOT sitting at the counter.My boyfriend and I ordered eggs benedict and it took over 40 minutes to get our food.  Eggs benedict came with a very small serving of really greasy home fries (aka potatoes) ... it was nothing special.  I was never offered a refill on my drink or asked if everything was ok or if I needed anything else Basically if you want to wait a long time for your food and be ignored during your whole visit ... come to the beach cafe
Al Dente=Wandering around Paris aimlessly might sound hopelessly romantic.  Unless you are in Vegas and are so hungry you want to stab someone in the eye.  Of course all the buffets and restaurants have lines longer than Fry's on black Friday morning.  I was furious.  For food.  We kept walking farther and farther until we reached Bally's.  Finally, we reached a dark hidden restaurant corner.  Steakhouse or pasta.  Steakhouse or pasta?  They both looked rather packed so we just took a shot in the dark.  Pasta - it looked classy and it was mostly full of crusty old people who looked like money bags and hair pieces.  The best part is that they were offering a prefix for $25.  A bunch of food (and a glass of wine) and we don't have to pay $15 just for a measly sammich like the rest of the Strip?We were quickly seated and our waiter was pretty funny but also gangsterish.  I didn't know if I shouldn't laugh at his jokes or if I'd get stabbed if I didn't. Anyway,  I went with the starter of salad and opted for the angel hair pasta with white wine.  The other half went with the soup and the meat sauce rigatoni with red wine.  Both were good but didn't make a lasting impression.  Then a bowl of bread came out - this was definitely the hit of the night.  The whole large ensemble of cheesy rolls, crisp flatbread, and french bread were demolished.  Next, the starters came.  The salad was lightly tossed in vinagrette and the soup was tomatoey and quite finely pureed.  The pasta was definitely not 'al dente' but a little on the too soft side.  The angel hair marinara was pretty potent so if you have acid reflux problems, you'll want to steer clear.  The rigatoni was good but I felt like I've had better meat sauce pasta at home.  The dessert was better looking than it tasted and they ran out of the tiramisu which made me quite sad.  All in all, the ambiance made up for where the food was lacking and so did the service.  The food wasn't disgusting and if you're hungry, you'll definitely leave happy and full.
Kings Fish House=Kings Fish House is a restaurant that I come to quite frequently. I'm not sure if it's commonly known but this particular Kings location serves sushi in addition to seafood. And I am a self proclaimed Sushi Superfan! I come here specifically for the Tuna Poke salad. It's the best I've ever had. Something about it... They make theirs with macadamia nuts, cucumbers, avocado, seaweed and sprouts. It's really spicy and flavorful and like nothing I've ever had before. I'm a Tuna Poke connoisseur and I've traveled all over sampling various Tuna Poke salads. I've even tried to get other places to recreate the one I've experienced at Kings Fish House to no avail. So therefore, I recommend trying it because it is special, but don't blame me if you get hooked too! You've been warned! I've contemplated bribing the chef for the recipe many times and you might not want to be in that boat, plotting and planning like I do. I've actually been putting off writing this review because I knew I'd start thinking about it and have to go satisfy my urge AGAIN. I just can't get enough! I crave it on a regular basis. And sure enough, I was right about my reviewing Kings and thoughts of Poke overtaking my brain. Yep, I'm wanting it in a bad way now. Doh!!!!Speaking of DOH!!... The other thing I love that is worth mentioning is their Sourdough bread. Amazing, warm, fluffy and yummilicious! Their Oysters, Miso soup & Key Lime pie are all worth a try too.Service is usually quick. Since I've been so many times, a few of the servers remember what I want so I don't even have to order, which is always nice and makes you feel at home.The best buffalo chicken wings in town! Who could have imagined that a fish place would have amazing wings. They bake them first and then flash fry them. You gotta try them :-)I have a new Henderson hot spot when I want seafood. King's fish house won me over in every form. Fresh fish, tons of options, outdoor dining, and exceptional service. I am wondering what took me so long to get here. My stepson wanted seafood for his birthday, and I think it may be a tradition after this to take him here. There are three dining areas, a large dining room, a sushi bar lounge area with a bar yet it is still family appropriate, and a patio with misters. The food options include lobster, different styles of crab, shrimp, oysters, mussels, and even sushi. Since it is salmon season, they also had a variety of salmon specialties. Between the four of us, we had king crab, calamari, crab cakes, spicy seafood chowder, a philly sushi roll, mussels, and shrimp. The only thing I would pass on my next trip would be the chowder. It indeed had a spice, but the broth was a bit greasy. Everything else I would have seconds of in a heartbeat!Granted, this place isn't the cheapest. (4 people = $200 bill) But I think that is pretty average if you are expecting high quality fish. Perfect for a date night, or trying to impress a potential business partner or client. And just as perfect for a family craving seafood. Can't wait to return.Fresh seafood with beautiful decor! I came here with my mom on a late evening and the weather was perfect to sit outside so we got to enjoy the beautiful patio seating. This place is gorgeous inside out. Fresh flowers adorn every corner.We ordered a few cocktails, a mai tai & key lime martini. Both were strong and big; good combos! We then had some calamari that was outstanding with two different dipping sauces; a creamy tartarish one and a sweet & sour one that was a really nice surprise. We also ordered poke and it was so fresh and a tad on the spicy side which was great with some seaweed salad on the side. Lastly came traditional creme brûlée. The meal was great and so was the service. The menu itself is big and we had a hard time choosing what to get because we weren't that hungry. I'm already thinking of going back on a nice evening again to try things that had my interest. They have an extensive sushi menu and are of course known for their seafood with so many fresh fish options. Broiled halibut may have to come next...7:45pm reservations this past Saturday night was greeted by a smiling hostess who sat my favorite close friend and I at a comfortable booth with a nice view of the restaurant.Our waiter David was excellent! He told us about the entire menu including their Wild Pacific Swordfish specials, that are seasonal until 15 December. David was very friendly, knowledgeable and without delay for all that we ordered from King's impressive seafood menu. In fact, the menu is printed daily with the date at the top right, a sign of class! David has been a waiter at this King's Fish House since they opened 11 or so years ago. Make sure to ask for David when you make your dinner reservations and let me know how you enjoyed yourselves.Why are we here? Seafood! We each started with a bowl of New England Clam Chowder that was the best tasting i've had since clam digging in Alaska 2 years ago.Next we sampled the King's crab cakes, delicious, 2 per order. NOTE: Photo below was taken after 1 was devoured!Did you hear the one about the shy oyster? He finally came out of his shell :-)  A half a dozen fresh topless salty Kumamoto oysters were served on a bed of crushed ice with real seaweed. Yes, I ate the seaweed too! These Kumamoto oysters from Oakland Bay, Washington were significantly better tasting than any nearby sushi bar. They are known to be a high prized oyster that were imported to Washington state in 1949 from Kumamoto, Japan. A real treat and a MUST TRY if you love oysters!My entree selection took a while as I was mesmerized by all of the wonderful seafood options offered from this extensive dinner menu. I may not be able to afford coming back before mid December when the regional seafood special of swordfish ends, so this is what I ordered: Wild Pacific Swordfish, grilled w/ Oven Dried Tomato served w/ ratatouille and rosemary potatoes. Yum! Only 7 ounces of fish, but cooked to perfection and absolutely delicious tasting! I never knew ratatouille was a real food, despite enjoying the Disney/Pixar movie about 10 years ago :-)  These seasonal veggies were roasted very tenderly and mouthwatering good! The rosemary potatoes were something I must try to duplicate cooking at home, as I craved more; but did not order more because I wanted to save room for the seasonal dessert...We shared a slice of Pumpkin cheesecake with homemade whipped cream, nutmeg and garnished with a mint leaf! Yes, I ate the mint leaf too! The Pumpkin Cheesecake was excellent!"King's Fish House is a seafood oasis, not a mirage!"YELP 250 CHALLENGE 2015: #240
Sonic Drive-In=This was my first time that I've been to a Sonics. It was pretty interesting to see the guy bringing the food on roller-skates. We had just eaten, but were passing by, and I wanted to try it. We drove up, parked, and ordered from the menu board. It was just our luck. It was happy hour, which meant half price drinks and slushes from 2-5pm everyday. I ordered the Jolly Rancher Green Apple Slush with Pop Rock Candy in it. It was a pretty interesting concept. I've never heard of it before. I took a sip and the Rock Candy was just popping all in my mouth. I loved it, except for that fact that it was so overly sweet. My husband got the Caramel Brownie Blastopia. It's a blended ice cream shake. It was nice and rich, but also very sweet. The last thing we ordered were the onion rings. It was decent. It was fried crispy on the outside. On the inside, it was actually the whole piece of onion rather than chopped up, breaded onion bits.Service was pretty fast. The lady who took our order was nice. We had some questions, since it was our first time at Sonics. She took her time and answered it for us. The guy who delivered the food was also very pleasant.
Basil 'n Lime=The first and last time I went to this place, customer service was very poor! I mean, the place itself is well decorated, but it seems as if it does not go with the bad service I received! I ordered pad thai and wanted spice added to it. When I received my order, it was just regular noodles. So, I asked them if they can add spice, and they just directed me back to my table and said there was spice that I can add myself! That was downhill for me there.
Steve's Greenhouse Grill=Steve's Grillhouse was A-OK!After a long, hot trip from California I finally made it into Phoenix. While cruising the downtown area, Steve's was one of the first places I saw- so i decided to check it out. I ordered the Blackened Chicken Sandwich while my Girlfriend ordered the Cajun Pasta with Chicken. The wait staff was nice and the food came out quick. I enjoyed my blackened chicken, however the chicken wasn't really 'blackened'- it was just kinda grilled lol. I didn't mind though- the honey mustard tasted good. The Cajun pasta, however, was a little too spicy for my flavor. I know it's 'Cajun' style, but it left such a hot aftertaste in my mouth that it felt a bit much. I can see Steve's being a cool little spot to grab a burger from every now and then if i was from the PHX area. Right around the corner from the stadium and arena- got nice outdoor seating that's kept cool by overhead sprinklers- I give it a solid 3 stars.We stopped in here for dinner because it was very close to our hotel and we were able to be seated immediately. They have outdoor seating, which we chose since it was a nice evening. The seating its self was lacking. The staff was nice but not on top of their game. They did not come around often enough and made some errors.I was feeling like something simple so I ordered the Breakfast Burro. It comes stuffed with scrambled eggs, green chiles, potatoes and cheddar cheese. I chose to add sausage. It was good sized, enough to fill me up. The flavor was a touch bland, but I was able to overcome that with some hot sauce.This is not a bad place. If you are looking for affordable bar food, then it probably will be ok.
92nd Street Cafe=This area has plenty of housing but not many options to choose from for evening cocktails. Luckily a spot like 92nd Street Cafe exists. Now, here's something very important to note: disregard the name "cafe" in the title. When I think of a cafe, I think of a quaint spot where I can get a nice coffee, a simple sandwich/salad and sit for hours while reading a book. But at 92nd Street Cafe, think about this spot more as one where you go to after a couple or to get a couple drinks and waist the day/night away with bar food and dive drinks. The scene here is pretty classic and fun. I walked in and saw a large group of bar goers themed in their best 80s attire. I saw old men who were stumbling around like they'd been drinking since 1989 and I saw normal bar goers just there to kick back and have a few. It's divey in here but clean, the staff is friendly and the drinks are good. It's a narrow bar but surprisingly has a decent amount of seating a room. The interior has plenty of activities for the drinkers as well. I will end this review with a funny observation I made while there and that's the fact that this bar is right next to Sweet Republic. One day the kids are getting ice cream with their folks, the next day they are home from college and discover 92nd Street Cafe next door.-10 stars. They sit there and let their racist karaoke leader mock customers and get into altercations and shove women who are patrons of the bar. He has assaulted our our family by physically shoving  the hat of my brother deeper onto his head instigating a fight between a big group of people. This bar only supports their " regulars" and do not make new customers feel welcomed.Worst place ever! Their nasty karaoke singer who is a regular, physically assaulted my brother-in-law and the bartenders did not care! There was no manager or owner on staff! This place is managed horribly and I do not recommend it to anyone!
Nathan's Famous=So this Nathan's is in the foodcourt at the MGM, which shares the space with a Panda Express-like Chinese food place, a McDonald's, and a Pizza place.  It's actually an interesting place for a foodcourt, considering Craftsteak and SeaBlue (by Michael Mina) are practically right next door.I got the 2 hot dog and fries combo for $8.95.  The staff seemed friendly enough.  I didn't have any problems.The hot dogs are just.  I guess you can say it's like how people go gaga over Pink's for no good reason because let's face it, Pink's isn't even really that good.  You go really only for the experience of eating at a Los Angeles institution.  I feel the same way with Nathan's.  It's such a historic New York tradition that when someone says "I want to go try Nathan's" not because it's THAT good, but because it's a cultural experience.  That's my two cents anyway.I would however have to say that the hotdog skin has nice pop.  You know what I mean?  No?  Amateurs....I probably wouldn't come back though.Nathan's became a much needed stop before heading to the pool in the mornings. Not for a hot dog, but for breakfast sandwiches!We stopped by on Thursday, July 11th & Friday, July 12th. Though we gravitated towards the familiar McDonald's for a sandwich, Nathan's line was shorter, so we decided to try them out.I got the Sausage, egg and cheese on an English muffin, add bacon the first morning. I figured they would just add bacon to the sandwich, but they gave me a good amount on the side. I think like 5 strips. I believe it was an extra $2 to add bacon, so the amount justified the cost. The second morning, I got the same sandwich without adding bacon. I believe the sandwich was over $5, but less than $6. I can't really remember as I didn't document any of these meals. Both days, the sandwiches hit the spot! I liked that the cheese was melted on the egg and not all over the muffin as I could just eat the inside of the sandwich if I wasn't super hungry.Nathan's offered a great alternative to McDonald's sausage egg mcmuffin. Plus, we didn't have to wait in their ridiculously long line!
Earl's=Came to lunch with a bunch of my coworkers. We made reservations on the patio and although it is right next to a busy intersection and the freeway I really didn't notice either. I really liked their patio and all of  trees provided plenty of shade. It was still a little chilly out when we were here for lunch, but they had a fire going in the outdoor fireplace on which made sitting outside much more comfortable. I wasn't very hungry so I ordered the Dynamite Shrimp Roll, which came with 8 pieces of sushi. It had a little bit of a kick to it which I enjoyed, but I could taste the scallions the rest of the day.  The rest of the table had salads and sandwiches which came in pretty generous portions. Although they were pretty busy, service was beyond slow. We had finished eating at least 15 minutes (but I'm thinking it was even longer than that) before they brought us the check. This normally wouldn't have bothered me if it had been around the dinner hour, but most people only have an hour for lunch and want to get in and out.This place is a bit pricey compared to a lot of the other lunch options around the airpark, but it's a nice place to go for lunch or drinks.
Ocean One Bar and Grille=Cheap prices, free WiFi, and a recommendation from Tetsu...inspired us to try this place (twice) in the Miracle Mile Shops at Planet Hollywood.  Lunch starts at $5.99 and dinner at $8.99.  The Island Salmon Salad was my favorite.  The mango vinaigrette and marinated onion not only blended with the greens, but worked well with their salmon filet that was cooked just right.  The pistachios added crunch and flavor to this dish too.  The half pound sirloin burger didn't look like it was half a pound, and taste wasn't all that either.  The wild mushroom pepperoni pizza was good in size, but lacked mushrooms and pepperoni.  A crispier crust would've helped too. As for the Grilled Chicken Club...I've had better!   Service was above average though.  Tracy rocks!  She put cherry flavored syrup in my diet coke and allowed us to plug in our laptop into the wall near the kitchen.For low-cost lunch with nice ambiance ON THE STRIP....I'll be back!We were staying at the Elara Hilton Garden Vacations Club, which was located just around the corner from this restaurant within the mall.  One morning we were walking by with a little over an hour to spare and thought that we would dine here for breakfast.  There were only a few tables with patrons seated, so we figured we would be able to catch a quick coffee and meal for three under an hour.Big mistake.  Once we were seated outdoors around the corner, it seemed as if we were out of sight and out of mind.  Everything took long from placing our orders to receiving our meals and getting the final bill.  It was extremely stressful being that we were on a time constraint, and had to leave the hotel an hour later.  We had to gobble down our food once it arrived and had asked for the bill at the same time.Our simple meals consisting of waffles, pancakes and bacon were pretty decent, but the extremely slow service brings down their rating another star or two.  I wouldn't say that I'd be interested in coming back anytime soon.#100 / 100Yelp 100 Review Challenge 2014Brunch is absolutely necessary after a night out in sin city! We took a short walk over to Planet Hollywood for food, not knowing what we want. The Ocean One Bar and Grille breakfast menu was out so we decided to take a look. Our party of 9 was seated fairly quick.Garden Omelette ($8.95): This veggie omelette came with a side of toast (white/wheat) and some potatoes. Portions were a good size for the price. I'm actually surprised the omelette wasn't more, especially dining in at a restaurant inside of a casino! Everything tasted a little bland or very average.Our waiter messed up on quite a few orders we had (wrong type of bread, incorrect way of how the eggs are cooked, etc). Needless to say, our service wasn't very good the entire stay but I'm sure he didn't really care since we were required to give the 18% gratuity anyways.There are better brunch places out there!It was a 4 "o" clock on Saturday, December 6 when I laid eyes on the sign advertising "half pound sirloin burger with sautéed onions, lettuce, tomatoes, mushrooms, bacon, mayonnaise, and provolone cheese, and seasoned fries for $6.99. I had been on the Las Vegas Strip for hours and walking from Ebar in Fashion Show Mall toward the south Strip my reliable hunger was kicking in. I was strolling the corridors of the Miracle Mile when this sign caught my eyes. $6.99 for a half pound cheeseburger with toppings in a full service restaurant sounds to good to be true, however, I am cognizant of the fact that Miracle Mile with Planet Hollywood have some decent deals in the heart of the Las Vegas Strip. So, I thought, "what is the worst that could happen if I gave Ocean One a try?"     Upon entering the restaurant, I questioned the $6.99 burger. The friendly hostess let me know that it is available for dinner and that it didn't start for an hour (5 PM).     Fast forward to 5 PM, I reentered the exact scenery and talked to the same hostess. It was obvious that the burger deal wasn't a gimmicks at the exact time that they weren't going to give prime seating to that customer who came here for the $6.99 burger at a table in the restaurant. My choices were at the bar or in the patio overlooking the walking path of Miracle Mile. I chose the patio. The hostess seated me at a table visible to the restaurant so that they would know I'm there. A few minutes further, a waitress knew I was there. This waitress wasn't nasty, enthusiastic, or friendly.    I had done enough walking. Now it was time to dig in and do some eating. The burger I was eating was nothing like a Smokestack burger down the Strip in Shake Shack, or nothing like a mouthwatering burger at Fukuburger down the Strip in Hawaiian Marketplace, or as thick and juicy as a burger in Outback down by Showcase Mall. With a bottomless Coke this came out to $10.72 before a tip that made Ocean One a far better deal than OVERPAYING for a $17 dry Philly cheesesteak meal at Nathan's or $16.50 for a cheeseburger at the Treasure Island Cafe. The cheeseburger and seasoned fries were good. It did the job by filling me up at a good price where the only gimmick is that I was looking in at the attractive brightly lit dining room from the patio.      In conclusion I was satisfied just like my wallet was with the $6.99 cheeseburger meal. There are so many dining options on the Las Vegas Strip and so many nights for me to hang out here that Ocean One looks like a one time experience in the near future.
Kabob Korner=This review is based entirely around the Super Gyro menu item, a fully loaded gyro that happens to be the best I've had in Vegas.  When I'm giving a 5 star review, I'm basically saying that the establishment will be a repeat eat for me.  If I am craving a gyro, this is the place that I want to go.  This place is located on Fremont Street just east of Las Vegas Boulevard, so coming here when I get that craving isn't always the most convenient solution.  How good is their super gyro?  A few weekends ago my friends and I met downtown at Firefly at the Plaza.  I've never been disappointed at Firefly, and this was no exception.  However, after spending a few hours at Downtown Cocktail room (another place that I've never been disappointed) I seriously had a craving for a super gyro.  So after dropping about $20 at Firefly per person (which always leaves me satisfied as far as food portions go) I was willing to get a super gyro here.  As a comparison, the main contenders for my favorite gyro have been the Paymon's, the Greek American Grill, The Mad Greek and The Olive Mediterranean Grill.  Hands down Kabob Korner is at the top of my list, for gyros specifically.Searching for a 'healthy' option for lunch led me to KK. Picked up a large Greek salad ($4.99) and an order of chicken boti ($7.99). Wait, before I chat about the food, let's discuss the place...it's pretty narsty. Seriously, there are wilting posters of gyros on the wall. Poster of gyros? Excellent. Gross poster from 1970? Not something you want to find in a food establishment. When looking around (it took 15 min to make the boti) you can see the place is really long and the kitchen is large for what they put out. I think it's time for a remodel peeps. It should also be noted that the guy at the counter was messing around with his foot and the bottom of his sock (yep, he was in socks n sandals) before taking my order. I couldn't bear watching to see if he was handling my food, so I sat in the corner. Ignorance is bliss, no? So I got my order and went home. The boti ended up consisting of 5 pieces of super awesome chicken and a truck load of rice. Damn that was good chicken! Tender, spicy, yum! But 5 pieces stinks for $8. It was like eating a rice salad with kabob on top. Lame. The large Greek was decent in size for the price, but the dressing lacked any sort of flavor. Kinda reminded me of Italian house dressing (gasp!). This all being said, I'll be back. Def for a gyro and yes, maybe even for 5 delish pieces of chicken over a rice salad. Hold the sock grime. Actually, put it on the side.Had to up the star rating here. Sure, the interior is still the capital of Grime City, but the super gyro is tasty and the chicken boti, while small in quantity, is still a good dish. Plus, I didn't see any bare feet this go-round. Seriously though, the gyro meat is solid. Moist, spicy and flavorful, it's def the star in this sammie. As usual, prepare to wait 10 min for your order. (Call ahead!)New tastes: Hummus (avoid)Greek salad (sub par)Hmmm. Maybe it should be a 2.5 star rating....
Hennessey's Tavern=Starving, tipsy and needing a place to rest my sore tootsies, I headed to Hennessey's with my group last night. In costume, I might add. We located a spot on the patio for the best spot to people watch. Service was friendly, albeit incredibly SLOW given how not so busy the place was. Drink orders were mixed up and our large order of french fries took about 45 minutes to come out. Great location and typically when I come the service is much better, so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt that the Halloween crowd slowed them down a bit. Definitely a good little place to take a seat and rest with a beverage or some pub grub while you're downtown. People watching from the patio is a plus!While wandering down Fremont Street for the first time I needed to get my drinking started and I started it here. though there was a lack of certain beers they weren't short on Jameson's which I despise. So with drinking aside I went for the food and they had an awesome hamburger. I was really surprised of how good it was. Not the best bar on Fremont but I couldn't knock it, it was cool.Like if there aren't enough eats in Fremont Street to enjoy, I just had to come to this place simply because it caught my eye! Myself and my foodie +1 date were running kinda late for EDC this past weekend and saw that this place was the closest nearby our hotel. Boy, did we sure make quite the great choice coming here!Let me first say that due to the fact that my phone was near death in battery life, I was not able to take any pics of the eats we had to enjoy. I will just describe the experience instead! Inside it is very roomy with plenty of ample seating, as well as outdoor patio seating. This place does have live bands coming to play. Sweet! They do have a fully stocked open bar as well as some of the most courteous staff! Our waitress was very prompt in making sure our needs were fulfilled. I think her name was Shannon or Sharon. Either way, she was very professional and sweet!For the eats, I ordered their Irish nachos, which came with a scoop of sour cream, which added to the already awesome taste. My foodie date had their amazing spinach and artichoke dip. Whoa. Some of the best we have ever had! For drinks, she had the lemonade with vodka. I had to opt for their iced tea(I was the DD that night!) The food came out rather quickly, which we was able to enjoy nicely.As I stated before, there are such a variety of places to eat on Fremont Street in Las Vegas. This is one place that I highly recommend. The service was impeccable, the eats were just amazing and the overall experience was a memorable one. Next time I am in the area, I will definitely be making a pit stop here. That is how much this place impressed me.
Oyshi Sushi=We get into Vegas Friday evening, checked in, and began our weekend off with a night of debauchery.Food porn at Oyshi. Yessiree, four hungry men and a AYCE Japanese food? This is gonna get ugly fast, real fast. We get there and it's packed. A nice waiter greeted us and told us it might be a while. 20 minutes. Shit, thats it? His reaction made it seem like an hour or 2. Dude! We'll wait. The restaurant is nicely designed with modern furnishings. Its set to look very relaxing like a lounge. Like Gerald S pointed out, it's not set up well if there's large groups. The good side is that it doesn't feel overcrowded. The AYCE is probably the best and only way to go here. There are so many items to choose from and the quality was not as bad as I thought it would be. They do limit the expensive stuff like uni, amaebi, and raw oysters, but it was well worth it. The sushi was very well made and fresh. Their sushi cuts are very generous. They hardly give any rice, so it was perfect. Everything was awesome, from the salmon, tempura, ribeye, and unlimited green tea or vanilla ice cream!!! Like hawks, we swooped down and attacked everything. Nothing was safe. We washed it all down with hot house sake ($7). For $25, I would do it over, and over, and over, and over, *deep breath*, and over again. The food came out slow, it was expected because they  had a full house. The service was simply awesome. If it's a Friday or Saturday, give them a call to make reservations. We left hurting and sat in our car like beached whales. You may have defeated us Oyshi, but we'll be back. Back with bigger and hungrier guys. *waives fist*Yeah, the Husband and I are sushi snobs - at least we're upfront about it.  But when you're living in Vegas, the only way to go is to do AYCE, right?  After getting tons of recommendations for this place, we finally got around to seeing what the hype is all about.All-you-can-eat dinner is $26/pp.  It was pretty busy on a Sunday night with a steady stream of customers (and large groups) coming in all night long.Like Ned M. mentioned, the sushi rice is only okay...it could be better.  Perhaps that's what put us off already...we had to eat the rice and we weren't digging it.We ordered lots of nigiri and found the fish to be okay too, some of it was mushy though.  As one friend mentioned, she wished the fish was a bit 'colder'.  Maybe we came on a bad night - but everyone is raving about the fish.  I'm also not too fond of 'sauce' added to my nigiri, and they added 'sauce' to a lot of my nigiri choices.  They do offer a wider selection of side items like Asian style skirt steak, ribeye steak teriyaki, etc.  And for this reason, one friend prefers coming here over other AYCE places.  I do like their version of agadashi tofu though.Limitations on their menu include:* one order of uni and amaebi per person* limit one order of oysters on the half shell (4 pieces) per person* limit one order on desserts of creme brulee, mochi ice cream, berry parfait or green tea tiramisu (regular ice cream is AYCE though - plum, green tea, vanilla, and coffee)Sitting at the sushi bar, service was pretty good.  The manager seemed like he was our main waiter and he was quite attentive.  We thought we were supposed to order our sushi from the sushi chef, but he asked the manager to take our sushi order instead.  He continued to take our orders throughout the night and refilled our beverages too.  There was a gap at one point where our tempura order was forgotten, had to be reordered again, and then had to be followed up on again before we got it.I can see why this place is popular - there's definitely a mixed crowd and separate rooms for private parties.  The staff are busy and attentive and they definitely recognize the regulars.  They have a lot of rolls to choose from, something that we usually avoid.  Overall, we found Oyshi Sushi to be an average place for AYCE sushi.Oyshi Sushi is a pretty good AYCE sushi restaurant located in the SW.  After hearing my coworker praising it, I finally hit up the place with a few Meetup folks from Las Vegas and SoCal.  It is the sister restaurant to Soyo Barestaurant in the same plaza, so yes, this is another Korean owned sushi restaurant with some items that has a more Korean flare/flavor.The restaurant itself is well-lit and trendily decorated, and attracts a diverse crowd of patrons looking for good AYCE sushi at a reasonable price.The AYCE menu is practically the entire menu (mostly nigiri and rolls), except the sashimi and if I remembered correctly some salads.  They also have expanded their menu, and the new items are printed on the paper place mats, so don't forget to check those out too.  Plus the numerous options available in the appetizer section is more than adequate to round out the sushi dining experience.  There are three special items (uni, ama ebi and raw oysters) that is limited to one order/pp with AYCE, and the restaurant reserves the right to charge you for the food you don't finish to minimize unnecessary waste (standard rules of the AYCE realm).I Enjoyed:Sibuya No Rice RollNew Moon RollVegas No Rice RollYumYum ScallopAma Ebi and the fried shrimp headsSurf n TurfPopcorn ScallopsI Didn't Care For:Japanese Lasagna (topped with way too much mayo that it overwhelmed and masked the flavor profile of the rolls underneath)Asian Style Flank Steak (basically a not so good version of the traditional Korean Bulgogi served on a sizzling plate)Green Tea TiramisuService was good, especially considering that Ted, was our only waiter, and he was looking after our party of 7 plus his other tables.We were seated in one of the side rooms with really comfortable seats, so it was extra relaxing.Ambiance: 5/5  Great vibes.Service: 4/5  For a busy night, our service was still great.Food: 4/5  Overall, I think it is pretty good for AYCE.Price: 4.5/5  Very reasonable.Parking: 5/5  Never been a problem finding a parking space when I come to this plaza.4 Stars!I am all about trying a new place! I really was pleased with the quality of sushi at Oyshi. If not for Yelp, I would have never known about this cool sushi joint. I fell in love with the darker more intimate atmosphere. I always sit at the bar when I go for sushi, that is the only way to have the best experience! They are friendly, and keep the dishes rolling my way! I have listed a few of my faves that I selected during AYCE. Ok so the Signature OYSHI ROLL was my favorite! I had two of those baby! My mouth was kissing me from the inside and it was the best feeling! I want to feel that again, soon! Very soon!Shrimp TempuraOYSHI shrimp tempura roll with dynamite and crunch flakes an topCRAZY PHILLYdeep fried Philadelphia with eel sauceVOLCANO baked yum-yum scallop on top of a cali roll, glazed with eel sauceFANTASYsalmon, shrimp, avocado, asparagus and cream cheese wrapped in soy paperDYNAMITE ROLL cali roll with baked yum-yum scallop, shrimp, crab mix, and mushroomSPIDER ROLL deep fried soft-shell crab, crab mix, avocado with eel sauceI just realized that I have not yet written a review for my favorite sushi spot on earth! Here it goes!! Although I have not been here in months because I moved on the opposite end of Vegas, now turning into a 30 minute drive, compared to a 5 minute drive =(WHERE: Located on Rainbow & RobindaleWHAT:  Everything about this local sushi joint is outstanding! From the uniqueness of the special rolls to the to the great customer service, this is the place to try!If you do get the chance to come here for your first, second, or millionth time, I suggest AYCE all the way!! Lunch is 24.95 and dinner is 27.95- so worth the time and money spent!One of my favorite appetizers is the ahi poke! There's something about the mixture that makes you want to order 5 of them and make your own dish!ROLLS:-Oyshi roll: The first thing you should try! It is their special roll, and the absolute best!!-Vegas & Sibuya rolls: If I can recall, these are the 2 rolls without rice! & are both full of flavor!-Japanese Lasagna roll: I always have to have my baked roll!!There are other great rolls, but I can't remember what the names were! So, until next time! I will update soon!*NOTE: You also get a free dessert with AYCE!! There are the fruit&yogurt parfait, creme brulee, ice cream, or mochi!I cant believe its taken me this long to find this place! stumbled upon this sushi restaurant while out doing some errands today and what a hidden treasure! Usually sushi bars have a very boring decor and bland music but this place was playing Trance music.. that is awesome! with beautiful decor to the wall art and the exposed pipes it has a very stylish/modern feel to it. I almost felt like I was in San Francisco. I ordered the seaweed salad. It was a very generous portion but my only gripe was it was completely covered in sesame seeds which i am not a fan but know next time to request them to be left out. The seaweed itself was very fresh and the right amount of dressing was used.Then i ordered the Hawaiian roll with soy paper. It had albacore, shrimp, and cucumber inside wrapped in a Cajun albacore and avocado tossed with some ponzu sauce... heaven. Seriously one of the best sushi rolls I have ever had and I consider myself a sushi connoisseur. Next time I'm there I will defiantly get the all you can eat. for $25 its well worth it. Why only 4 stars? horrible service, I sat at a table and had a difficult time ordering and keeping my water glass filled. but whatever the food was so great Ill defiantly  recommend it.I cant believe its taken me this long to find this place! stumbled upon this sushi restaurant while out doing some errands today and what a hidden treasure!

The popcorn scallops are amazing as well. they're little scallops deep fried and served with a wasabi ranch and honey mustard sauce. I had the all you can eat which was only $25 and that even included 2 oysters! Amazing deal especially for the quality. Ive already been 3 times in the past 3 days and Ill probably end up here at least 3-4 times a week. LOVE LOVE LOVE!Oh! and the sushi chefs are awesome. :)This was my second visit to Oyshi and it still stands strong with 4 stars! Our experience started off a bit rocky as we waited to be seated while the bar was empty? The Manager stated that we "needed to wait a few to be seated so that the Sushi Chefs can get caught up". There were two other guys who were waiting as well who told us they have been waiting 10 minutes so far to be seated. This was a Saturday so I will take that into consideration I suppose for the extra wait. Anyhow we are finally seated at the bar as we requested and are greeted about 5 minutes later by the most Awesome server named Diego. Things started to take a turn for the better thank goodness even though we did not have food for at least 25 minutes after sitting at the bar.We decided on the AYCE menu and it was lunch time on top of it so for $21.00 each we were ready to grub!This was my boyfriends first time here and I have only been once prior which was a great visit as well!All of our rolls and appetizers were spot on fresh and tasty! The service we received from server Diego was Outstanding which made our visit a real treat on top of the yummy food. At the end of our meal my boyfriend even informed the Manager of how Fantastic Diego was however he seemed preoccupied as he was rushing us out the door by saying OK , OK ,OK. Wow the same Manager that told us we would have to wait to be seated so that the Sushi Chefs can catch up. That sucks because when people go up and beyond in providing you with excellent service I really think they should be recognized and to give a Manager an employee compliment who could care less is unfortunate. Not the best of Service from the Manager however Diego our server was a Star!I took photos and labeled a few of the items we had.Oyshi used to be my favorite AYCE sushi spot.  They had a wide variety of quality rolls, great tasting food, consistent service, and a really nice atmosphere that made for a great spot to have pre-game Friday night dinner. Although the sushi is still pretty good, the service and management has gone off the deep end and because of this, I don't think I'll ever eat at Oyshi again.  There are too many quality sushi restaurants in Las Vegas to justify returning to Oyshi where the last few visits, all I seem to get are orders that never show up, drinks that never get filled, waiters that refuse to come to our table or our spot at the bar (even though it's obvious that you've seen me flag you down), and servers/staff that are increasingly bitter and unfriendly.  This stuff matters. Oddly enough, it's also the stuff that is easiest to fix. When you've already got quality menu items, quality sushi chefs, and quality sushi rolls that people rave about - why are you letting your terrible servers and management ruin your restaurant?If I'm sitting at the sushi bar and I'm trying to order more beer and sake, why are people refusing to help me out? If I want to give you my money in exchange for some-what overpriced alcohol, why does it take more than 20 minutes for someone to take my drink order and then another 20 to bring me a couple of beers and sake? This should never be an issue with a sushi restaurant.  Never. Sure, AYCE places get really busy and I totally understand that. But, if you can't handle the heat - hire more servers. I shouldn't have to wait more than 45 minutes for my order. And when my order does come out, half of it shouldn't be missing. It also shouldn't take you another 30 minutes to bring out the pieces missing from my order. And you shouldn't have an attitude with customers just because they are asking for the items they originally ordered that are missing because you either forgot to put the orders in or there was a mix up in the kitchen. I am never rude to waiters or management and this last experience at Oyshi was no exception. I was pleasant and more than patient and if I still can't get someone to so much as offer an apology for missing orders/missing drinks and for treating me like I was more of a burden than a customer bringing a lot of business to the establishment, then I will happily take my business elsewhere. Sorry, Oyshi, it was good while it lasted!I went to oyshi for lunch on a Friday and was immediately seated. The ambiance was beautiful.The food was really good with a wide selection of rolls . I love how the customize what goes on the rolls if you ask . The nigiri was really fresh but I've had better. What really stood out for me was the desserts Our server Julia was the bomb ! She was really friendly and answered all of the questions I had . Although she was quite busy , she still kept tabs on us and made sure our drinks were always full and our tables were cleared . Oyshi is definately a place you want to check out , from the food to the amazing service.I've been here too many times to not write a review.Service has always been great. Every waiter/waitress that have waited on my party and I have been attentive and polite.  We usually come here for dinner/late night. Our orders were always correct and it comes out pretty quick...I'd say within 10-15 minutes.We ALWAYS order the ATOMIC BOMB ($11). And yes...it's bomb dot com. We also order the usual spicy tuna roll. Here at Oyshi they make one of the best spicy tuna rolls. Some spicy tuna rolls are not even spicy...but here, there's a great kick to it. We've also tried other rolls like Love Affair, Heart Attack ($9-13) and a few others. Didn't really leave a lasting impression. A few days ago, we tried the JAPANESE GARLIC LASAGNA and it was yummy!!!! Soooo now I got a new roll added to my usual two.Can't wait to be back! Never disappoints! =)
Chicago Gyros=-Outstanding food.-Fries are truly addicting!-Very inexpensive prices.-Very clean.-Questionable area.-Plenty of parking.
David Burke="Iron Chef loser". That's David Burke, and I got to taste this losers food first-hand with the restaurant bearing his name, and I'd have to break it down Iron Chef style:Like the original Iron Chef, each chef can be awarded up to 20 points; -- consisting of up to 10 points for taste-- up to 5 points for plating (the appearance of their presentation)-- and up to 5 points for the originality of their dishes.Since it was New Years Eve, we did the prix fixe menu which consisted of either the 5 course ($125.00) or the 4 course meal ($95.00). TASTE:----------------------------------------------Aside from the amuse-bouche, we were also served a brioche with butter served atop a brick of Himalayan pink salt (odd, but I received this also as an Xmas gift). This wasn't that impressive in regards to flavor, so was this mainly about novelty/plating vs. taste? If this was served atop Elvis collectible plates, it would have won a couple more points for originality.This is what pissed me off the most, and I think it's what made me despise this place to some degree. It's that they served up the main dish as a "Kobe beef" dish which I really questioned at the get-go because most of the times it's not "Kobe" beef. Kobe is from the Hyogo Prefecture in Japan. Most times, this isn't what you're getting. Instead, what you get, including the place I worked at is wagyu beef, but it's usually Australian or American wagyu. We got American wagyu which is what Jay, one of our servers had stipulated to us, and if this confuses you, you can liken the naming of Kobe, like Champagne which should be called "bubbly" or hot tubs being called a "Jacuzzi". So, regardless what it's called, it sucked! It was no where near the quality or taste of Australian or Japanese wagyu. What I ate didn't taste like, and had nowhere near the marbling of the wagyu you can pick-up at Mitsuwa for some freak'n chump change ($59.99 a lb). If they would have just called it American Wagyu, than my expectations would have been lower and more appropriate, but of course it's all about the easily marketable recognition of "Kobe beef". Another sidenote: The "Himalayan salt" is actually also marketing mumbo jumbo because it's actually a product primarily from Pakistan.I already went off on the Kobe beef being called "Kobe", but I never mentioned how it was also prepared overly salted!!, and I'm a huge salt-a-holic. This one was almost so bad that we should have sent it back because they also didn't bother to trim the meat properly, so I had a decent portion of my cut that was a huge chunk of fat. Yum, I got to eat huge chunks of salty fat.... I hope it was Pakistani salt.The biggest redemption to the meal was definitely the fish dish. The roasted red pepper puree and the dish as a whole was very good, and I think everybody enjoyed this one the most. The last bit of the meal to top things off was the dessert. I'm not a huge sweets/dessert fan, but I made an exception for this dessert because I can't pass up chocolate if I do eat sweets, and the crunchy texture of the dessert was probably one of the most impressive elements of the dessert. I should also say that the scoop of ice cream wasn't chocolate. Instead, It was some funky flavor. An Iron Chef trademark.PLATING:----------------------------------------------The butter we had for the brioche was plated atop a brick of Himalayan salt that's pink in color, so it looked kind of cool, but I just thought it was such a waste if they didn't re-use the salt although I'm sure they do since salt is inherently antimicrobial.What I did enjoy was the multiple vegetable puree's that were served with the dishes including the multitude of small little veggies involved in the plating. A lot of detail, and a lot of effort were put into these dishes that were tasty and looked good. Also, they used culinary foam...ooh, aahh.ORIGINALITY:----------------------------------------------The beginning of the meal started with the amuse-bouche which is supposed to be a hint at the what's to come, but what was presented was an extremely unoriginal and extremely typical tuna tartare. After seeing that, I wasn't too optimistic on originality. I think this would be common place even in a mid-west suburban franchise.The next unoriginal dish was the spinach salad with some sort or balsamic vinaigrette which possibly consisted of some gorgonzola cheese, apple slices, and candied walnuts. This was a huge f'n let down because it was so typical. I've even prepared this sort of salad numerous times, but I include sliced red onions for my tastes, and I prefer arugula over spinach.Here's how I judged David Burke's restaurant:-- TASTE: 7-- PLATING: 3-- ORIGINALITY: 2TOTAL SCORE IS: a 12 out of a 20The total bill was $601 for 4 people with an automatic 20% tip, so whose the loser now.... ok, it's not David Burke.
Sal's Pizza=I received a rotten chicken finger and they did not do anything about it told me its fine we just got them delivered today!!!!! NO THANK YOU SALS!!!I'm bumpin' them up a star. They're pizza is consistently delicious and even the service is good. These are good guys serving a real good pie. Today I went with the meatball sub and it was money, too. Thank you Sal's. You're alright in my book.
Boulders On Broadway="White chocolate-flavored beer?"  Those were the last words I said before falling in love.  The thing is, I don't even like white chocolate.  But, as a beer, my tastebuds and my stomach were transported to the closest thing on Earth that could be referred to as Heaven.I'm exaggerating, but not very much.  It's like saying, "A gajillion!" when the actual number is 753 quadrillion.Their other beers are great, too.  You can always ask, "Hey, what's new here?" and they'll go through an exhaustive list.  Ask them what their new favorite is and you'll get something amazing.The food is not only nothing special, I don't even recommend going there with food in mind.  It's not terrible but it's really just not that good.  They have a chicken pesto sandwich that's alright, but generally, I would say, come here after you already ate and stick to beer.The service is great.  They're always, always as nice as can be without being Ned Flanders about it.  If I ever saw someone being a dick to one of the help, I'd probably lose my shit and go Tony Soprano on 'em.I saw Barack Obama's acceptance speech here, the vice presidential debate between Biden and Palin and the first half of the Super Bowl.  This is sort of like my second home, only maybe a little bit better because there's more than one toilet.
The Bagel Cafe=What's a good way to start Saturday Morning in Las Vegas....Bagels and Starbucks! The breakfast bagels came with cream cheese and we probably got about a dozen bagels. The bagels were tasty, definitely a little hard on the outside but still good. Got the bagels and headed to the Starbucks drive though :)New York Style Deli's are a touchy subject with me.  When done right, they are like staring into the face of God and having him smile back you and say "You are my most precious creation" but when done wrong, they make me sadder than Pauly Shore's acting career.  The Bagel is in the former category and can easily lay claim to best delicatessen in Las Vegas.Judge a Jewish deli by five things:  The rye bread, the pastrami, the knish, the sweet & sour cabbage soup and if they sell the black & white cookie.  Alright, that last one might be homage to Seinfeld, but the other 4 will definitely tell you if a Deli is worth it's salt.  The Bagel has them down.  First, the rye bread is fresh and the perfect consistency.  Its got a nice crust and the heels are a perfect complement to any of their soups or sandwiches.  Speaking of soups, their sweet & sour cabbage soup is dynamite.  Chocked full of cabbage and with a simple beef bouillon to absorb the flavors, its a nice lunch on a cold day...to remind you of back home in Jersey.  The pastrami is like butter and practically melts in your mouth and if you want to get fancy, upgrade to a Reuben.  Finally the Knish....where do I began?  You are so good, I'm officially declaring myself on "a gravy train with knish wheels."  So you're probably wondering why no five stars?  Well, the Bagel is excellent but I cant dis the original gangsta deli's like Brent's in LA, Manny's in Chicago or Katz's in New York by putting it on the same level so consider the Bagel 4 1/2 stars as it pays homage to the grand masters.  For Las Vegas however, you can't do any better.  Ohhh, and you're probably wondering why I never even brought up their namesake as well.  Bagels here are good, but bagels are bagels.  They do have an impressive selection and to go is available if you're not dining in.  They also have a bakery that would make my Bubby declare this place "Meshugganah!" the portions are so large....I like Italian cookies so, when East Coast peeps such as Mario S and John F kept checking in and posting pictures of goodies from this place, I had to make it my mission to go here.  It must be legit.You seat yourself and read the menu that looks like a newspaper then the server takes your order. For anything to-go, you have to go to the deli/bakery line.I had such a sugar rush when I ate half a pound of the rainbow cookies. Those treats with the colors of the Italian flag that tastes like almond with apricot jam in each layer and chocolate on top. They're so good I couldn't stop myself from eating them.  I easily spent $56 on rainbow cookies, raspberry rugulach, apple rugulach, black and white cookies, Florentine cookies, linzers, etc.  Their eggs benedict was also yummy.  Great Hollandaise sauce (consistency and flavor).  It comes with potatoes.  I also tried their cheese blintzes with strawberries.  Each blintz was fully stuffed with sweet cream cheese filling.  I could only eat 1.They also have sandwiches, matzoh ball soup, salmon, white fish, etc. on their menu. Bagels and schmear, meats, monster-sized cupcakes, 7-layer cake, carrot cake, etc in the bakery/deli. I wish I would have known about this place a long time ago so I could have fed the doctors at work more variety of Kosher treats.  But at the same time, I'm glad I didn't know about this place a long time ago, otherwise, I would be 200lbs heavier by now!Born and raised in New York the warm and soft bagel is a part of my heritage. It seemed that I would have to board the Concorde if I was to have a New York bagel in a reasonable time. That was until I stepped foot in the Bagel Cafe.  The Bagel Cafe is a slice of the Big Apple approximately ten miles northwest of NY-NY in the Summerlin community of Las Vegas. The four times that I have had breakfast here in very recent times, my mind literally left Vegas and entered a New York bagel restaurant. As soon as I stepped on line, displayed right to my left were Wise Potato chips. Wise Potato chips are a popular brand of potato chips that are extremely popular in New York, but sold in a few places in Vegas :( . When I looked to the right, standing out from the display cases of cookies were the rainbow cookies. Since leaving New York, I have rarely laid eyes on them in Las Vegas. The closest rainbow cookies that I have seen to Las Vegas were at Chompie's Deli in Phoenix. After being seated sitting in front of me was the warm and soft bagel. Three times, I ordered egg salad on a bagel and once a BLT on the warm and soft bagel. The quality was superb. The bagel sandwich was overflowing with egg salad that was topped off with lettuce, onions, and a tomato. The BLT was the antithesis of the pathetic BLT that I recently ordered at Panera Bread. It was overflowing with crunchy beacon. With each sandwich, I ordered potato salad and coffee. The coffee tasted just as good as the bagel shops that I remembered before Starbuck's came on the scene. In actuality, the coffee is just as good as Starbuck's.  Just like New York, the Bagel Cafe is crowded. Parking is a challenge, and it is almost guaranteed that some walking is required. The Bagel Cafe is located in a professional park on the west side of Buffalo Drive south of the Summerlin Parkway. Unlike the New York City landmarks, it blends in with the professional buildings. On account of the parking lot being linear with the popularity of the Bagel Cafe, each time I had to walk the distance of two professional buildings (not complaining. I went here before hikes). On weekends, there was a wait. The Bagel Cafe is relatively large and the weekend waits were no longer than 15 minutes. On the other hand, it was less crowded on a Wednesday at 1 p.m., and the "Please Wait to Be Seated" sign was turned around to "Please seat yourself."  The Bagel Cafe differentiates from the prices of the New York bagel shops that I know of in New York. Unless inflation at the New York Bagel shops went up in double digits, the Bagel Cafe prices seem steeply higher than those of the bagel shops that I remembered. From my experiences here, it is the Waitresses that can make and break the price. The first two times that I had my New York moments here, the sweet Waitress passed on a tip that if you order a sandwich on a bagel instead of bread (Did not come here for bread) that you get a full sandwich for the price of a half sandwich. Fast forward to the last two times, and the impersonal Waitress was charging me for the full sandwich (check with tip came to around $15). But what could I do?  It would still be far less expensive than flying in a Concorde to New York.  If you grew up with the New York bagel, or are just a fan of it; I recommend the Bagel Cafe. On the four visits that I visited Bagel Cafe, I have made it a point to stop by on the way to a park. Admittedly I planned to hike in a nearby park a couple of those times with the excuse to check-in here. I am so confident that I will get in a mood for the New York Bagel. With that said, I see Bagel Cafe check-ins in my future.****Please note that there are other establishments using the Bagel Cafe name or similar to it. The one in the Sun Coast I rated 2 stars.I'm updating my review due to the extremely RUDE manager on duty on Easter! I placed an order for pick up early on Sunday to have picked up at two. I ordered four meals and several pastries from the case. When I was checking out I mentioned that I was to get a side and bagel option with the Benedict I ordered, per their menu online(see picture). Two girls told me no before they asked the manager, Jeremy/Jerry. Who said no but go a head and give it to her, I said thank you. He proceeds to get a menu to point it out. I said ok just to let you know your menu online says that all eggs and omelet dishes come with a choice of sides stated and a bagel. (All in the same section of the Benedict's). He said it comes with an English muffin but I'm not going to make a big deal out of a bagel and that he's never had anyone ask for the bagel. I don't respond because I know better and he agreed to give me the bagel. But I think to myself well I understand that a Benedict comes with an English muffin, I'm not stupid but the menu didn't state a bagel for a substitute. The girl ringing me out said oh the online menu? Well what this guy doesn't know is that I've worked in and managed places very similar to this and I know when a cashier is sympathizing with a customer. They obviously have had this complaint before also by the way he immediately got defensive. So I pay $75 AND tip (not to mention the $8.25 for a "large" side of fruit that was a mere pint) and we leave. As were walking out the door I hear ma'am, like I've forgotten a bag. Ha nope! It's the manager coming outside to argue some more. (My BF said after we left that when he came out the manager said I didn't want to argue with you inside....uhhh how about not at all) He tries to speak but I say to the BF let's go and he starts going on and on and I walk around the BF to walk away and the manager says "ridiculous" as he's wailing back in. Ummmm NNO!!! I turn around, open the door and say that was uncalled for and walked away. He comes out again and says next time you can get a bagel instead of the English muffin. Well Manager of the Year, there won't be a next time!! Ok so! So many things wrong with this!! First of all a manager following me outside to argue with a customer!!! Outside!! Over a bagel!!! You seriously have nothing better to do? I never had time to do that when I was a manager nor was it something I wished to do and seek out. He was so mad about giving me a bagel he steamed over it and still felt he hadn't said enough! Second, let me inform some of you who might not know...those bagels you pay $2.00 and then some only cost about $.25 to make. Hmmm customer comes to my store spends $75, makes a valid point about what your crappy online menu says, give $.25 bagel to make customer happy. Most restaurant managers know the common sense in that! I seriously couldn't say enough about this! Uncalled for. Unprofessional. A frequent customer is now a nonexistent. I'm not happy about refusing to have their pastries!! But not worth giving any more of my money to them!!I have been back several times before writing this review update just to make sure all the inconsistency that I have been experiencing is now the way of Bagel Cafe and not just an off day they were having. I'm prepared for the loyal fixtures to be upset, but if you really have been eating here since it opened then you know it's not the same. I first started eating here at Bagel Cafe (I was a teenager) after it opened. It was worth the long wait to get a table as the food was spot on excellent. Sure we all know the best breakfast in town is at the Omelet House on Charleston, but this place definitely came close behind at one point. In the last 6 months I have experienced meals here at Bagel Cafe that were just not worth the money or wait for what you got. They don't even use Boar's Head deli meats anymore! WTH?!?!?!? They use some brand I have never heard of. The taste and quality of the deli meat just isn't the same as it used to be. They claim the bagels are made fresh daily yet they are rock hard. I have never liked the bagels here, but if it's in your name.... live up to it!As you can tell from my previous review and pictures, I really used to like this place. Consistency is a major issue. The sandwiches used to be made with Boar's Head deli meat and was piled high between the bread of your choice and a real winner. Now you get some other brand of meat just bunched up in a ball between 2 dry pieces of bread. I can do that at home! Then there is breakfast. I usually order breakfast here. The last 3 times the coffee has tasted bitter and nasty. Getting a refill was a major chore as well. I noticed the servers didn't have name tags on my last visit or I would give a proper shout-out to the waitress who has messed up my order lately and has terrible customer service. I ordered "One Egg any style W/Bacon" priced at $8.95 and asked for eggs to be scrambled with shredded cheddar cheese on top. Such a simple breakfast right? Apparently not For Bagel Cafe. The breakfast also came with a bagel of my choice and breakfast potatoes. When my food arrived I noticed there was a slice of cheddar cheese on my eggs. UGH! If you don't have shredded cheese just let the customer know so they can maybe make another choice. I would have had the egg over medium or easy to dunk my bacon in if I had known. The "Asiago" bagel I had was so tough and hard!  I was with another yelper one of my last visits and showed him how I was able to bang the bagel on the table and it just broke in pieces.  The bacon was terrible. From the picture it looks heavenly, but let me tell you it was rock hard and seemed like it was honestly pulled from the fridge or something. When my meal arrived the bacon was missing, so I informed our waitress and she replies to me "oh did you want bacon?" to which I'm like HELL YES why would I have ordered a breakfast that comes with it if I didn't want it? She then brings me the cold/hard bacon and when the receipt comes she charged me $3.50 for a side of bacon. Seriously? It was supposed to come with the breakfast I ordered. She made me feel like I had done something wrong when she actually is a very lousy waitress. The potatoes I had were the only thing edible on the plate and even those aren't the same potatoes as they have had in the past. With this place not being consistent and having waitresses who can't do their job right, I'm going to  BabyStacks Cafe and Omelet House from now on for breakfast and will make the drive to Henderson to eat at Weiss.Great deli just off Summerlin freeway at Buffalo.  Been coming here for years and decided it's time to give them the props they deserve. I'd probably give this NY style deli 4.5 starts but since I can't they don't necessarily deserve a full 5 star rating.Let's go with the good then I'll drop my tiny bomb on the bad.  The food is high quality and always fresh.  They have amazing breakfast that nearly all come with a bagel and one of their amazing cream cheeses.  Love the scallion cream cheese.  Lunch is crazy good and HUGE!  They offer gigantic salads all with fresh produce, meats and cheeses.  The also offer great dinner specials.  Today we had a tuna melt that was made with great tasting tuna salad and fries.  We also had a cabbage roll that was served with a cup of soup and of course a bagel with cream cheese.  Loved it all!Parking isn't an issue as there is plenty of it.  The place is always packed but there is never a long wait so don't fret!  The biggest negative is the staff and their "I don't give a shit if you're the customer" mentality.  They kids act like their stuff doesn't stink (imo).  Anyway great food and will be back as I can get over the negative...We stopped in here the morning of the 2nd for breakfast and I ordered a café mocha and the pastrami omelet with provolone, and my Mr. ordered the two egg breakfast with bacon.  I was really jonesing for this breakfast because I'd never been to a place that will put pastrami (and some of the other deli meats) in an omelet.  It just sounded good, you know?  The omelet was great.  The pastrami was really tender and full of flavor.  My home fries were not warm and tasted like they had been sitting around for awhile.  Same goes for my husband's breakfast, which also had his eggs scrambled, not sunny side up.  He always orders sunny side up.  I didn't even notice because I was digging into my tasty pastrami.  He opted not to have it corrected and just helped me eat my omelet.  The mocha tasted like watery hot chocolate and was really disappointing at $4.50.  One of us ordered a chocolate chip bagel with regular cream cheese and the bagel was very nice and chewy.  Really enjoyed that even though there were no discernible chocolate chips in it.Other than the omelet and the bagel, there's really nothing that was good about our breakfast.  The atmosphere was very noisy.  On one side I had a loud talker blaring in my ear his expertise about car tires, and on the other we had a little poopster who had probably just learned to pull herself up and stand and look around.  She also enjoyed pulling on my husband's shirt and ear.  Not cute or cool.  I wish the people who shot out that kid were paying a little more attention to her.  I would go back again and try some of their other items.  Maybe it was just a bad day.  Our total after tax, before tip, was $31.08 and it was just not a good 30-dollar breakfast.  However, I trust my Yelp buddy, Loon E.'s opinion, so next time I'll have to try the whitefish salad.  Maybe that will elevate my next review.I cannot believe that I've never written a review for The Bagel Cafe.  I have dined here well over a dozen times since I moved to Vegas.  They offer the closest thing to New York bagels that I have found in LV.  Both their breakfast and lunch menus have so many delectable choices that remind me of the East Coast.  The line for a table is almost always long, but worth the wait. They also have limited counter seating.Recently,  I have enjoyed the Matzo Ball Soup, which is chock full of large pieces of carrot, celery, onion, and chicken in addition to a fluffy matzo ball.  A cure for what ails you (or just a tasty soup).  The chicken salad platter- a large scoop of chicken salad, two sides, pickle spears and veggies to make a sandwich with your bread or bagel choice.  The chicken salad is what I would call 'traditional style', no fruit, nuts, or other surprise items mixed with the chicken and celery.On recent breakfast trips, we've enjoyed the fantastic Potato Pancake with applesauce and sour cream.  Definitely a welcome reminder of Jewish delis back home.  A huge portion of biscuits and gravy with eggs and bacon and some of their omelets.  We always seem to walk out with a bag from their bakery case too. Not sure how this keeps happening. ;-)  We freeze most of the bagels and they taste just as good after we take them out.  The cheesecake, carrot cake, cookies, and all the other bakery items we've tried have all been well above par.Items Selected:CoffeeVanilla Crumb CakeBlackberry MuffinCinnamon RollBlack & White CookieButtermilk PancakesMalted Waffle with Strawberries and JamChallah French ToastCheese Blintzes with Sourcream and JamCorned Beef Hash with Overeasy Eggs and Everything BagelOnly visited once in the past, but a place to which several others have been referred when craving a good local deli, it was in reminiscing of Langer's a week prior that breakfast was enjoyed at The Bagel Cafe, certainly not the landmark sort of place found in Los Angeles but a very good meal at a fair price just the same.Laid out with a grab n' go area, bakery, and deli near the door as a spacious but tightly packed dining room fills the rear it was just after 8am on a Friday that our party of five entered and with family getting seated while I perused the pastry case it was mere moments before the menu was navigated; orders placed and rather weak coffee poured.Perhaps the youngest people in the place, my 60+ year old mother included, it was not long before pastry selections arrived tableside, the daily muffin and huge slice of crumb cake each buttery soft  while a warm cinnamon roll was unfortunately a bit overbaked, the black and white cookie fluffy and thick although frosting tasted a bit artificial.Moving onward to mains, the kitchen expediting orders at breakneck pace with  the dining room 2/3 full, it was with faux-Maple syrup cast aside in favor of the real stuff from home that French Toast, Pancakes and Waffles were gilded, the last a flavorless disaster when compared to the textbook alternatives; the the hash simply not my style and the blitzes failing to live up to the high standards set by Langer's and innumerable others.    Slipping a bit since my first visit, perhaps an effect of such a large crowd or perhaps a result of me overrating the place based on excellent ordering the first time around, The Bagel Cafe remains a competent spot for those craving Deli foods or what is still, in my view, the best bagel in Sin City.
Great Harvest Bread Company=I should have ran, (not walked), in the other direction when I saw the word "Bread". Chocolate chip cookies are a weakness of mine, and, oh - what's this? Pumpkin Chocolate Chip Bread? With butter? That is a recipe for self-destruction! Everything in moderation, right? Nope. It seems like the logic part of my brain shuts down whenever there are cookies around me. My only purpose at that point in time would be to consume every cookie in site! (My motto in life should be, "No cookie left behind".) The Monster Cookie, (with the M&M's), does it to me all the time. The sandwiches are excellent - especially the Spicy Turkey Pepperjack on five-grain bread, and the B-L-T-riffic. 2 more favorites - the Savannah Bar and the White Chocolate Blueberry Bread - soooo good! On the days that I want to over-indulge, Great Harvest Bread Company is my first and only stop!Every Christmas marks the time that I venture over to Great Harvest for gifts of baked goods.  I usually go to the location on Marks in Henderson because it's near my job, but this store is actually closer to where I live.  The best thing about Great Harvest?  The free slice of bread you can get when you step inside a store, with butter if you want it; of course I want the butter!  I love bread, but I can't come here as much as I'd like or I wouldn't fit through their door before too long.  I like their products as gifts because everyone I've ever gifted their goods to has loved them, as well.  The cinnamon crunch bread is one of my favorites, but I also love the pumpkin chocolate chip loaf.  The cookies that they sell are a nice, big size with the snickerdoodle ones a fave, too.  If you ever need a carb fix, stop here and get yours.
Firehouse Subs=This was my first trip to a Firehouse Subs, and I liked what I discovered here.  I ordered a Medium Firehouse 'Hero" Sub sporting hot Virginia Ham, roast beef, turkey, Smoked Provolone, tomatoes, lettuce, White Onion, and oil & vinegar on a warm Wholewheat Roll, along with Miss Vickie's Sea Salt & Vinegar packaged Potato Chips.  The vegetables were all fresh, meats juicy from application of vinegar & oil, and cheese nicely melted over the meats.  Service was friendly.  And the atmosphere was nice and casual.  A Rat Pack fire crew wall painting was rather cool.  And, diners were seated at Dalmatian spotted wooden tables.  How fitting for a firehouse ambiance!  I expect to be back.Yet another good sandwich shop in town. They always give my grandson a fire hat. Only drawback is they serve Coke products. Sandwiches are good, recommend the hook & ladder or the corned beef. Comfortable seating and clean surroundings.
ENVY The Steakhouse=I rolled into Vegas late one night and arrived at the Renaissance Hotel.  My companion and I debated where we should eat and finally settled on Envy for two reasons:  it was There and it was Easy.  We weren't expecting much.  Wow...were we surprised!We were seated at a large booth surrounded by lusty red and brown tones.  A single red rose head beckoned from a square, glass vase.  Candles glittered and set a romantic tone.  Too bad I was there on business!We began the meal with a half bottle of an Estancia Meritage and split the Caesar salad.  We then went on to devour perfectly prepared filet mignons, truffled mac and cheese and port wine mushrooms.  It was sheer heaven!  The flavors were robust and delicious!  We also had several choices of how to have our meat prepared.  I chose to have mine charred on the outside, red on the inside.  My companion had her filet in a Bearnaise sauce.  Both were excellent.Then it was time for dessert.  Since we couldn't settle on just one, they made it easy for us with the Chef's trio.  We had miniature versions of the New York cheesecake with raspberry sauce, cappuccino mousse and a chocolate souffle cake.  We paired these with a chocolate port and an ice wine.  The restaurant was kind enough to also give us a complimentary glass of Sauternes.  They knew the way to our hearts! We left Envy feeling elated.  It was complete food euphoria!  When we came back a couple of weeks later, we immediately put in our reservation for the first night we were there.  Envy has become one of our "must dine" places in Vegas.Saving the best review for last and what a way to wrap up our Vegas adventure.We have been eating at a lot of high end steakhouses this year. I knew we wanted to go to a fancy place to celebrate my guy's birthday and since we were staying at The Renaissance and after reading the stellar reviews of this restaurant on Yelp, I knew this would be the restaurant for us. All of the room service at this hotel comes from this restaurant as well, so I had a feeling the meal would be good-I just had no idea as to how good.The menu is creative. Everything like most high end steak houses is a la carte. Kevin started with the roasted tomato soup with fried Jarlsberg(his favorite) cheese. It was light and tasty. I had the spinach salad with pancetta, fried goat cheese and a bacon balsamic reduction. Both of these were a fabulous start to our meal and what we both appreciated was the size of these were perfect. Not too big, not too small. Kev ordered the surf and turf (you get to choose which surf and turf) and he went with seared scallops and a petite fillet. I had the bone-in rib-eye steak and we opted for the lobster macaroni as our side (there were several we wanted but knew it would be too much food). Our waiter recommended the creamed corn, but we still went with the macaroni. Upon the arrival of our food, I was awe stricken at the presentation. Simple and elegant. My steak was perfectly charred on the outside and pink on the inside. Tender and flavorful, I closed my eyes and was taken back to a wonderful childhood memory of an old-time steakhouse in Phoenix called Durant's. I cannot remember the last time I had a steak this wonderful. Kev really loved his meal and said it was better than that of his last summer at Bradley Ogden and might even be better than Fleming's. The lobster macaroni was perfectly balanced in flavor with just enough lobster to cheese to pasta ratio. When I told our server how happy we were with the macaroni, he went to the kitchen and brought us out a small sample of the creamed corn. I hate to admit this, but dang, that was probably the most delicious sample of anything I have ever tasted. It was made with fresh roasted corn, bacon and a hint of cheese. To end our meal, our waiter brought Kevin a banana bread pudding (which was incredible) with caramel gelato and cashew brittle. He even had Happy Birthday written in caramel on the plate.Our server was fantastic. He treated us like royalty and even comped a second glass of wine and our dessert. After our disastrous meal at earlier in the week at Ruth Chris in Walnut Creek, I was overwhelmed with joy.Highly recommended. Take the time, take the taxi and make reservations on OpenTable.com and get to this fabulous restaurant!Did you say, a $75 gift certificate for $9?  5 types of mac & cheese? SOLD! Our reservation was for 9:30 pm and arrived on time to a near empty restaurant.  Once we walked into the lobby of the Renaissance my fiance (wow that's weird to say) says to me, "is this place open?"  I was nervous that we were the only ones there but there were a few other tables.  Phew!  I took the pleasure in purchasing via Restaurant.com a $75 gift certificate for $9. Ah, yeah...$9!!!  What a deal!  The catch was we had to spend $150 (includes alcohol!)  to have the GC apply.  No problem!  Food:*Surf & Turf - a GIANT 19 oz. bone in Rib Eye with scallops.  Very very tender & juicy rib eye cooked medium rare (woot woot!) served with three succulent scallops all cooked to perfection.  *Bourbon Creamed Corn.OMG.  Serious goodness here!  The best creamed corn I have ever tasted.  Ever!  (better than Lawry's....shhhh you didn't hear me say that!)*Bacon and Gruyere Mac & Cheese.One word....WOW!Drink:*Bottle of Red S. Australian wine.  Perfect.The only complaint we had was that we knew we would fill up fast.  We both slapped our tummies and psyched them into a few extra bites.  Food = great.  Decor = beautiful and comfortable Service =  unpretentiousTIPs:  1. If you cab it here, make sure to get his card so you can call him to pick you up.  There's not much activity here so set up your ride beforehand.  2. Check out Restaurant.com's site and sign up for their emails.  They had a sale over the weekend for 80% off so you can score a $75 GC for $6!  Who can say no to that?ENVY The Steakhouse has always been a restaurant we passed by, heard about, but never really thought about dining at.  Sure, we heard amazing things about this place, but it's another steakhouse in Vegas.  We finally took advantage of their restaurant.com coupon and had a cozy dinner for two.First up - I made reservations on OpenTable.com and requested we sit side by side.  Although I do note this in the reservation, it's rarely and sometimes noticed and acknowledged.  In this case, the booth had two settings specifically set up side by side.  Nice!After a slight delay, we got our beverages and menus.  It wasn't too hard to decide.  We barely made a dent in our warm bread and butter when our entrees arrived.* Bone-In Ribeye, 17 oz with Wild Mushroom Sauce ($45)* Bone-In Ribeye, 17 oz with Brandied-Pink  Peppercorn Sauce ($45)Both orders came with garlic mashed potatoes and roasted seasonal vegetables.  One thing I appreciated from our waiter (Joshua) was that he told us that we probably had enough food without ordering sides.  And this is usually the part where they push the sides on you, but not in this case.  And he was so right!  The 17 oz is a big piece of beef, and there's really not a whole lot of room left for much else.The steaks were perfectly cooked rare, and tender and tasty!  So tasty that we didn't even bother with our respective signature sauces that came with it.  Rather, we didn't even care for the sauces at all.  The meat was flavorful all on its own and that's what you call a good piece of beef!  Of course, half the fun is experimenting with their three salts and seeing which one goes best with your dish.The garlic mashed potatoes were also good, and the roasted seasonal vegetables also had a good mix of veggies which surprised us.  Different kinds of squash, beets, and mushrooms were part of it.Overall, we were pleasantly surprised with the quality of service and food.  Service was top notch and the food had us interested in the rests of their menu.  Of course, coupons definitely help in this department.4.5 stars.Went here for lunch today to meet a colleague.  I ordered the Burger with Cheddar Cheese & Jalapenos with a side of Fries.  The food came out fast and as ordered.The Burger was good....not great.  The Fries were outstanding.  The service was good and my meeting went well.Overall it was a good experience, but for $14 I've had better Burgers.Will I return?  I usually have business lunches here because of it's proximity to the Strip & Convention Center.....so I will probably return.  I wouldn't take the family here for dinner....just not good enough for the price in my opinion.Really? I had to make reservations for this place? Because on a Saturday night over Labor Day, this Envy The Steakhouse was completely dead. There was one other table in there. When we left, there were maybe 5. We had a restaurant.com coupon, so thank goodness we didn't pay full price for this place, because I would've rather taken my money to Fleming's.Our waiter was this super mellow guy, and was really nice. He did pay attention to details because he knew we didn't want ice in our water and made sure he didn't accidentally pour it in when it came to refills. It's the little things.Well, the big thing was the price. We ordered the 10 oz. filet mignon to share between us for $45 and paid a $5 split plate charge. $45?? Are you kidding me?? We started with the gnocchi which had wild mushrooms and parmesan fondue, which was pretty good. We also ordered the steamed broccolini. The steak was definitely not worth the money, because the outside was cooked to a slight crisp (not a problem for me because I like a bit of char), but the inside ranged from well-cooked on the sides, to cold red center, which is not good. A well-cooked filet, ordered medium rare, is a cool pink throughout. What I also didn't like was that they cut the steak in half for us and brought it out on two plates, just because we split it. Well, it probably didn't get to cook enough since you cut the sucker open, and it got colder by the time you brought it to the table. What was good was that your entree comes with a small crock of mashed potatoes and roasted season vegetables, which was yummy. That's a nice addition, considering most steak places just give you a steak, a la carte. They had forgotten the steamed broccolini and didn't bring it out until we asked for it. We had a wine from their seven for seven list, which was pretty good for $7. The ambience was very hotel/steakhouse-like. I still felt like I was in a hotel, and I thought the decor was trying a bit hard to be on a more upscale than what it really was. At least I didn't have to dress up to eat here. They didn't balk at my track suit jacket I had with me because I was too lazy to pack anything dressy for the trip. So glad we didn't pay full price for it. It was barely worth it even with the coupon. I do not have steak ENVY.I was first impressed with the birthday card the restaurant had the hostess give me when we came in. Our Open Table reservation mentioned our celebration, and they shined at making me feel special with that thoughtful gesture.Our waiter was very informed and enthusiastic about the wine selection. We shared a bottle of a special house wine that was very tasty and went well with our meal.My Love and I shared the spinach salad with goat cheese, pancetta, warm bacon-balsamic vinaigrette with bacon on top. It was really good, and a very interesting flavor. Our friends shared the Caesar salad with romaine leaves, white anchovy, and black pepper croutons, and both agreed it was the best Caesar salad they've ever had.The four of us did the best style of eating, what I call tag-team eating, where we order two different items and share, so we can try more dishes. Our party ordered two of each of the:-17 oz. Bone-In Rib Eye-Chilean Sea BassThe rib-eye was absolutely delicious. It wasn't just large. It was large, tender, well-seasoned, and well-grilled.The sea bass just melted like butter in your mouth. It was so good!The sides were good, too. The roasted seasonal vegetables were fresh and seasoned with rosemary. The garlic mashed potatoes were smooth and satisfying.My friends shared a dessert, the bittersweet chocolate lava cake with pistachio ice cream and mint sauce (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Fy4t2XHIRKwMk_ocCZze0Q?select=bzRDV05eD7MojFn3rnRsWQ). They loved it.Service was sporadic, but it seemed intended so that we could enjoy our experience, not just dine and dash.Overall, we had a great dinner experience, and I'd love to come back another time. The discounted GC from restaurant.com really helped with making this special meal more affordable, and because I love savings, I enjoyed this experience more because of it.TRUFFLE FRIES!!!Yes I have been on a binge for truffle fries, I blame the Four Seasons in Las Vegas for introducing me to them, now if I see them on a menu, I have to order them!The truffle fries here were GOOD! and worth the $9. Spice-Seared Ahi Tuna with the Sesame-Seaweed Salad, Pacific Rim Sauce - $16 - pricy for what you get but never the less tasty!I had the Warm Spinach salad with Goat Cheese Croquette, Pancetta, Warm Bacon-Balsamic Vinaigrette - 4.5 stars!Ambience is nice and service is pretty good too.Review for Spring Restaurant Week 2012 menu:I went to Envy tonight for the last night of Restaurant Week for this spring.  The choices were limited which is to be expected for a RW menu.  The bread basket was quite nice with slices of French bread, white chocolate walnut bread, and some breadsticks. Course 1:  I opted for the Butternut Squash Soup with brown sugar croutons.  This was excellent!  When I took some soup with a crouton, I had both a somewhat sweet taste mixed with the flavor of the squash.  Truly inspired thinking on the part of the chef to come up with this combination.Before Course 2, my server, Joshua, brought me a small triple dish that had sea salts from different parts of the world.  The white was from Australia, the black from Hawaii, and the pink was Murray River salt.  He urged me to try the salt but to use care because it can be overdone.  It was fun trying the different flavors with pieces of steak.  Australian was my favorite.Course 2:  Of course I chose the filet mignon.  Why get salmon at a steak house?  The steak was anchored on some very thin slices of sweet potato.  The steak was cooked correctly.  I ordered it black and blue and it almost was.  Done a bit more than I like because it wasn't blue enough.Course 3:  There was no choice here but who needed one?  RW dessert is triple chocolate lava cake.  It was outstanding.  The chocolate was rich.  It was also bittersweet chocolate which was a good choice to keep the overall sweetness in check.  There was a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top.  Great end to the meal.A couple of things prevent me from giving a higher rating.  I'm not sure if the bread was warmed in a microwave but it seemed that way.  When I decided to have a second slice of that wonderful white chocolate walnut, it had dried quickly and had a bit of a crust on it.  This doesn't happen with fresh bread unless it's microwaved for heating.  As mentioned before, the steak was a little too done for me.  Finally, as another reviewer noted, you have to take into account the beautiful surroundings, the good service, and the portion size vis à vis the price and Envy comes up a bit short.  I realize this is an RW menu, but when comparing it to other places I went during Restaurant Week, Envy couldn't compare with some of the others.The service was excellent.    Joshua, was very knowledgable and helpful.  Props to Chef Michael for stopping by the table to chat with me and ask for feedback about the meal.  This was a good experience, but I'm not sure if I'd return.  I checked the regular menu and I'm sure my wife would be happier where her choices were more numerous.This is my 100th review and I am glad I can use it for a place that deserves this recognition and honor. :-)I've eaten here twice by now and both times we used the $100 restaurant.com coupon. In fact, that's how we found the place. We wanted to find a new place and looked at restaurant.com for restaurants for our Vegas trip. This place had great reviews, so we picked it.Our experience was so wonderful the first time last year that we went back this year again.I just can't say enough good things about this restaurant. The decor, the lighting, in other words, your first impression is already up for a good start. Everything is beautiful, warm and subtle, including the menus. Their wine list is simply amazing! They have all varietals you'd like for every budget. Josh is very knowledgeable about wine and has great recommendations. He even let us taste a couple selections by the glass as we were hesitant what to get. He gets good reviews here and I can vouch for that. He's very professional, yet friendly and funny, amazingly helpful and simply charming. The first time, after we decided what we wanted to eat, I noticed that at the bottom of the menu they were offering a 3-course tasting menu for a discounted price and it had exactly what we wanted. I can't remember what exactly they were, but I know I had the sae bass and my roommate had the steak and everything was just wonderful.This time last month, we had the oven roasted, stuffed tomato. My roommate doesn't like tomatoes, but I ordered it for myself and we still shared it and he loved it. In fact, after dinner he said that the stuffed tomato was probably the best dish that night.Since I don't eat red meat, I ordered the sea bass again, but it never disappoints. It's always perfect, tenderly juicy yet flaky, just wonderful. The shiitake mushroom and asparagus garnish is also very flavorfully prepared. I had the New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc with my fish. My roommate had the 10 oz. Filet Mignon and he loved it. They 3 different salts they give you are all amazing. I just used it on my bread. But one of them (can't remember which) really goes well with the steak. He had a Syrah that he just loved.You would think that the portions are not that great, but with a 3-course meal, you really get stuffed.We ordered 2 desserts and they were also just mouthwateringly wonderful. I wish I could have ordered one of each of the desserts, but I couldn't have eaten them all,  but any desserts we had there was both time amazing.I can't remember the names of the two ladies who helped Josh out, but they were also delightful. As I said earlier, I can't praise this place enough. Both times, everything was top notch. The food, the wine, the service, everything.I can't understand why this place is not more crowded (we actually like this fact). :-)Anyway, do yourself a favor. When you're in Vegas, try Envy. You will not regret it.Haven't been back in over 5 years and the menu is pretty much the same.  The Travelzoo deal they currently offer (pay $80 for $149 worth of food/alcohol) made a revisit a total no brainer.  The restaurant's appearance even looks about the same.  There's lots of red décor and the bigger rooms were curtained off since there were less than 10 tables being used.  There's good value to be had at Envy.  Most appetizers were less than $15 and all the entrees include mashed potatoes and sautéed brussel sprouts with bacon.  But when armed with the deal I had, it was all about the $55 "Grand Seafood Plateau".  Lobster, prawns, oysters, mussels, clams, king crab legs....is it possible to get high off of seafood?  I think I did!  Everything was super fresh.  The prawns were enormous, lobster was tender, and I really liked the added garlic to the clams.  This would cost at least 30% more on the strip.  All the sides we had were excellent.  There was a plethora of lobster in their version of this mac and cheese staple.  This was a highlight of dinner and a ridiculous steal for only $7.  We also had the wild mushroom medley and grilled asparagus.  Our friendly server, Nicki, must have seen several takeout boxes in our future.  I was least impressed with the steak.  The 12oz bone in filet was 3 stars at best.  Even though $44 was a reasonable price for this type of cut, there are too many great steaks options in LV to say this was any more than passable.  I might not even order steak on my next visit.  The staff raved about the "Envy Signature Sea Bass" as many Yelpers have so I might give that a shot.  Their "Grilled Pesto Prawns" and "Vegetarian Oven Roasted Stuffed Tomato" also caught my eye.  Entrees like these would be totally ignored at any other steak restaurant, yet Envy might only really be a "steakhouse" in name.  The steaks only take up small bit of their menu while so much of it is non-beef.       They would be a clear nominee if there were ever a "Best of LV" category for "Steakhouse for people that don't like steak".  3.79394278797982938641112493 stars.  Round up!Menu:http://www.renaissancelasvegas.com/dining/envy-steakhouse.htmCelebrating Valentine's belatedly, my fella and I ended up at Envy Steakhouse. The restaurant was pretty empty when we arrived around 7pm on a Thursday evening. We ordered the tomahawk chop, lobster mac & cheese and the bourbon creamed corn. The steak was just ok, a little on the gristly side. My expectations were low, but I had hoped for a little more from the steak. The flavors were a little lacking for me and the steak had a glaze that I found unappealing. The sides were decent. My favorite was the creamed corn, which was sweet and creamy without being watery.Our server was so attentive and sweet, she really went above and beyond. She even made sure that they presented the entire tomahawk so I could get a picture before they took it back to slice it up for us. I don't see myself going back any time soon, but it is a decent location close to the convention center.
Rosati's Pizza=There was mold on my daughters pizza. I called and told them and there only response was to tell me to call back tomorrow because there was no manager on duty... I left my contact info and was never called.Sadly disappointing......1st time ordered delivery. Ordered sandwich off their online menu. Told they no longer make it. Ordered second sandwich off the same menu. Told they don't do that one anymore too. Ordered pizza which was excellent, but not what i wanted.2nd time we phone ordered pizza for pickup.Told 25 min wait. Wife went to pickup and took pizza to the car. Decided to take a quick look at it and discovered it was not the pizza she ordered. Went back in and was told that they had mixed up 2 orders and "Jay" had taken Jane's order. Asked to wait while the order was recooked. Sort of defeats the purpose of calling it in, if you have to sit there. They must have then hurried it because the pizza was undercooked and the cheese had slid off the pizza. One end had no cheese while the other end no crust......Well, mistakes can happen and we are normally forgiving, but absolutely no effort made by staff to try and make it right. No offer to deliver or take a few $$$ off or even a coupon for the next time. Feel 2 stars is generous under the circumstances....
Tequila Bar and Grill=My Son and I stopped by to watch Anthony M try to finish the 3 lb Burger challenge......the Burger was actually 5+ lbs total weight!  (see pics)We decided to order some food for ourselves as well.  I ordered the 1/2 lb Open Range Cheesburger ($11) w/Onion Rings ($2) & Loco Bueno Hot Wings ($10).  My Son ordered the 1 lb Big Daddy BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger ($16).  There were 11 people in our party, so I expected the service to be a little slow.Our food came out in a reasonable amount of time.....the Burger was OK, not great.  The Hot Wings tasted pretty good, but the sauce was not hot enough for me.  I asked for the hottest sauce they had and it was called the Texas Double Pepper.....it had a small kick to it, but it really didn't do much for me.  My Son enjoyed his Big Daddy BBQ Burger....it was huge at 1 lb, but it was nothing compared to the 3 lb Challenge!Anthony ordered his Burger at the same time we all ordered our food, but he didn't get his 3 lb Challenge Burger until we were all finished with our meals.  Keep that in mind if you want to do this challenge.....it will take 15-20 min longer for it to be ready vs other entrees.When they delivered the challenge Burger, they rang bells, whooped & hollered and made a big deal.  The staff announces it to the restaurant and they count down to start the 30 minute time limit.  Everyone in the restaurant watches as you try to eat this monster.  They advertise it as 3 lbs, which is within range for a normal person.....but it weighs it at over 5 lbs once you add it the 12 pieces of Bacon, Whole Onion, Whole Tomato, 6 slices of Cheese, Bun, and Lettuce!  Crazy!  I give Anthony props for giving it a shot.....he finished 1/2 of the Burger, which is respectful.  The manager told us 150 people have tried it, but only 5 have completed the challenge.  While we were dining there was another challenger at the bar.....we heard he only finished 1/2 the Burger too.  It's a $36 Burger in case you want to give it a try.....Overall, it was a pretty fun time hanging out with other Yelpers.  The food was just eh....OK.Return Factor - 30%
Roka Akor=What a fabulous venue for yet another fabulous yelp event. From the valet to the restrooms. From the vast modern space to impressive and friendly service. And the food! Oy Ve (that's Japanese for yummy)...Ika FuraiAge Watari GaniAbura Bouzo No Tataki Shiro Asparagus ZoeButaniku To Hotate No GyozaYakitori-Negima YakiOK. Admit it. You know asparagus. But what about the rest? Well, you'll have to check out Roka Akor to find out. Cuz I'm not spilling it. My fave was the Abura Bouzo. Buttah! Like a big stick of buttah! I could have chowed down several more. And then several more. Light and airy with clean lines and muted tones, this is contemporary asian at its best. Origato. Dori Ori Gato Mr. Roboto.Moe saved the night!I had to try this place...after hearing amazing reviews...So after waiting 45 minutes for a table (even though I did make reservations for 8pm) we finally got our table.  (I know that a lot of you like the decor...I just wasn't feeling it...a little too basic for me)  After being seated..it took another 20 minutes to have the General Manager come over to ask us if we have been asked for drinks yet.  I replied that nobody has even greeted us yet.  He took our drink order (I got this Pomegrante and Sunflower Iced Tea...which was AMAZING...weird since I HATE flavored tea) and he even took time to explain the menu to us.  Since we still didn't have a server yet, the GM (now I know his name is Moe) took our orders and even offered suggestions. We ended up with (I wish I wrote down the actual names of the dishes) Shrimp Tempura (out of this world), Cucumber Roll with this amazing plum sauce, this tasty salmon roll with asparagus, beef skewers, and scallops that were AWESOME with this AWESOME mayonaise in the center.  Of course since their servings were extremely small and my friend Karla and I were sharing...I needed some dessert.  I got the Strawberry and Honey Chawan Mushi with Apple Pear, Passion Fruit, and Banana.  First of all, it looks like salsa, the way the fruit was chopped up.  Then I tasted it.  Ewwww....not good at all.  Moe felt bad, knowing that we had to clean our palattes...so gave us vanilla sorbet and green tea ice cream instead...on the house and even took off the other dessert.Moe Rules!I didn't find the place to be too pricey...I have been to worse.  I even played a game with my friend about guessing the price.  She guessed $78....and I said $ 57.63.  I didn't even add up anything in my head.  The bill came out and it was $ 57.85.  (My friend thought I had some amazing psychic powers...)Food 5 stars...well for dinner.  I won't even comment on the dessert, because I knew that I should have gotten the Flan....I should give it 2 stars for service...but like I said...their new General Manager Moe...saved the day.  He was awesome!  Moe rocks.This is most definetly the best restaurant in all of AZ!!!For one, they do not use any preservatives or hydrogenated oil. If you are someone that refuses to eat that garbage that is banned in multiple countries than you dont know how hard it is to find a place that wont use it in their food.Even Cheesecake factory uses it( I ban them now)The food is very crisp and clean, so clean you can taste many different flavors in their food.I usually give sushi places the spicy tuna test. You can tell a lot by a places tuna. Eat a piece w/o soy, if there is no fish flavor the fish is a higher cleaner quality.The spicy tuna there is ridiculous how good it is. I also really enjoy the Crispy Prawn roll. Usually not something I would pick but the person I was with did. Boy was that a good thing. It is very good. They have a dessert there with flowers and rasberry. I dont remember what its called but it is immaculate.Starters  butter-fish tataki and calamari Soo damn good. MOST PLACES LOOK LIKE REALLY NICE RESTAURANTS, LIKE  SAPPORO, BLUE WASABI, AND RA.... BUTT ALL THOSE RESTAURANTS FOOD TASTE LIKE CRAP!UNLESS YOU HAVE HAD SOME QUALITY SUSHI YOU PROBABLY WILL THINK THOSE PLACES ARE GOOD.TAKE THE TEST GO TO ROKA AND YOU WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO EAT THAT GARBAGE DISPOSAL FOOD AGAIN!!NOT TO MENTION THAT FOR ONCE YOU WONT HAVE THE SHITS!!ITS ON INDIAN BEND AND SCOTTSDALE P.S. THE DUCK IS OFF THE CHAIN!Ok, I went again last night and tried a few new things. I had the Tuna Tataki Starter it was really realy good. Tried the pork dumplings they were actually really gross I brought them backthen my usuals that I love.I havent been to Roka in a while so I decided to pop in and check it out. I wasnt starving so I just wanted a few things. I got an order of the calamari which is soo good there. I actually wont eat it anywhere else. It has thin sliced serrano peppers and lime juice. We were greeted after by William the manager I believe. I love that guy, he is soo good at his job. He is the english guy that will come around with the boy like smail asking how everything is. If it would be soo weird I would hug him when I see him. He is soo cute. Anyway he wanted us to try this new dish out which was a perfect gem of a starter.It had the most perfectly seasoned sweet and salty tuna tataki with chared tomatos and mushrooms and asparagas. Let me tell you, I hate mushrooms, even the name makes me sick. I havent eaten a mushroom in a yr at least, every once in a while Ill give it a shot then realize how much I hate them.Anyway I said what the hell and took a bite of one. WTF, this is the first mushroom I have ever liked, it was perfectly smoky and nutty, you know I watch food network all the time and I hear them say mushrooms have a nutty flavor. All I have ever tasted is dirt, but know I actually know what they mean. This new tuna starter will be on the menu after the 1st he told us, and he surprisingly comped us!!!!! We had already planned to try the happy hour menu since we hadnt been there since they made one. So when he took care of the bill I felt a little awekward going to the bar to get more stuff. I hope he didnt think we were trying to freeload, hahaha.  We paid over there anyway. I will for sure not wait soo long to go backoh and I had a non alcoholic  apple mojito, it was awesome and not overly sweet. My only complaint is that they dont have wrapped straws. Most people dont care, but I actually caught a staph infection on my face from a server who I guess was touching there staph wound and then stuck my straw in the drink with hands were my mouth goes. I will never ever leave home with out a sealed straw.After the disappointment of dining at Quiessence, I decided to try a sushi restaurant in the middle of the desert! Before you all shake your head and laugh, I had checked out their menu and figuring that they also have other branches around the world, they must be doing something right.The restaurant is located out on N Scottsdale Rd and has ample parking. The interior of the restaurant is big and airy, unlike its London counterpart, which has tables crammed up together. There is a bar area where they carve the big pieces of ice on which the fresh fish is served. The main restaurant area is dominated by the open plan robata grill. As I was dining on my own, I chose to sit at the grill to watch/chat to the friendly chefs and to make friends. There was a good buzz about the place.I got a shock though when I opened the menu. I had my heart set on having the tasting menu to sample more dishes but the tasting menu was for a minimum of 2 people. Being the USA where the customer is king (please note, all UK restaurant owners!), I decided to ask the server to find out from the kitchen whether I would be able to have the tasting menu on my own as I had come all the way from London. I was so pleased when the server returned with a positive answer.Well, the generosity of the restaurant knew no bounds. I am sure that they served me the equivalent amount of food for 2 people with double portions of everything. I was starting to panic as the never-ending sea of food kept flowing out of the kitchen - I hate to return uneaten food to the kitchen but there was no way I was going to be able to eat all of it. Fortunately, I made friends with the diners on either side of me and between us, we did manage to eat it all.Having had some misgivings about eating sushi in the middle of the desert, I found out from the chefs that all the food is specially flown in, mostly from abroad, so even the London branch would be getting its fish from Japan rather than Billingsgate.Once service started, dish after dish just flowed out of the kitchen, all beautifully presented.1. Butterfish tataki - lovely delicate fish which possibly needed an accent like ginger.2. Spinach salad with peanut dressing - refreshing.3. Rock shrimp tempura with chilli mayonnaise. Very light batter enclosing just cooked shrimp.4. Premium sushi including my favourite melt in your mouth toro. Mmmmmmm.5. Wagyu gunkan with caviar. My only disappointment of the menu. I think the flavour of the super expensive beef was wasted in this preparation. Was even hard to tell it was beef. I appreciate the expense but perhaps they could do a different preparation.6. Spicy tuna roll. Lovely.Then came the robata grilled dishes.7. Sweet potato. Was a bit sceptical that it would cook enough on the grill but it was lovely and crispy.8. Black cod. Which Japanese restaurant doesn't have a version of this dish popularised by Nobu? Still wonderful with large flakes of white fish accompanied by that lovely sweet sticky sauce.9. Lamb chops with Korean spices. Huge meaty chops but moist and tender.10. Rice pot offered with vegetables or king crab. Had to be the crab though I was ready to explode by this stage! This was something new that I have never seen before. Probably best described like Japanese risotto where the crab was mixed into creamy rice and a generous amount of tobiko added some pops. There was an incredible depth of flavour that I suspect comes from a proper stock.Last but not least and I'm afraid I may have actually laughed out loud when dessert arrived. It was the most fabulous looking and enormous dessert selection served on a block of ice. I can't actually remember what was on there - my stomach may have been telling my brain to abort at this stage! However, I had a taste of everything and like the rest of the meal, it was divine.So top marks to Roka Akor for flexibility and their generosity for feeding me and my 2 impromptu dining partners. I was happy to escape the fate of the exploding man in Monty Python's Meaning of Life sketch ('just a little wafer, monsieur') but it was the quality of the food, not its quantity which captured my stomach's praise.I was able to chat to the Scandinavian head chef later, who extracted a promise from me to go and try the London branch and let him have my honest opinion. Well, Scottsdale wins, guys! You have a more spacious restaurant, more friendly staff, amazing flexibility in customer service and more generosity with the dishes (London's 'premium' menu sushi selection only included salmon, tuna and yellowtail - no sign of any toro) And to achieve this in the middle of the desert!Took Mom and myself to have dinner here after work on Sunday (4/12).  Nice space.  We were given above-average service when we were seated at the robata counter.  (Actually, it's the level of service I expected given the atmosphere of the restaurant.  Anything less would have been suspect.)  When we had to move to the bar in order to take advantage of reverse happy hour, the service level dropped considerably- more on that later.Since we had arrived around 8:30p, we studied the menus to see what we could try off of the regular sushi options for dinner (the soft-shelled crab) and happily found out that Roka Akor recently started offering, "on a smaller scale," a few robata apps only to be served on Sundays.  I thought what a nice way to be introduced to the robata menu.  I asked the usual questions regarding allergy concerns and asked how certain items were prepared.  I even handed the bartender , Colin, a list of allergens to hand to the chefs.  (Evidently this list was only going to be looked at once, since many of our dishes had to be corrected after delivery.)Off of the robata apps menu, I ordered the shrimps ($5) for Mom and the zucchini ($1.50) and the black cod ($5) for us to share.  Off of the regular sushi menu, I ordered the soft-shelled crab roll ($9 for 5 pcs.) for Mom.  The timing of delivery of these items was haphazard.  It took at least 10 minutes before the plate containing two medium-sized shrimp to arrive.  To charge $6 for two grilled shrimp is just ridiculous!  It did smell wonderful and looked appetizing, but Mom wasn't wowed by them- certainly not at $3 per shrimp!  The soft-shelled crab arrived about 5 minutes after the shrimp did and looked great.  Mom found the rice good enough, but she still wasn't feeling any love.  The plate of zucchini arrived roughly about 5 minutes after the crab roll (that's 20 minutes after I ordered!) and held 5 pcs. of seasoned zucchini (salt, pepper, and soy) and a dollop of mustard sauce at one corner of the plate.  Mom liked the one piece she tried, but as much as I tried to get her to try the mustard, she didn't, so I can't report on that aspect.  So here we were, 5 minutes before happy hour was to commence, and all I had to nibble on were the zucchini pieces... Black cod was nowhere to be found.  Correction, Colin the bartender said he spied it at the robata counter, but did not make a move to retrieve it.  I asked Colin if I could give him my happy hour menu selections (all cost $5 each) so that he may have them ready for entry at 9p?  He took my order of Crispy squid and a salmon roll.  I also ordered two Roka Akor burgers, one without the housemade bun, and instead asked for an extra slice of heirloom tomato as a sub.  Would you believe that the crispy squid (again, only for Mom to enjoy bec. the batter contained *!) and the salmon roll (which arrived with **, which I wrote down on the list as two of my allergens- apparently the chefs did not remember, nor did Colin recall to alert the chefs) arrived before the black cod app?  Anyway, the salmon roll was left for my Mom to enjoy while the chef prepared another, allergen-free, for me.  Before I go on, let me say that Mom LOVED the calamari!!  This was the first dish that wowed her, and she exclaimed that this version of calamari is the best she's EVER tasted and even begged for me to forget about my allergy and try them- they were that good!  But I stood my ground.  I found the salmon to be very fresh-tasting and mild-flavored.  The pea-sized miso-mayo garnish that sat atop each piece was so mild, the roll could have been served without these embellishments and no one would know the difference.  I'd say that the black cod (3 pcs.) arrived at least 45 minutes since the time of order.  At least.  Aren't robata items, esp. seafood, supposed to be quick to cook?  I will say that the cod tasted superb, and I'd order them again.  Well, maybe.  $5 for three small pieces is too much, I think.Last, but not least, to arrive were the beef burgers, one-at-a-time.  Funny, the first burger, which arrived without avocado, but with a bun, so that was quickly returned.  My Mom's burger came, with everything on it, but she didnt' try hers until mine arrived- she was still working on the calamari and the salmon roll.  I liked the beef patty, cooked perfectly to medium rare, although I wished there was more flavor.  Mom's burger looked amazing.  Too bad the lighting at the bar was very minimal (one oil lamp for the both of us until Colin saw me taking photos and lit up another and placed it in front of me, but the fire died down soon after).I hope to return again to see if the service improves (better memory recall and timing of delivery).  I found the ambivalence showed by Colin of the (greater than 30%) tip I'd given him off-putting.  Factored in the price of the comped salmon roll, PLUS tipped based on the burgers original price of $4 each, too.  Hmm... maybe not too soon a return.There is Japanese cuisine in abundance here in Scottsdale, such as Sushi and Teppanyaki, but Roka sets itself apart with its Robatayaki Grill. All the fruits of the earth are prepared in view of the guests.   Steaks, fish, chicken - even the asparagus and stuffed mushrooms - are served charcoal grilled.The name Roka Akor derives from the Japanese words Ro and Ka.  Ro meaning gathering place for people to enjoy a good meal, sake, and company; Ka meaning heat and fire, creating energy.The restaurant has an unassuming feeling of luxury, combined with a more terrestrial flavor.   A distinctive character by virtue of the menu's quality ingredients, the clean lines and high ceilings of the dining and lounge area,  the earthy tones of its decor, and the geotic feel of the serving dishes and plates.From the drinks to the grill, I have been swept away time and time again.  For me, nothing has compared to the Sushi or the Shochu.  Because Roka is also a Shochu Lounge, it is of import to incorporate this into your experience.  Shochu is a distilled spirit which can be made with rice, potato, or barley, and which dates back 6 centuries.  It is similar to vodka, and its many varieties can be used as healing tonics, aphrodisiacs, or energy boosters.  The shochu is infused with herbs or fruits, and served with ice that never melts...H2O minus the oxygen which keeps this melange of pure bliss and succor chilled to the last drop, without melting and spoiling the taste.  On this visit, I enjoyed the Honey as well as the Pineapple.  Absolutely incredible!Spanish Mackerel Sashimi, Hamachi Belly, Buttery Salmon Sashimi, Char-grilled Asparagus with sweet soy and sesame, Zucchini with miso mustard, and cremini Mushrooms with butter and garlic , manila clams with red miso broth and cilantro, Butterfish Tataki wrapped around white aspargus and yuzu, and robata grilled teriyaki, it was culinary fireworks in my mouth.  Down to the details, from the wasabi root being ground at the table, to the artful preparation and presentation of the food, we were swept away.I will come here time and time again for the quality, the richness of the flavors, and the great atmosphere.  Culinary exloration and adventure await - and there is good reason for it being voted one of the top sushi locales in the nation, by Bon Appetit Magazine.Restaurant week will be the perfect opportunity to discover Roka when it offers a three course menu for $25 between July 20th and 28th.Happy Hour:Everyday - 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM and 9 PM to CloseBelow are selections from my favorite HH items:$3 White Miso Soup with Spring Onions$5 Crispy Fried Squid with Chili and Lime$6 ROKA AKOR Butterfish with White Asparagus and Yuzu$5 Fried Soft Shell Crab$7 Wagyu Gunkan with Wasabi Ponzu and Ginger$5 ROKA AKOR Hamachi Serrano Chili Roll$6  Shochu in honeycomb or pineapple$6 wines by the glass or 50% off bottles$3 beers$6 house sakeRoka Akor isn't my typical type place. I usually find that the food I love comes from places where they have put their heart and soul into the food and just ground it out. Sometimes these places look nice but often they're not too fancy and they rarely look anything like Roka Akor. Roka Akor is beautiful and huge. The decor is modern and tasteful. They have a great lounge, a huge featured sushi and robata bar and oodles and oodles of wood (which I dig).So often when you see these huge, gorgeous spaces obviously funded by a good deal of investor money, it's all business driven and the organization has lost some focus on the food.That's not the case with Roka Akor. I've been there the past 2 nights (and before) for their happy hour and had some stellar dishes.I'm a Japanese food freak so anything new & out of the ordinary piques my interest. I've been waiting forever to have a real izakaya or kaiseki place in Phoenix. Roka Akor is rolling out an izakaya concept in their lounge. For this first week, they are also doing a special where all food and beverages are $2 (through 11/25). It's absolutely crazy not to check this out.While I wouldn't say this an authentic izakaya, I'm a big fan of what they are doing. I tried most of the izakaya menu over the past two days and had some killer dishes.The tenkatsu fried pork belly is completely ridiculous. It is right up there with some of my favorite bites in recent memory. Then I also had their burger on a homemade sesame bun. Definitely order this medium rare. We had a couple ordered medium temp that came a bit overdone. The meat was tasty though and the thing that put it over the top was the awesome bun. Super flavorful - absolutely made the dish. They also use this bun on the cremini mushroom burger with wasabi aioli. Also very nice. Last night I also got to sample their Chinese style glazed pork ribs off the normal menu - amazing. I was already completely stuffed but it still made a huge impression.As far as other things on their izakaya menu, I'm a big fan of hamachi kama and enjoyed their version. Would have been killer with a bit of ponzu sauce. Robata grilled unagi was very nice and the fried soft shell crab with mixed salad greens was excellent. We also enjoyed the butterfish tataki with white asparagus and yuzu. The list is getting long but we really didn't run across any major misfires at all. Enjoyed the sweet corn tempura with sea salt, braised short ribs with daikon, agedashi tofu & hamachi serrano chili roll.For me the definite standout was the pork belly though. I kind of went through that list in order of preference. I enjoyed it all - actually a bit surprising.They also have a bunch of great drinks. Over the past 2 days, I had the shochu & tonic (barley shochu with spash of yuzu juice and tonic), tanuki peach (again - shochu & fresh peach puree) & sake-tini (lychee). All were great. The last several visits there we've also had excellent service. The staff has been super nice and super attentive. We even brought our young kids (5 & 2) after calling & making sure it was alright. While they are very well behaved, it is still nice to see them welcomed in.I expect that this happy hour will stay in the rotation. Great food, great drinks. Nice value.And I also have seen some wonderful looking sushi come out as well so we have to come back and go that route.While it doesn't look like the places that fall into the norm of what I typically like, I can't help but be a big fan.I was seriously disappointed in my dining experience at Roka. I went with a group of 18 and had arranged to have a fixed menu and reserved the back room. The food was as excellent as all of the other reviewers stated. We sampled several rolls, veggies, soup, sashimi, tempura ect.   The place itself big, with modern tasteful décor, and the tables were nicely spread out. They have a huge sushi and robata bar and a lounge to the side with all different seating arrangements. The back room we were placed in was big but intimate enough for our group. Our server was exceptional (his name was Casey) he was quick to offer suggestions and really knew the history of the drinks. If I had a restaurant I would steal him away and put him as head waiter!So why the 3 stars? Timing, or in this case lack of timing. We were seated and brought the first round of rolls before our drink orders had been placed.We actually received 4 orders of rolls before we received our drinks. We were served drinks without sake cups, soups without spoons, rolls without soy or wasabi... It was a complete mess. I am sad to say the lack of timing really disappointed us, I would return because the food and service were excellent, but I would not recommend it for big groups.One more thing - They offered to call us a car service to take us to downtown Scottsdale, telling us the fist 10 miles were free. Once we got in the driver told us it was a minimum charge of $25. They really need more organization.I hate to admit it, but it had been a long while since my last visit to Roka Akor. I deserve a hand slap. But last week, I had the perfect excuse to pay a long overdue visit during Yelp Eats Week! We went on Friday night and to make a long story short, this is the perfect date spot and the perfect restaurant for delectable dining. But let me dive into details a bit more. First of all, the atmosphere here is vibrant and alive, but it lacks the "so Scottsdale" vibe that some similar spots may have. For this reason alone, I will become a regular at Roka Akor. There's plenty of seating inside, including seats at the bar, romantic couch seating in the lounge, front row sushi seating at the sushi bar and then plenty of normal dining all around. We sat at a normal dinner table and took in the fun environment surrounding us. The staff here is incredibly friendly and attentive. We arrived on time for our 8:30 dinner reservation and were seated promptly upon arrival. The server welcomed us immediately and gave a descriptive overview of the food and serving style they suggest for the restaurant. Since we were there for Yelp Eats, I definitely wanted to take advantage of some of the Yelp Eats musts, so we ordered the Grilled Sweet Corn (Roka Akor signature dish), the Skirt Steak and the Warm Toffee Cake for dessert. But, that just didn't seem like enough, so added on the rock shrimp tempura and Kobe beef and Kimchi Dumplings -- two more Roka Akor signature dishes. Since there is so much delicacy to discuss, I'll break it down by dish. Grilled Sweet Corn -- as sweet as it sounds. I felt like I was in a scene out of the movie Big because the corn is petite and cut into halves, so I found myself nipping away on each tiny ear. The corn was grilled perfectly and had just the right amount of zing. *** PS -- probably not the food choice for a first or second date.Rock Shrimp Tempura -- by far my favorite dish of all and the top anywhere in the Valley. It's fried, it's tangy, it's spicy, it's crunchy, it's just delicious. I could eat an entire bowl (or two) just by myself. Kobe Beef Dumplings -- they were tasty and the perfect compliment to the meal. They were filling but not overly filling and with five to a plate, it's just the right amount for two. Skirt Steak -- I don't even know where to start. They give you a good amount of steak and it's perfectly tender, moist and delicious. We let them pick how it "should" be prepared and that's the right move. It was medium well and the perfect amount of rare and well done at once. The marination on it provided the perfect sweetness and it was just the right amount of steak. It's a great dish to share as well. Finally, the Toffee Cake -- this is a great way to end the meal with a sweet touch. Delicate and delightful. I almost forget about the sake. The sake here is top notch and perfect for sipping. Accompany it with a Japanese beer to sip on as well and you're in for a great evening! Thanks for a wonderful Friday night Roka Akor. I can't wait to visit again!I am a little disappointed in myself for not remembering our bartender's name! He has been at Roka since the beginning and helped the place get up and rolling. He knew every detail of the menu and recommended some great food to try. Even though the bar was extremely busy, he still managed to be very attentive and not seem flustered! Also one of the cocktail waitresses was extraordinarily nice as she picked up our slew of appetizer plates. The service here is seriously top notch! The crowd was also fun! I was there for a Yelp event this last time though so I am probably being biased...but I have been here before and there always seems to be a good vibe. Last and probably most importantly the FOOD: the BUTTERFISH TATAKI with white asparagus is unique and AMAZING! The Kobe beef dumplings I could eat all week for every meal and probably not get tired of them. I have never sat at the sushi bar, but it is definitely on my 'To-Do' list because not only does the food taste great here, but the presentation is quite impressive. I would love to see Roka Akor's chefs in action!Roka Akor is the best Happy Hour place I visited while staying in the Phoenix area. We took a trip to Scottsdale and on the recommendation from fellow yelper Jared R, we gave it a shot. We arrived on a Sunday for Happy Hour and found a quiet little corner couch to lounge in. Everything we ordered was on the Happy Hour Menu and fantastic. There was not one thing that we did not like. To start, I ordered the house sake: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DymZ5vpm7vkSsR__-4sflw?select=9nbjFTP4j7xvm0M3NMN4BA#Z4l2nQd3AN32UmwWoftl4Q and my man ordered the Blood Orange Margarita http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DymZ5vpm7vkSsR__-4sflw?select=9nbjFTP4j7xvm0M3NMN4BA#p2vq7FipyZO-Hn26b_b5dg And although mine was great, he scored the best first drink award.Anything spicy always catches my eye, so we ordered the Hamachi Serrano Chile Roll and it was so good. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DymZ5vpm7vkSsR__-4sflw?select=9nbjFTP4j7xvm0M3NMN4BA#OkLM7fkyeEFa0WbAVwy34Q Second up was the beef teriyaki. Then we ordered two house infused glasses sochu, one cucumber melon and the other a spicy mango. Both fantastic light sippers! This isn't really alcohol is it?! To go with that, we ordered the Butterfish. I am a sucker for Butter fish and it was beyond amazing. Slices of creamy butter fish wrapped around white asparagus! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DymZ5vpm7vkSsR__-4sflw?select=9nbjFTP4j7xvm0M3NMN4BA#2nPo-UaB6chwwASuWjJ3EQThe food was so great, yet I was too full to try anything else. Which is okay, because our fabulous waitress Lisa told us that they are planning on opening a Roka Akor in San Francisco soon! Look out kids, you are gonna LOVE this.I finally sat at to the sushi bar!  I now know I never want a job cracking open oysters; that guy should get a bonus!  Also, Roka Akor knows how to make some beautiful dishes!   I should start off by saying Roka Akor has great food, BUT I am starting to come to the conclusion that I just need to come to Roka Akor for happy hour or the dinner entrees, not the sushi.  Their rolls (we had the Serrano Chili and Spicy Tuna) were honestly not that exciting and on the small side, but they tasted good and were solidly made.  I wish I had gone with my instincts and tried the Dynamite Scallop Roll, because we saw one being made later at the bar and it looked yummy.  The warm Wagyu roll sounded interesting to try next time too.  I ALWAYS get the BUTTERFISH TATAKI; it is seriously amazing.  But, I should also say you get 5 small pieces of fish for $11, and it would never fill you up.  The octopus salad was delicious but came on a plate the size of a tea saucer with more greens than octopus (maybe 5 pieces of octopus); most octopus salad I have had, the majority of it is octopus.  As Jared R. said the Waygu Kimchi dumplings were not as exciting as all the other things we ate.  I think you just come to expect that WOW factor at Roka Akor and they don't deliver that.  I checked in on Yelp and they offered the Yuzu Mousse dessert with a beverage purchase, which was a pleasant surprise!  The mousse was light and fluffy with the perfect amount of lemon; definitely not rich and over-baring.  It came with a raspberry drizzle that complemented it beautifully.  Not to be cliche, but one thing that was kind of noticeable to my date and I, was out of the 8 people in the open kitchen, one was Japanese.  As for our service this time it was okay.  The guy I went with had never been to Roka Akor and had quite a few questions because they have a unique menu that lacks descriptions, which is fine when you have a knowledgeable waiter- but we didn't. I almost wonder if our waiter was relatively new, because he did not describe things very well and most things were described with adjectives like 'good' or 'great' and he basically just said 'I think I would go with that.'  It really didn't give you much to go on, especially since the menu does not have descriptions.  But, he got the job done and he was fast and pleasant, so I am not really complaining.  What to take home with you: Roka Akor has beautiful, yummy food.  The prices are high and I think you can get just as good, if not better, sushi other places. ORDER THE BUTTERFISH TATAKI. They also have one of the greatest happy hours in town, with outstanding, reasonable food options!7/27/11Took Mom for our first lunch here, and she LOVED it!  I really should take her back for lunch again (she won't let me treat her to dinner here, as the ticket could get pricey very fast!).  From our starters of miso soup http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/roka-akor-scottsdale-4?select=QBQnXq0OfJRfDbim4bq8Nw#QBQnXq0OfJRfDbim4bq8Nw and salad http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/roka-akor-scottsdale-4?select=vs7J2Sxqm5CKQD4t737K0w#vs7J2Sxqm5CKQD4t737K0w, to our main courses of sashimi http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/roka-akor-scottsdale-4?select=crw2LPM69lGjbf2aR6nfoQ#crw2LPM69lGjbf2aR6nfoQ and robata pork http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/roka-akor-scottsdale-4?select=oqQ7SHbOv8iTzf3rnS6XYg#oqQ7SHbOv8iTzf3rnS6XYg, she was in heaven!  Everything was perfect-- from the dressing of the salad, to the meat temperature of the pork (fully cooked, no redness anywhere, yet still tender and very juicy).  I'd say the only thing that didn't impress her was the miso.  I thought it was OK, although not enough soy cubes, but I wasn't too worried about it, since I was looking forward to our entrees.So glad I spotted the photos in my iPhoto folders... Now I know where to take Mom for our next lunch date!  :)p.s.  Here's another shot of the robata pork tenderloin-- just look at that gorgeous caramelization!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/roka-akor-scottsdale-4?select=HrhOl_vuURZc31AE4wdbcA#HrhOl_vuURZc31AE4wdbcA$170 dinner for two, before tip. Happy hour is only in the lounge.  Make reservations for the dining room.  We sat in the patio.  There is nothing to enjoy about the patio other than the weather.  Kumomoto oysters - A+! beautifully plated over ice with decorative seashells.  Flavored with a lovely fresh citrusy sauce. Butterfish sashimi - Very good. Not as amazing as everyone makes this out to be.  The fish has a good firmness. Yellowtail sashimi - thick sliced and very firmSalmon sashimi - very niceSashimi is served with Fresh wasabi!!! It's the best, the quick heat disappears after you've swallowed it.  No horseradish here. Petit filet - sliced small and cooked perfectly. I didn't bother with the sauce on the side. Bone marrow - HUGE!  very yummy.  Could be overwhelming for some people and would be better shared with a group.   Tasted great when topped on the steak.  White chocolate brownie - yelp coupon. Topped with ice cream.  I wouldn't order this if it didn't come free.   Not bad but I'm sure there's a better dessert. Our butterfish never came.  So before ordering dessert I finally reminded our server.  They brought it out with an excuse that the ticket was lost. We were charged for it. The food is great!  I would have liked to check out the happy hour.
Aroojis Wine Room=4 of us went to Arooji's in The Promenade on Friday night.  We've been here 4 times since they opened and had only 1 good experience, which was the previous time we went.  I doubt we will go again.  Though I have heard that their South Park location is better.  Most of their food is good.  We ordered the crab dip which my husband thought tasted fishy.  I thought it was good but a little too thick and creamy.  A lighter crab dip would be better, where you could tast the crab more than what it was mixed with.  I ordered the lobster ravioli, which I thought was very good and had a nice size portion.  More ravioli than I have gotten elsewhere.  My huband ordered the veal saltimboca.  When he asked for pasta instead of the mashed potatoes, the waiter told him it's a $4 substitution charge.  ($4! Is the pasta made of gold?)  We also found out that the SouthPark location doesn't charge for the substitution. My husband wasn't impressed with the dish.  Too much cheese. Our friend ordered a chicken dish which was very good.  So, you want to know why I gave it a two...they had their special select wine list in which we ordered a Malbec .  After we were half way through the wine and not impressed with it..we realized that the year was not the same as on the list.  It was 2 years younger.  We ordered another bottle of wine from the list and that too was not the same year as listed on their list.  This just screams to me that they really don't care about the quality of their service or how they present themselves to the diner. We've had a problem with this before.  Unfortunately, it's not just good food that keeps people coming back..it's great and courteous service.  I really feel that the arrogance comes from the upper management and not the servers because they have always been very good.  If I am going to spend my hard earned income than I want to go to a place that I feel appreciated and at this location I don't.  So, get a new attitiude Arooji's (and it better not be fake)!  I really am surprised this location has lasted so long.After I posted this, someone asked me why did I go after the 2 bad times..this does need some explaining.  After the first bad experince, I wrote to the management and they sent me a gift card, that led me to go there the second time.  Then a friend gave me a gift card which led me there for the 3rd time.  Remember I like the food just not the attitiude. So, this 4th time was the Illios Noches was too crowded to wait.. and it was close.
Ollie's Diner=I probably drove by this place a thousand times, and didn't give it a second thought. Housed in a muddy yellow, squat brick building, with a dingy awning, I didn't have much hope for Ollie's. But Sunday morning, the pantry was empty, we were out of coffee (NOOOOOOO!!!), and needed to calorie-load for a busy day of home improvement. The area IHOPs and Waffle Houses, are always just  meh at best. The dining experiences there usually involve lots of crying babies, spotty service, and sticky tables. Black Bear Diner just had a ridiculous number of cars in the parking lot, and we were not up for a long wait. Plus their biscuits are dry and crumbly.That's when Ollie's popped into our minds. When we arrived, there was a decent number or cars in the parking lot, but not too many. The interior betrays the dull exterior. It is bright, and minimally decorated with cutesy country accents, and a couple of portable AC units. We were seated within a minute by a friendly hostess.Our server, a no-nonsense kind of lady, with probably many years of front of the house experience, came by shortly thereafter. She offered a  a quick "good morning," and came back in a hurry with a carafe of surprisingly good coffee. As she went around the room, doting on the regulars, we looked over the menu.No surprises there. The first 80-something selections are omelets. I'm sorry to say, I'm not a big fan of omelets. So I chose the egg and cheese breakfast burritos and some home fries. My dining companion chose the steak and eggs with hash browns.Our order was to our table in record time. The server left before we could ask for any condiments, but like a true veteran, she was back in a few seconds, laden with everything we could possibly need.First impressions -- presentation was minimal. After all, it is just breakfast, so I don't really care about all that anyway. The burrito was piping hot, so I snacked on the home fries for a while. Whoa! They were good! Crispy and seasoned on the outside, fluffy on the inside -- like curly fries, but in dice form.When I could finally pick up the burrito, I found it stuffed with light, fluffy eggs and cheddar cheese. The cheese was kind of cheapie and took a while to melt, but tasted OK. The salsa served with it was not bad.My companion's verdict on the steak and eggs was that it was good, but not worth $8.99. I believe our total bill was about $21.All in all, this may be our new "go-to" restaurant for breakfast, when we wake up unprepared and starving.
Sumo Sushi 2=Sumo Sushi 2!!!!!!!!! O-M-G!!!!! FRIGGIN ORGASM!!! 69!!!! YUMMY!!!!!What happened here? My mouth and body were just trippen!I've had some good sushi in my lifetime but boy oh boy was this place AWESOME! It always helps to know someone to who works whereever you go. It also helps to tell them what you like and let them make special things for you that are on and off the menu. MmmMMMM! I'm SOOOOO going back soon!The first thing I had was the ORGASM. It was tuna sashimi with other things and topped with some special sauce. Whatever it was, it did give me my first orgasm and set my body up for the next orgasms as well!!!My FAVE rolls were the 69 roll (yes 69 roll is the name) and the Tuna Naruto roll (I think that was the name). The 69 roll was SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOo good!!!!!!!!! It had this special garlic sauce that was just amazing on the roll. WOW. SO friggin good.Of course we had sake bombs which was complementary to the rolls, sashimi, and special stuff we had. MmmMMM! You MUST go to Sumo Sushi 2. Tell them what you like and let them make you some stuff.Be nice and hook up my buddies with some beer and sake bombs!Have a great time and get ready for a MOUTH-GASM!!!!!!!!!The staff at Sumo Sushi 2 are indeed pretty awesome.  They are friendly, attentive, and efficient.I read some Yelp reviews earlier in the day, and decided I was feeling in the mood for sushi and trying a new place, so when my GPS listed Sumo Sushi as one of the nearby sushi restaurant I knew right away that that was where I was going to go for dinner.The ambiance was great. Right when you walk in, you can see large aquariums (salt water) with colorful fish swimming about.  The lighting is on the dimmer side, which sets a good atmosphere for those on a romantic dinner.I tried their AYCE menu (~$26 +tax).  And overall I thought the fish served were fresh, including their special sashimi (3 options available on the AYCE menu).Special Sashimi:Tuna Karai - basically cubes of tuna with a blend of spicy seasoning.  They can make this really spicy if you request it, but it was pretty spicy without any special request.  So unless you can handle the heat, don't try to impress anyone asking for 9/10, then not being able to finish it :p  It was good, if you like tuna.Cocaine - this one was good too, slightly different flavors, but not all that different.Screaming Orgasm - slices of fish dressed in their "Orgasm" sauce.  Not bad.I mostly had their nigiri and some items from the appetizer section.  The nigiri were good, except they didn't have uni when I went, so that was rather disappointing.  Of the items on the appetizer section, my favorite is the Kurobuta Sausage, which was basically 1 pork sausage sliced up and served with ketchup. In hindsight, I should have ordered like 2 or 3 of these (since I don't think it is on the menu at other AYCE sushi restaurants).Of the rolls, I was only able to ordered two:Tuna Naruto - refreshing roll of various fish (salmon, tuna, krab) wrapped in cucumber.  (No rice).  The chef who prepared it has good knife skill, so it turned out looking as tasty as it was beautiful.  Something Wrong #69 - not a bad roll, but drenched in way too much spicy garlic ponzu sauce or was it regular soy sauce (?), because it was so salty that I drank 2 cups of hot tea trying to finish it all.After that I was done. Too much rice + hot tea = bloated stomach.Service: 4.5/5Ambiance: 4.5/5Food: 3.5/5Price: 4/5 reasonable for AYCE.Location: Off the Durango exit on 215, so great for locals, but not for out of town visitors.4/5 in my book.  And just FYI, the sushi has Korean influence in terms of the way they flavor their special sauces, rolls and such.I first heard about this spot from a buddy who said that Jjanga honed his skills here before breaking into his own restaurant. So, I was intrigued how similar the food was going to be. After eating here, I would say that even though I think Jjanga has the edge, this is a splendid sushi restaurant!This place is located on the deep southwest side of town. I was surprised by how far, but I guess it's good that they are located near a lot of suburbs. I also noticed on a sign outside that they were under new management, so some of the food might have changed since Jjanga had worked there.After walking in, I noticed everything was dark, but in a cool, modern way. The sushi bar is huge, and can hold a lot of people. One thing that kinda weirded me out is that it seems like the chefs are hovering above you as you eat due to the highness of the sushi bar center.I ordered a lot of items, and while I thought they were pretty good, nothing was bad. The fish quality they were using was very good. I really didn't like the rice too much, it was a little too sour for my taste.As far as apps go, the chicken katsu, octopus skewer, fresh oysters, and I thought the fried calamari were really good. I didn't care for the pork belly, ribeye steak, and grilled octopus. And I thought the udon was ok.This is definitely a solid place, I would put it in the same league as a Sushi Mon. I would definitely recommend this spot to those living in the southwest who don't want to drive all the way down to Spring Mountain for some good sushi. This place is also a lot better than the original restaurant in Green valley. A quality place all around.Well we went to three other restaurants before we happened upon this little sushi gem.There was no wait and we got seated immediately. Praise the lord because we were starved!I loved their seating! Every table was in its own little private cubby it felt very warm and welcoming. The appetizers were very yummy!We had:Oysters 5/5Spicy Garlic Edamame 3/5Coconut Shrimp 4/5Creamy Shrimp 4/5They had two appetizers I really wanted to try but my tummy was too full! So if you go and try the Whose your Daddy? Or the Ex-Wife let me know what they are?!We only had a few rolls, but the ones we did try were delicious!Dragon RollSea King RollBad Boy RollAnd another roll that I'm ashamed to say I can't remember the name off which is a shame because it was my favorite roll!Of course we ended our under the sea adventure with Mochi!The service was good but it did take a long time for the actual rolls to come out with it being dead I thought that was kind of strange but it could've just been an off night. Can't wait to come back!
Palee's Crown=We had gone to Payson for the day and as we were getting ready to leave Payson we decided to look in the Entertainment Book to find a restaurant coupon to use when we got back into the valley.We all agreed Thai sounded good and when we checked the trusty Yelp Mobile app and found Palee's had 4.5 stars on 14 reviews we decided it was a GO.I'll be adding Palee's to my list of Phoenix area Thai restaurants, right at the top with Thai Lahna.  We had four different items and a couple of them were the best I've had outside of the bay area.We started with chicken satay which was tender and very flavorful.  Next we shared massamun curry and pad thai.  Since my youngest daughter was with us we ordered the spice mild.  They did bring out an assortment of hot things on the side so that I could punch mine up if I wanted to, which I did.The pad thai was really good.  Not too sweet, not too fishy...just right.  The massamun curry was also very good.  The next time I am getting my own entree and ordering it hot.  We also had pot stickers which were good, not the best but good. I like a thinner skin but they had a nice flavor.The service was very good as well. We arrived about 6:15 on a Saturday night. We were the only patrons except for a few take-out orders.  By the time we left there were about 20 others in the restaurant.Everything tasted fresh and authentic.  We pretty much agreed that until another Thai place knocks them out, Palee's Crown was going to be our Thai spot.
Make Your Mark=If you're looking for the most comfortable and welcoming cafe/coffee shop in the world, please look no further!  There are so many great things going on here!  First off the environment is just so warm and inviting.  From what I hear the weekends are pretty hectic, but the weekday was nice and calm for a nice work day and meeting for me!  You really can't get any friendlier than the owner of this place either.  I could have BSed with him the whole time if I didn't have work to do!  Plus, you can really tell he cares about his business and how he wants to present it...I love that!  I even chatted with some other costumers, it was just that kind of friendly environment! I also love that I can grab a delicious, all vegetarian I might add, meal.  But don't worry, it's not shipped in, it's cooked fresh.  I enjoyed the broccoli and white bean soup and a mushroom, red pepper and cheese panini.  Both were delicious.  I loved how the soup had large pieces of fresh broccoli and it wasn't bean overkill either.  The mushroom panini came on rye bread, which I usually don't like, but for some reason this magical rye bread did the trick on all the other amazing flavors from the veggies.  I didn't think of meat for a second!  I'm definitely going to make this a spot to hit up when I want to grab a bite and work...and maybe chat up some strangers!
Zack's Hamburgers=Stumbled on this place entirely by accident, and it was a good time! Tasty burger and fries (had to try the Zack's Special) for cheap. My husband had the fried chicken, which he wasn't terribly impressed with- but I guess that's what you should expect ordering chicken from a burger joint. I wouldn't say this is the best burger in Charlotte (I'll save that distinction for the Penguin), but it's still pretty darned good- and the place has a cool classic dive feel to it.Definitely worth a visit if you're in the neighborhood. I'd happily go again!Taking into consideration that I am actually one of the twelve people left that are from Charlotte and I still live here, I am officially ashamed that I never tried Zack's before yesterday... The Zack's special was stupendous, guys... I ordered mine without mayo because that's how I get down, but there was still a great amount of toppings mixed all in with the two beef patties and cheese: tomatoes, pickles, onion, lettuce and secret sauce (which tastes quite a bit like thousand island dressing, so I think the secret is out)... I was really glad there wasn't any extra sauce because that sucker was already falling apart toward the end... In a good way, though... The bun was nice and toasty and wasn't bland, but didn't work too hard to prove itself by overpowering the other flavors...The onion rings were pretty good... I'd liken them to Mr. K's down the block... Not too thick, not too thin... Decent batter, but not the cajun kind that comes on most onion straws... A basic, but tasty fried coating... I even took this to go because I was heading home and everything traveled quite well... The food must have been practically on fire when they brought it out because it was still nice and hot by the time I arrived and got settled to eat... I didn't even have to do a quick microwave refresh!  I'm kind of afraid to take the boyfriend here... I doubt he'll want to go anywhere else for a while... But I just have to be the one to introduce this to someone new and I think he's the only one left that hasn't tried it...There's nothing flashy, trendy, or even remarkable about Zack's. They don't throw any fancy slogans out or use some sort of dated jargon to describe their outfit. It's just burgers, fries, rings, shakes, and the best crushed ice in all of the Earth's history. The Zack's Special -- Double cheeseburger, lettuce, tomato, mayo, pickles, mustard, easy like a Sunday morning bun. It's like the king of all lunchroom burgers. Nothing that's going to blow you away, but familiar like an old friend. Just right. Fries are nothing to shake a stick at. Onion rings, however? Sheer greatness. Also, for the price of $10 for two, you can't really be upset. I'm glad that Zack's is around and has been doing the same thing for so long. Don't change a thing, fellas.
Dave & Buster's=I want to be the mayor of my own little electric wonderland! As mayor I promise to offer a fully stocked bar of spirits and fountains of cold beer to allow my constituency to quench their thirst while drunkenly lobbing skee balls down the lanes, spilling beers on the air hockey table, and riding bitch on virtual motorcycles. To remind them of their stay in my land of delight, I'll let them redeem tickets for cheap-o trinkets with the name of my wonderland plastered all over 'em. I'd be the kind of mayor that brings back the nip of scotch with my loyal sycophants on a lazy afternoon and I'd give teenage hooligans the boot, telling them to go frolick in Tilly's or Charlotte Russe because my electric wonderland is a den of iniquity and requires a chaperone over 25 for anyone under the age of 18. Too keep the masses happy I'd offer a massive feast at reasonable prices, with appetizers, soups, salads, sandwiches, burgers, ribs, seafood, pasta, chicken, steaks and sweet, sweet desserts. And to make them feel like they're getting their money's worth, maybe I'll create little indulgences like happy hours and meal deals. Between 4:30 and 7:00 Monday through Friday I'll let my lovely little bunnies indulge in cheap drinks and offer a Power Hour game card for ten bucks that allows all the game play their little hearts desire for a whole hour! And maybe I'll even offer a reverse happy hour from 10:00 to close Sunday through Thursday... Yeah, that's a great idea, and I'll make my closing hours midnight Sunday through Thursday and one in the morning on Friday and Saturday! Now, meal deals, meal deals, how about an Eat and Play combo? It would consist of 25 meals and a ten dollar game card for $15.99, and I'd give them the option of adding an extra ten bucks to their game card for an even 25 bucks. Now I'd be a generous mayor, but I still have to pay for the infrastructure somehow, so I'd have to put a time limit on this awesome deal. Let's say Sunday through Thursday from open to close and until 5 in the evening on Friday and Saturday.And I'll sneak in a $2.00 activation fee for all new cards (except those with my mega meal deal), but to sweeten the blow I'll let my followers retain their cards to recharge them in the future, fee free! And I'll let 'em accumulate their ticket count over time to keep them coming back for more, more, MORE!As mayor I will create a land where divorced dads with their kiddos, young couples looking for some goofy fun and video game nerds can coexist, with a happy beer buzz and over stimulated pupils the size of dinner plates due to my flashing lights, whirling colors and jaunty winning noises. It'll be like a casino, but it won't be a place where dreams go to die. Saturdays will be the most crowded, but will still be manageable in size, as the mob ebbs and flows between midway and video games. There will be skee ball, air hockey, basketball free throw games, streaming water races, those games where the horse runs fast when you roll little balls into holes, virtual bowling, wacky drop the coin games, old skool Pac Man, Donkey Kong and Space Invaders, House of the Dead, motorcycle and racecar games, virtual boxing and my personal favorite, Super Trivia, where six people match wits against one another and get hundreds of tickets if they're super suave like me! Then they can trade those tickets in for junk like nose hair trimmers in the shape of a finger, t-shirts with our emblem on it, Chinese finger traps and jumbo pixie sticks!Ooo, ooo, and there will be fun little shots in those bottom heavy hourglass-shaped shot glasses where the mixer goes in the bottom and the shot goes in the top. And I'll even let 'em keep the shot glass, class act that I am. I can see it now, my own personal funland...What? Dave and Buster's already snaked my idea? Those sneaky fucking bastards. I guess I'll just have to go there if I'm feeling the need for a little goofy fun.Edit: By no means order anything that can't be produced by the divest of dive bars' short order cook. The food blows harder than a hooker trying to make rent on the 30th of the month. The games turn me into a giddy little girl, but the food turns me into a surly wench. Don't do it.On the outside, this place is great.Here is my story.I was at this place with a group of friends who were holding an event there.  Two of my friends, who happen to be gay, were trying to find a restroom.  There was an open door, so they went through it thinking maybe there was a restroom back there.They were told it was an area for employees only, they apologized and said they were looking for a restroom, and then left the hall.They went to go look somewhere else for the restroom, and they were stopped by an employee.  This employee radioed a manager after responding with disgust to the fact that they were holding hands.Before you know it, there are no less than 5 employees, 2 of which were managers, around my friends, peppering them with questions and threatening to throw them out.Mind you - we PAID to rent this place out.  They were *actually* looking for the restroom.  Nothing was out of place.  Except that it was two guys holding hands looking for a restroom.After enough of us stood up and asked the management staff why they were giving our friends a hard time, the employee mob started to shrink down, and the manager left.  One of them obviously very pissed off.My friends were not intoxicated, they were not agressive, they were two gay guys who happened to walk down the wrong hallway looking for a restroom.The management staff was aggressive and rude.  Without cause.It took 5 other people coming over to get them to back off.You put it together.  This place will never see another dime of my money.I've only popped into this Dave & Buster's for booze and games.  I hear they have food...What can you really say about a Dave & Buster's?  The bar is usually short-handed and packed with people wanting a million cocktails.  They offer a rechargeable token card which is both a blessing and a curse.  After a few drinks, losing track of your tokens is the obvious outcome.  At least you can let out drunken war cries when killing zombies with a fake handgun and no one would think twice.  It's loud in here!They also check your ID at the door after 9PM or something but unlike Los Angeles, they don't search your purse and have you go through a metal detector.  Yay?
Don Guido's Chicago Style Hot Dogs=Don Guido's is Sunnyslope's hot dog place.  I'm not especially a hot dog gal, but Don Guido's offers something else to Sunnyslope too: Italian Beef sandwiches! This was my lunch today: a delicious Italian beef sandwich paired with garlic fries! The beef in my sandwich was not fatty or metallic colored like I've experienced in other places. I really enjoyed it and will definitely have it again (but will probably ask for it a little more wet, next time)! But, seriously, let me tell you about those fries...!!! Don Guido's garlic fries exceeded my expectations!! The fries were nice and crisp, not greasy. And, while I expected a shake of garlic salt to qualify for "garlic fries," I was delighted to find them topped with REAL minced garlic and parsley. A lot of it too! People were coming into my office from down the hall to get in on the action! We've polished them off, so you'll have to make a run to Don Guido's and get your own. TOTALLY worth the trip!
Delights=If you're a local, or even a tourist staying on the strip, I wouldn't say you should go out of your way to visit Delights. But if you happen to be at the MGM Signature... well, this is pretty much your only choice. Luckily, it's pretty good! I had their vegetarian egg white scramble in a cast iron skillet and I was pleasantly surprised by how many fresh veggies were on it, and a huge portion of delicious avocado. It was by far the healthiest thing I ate the whole time I was in Vegas. It came with a side of pretty fresh fruit salad and toast. If you order without toast, they'll give you two servings of fruit. They also have things you can pick up and go, like bottles of wine and snacks. Be warned: the prices are pretty outrageous. I think a small bottle of San Pelligrino was 4 or 5 bucks. The SMALL one! But this is Vegas, and what do you expect? If you want a bargain go to Costco beforehand and hoard it in your room!
The Cracked Egg=Finally! A place with gluten free blueberry pancakes. my 2nd all time favorite food :) I've been here like 5 times in the past two weeks and its so good. The side of fruit is amazing too. grapefruit slices, blackberries, raspberries, strawberries, and sliced melon! Fresh squeezed orange juice is the cherry on top to an amazing meal. The staff is very friendly and accommodating as well. My new favorite breakfast spot :)I only ever seem to end up at the Cracked Egg with a coupon in hand. The breakfasts are always solid. Not my favorite in town, but they have quite a bit of variety and it's all pretty good. I have tried a number of things over the years and I tend to prefer their savories to sweets. Coffee cake isn't my thing, so despite all the raves, I have never ordered it more than once. The omelets usually draw my attention and they are good and cooked to order. Service is friendly, but the restaurant gets pretty busy so be prepared to wait or arrive early on weekends.None of the dishes have stood out over the years, but if you're looking for a basic breakfast stop, this is as good a place as any, just make sure you have a coupon.In deference to the prior review of a good friend who received poor service here in 2010, I'll say that I'm hopeful that they've at least gotten rid of her terrible waitress some time in the last five years.After spending a few days in the center of the strip, we had a 1:10 flight out of McCarran to come home.  That gave us a perfect chance to have a nice leisurely breakfast.  After researching gluten-free options in the area (wife wanted more than a 'fruit cup', but didn't want eggs, yet ironically we still came her), I found The Cracked Egg mentioned at a gluten-free website we use.  A couple people had reported issues with cross-contamination, but the more recent mentions indicated less problems.  So, we thought we'd give it a shot.Wife had a craving for simple pancakes with pecans (and of course syrup), which they could accommodate here.  They used "Pamela's"-brand mix, which we also use at home.  I'm going to assume they don't have a dedicated griddle surface, so if you really are extremely sensitive (wife usually is not), that may not work for you.  They also have gluten-free bread (but not a dedicated GF toaster).  The menu clearly states all this, and even has the heading "Gluten Sensitive" and not "Gluten Free", so we knew what to expect.  I'd seen a mention of gluten free English muffins in a prior review, but those were not available (nor mentioned on the menu) when we visited.The gluten-free pancakes are quite large, and would have been $6.95 alone.  But for a little bit more, we ordered it as the "Cakes and Eggs Combo" for us to split, which added two eggs and your choice of meat (2 slices of bacon for me, obviously).  There was an additional $1 charge over the regular Combo price because of the GF pancakes, which I feel is fair, knowing the difference in cost between Pamela's and "regular" pancake ingredients.  It was plenty of food for the two of us.  We also picked up the breakfast of a coworker of hers, and even with three beverages, the bill was less than the celebrity "burger, fries, and shake" I had on the strip the night before (review to follow).  The coffee was good, and hot.  Add to that friendly and fast service (there was no wait at 11am on a Tuesday), and who am I to complain?My pro-tip:  Sure, they have the fancy "hash browns", made of cubed seasoned potatoes, with bacon, cheese, scallions and sour cream.  But if you're a purist like me, they also have the crispy shredded potato version that I prefer.This location is on the southwest portion of town, and as a tourist who had been on the strip for four days, a calm way to transition back to "reality".  Since we had a rental, it really wasn't out of our way.  Just go like you are headed to McCarran, and where I-15 hits the 215, go a couple minutes WEST to Rainbow Blvd. (instead of east to McCarran/rental car return) and it's a couple blocks north from there.  Took about five minutes to drive to the rental car return from there.3.95 stars
Thai Thai Takeout=To give you a little background, I LOATHE carryout.  If I'm going to put on pants and leave the house, I want to be taken care of, not turn right around and drive home to eat and then have to clean up after myself.  Don't get the enjoyment of carryout.  Husband loves it.  HATE it.That said, Thai Thai is the only Thai restaurant from which I'll eat in Charlotte.  They used to have a brick and mortar in what became a sketchy section of town (which is when I started with them), so they moved to this location and are now only carryout.Their food is heaven.  We have a standard order:  lots of fresh spring rolls (vegetarian and full of noodles and vegetables and mint leaves with a peanutty dipping sauce that makes me have bad thoughts), tofu tod (deep fried tofu for the hubby with an even peanuttier dipping sauce), pad thai (no onions, no tofu, extra broccoli for me and no eggs for the hubby).  MmmmmmWhen you call, you will be talking to Pim, who is a treasure.  I'm sure her husband, the cook, is also lovely, but I don't interact with him.  Pim will remember you and the vagaries of your order (see above) and is always super perky without being annoying.  Some other reviews mention that she has sometimes been a little optimistic about wait times, but I've recently heard her tell people on the phone "be over an hour", so she's getting more realistic.  If you'd like a Thai place in Charlotte that can get you food quickly, I can recommend several, but there's a reason Thai Thai has the wait it does.  THE FOOD.LOVE THEM.  Sorry.  I'll quit yelling.  You gotta go.  If only they'd get tables...sigh...
China Ginger=I must qualify this review. I didn't make the call to China Ginger expecting Wing Lei type food. I just wanted some local chinese take out. Quick. Easy. Somewhat edible.This spot is pretty close to my house, and I always pass it on my way to and from work, so I figured I'd give it a shot one night. Not a lot of Yelp love for this place, but that's ok...it can be our little secret ;)Some dishes that are decent: chicken with black bean sauce, chicken lo mein, and anything with chow fun. All are excellent choices.I also love that the food is always hot and ready for pickup within 10 minutes. As I said in my first paragraph, this isn't five-star, hard core, authentic Chinese food. It's just easy, simple, take out. And it's good for that. Something I missed in Arizona.If you want real authentic Chinese grub, hit up the spots on Spring Mountain, or go to Wing Lei, or even Wazuzu for fine dining.Ehhh my mom was craving Chinese food so I decided to give this place a go since I had a buy 2 get 1 free entrée coupon.. Called in my order and they said it would be ready in just 10 minutes so that's a plus.. fast food! When I got there for some reason I had trouble finding the main door LOL I thought it was on the side somewhere by Nagoya.. Any ways.. they didn't seem too happy that I had a coupon.. Which, by the way, saved me $10 so yay. I wasn't really hungry but I did sample a little bite of each entrée :-Chicken Chow Fun Dry: It was ok... flat, thin, long rice noodles pan fried with soy sauce, onions, bean sprouts & chicken.-Beef & Asparagus: way too salty-Orange Chicken: It's deep fried & coated with a sweet orange glaze.. of course it's tasty but so is Panda Express haha -Steamed Rice: They gave us 3 large containers of rice which was way too much but a plus since some places don't include rice.. But the rice was a cheap quality rice.-To-go containers: I like their plastic Tupperwareish to-go containers. Prevents spilling and leakage.. AND they are re-useable haha Anywho.. This place is not really worth checking out. The prices aren't even that low for take out quality food..HOT TIP: Look in your mail for Valpack Coupons.. that's where you'll find their buy 2 get 1 free entrée coupon!
Fresh Grill & Bar=I was walking around the Miracle Mile shops at the Planet Hollywood Hotel on my way to the parking garage to get my car, and decided to grab a quick bite to eat. I happened to pass by this place so I decided to stop by and check out their menu. The pictures on their menu looked appetizing so I went with the grilled chicken wrap combo meal, which came with a side of seasoned fries and a drink. My order came and it was surprisingly good. They have a condiment flavor bar that offered various sauces from smoked bbq, ranch dressing, honey mustard, salsa, ketchup, house dressing, etc.. pretty much anything you might need to spice up your wrap or sandwich. I was looking through their menu and noticed that they also offer quesadillas, sandwiches, salads, smoothies, and mixed alcoholic drinks and beer. I was tempted to get a margarita, but I was on my way to a business meeting and decided to just skip the spirits for now and make it up later on that night.Overall, my experience here was pleasant and the employees are friendly. They really do stand by their motto of serving food that is fresh and flavorful. A good alternative to the other fancy and more expensive food places along the Miracle Mile shops..How could I forget about this place.. I know I was extremely hammered after the Wet Republic to even remember that I ate here until my friend reminded me the other day!! lolFrom what I remember I came here to Tacone in Planet Hollywood....& I ordered the great gobbler sandwhich which was shredded chicken, cheese, avocado, bacon ,& other such toppings I can't recall but it tasted quite delicious @ the time...& they had a sauce bar with a variety of sauces from chipotle bbq, cilantro ranch, honey mustard dijon, & the list goes on of deliciousness...ya this place was the most affordable thing I ate that whole weekend seeing that my friend bought me a sandwhich gave me an extra $5 to take a cab back cause I spend all my money on booze ..yes definitely will remember this place & try it againIt's located inside PH right next to the parking lot escalators. It's on the corner and you might miss it if you're thoroughly sloshed. I was planning to get manageably belligerent and wanted those yard drinks from Fat Tuesday's but seeing the long, long long line, decided to come here instead. I had purchased the Groupon deal for 2 yard drinks earlier in the day ($21 for 2) and decided that now was as good a time to get drunk as...well all the time in Vegas.1) The drinks were not strong. It was basically drinking peach slushy. I know they're probably trying to get you to purchase an extra shot, but I didn't want it.2) Rude. Holy cow. The cashier was impatient and rude as all hell. I don't know why, as there were no lines. Was I disturbing her chat time with her coworker? I don't careeeeeeee.3) They overcharged me by almost $10. This was on top of the Groupon. When I pointed that out to her, she just shrugged and said they already made the drinks for me. So what?! Ugh. FINE. At $32 for 2 it's still cheaper than buying at full price. I'm in Vegas to have a good time, not to deal with some idiot who can't do math or punch in correct totals on the cash register.I give you an extra star because the yard cup had a happy face and reminded me not to throw a temper tantrum.Rule #3 of Vegas: Buy a huge ass drink the size of your torso to carry with you as you walk The Strip.I purchased a couple of Groupon deals before coming here, something silly like 20 bucks for 2 drinks. If only I had known how sweet the drinks actually were I would have only got one of the deals as we ended up not using the 2nd. Oh well.Set up: Casual bar with the usual fried food and vast array of alcoholic drinks.With the ''Yard longs'' you pick your cup, then your flavor and any additional Alcohol shots if you want them. The drinks are already pre made in a slushy machine, I kinda wish I had got an extra shot as I couldn't taste what was in there and it might have toned down the sweetness of it all.Service was fine and the drinks were ok but way too much for both myself and my Husband as neither of us drank more than half of it. Will I ever return to use that other Groupon on another trip? Probably not.
Joseph Tambellini Restaurant=Rick brought me here for my Valentine's Night dinner on Saturday, February 18.  Yes, four days later.  Unfortunately I had to be out of town, San Antonio to be exact for two weeks and that included Valentine's Day.  But O did he promise me a really nice dinner when I returned!  Their menu promises "Warm romantic fine dining in the true Tambellini family tradition." and they are not kidding.  We began our dinner with some antipasta--sauteed calamari.  Hey, I'm 50% Italian and my guy is 100%.  We both love a great calamari and I'd been craving it since San Antonio.  This was the sort of calamari that just slowly melts in your mouth as you eat it, it was that succulent.  For my insalate I went for the mozzarella salad--fresh mozzarella, tomato, oasted peppers and mixed greens.  Heavenly!  One thing that sets Joseph Tambellini apart from some of the others is that they make their own pasta by hand here.  And believe me, it shows folks.  Their Mafalda Caprese was like none I've ever had before.  The grilled chicken was just right, the tomatos fresh, and the garlic not overpowering.  Rick went for the veal chop which just smelled divine!  This thing was a 16-oz'er and he ended up bringing some of it home.  Ah, but what is an Italian dinner without Dolce?  They've got a butterscotch poundcake with vanilla bean ice cream, and candied pecans with butterscotch sauce.  Oh how tempting that looked, but just a bit much.  Rick and I split a wonderful cannoli though, which topped off that dinner perfectly.  The atmosphere and service here are just impeccable.  Joseph Tambellini has three floors, each with a different decor.  Rick got us a table on the first floor, which has a much more traditional setting--just the way I like it.  So my Valentine's Day was a little delayed. But with that dinner, it was s-o-o-o worth the wait.  And the night was still young too.Solid Italian.
Korea Garden=I stopped by Korea Garden with some friends last night, since they were looking for a restaurant in Oakland, and none of us had tried this one before.  Unfortunately, I doubt any of us will return after our experience last night, as there are many better places to eat at in Oakland (and that's saying something, given the mediocrity of the Oakland dining scene), and better Korean restaurants elsewhere in PGH.Since me and one of my friends had never tried Korean BBQ before, we decided to order the pork belly version to share ($27). The waitress suggested that we get something else to ensure that there was enough food, so we ordered the chicken from the Chinese-Korean section ($16).  Finally, we ordered soju to go with our meal ($12), at the suggestion of my other friend, who's been to S. Korea.  Every one of these items, without exception, was subpar.  The pork belly, normally one of my favorite items to order, was chewy and flavorless, indicating low quality meat and overcooking.  The chicken was something straight out of an Americanized Chinese take-out place, consisting of fried and breaded pieces smothered in a thick, sweet sauce with some vegetables sprinkled in for good measure.  Some of the chicken pieces were almost completely dry, whereas others were gooey from sitting in the sauce, making for an inconsistent and undesirable texture.  The soju was sweetish and watery, despite being straight from the bottle.The service we received was equally bad. Our waitress didn't stop by our table once after our food arrived.  Our waters remained unfilled, and the banchan that came with the KBBQ weren't replenished, which should be standard, according to my friend who visited S. Korea.  Indeed, we had to ask the person who came to bus our table for the check.  As other reviewers have mentioned, this place is grossly understaffed--our waitress was the only one working, except for the person bussing tables.In the words of my friend who's visited S. Korea, we were very unimpressed with the quality of food and service we received at Korea Garden.  To add insult onto injury, the prices are quite inflated--we could have had a solid meal at the hot pot place up the street for equal or less than what I paid for this meal.  If you're in the mood for Asian food in Oakland, I strongly suggest checking out that place (Top Shabu Shabu), or one of the other Chinese restaurants nearby.  If you're in the mood for Korean, try Green Pepper in SqHill or Nakwon Garden in Shadyside.  Regardless of what you're in the mood for or how close you want to stay, I guarantee that you can find a meal with better quality, prices, and service at any number of nearby restaurants.
Wing Lei=We made reservations at Wing Lei since it was a convenient location after seeing Spamalot at the Wynn. It sounded impressive, what with it being the only Chinese restaurant in North America to have a Michelin star, plus the Peking Duck Five Course menu sounded delicious. Things got off to a bad start when we had to wait well past our reservation time, but the manager did comp our first round of drinks as a result. When we were finally seated, we did enjoy the decor of the room, but we were really hungry after having being kept waiting, and we weren't offered appetizers or amuses or anything to hold us over. My husband was especially "hangry."Two of us opted for the Peking Duck Five Course menu, and two of us opted for the Chef's Signature Dinner. Two of us got the suggested wine pairings (which was questionable to begin with, since I don't think wine generally goes with Chinese food, but due to the so-called "French influence" they claimed on the menu, I thought maybe they could pull it off. Not so much.).  I think for all of us, the first course was our favorite. I had the duck menu, so my first course was classic Peking roasted duck served with mandarin pancakes - you can't go wrong with that dish. Things went downhill from there, though. My second dish was a duck salad, which was quite delicious, but our server didn't bring the wine pairing until about 10 minutes later. The next course was a duck soup, and they forgot to bring the wine, period. When they finally brought it, it was the wrong wine, and it took yet another long wait to finally get the right one. The fourth and fifth courses were served together, and while they were not bad at all, they were basically just slopped together on the plate like a Panda Express combo bowl. For a restaurant of this caliber, I expect much classier presentation, and frankly, more subtle and refined dishes. I should have known better, having just returned from Taiwan, where I was treated to wedding banquet food extraordinaire that was picture perfect each and every time. I think I'll have to refrain from "fine dining" Chinese from now on, as there is no way it is going to meet my expectations. We really felt cheated after our meal. The food was good, but the service was not up to par, and the overall experience was definitely not worth what we paid.It seems like the bad reviews for this place were mainly because of the pricing of the menu. The reviews with 1-2 stars seem to say that Chinese food shouldn't be expensive. It makes me sad that people have categorized Chinese food into cheap eats and that the general impression of Chinese food is that it should not be expensive. Maybe the countless Chinese take-away places popping up all over America have helped reinforced this stereotype.First of all, in terms of the price and atmosphere at Wing Lei, it is no different than if you dined at a very nice Chinese restaurant in Singapore, Hong Kong, and Malaysia. In fact, it is very common to have Chinese restaurants like these and in this price range (and sometimes even more expensive) in Asia. Chinese food does not only belong to the cheap take-away food category. If there can be an expensive steak house, the same is said for a very good Chinese restaurant. Wing Lei reminded us alot of the very good Chinese restaurants we've been to in several parts of Asia and we were impressed as to how close Wing Lei tries to execute their concept.We had the 6-course peking duck tasting menu and loved every bit of it. We also thought that for $88 per person it was quite a good deal. In fact, we imagined that doing this same tasting menu in an equally fancy restaurant in Singapore or Hong Kong would have cost us more. We had the duck meat and skin served on an incredibly soft bun, duck salad, duck wonton with broth, stir-fried duck with veg, egg noodles with duck, and mango sorbet for dessert. The amount of food was definitely more than substantial and we were already very full before dessert. The service was also good, friendly, and professional. We asked if they had Thai birds eye chilli (we love our food spicy!) and the server said they would ask the kitchen to chop some of the fresh chillis for us. Overall we were impressed with Wing Lei. It was definitely a well deserved Michelin star they received.Double the price, double the quality?  No.Double the price, double the flavor?  NopeDouble the price, double the winnings in the casino? You're kidding right.The Strip has a sprinkling of very "high end"  Chinese restaurants that cater to wealthy, gaming crazed, visitors from Asia.  Wing Lei is unusual in that it focuses on Americanized Chinese food (what you expect to find in your usual takeout place) rather than Asian delicacies.  So does spending $34 for an order of orange beef or walnut prawns make it better than your favorite dive?The food.  The walnut prawns were outstanding.  Fresh, sweet, perfectly cooked with the right balance of crispy coating and not overly sweet honey cream sauce (it's not mayo).   The orange beef is well cooked, tender.  It is dressed in a tangerine, yuzu, and garlic chili sauce that adds a nice acidic balance but lacks the flavor punch you expect.  Finally, mu shu pork, watered down, week flavor thanks to the cabbage releasing its water.  Underwhelming.A beautiful dining room.  Spotless place settings.  Excellent but very restrained service (servers serve, not converse).Special Note:  The prices on the menu do not adhere to the Asian belief that that "4" is bad luck and "8" is good luck.  (Before you get all practical on me, I firmly believe "depend on the rabbit's foot if you will, but just remember it didn't work out too well for the rabbit."By the way, the answer to the question:  No.My family and I came ages ago, sometime in the late 00's (so long ago, I can't even remember), because my dad had a $150 gift card. This review is clearly long overdue, but here's my two cents anyway.First, the decor is absolutely gorgeous. With red, gold, and black accents, the ambience is very elegant and luxurious. One of the things I remember most about our dinner was not the food, but the beautiful chairs they had at every table. There were some tables that had booth seats on one side, against the wall, and those were just as opulent.At the time, my parents didn't want to go over the $150, so there were only so many things we could order. As I'm Taiwanese, I don't see a reason to spend more than $20 (heck, even $10) on one Chinese dish. Majority of the plates here are at least $30, going as high as $90. I'm glad I'm fortunate enough to live in an area where authentic Chinese & Taiwanese food is readily available for less than $10. Anyway, between the four of us, I believe we shared 3-4 plates. Since this was awhile back, I don't remember exactly what we ordered; just that it was surprisingly tasty.I would love to come back again for dinner, even though I don't remember the specifics. Considering that Asian fusion restaurants seem to cater to non-Asians more -- I'm looking at you P.F. Chang's -- I'm just happy that I didn't find the food repulsive. Wing Lei is an upscale restaurant with tasty Chinese food that will appeal to even the harshest native Chinese food critic.Michelin: 1 star (2009)This review is for their seasonal Chinese New Year Brunch which ran for 2 weeks.  The price was $68.88 and it came with an insane amount of food.  For the seafood fans, there's 5-6 selections of sushi, shrimp cocktail, king crab claws, oysters, and whole lobsters.....And this isn't like the old Rio seafood buffet where you see asians fighting over and topping their plates full of lobster 7-8 deep.  There's so many options everyone will be pleased.The dim sum rolled around every 15 minutes or so.  There was lobster, scallop, and shark fin dumpling along with your standard dim sum fare.  The soy sauce chicken, duck, and pork belly were especially delicious.If you're still going strong, there's about a dozen hot entree items such as filet mignon tips, sea bass, two kinds of shrimp (curry and chile sauce) and yee mien.There's a huge dinosaur size tomohawk chop for the meat lovers and 3 soups to choose from.  For dessert save room for the flaky dan tat egg custard, sesame balls, or their assortment of non asian desserts.Overall everything was good but nothing really blew me away.  Having had the Mozen brunch a month ago, Wing Lei is head and shoulders above it in all areas.  Since Wing Lei is seasonal I'd take advantage and try it out once.  The one thing that was annoying was they charged $48.88 for children under 6.  I dont' have any kids but that's certainly Wing's way of telling you to leave them behind.** PS - Had their Peking Duck tasting menu and it was amazing - super expensive - i'd love to come back for dinner but i'm asian so paying 40-50 bucks for one plate of food is insane - maybe next time on someone's dime. **I wish we could have experienced this restaurant when it was truly worth a Michelin Star because it definitely would not make the cut today. We stopped by for dinner on a Sunday evening. We made reservations for 6pm and were seated right away upon arrival.The service is very cordial and the decor is very nice. We were there early in the evening, so I guess the staff felt relaxed. A cook stood outside the kitchen and rubbed his back on a doorway corner like a bear on a tree. Nice.We ordered the Peking Duck, Mapo Tofu and Cantonese Sausage Rice. The "Peking Duck" is very suspect. I can't say for certain it isn't real Peking Duck, but it certainly did not taste like it. It very much tasted like regular old roast duck. The tofu and the rice were very good, but I would certainly hope so for what they are charging their entrees for.Basically, you could have a comparable or BETTER tasting Chinese meal at any number of other good Chinese restaurants in town for a quarter of the price. Sure, the decor is very nice, but does that warrant a 300% difference in price? The experience one would like from a former one Michelin Star restaurant just isn't there.This was our second visit to Wing Lei.  The first was several years ago when I had ordered a second expensive round of small pan-fried pot stickers in order to be filled enough by my favorite Chinese appetizer.  Not this time!After a delicate amuse bouche of a Cherry Tomato & Cucumber in a ceramic dish, I was quite pleased to be presented with five large and nicely tanned Pan-Seared Pot Sticker beauties that were stuffed with minced pork, cabbage, and pickled ginger, and accompanied by Garlic-ginger Soy Sauce for dipping.  This fine starter was then followed by a hot bowl of tasty Vegetable Hot & Sour Soup with sufficient but not too much spicy heat, Woodear Mushrooms, Bamboo Shoots, and egg.For my entree I enjoyed very tender medium-rare Garlic Beef Tenderloin with Heirloom Bell Peppers, Green Cauliflower, Sugar Peas, Black Mushrooms, and a side of Yang Chow Fried Rice festooned with shrimp, BBQ pork, and scallions.  This afforded me a great juxtaposition of harmonizing flavors.Meanwhile Diane savored her entree of Walnut Prawns that sported quite large prawns, brawny glazed walnuts, and an inventive creamy mayonnaise-like Honey Cream Sauce spread over all to nicely conjoin the two principal elements. I finished with two large creamy scoops of Almond Cookie Ice Cream and Chocolate Ice Cream.  Then came complimentary chocolates and other candied confections.  Had I known they would be produced, in all likelihood I would not have ordered dessert.  But I did enjoy my ice cream as well as a few of the sweet treats.Service was exemplary, with unbidden refills of water and hot tea.  Ambiance was exceptionally elegant.  And, there was even a pursestool placed near our table to support a lady's purse.  The tariff here is high, but the dining experience we had this last time out was worth every penny.
Logan's Roadhouse=Where to go on a Saturday night, when you are craving some good steak, but Outback is played out, wallet's too thin for Morton's or Ruth's Chris, and the line at Texas Roadhouse is out the door?Logan's Steakhouse at the Chandler Fashion Center. I'd never been here before, though it's just a few minutes from my house, but I'm glad we gave it a shot, after driving all the way to Texas Roadhouse (TR) in Gilbert only to learn we'd have to wait at least 50 minutes to be seated. Very similar to TR (or exactly like it), the place is covered in peanut shells, and there are buckets of peanuts at every table. However, unlike TR, the place was slow, and we were seated immediately. First the service... The wait staff was very friendly and attentive, our glasses were always full, and our server came by to check on us regularly. I don't think I can say the same about the kitchen staff. Not sure where the communication or the process might have broken down, but it took ridiculously long for us to get our meals, though our salads came out immediately. As for the food... The salads were alright. nothing to write home about. We just got the side salad (house salad comprised of iceberg and romaine, tomatoes, cheddar cheese, shredded carrots, and some onions). Italian dressing for me, Balsamic Vinaigrette for the boyfriend.When we finally got our food, it was darn good though! I ordered the 6 oz. filet mignon, medium well, with a grilled vegetable skewer. The  boyfriend ordered the sirloin with the veggie and shrimp skewers, and a baked sweet potato. We both really enjoyed the meals. The steaks were perfection. The vegetables could have used a tad LESS seasoning/salt, but still tasty.We wrestled with the impulse to order their little Nutter Butter dessert -a mini version of their peanut bucket, full of chocolate mousse, fudge and nutter butter filling topped with whipped cream. It's only $1.99 and TINY. But we didn't order it... ya know, we're watching our figures.The manager and our server seemed to have noticed that our order took abnormally long to come out of the kitchen, and we were comped 50% off our entire bill. We still tipped our server on the full price of the meal, as it was certainly no fault of hers, and her service was great!The food was great, the service was great, and I honestly think the issue with the delay in getting our food was an isolated incident, not the norm. We'll definitely eat there again.
Cantina Laredo=So I have been lured back several times......It's such a scam they suck you in with the fancy menu and these Fab chips and salsa, trust me after eating those you'd expect to the food to be pretty damn good, but NO ,to Quote Jenn H.  it is  "Blech. Die."If and when I come back I'll stick to the chips and salsa, I also would usually order the table side gauc , but have found that they put such large chunks of onion and jalapeno it really takes away from it.......take your time chef and finely chop that shit!!I'll give 5 stars for the chips and salsaand 1.5 for the food, but you can't have both!Dang, Cantina Laredo - I wanted to like you so hard!  Like a hot date that ends in a restraining order, like an incredible hike that ends in poison oak or skunk spray - I've walked past this place for years, imagining a swanky, high-end Mexican food joint behind the dark windows and high prices; sadly, what I found was a very regular, uninspired restaurant serving up some rather meh Mexican food.  This was a 'man behind the curtain' Wizard of Oz moment for me.Good things?  Mmmmmm - the warm spicy salsa which they serve along with another milder cold one (not so good) and chips is the reason this place gets 2 very enthusiastic stars from me - SO DELICIOUS!  It was hook-me-up-to-a-feed-bag delicious.  Service was quick and pleasant.After that though, it all goes downhill.  Being vegetarian, I can 99% of the time find something meatless and tasty when I go out to eat but there were very few such options here.  I ended up selecting the Enchiladas de Espinaca and subbed in a Cheese & Onion one to shake things up a bit (I know, I'm very exciting).  When my meal came out, the waitress said she had the kitchen put zucchini alongside my Mexican rice instead of beans (wtf - who in their right mind opts out of beans for zucchini at a Mexican food restaurant?!); so began the first of my meal modifications - I might note here that while being veggie, I am a pretty low-maintenance diner.  So, just as the black beans are being brought out, I realize the sauce atop my cheese enchilada consists of red chili with beef chunks - again wtf - in my 31 years of life on this earth, no Mexican food joint I've ever visited has ever converted a cheese enchilada to a meat one via the sauce!  The waitress said they could make me a new cheese & onion with sour cream sauce atop (cringe).  The mushroom and spinach enchilada was kinda gross - something about the oil they used to sauté the spinach in gave it a strange taste and the button mushrooms looked like they had been plunked into it straight out of a can.  The zucchini and cheese & onion enchilada were nothing I would ever want to order again.  Black beans were alright - hard to mess those up though.  In defense of Cantina Laredo, if you're a big meat eater, perhaps you might have more luck here than I.  The place was clean, the workers were nice, the one aforementioned salsa is killer.  But this place is neither authentic nor new-agey Mexican, not worthy of the steeper price points, and certainly lacks any great ambience to carry the lackluster food.  Don't think I will be auditioning this place for a second date or hike - would strongly consider rolling around in poison oak or getting skunk sprayed over coming back - it was that bad.
Juan Jaime's=I saw a bad review which really surprises me. I go there often, but wouldn't call myself a regular. I don't know any bartenders' names or anything. But, I've never had a bad taco, bad service or bad anything ever here. The crowd always seems chill. The patio is nice. I like the red lighting. Good for street watching too. Their food always tastes fresh and their salsa bar is very yummy! Tequilas-great selection. I believe Herradura is one of my faves. I say, can't go wrong with this spot. If you like a casual fresh Mexican kind of sporty type bar with a lot of modern touches and nice staff, don't see why you wouldn't enjoy!So when I get up on Saturday mornings I make sure my husband has started on the mile-long honey-do list I've left him, and I shake my finger at him and then say, "No Bud Light until you're finished with that list, Mister," and then I pile on a gallon of some Jessica Simpson designer imposter perfume, put on my yoga pants, a push-up bra, my most over-priced tank top, and grab my squalling 16-month-old to go meet up with my best girl, Traycee, and shop at Nordstrom Rack.  We drag my kid, Barrington, all over the store, and he's screaming the whole way, but really, who cares?  Then we head to Juan Jaime's for half a bottle of tequila and a couple of tortilla chips, and Barrington is still screaming, but again, who cares?  I  had a great time and jacked the credit card up six- or eight-hundred dollars.  I forget, but I don't pay the bill so whatever.  Man.  There is a whole other world out there, and I'm glad I don't live in it.  But sadly, sometimes I catch the effects of it.I am so glad we finally tried Juan Jaime's.  Ladena has always been our server, and she is awesome.  She makes sure those drinks don't get empty and is quick with the food and the check as well.  I have a new love.  It's their pomegranate margarita.  Delicious!  Right now I can't feel my elbows or my kneecaps and I'm pretty sure I only weigh 110 pounds.  That's a great drink!  We've also had the street dog lunch special, the carnitas and beef tacos, the nachos, and the cheese enchiladas.  Everything is tasty and reasonably priced.  Next time we'll have to try the patio where we can then be entertained by all the bad drivers on Chandler Blvd.  GREAT place!
Wingstop=I went to bed late the night before, and still woke up at 6:30am. I don't even actively day trade stocks right now, so that was annoying.  In spite of the less than stellar start to the day, my favorite Asian agreed to meet me for lunch and I offered her a choice between wings or ramen.  Deep down I knew she was gonna pick chicken wings, but nearly every fiber of my being was hoping she would surprise me again and go for ramen.  It was barely in the mid 50s at the time we were exchanging texts, negotiating my term of unconditional something or other.  While she casually mentioned that she wasn't at home but was at one of the mid-tier Strip hotel.  Okay, maybe the guy spent all his budget on 12 Blue Moon and 8 Red Bull (sugar free), plus the room and there was nothing left for brunch. Whatever the case, he is off to ride back to his crib on the West side or Cali or wherever.  A lot of weeds to whack to get the girl, that's just the reality and the struggle.Anyway, I will skip the tangential details and get straight down to the business of reviewing my very first ever Wingstop experience.  As you are probably already aware, there are multiple Wingstop locations dotted throughout the Las Vegas valley.  Most locations open at 11am, but this location on Tropicana wins the early bird prize by opening at 9am.  The simple menu is the same, as far as I can tell, across all locations.  You basically have wings (classic bone-in and boneless) and crispy chicken tenders to select from, with 11 wing flavors and whatever limited time promo they are offering.  The dipping sauces (ranch, honey mustard, blue cheese and spicy chipotle) are extra, unless you order their combos or family packs. Their fries are actually not bad, and a large is really more than enough.Service is swift and professional. But your order will still take up to 18 minutes, which the cashier will inform you as you place your order.  So call ahead or be prepared to wait.The wings was just okay, because my wings were on the overcooked side, and not really moist and juicy.  The Cajun sauce was spicy, but tolerable, but eat a lot and the heat will build up and surely burn you later.  Lemon Pepper was good, but damn was it salty.  Hawaiian was decent, with mild sweetness and no heat.  You also have the option to ask for your wings to be served "wet".Overall, the food was okay (3 stars).  Spending time catching up over a bunch of fried chicken wings with my fav Asian, talking about random stuff made the Wingstop excursion well worth the price of a 24 piece family pack (which was surprisingly heavy - pretty sure it is enough to split with 4 people with normal appetite).  I would do it again if she still wants wings.
The Original Burrito Co=You'd think it's hard to go wrong with a burro. Well, I've had my fair share of bad ones. But the chili rojo I got at the Original Burrito Co. was done right! Pork, rather than beef! Lots of it! Lots of the spicy sauce! Deliciousness abounds!Also, take a note from me and be sure to read before doing.Clearly, I don't pay attention as much as I should, but.......When I see a bar of salsa, my first instinct is to run...toward it. Then of course I realize that there are only paper cups without lids to put said salsas and pico in. When you've got an order to-go, this could be tricky. Then you might notice the sign that says that salsa comes prepackaged with your to-go meal. I am such a ditz sometimes.Anyway, after a few mix-ups, and me being a nervous and easily embarrassed person, we finally got home with the goods. And like I already said, everything was pretty solid. The salsa was nice and spicy with good flavor, although I thought the tomatoes in the pico were a little mushy. The tostadas looked pretty nice, too.The menu was also pretty expansive, and I'm sure any of their burritos, platters, or tacos are excellent.Despite the fact that they tell you their beans are vegetarian, and put them in the vegetarian burrito, The Original Burrito Company makes their beans with CHICKEN STOCK. This is false information they are providing to people, and when people have moral issues with consuming meat, this turns into a huge issue.I will never eat here again. I do not support businesses that are dishonest.
Tortas El Guero=7/01/10I've had Tortas El Guero bookmarked for a couple of weeks when a friend told me of the wonderful torta she had here recently, I thought I'd visit it on my next days off.  Came in prior to 430p, and the woman manning the counter could not speak any English at all.  Good thing I still retained a little of basic Spanish to request that a few ingredients be omitted.  (Had I waited till 5p, I'd have no problem w/ the bilingual Caucasian server that arrived.)  Chose the carne asada torta, and the bread was good.  However, the filling was very sparse.  I suggest that TEG either use smaller-sized bread, or up the filling a bit!  The cost of the sandwich is definitely too high-- I wouldn't order this same sandwich for that price again (especially when I could order a huge serving that is equally as tasty, perhaps more so, at Phoenix Ranch Market-- the telera bread there is amazing!).  Indeed, I had to order two side tacos for their meat contents (pastor y carne asada) to be able to fill in the rest of the torta :(  Based on what I tried, if I were to come back, I'd order the pastor.  I don't think I'll be back, though.(I will, however, visit the Michoacan ice cream parlor again next door!!  The coffee and mango flavors I tried were delicious!  What I wouldn't do to have some of the coffee right now...)
Pasqual's=Re-visited Pasqual's tonight for dinner with a co-worker, and we were seated next to the kitchen, where we had a full, un-fettered view of the kitchen works.Our server was friendly and prompt; chips and salsa were good, as usual.  A Dos Equis Amber (from the tap) was crisp and fresh.What bothered me was watching the food preparation process. Nothing is made fresh.  They have chafing dishes and refrigerated containers that contain all of the "pieces" of your meal.  Depending on your order, they scoop from various containers, assemble, plate, and then cover with a plastic lid.  From there, it's into a microwave - they have a bank of them - where your food is nuked until warm.  Or, in my case, until it's still refrigerator cold in the middle...I'm sorry, but I don't feel it's fair to pay $10 for 2 tacos that are improperly microwaved... I watched as *every single* entree was processed through the assembly line like this.  I could describe to you in perfect detail the steel-grey microwaves, the greyish-colored lids, and the workers that were cranking out the reheated food plate after plate... I saw several entrees that had sat too long after being nuked go back into the microwave for a second reheating before being presented to diners.I won't be back.  Hell, Chipotle prepares its food in-mass prior to serving, but at least it's kept warm/hot and served relatively fresh.  And, it costs about 2/3 as much.It's sad that this Pasqual's even shares the same name as the one on Monroe st, because if this were my only Pasqual's experience, I'd never go back.  I used to love the old Atwood location, and the Monroe one is good too.  This newest addition just sucks.  First off, It's big and dark, yet like an old factory.  Huh?The food selection is slightly different than the Pasqual's on Monroe street too.  Just weird stuff.  And what is with the bakery/coffee shop?  The table setup is strange too.  Every table is awkward, and the place is cold.Just do yourself a favor, and don't go here.
Clarendon Kitchen + Bar C4=C4. I want to understand you. Like I want to understand why my neighbor wears a Members Only jacket. Like I want to understand gay Republicans. And who was the first person to put vegetables in jell-0. I do C4. But ya gotta help me. The bar decor is all about the 4 tvs. That's cool I guess. But other than that, where am I supposed to sit? My vodka cran was weak. When I asked for a remake and let's make it a double. It arrived in a pint glass. Yes a pint glass. I didn't want double the drink. Just double on the booze pour. I wanted a greyhound, but the bartender never heard of that. I'm sure he thought I was trying to book a trip to Bakersfield or something. Come to find out C4, you just don't carry grapefruit juice. The sushi rolls were actually worse than something I would pick up at the grocery store. The teriyaki wings were passable, but a little dry. I do believe someone in the group enjoyed a burger. The dining room has a big spot with nothing in it, right below the cool painting of, I believe a dragon of some sort. Hey, how about a sofa or loungey kinda area? Since I can't seem to find a seat in the bar. And since we're neighbors C4, I'm gonna stop by again. Maybe I'll bring my friend with the Member's Only jacket.I have an entire box of conversation hearts left over from Valentine's Day and these little morsels are going to be the inspiration for this review. Let the taste of cherry flavored death and pastel sidewalk chalk begin!"My man" and I decided to join a group of ten at C4 last night to enjoy the company of a quirky group of "romeo"s and "dream girl"s and sample the new Southwest inspired menu at C4.I was impressed at "how nice" the decor was in the main dining area, since I had previously only frequented the bar and sampled some of the wretched Japanese inspired bar food. It's nice to see a restaurant "wise up" and invest a little "tlc" into reworking its image, as well as its menu. I thought that the bold, colorful Mexican centerpieces and hanging crystal light pieces were "tres chic" and when I saw the same strong use of color duplicated on the chair backs it was "true love" for me. I wanted to steal all the light fixtures, knick-knacks and tall chairs for my own home.It was Valentine's Day and I had to order something to drink that was as frou frou and girly as my polka dot party dress, because when "ur a qt" you simply have to be sipping something just as ultra-femme. So I went for the Prickly (pear) Peach Martini and was not disappointed by its "sweet," pulpy, hot pink contents.For apps, we ordered two platters of the tri-colored chips with three dips and the crab cakes. When it came to the dips, there was "one I love"d, the napolito corn salsa. The other two, guacamole and pico de gallo, "I hope" get better with time because the pico was bland and the guacamole was so overpowered by lime juice that it was nigh on inedible. The crab cakes on the other hand "I'm sure" I would order again because there was a good crab to filler ratio and a pleasant spicy kick delivered by the chipotle remoulade. "Lover boy" and I split the bacon cheeseburger and the chorizo mac and cheese for dinner, both of which I wanted to be "all mine" because they were so good I didn't want to share a single bite with "my baby." I was hoping the burger would "be good" but I wasn't expecting it to be cooked to perfection and served with crisp tomatoes and a lovely pile of spring mix instead of some of the more lowly greens available. It also came with a side of fries that were more like munching on a plank of potato if you "ask me." And feel free to "call me" crazy, but they must have sprinkled "stardust" on the chorizo mac and cheese because it was out of this world good! You could ask any of the three people that ordered it at our table if that's too good to "be true" and I'm sure you'd receive the same response as mine. Spicy, tender homemade chorizo was afloat in three types of decadent cheesy bliss!We ended the night with two dessert sampler platters, and if you have more than at least three people at the table, I highly suggest you take "time out" of your evening to indulge because it was "way" good. I am in "love" with two of the desserts in specific, the frozen key lime tart and the Mexican chocolate flourless cake. The key lime tart was "cool" and citric and I let it melt in my mouth like a bite of sorbet with a graham cracker crust and tasty little candied lime zest. The "cutie pie" slice of Mexican chocolate flourless cake was rich and dense with a deep cocoa flavor and a hint of spiciness at the end that "let it be" a bit more unpredictable and memorable than regular chocolate desserts. The borracho bread pudding wasn't as drunk as its name suggested (or as pudding-y) and the 7 layer chocolate cake was the same "you & me" could get the valley over. The waitress we had was an "angel." She was extremely knowledgeable about all of the dishes on the menu and went so far as to open a dialogue with the chef when a member of our party needed a vegetarian, lactose free meal (who could that possibly be? ":)" ). I "loved her," and even though service was a little bit scattered, I attribute that more to having to deal with drink orders and food delivery at the same time (for a pretty big group) than any kind of slacking. It wasn't perfect and could definitely use some refining, but since that was the only minor hang-up in the evening, I'm going to "let it be" forgotten."I do" think C4 has the possibility of becoming a five star dining experience. It just needs a bit of polishing!Don't agree? "Fax me." (Sorry, I just had to include the most ridiculously out of date conversation heart saying in the history of Necco. The rest of them were just too ordinary.)EDIT: 3/30/08Ok, I'm downgrading to 3 stars.  Now C4 is still a good place, but recent visits have shown the restrooms to be consistent disasters.  Water overflowing with caution signs and bars of soap and lack of paper towels.  Yuck. My last visit on a Friday night, the restaurant ran out of macaroni when I was looking forward to the Chorizo Mac and Cheese.  I had to settle for a shrimp quesadilla which was ok, but nothing near the deliciousness of the mac and cheese.Review - 2/16/08My huge Elton John glasses are off to Ben, his cute dog and his team at C4 and the Clarendon Hotel. I'm impressed with how quickly C4 underwent changes to the restaurant and menu.  I'll keep this quick because Erica's awesome review covers it all.The chorizo mac and cheese was very delicious. I'm all about all things cheese and love a bit of spice, so this was an obvious choice when I saw it on the menu. It was also only $7, but should you be in a sandwich or burger mood, the California Club with the usual fixings and chipotle mayo also delivered for my friend Bobo.   The potato wedges that came with it were huge...I'm talking quarters of potatoes here.Our party of 10 got dramatically improved service from our last experience, and only toward the end did I tip off the server that we were guests of Ben's from Yelp.   Yes, one person got their appetizer tortilla soup....for dessert!  But other than that, our server was gracious, chatty and demonstrated knowledge of the new menu.  The best part of the service was after dinner when Ben and his cute dog asked us how dinner was and we gave him our feedback.The best parts of the new C4 beside the Chorizo mac and cheese?* A stunning rooftop bar and cool happy hour promotion with different DJ and comfy patio furniture to watch the glittering Central Phoenix skyline and relax in a fab setting reminiscent of the Standard Hotel in L.A.  * Desserts. The flourless Mexican chocolate cake was incredible, with the flavors of both spice and cocoa that left us all wanting more.  The key lime cheesecake had great hints of lime zest throughout.The warm Santa Fe orange paint on the walls and new Southwestern/Native art in the glass case suggested a new direction for the restaurant -- one that I'm pleased with and hope continues to be improved upon.  3.5 stars for food and service and 5 stars for effort by management.Original review - January 2008I feel like I'm being generous with the two-star rating. After coming here a few times for drinks I was waiting for a dining experience to actually rate the place, but two stars is all it gets. Quite simply, the food and the service stunk. I understand the difficulty of serving 14 people, but our server got little to no help from other servers, which is surprising because it wasn't even all that busy. There is a reason why the cocktails are more expensive than the food, it's because the drinks are better. J-man and Lauren pretty much cover it all. I will add that half of our party seemed to be ok with the food, but the other half thought it was disgusting. My mahi mahi sandwich with mango salsa was probably the driest sandwich I have ever had. I had to wait about 10 minutes to eat it though because the server had to replace the bun after she accidentally knocked the bun off the sandwich when she served me. It probably dried out from the wait. The fries were decent. The "house fries" were described as a mixture of french fries and sweet potato fries. The reality? 30 french fries and 2 sweet potato fries. I made sure to eat the sweet potato fries really slowly to make them last longer.The only saving graces here were the cocktails and the pokemons. I kinda like them! The drinks were decent, but they took forever to arrive after ordering. Do yourself a favor and don't dine here. C4 will be a drinks only place for me.I am partial to indepedent, non-chain restaurants and especially ones with a casual feel and no attitude.  And ones with great food.I've eaten at C4 four times now with its newly revised menu and have not been disappointed.  The atmosphere is cool and understately hip.  The food is terrific and reasonably priced.The food:I am addicted to the super-delicious corn & poblano chili chowder soup.  Absolute perfection.  I order it every time.Other recommended dishes:Appetizers:  tres queso quesadillo, crab cakesSoups:  the chili stewEntrees:  the tilapia dish, the pork chop dish, the chorizo mac & cheese, the burgersDesserts:  lime tart (tastes like lemon drop candy), bread pudding, apple cobblerAll of the food is prepared fresh, including the desserts.  I've had the pleasure of touring the kitchen and meeting the cook staff.  You can see the pride in their faces as they prepare and talk about the food.A great restaurant for one, for two, for four, for six, or more persons.  Be sure to check out the rest of the hotel while you're there:  the rooftop with its incredible sunset and downtown views and the jawdropping pool area.Top 3 WORST Dining Experience EVER!Saturday night my girl and I decided to check this place out, excited for the change in menu and an "Old School Mexican Food" experience.  We were thoroughly disappointed in almost every possible way.We arrived at about 9:15pm and didn't get out of there until 11:15pm... TWO hours for $9/plate Mexican food.  Did I mention we were 1 of 3 TOTAL parties in there?  No big parties, two tables of 4 and our party of 2.  Service was so poor and slow it was comical.  The waitress would disappear for LONG periods of time.  Maybe smoking weed or something, I have no idea....?  Weed would explain why it took 20minutes after ordering a scoop of sorbet before it found it's way to our table.Now the food.  Junk at best.  First, after literally 45mins-1hr after being seated, our food finally arrived.... COLD... not luke-warm, cold.  I had grilled chicken w/ rice and beans, my girl had chicken soft tacos.  We sent our plates back and the waitress said she would have the kitchen remake the meal immediately.  Well, 25minutes later the new plates arrived.  Really?  25 minutes to remake a plate of grilled chicken and soft tacos then slap a spoon of rice and beans on the plate?  Now the second time the food STILL was not hot... this time it was luke-warm.  Whatever, we were starving, so we ate it.  The food itself lacked any seasoning and frankly any taste.  I can make better Mexican food at home, shit, Filiberto's makes better Mexican food.  Interesting also, the second plates had portions about 1/2 of what was delivered initially.  I usually have left overs and don't really like huge portions, so this was fine with me, but it just goes to show the lack of consistency.The waitress was always very nice and courteous, and she did offer us a free item to make up for the cold food, so she appeared to be trying, I just don't understand what the issue was.  We were not alone in a bad experience.... one table of 4, sitting behind us, ordered a nacho appetizer with guac on the side... well she brought one out with guac all over it, explaining there was a mistake and another one was being made, but they could have this one also, instead of throwing it away.  Well their 2nd one, prepared correctly, didn't come out until AFTER they were all 4 done with their meals!  The other party of 4 who were seated before we even arrived, didn't get their food for 15 minutes after our first cold plate... meaning they waited at least 1 hour for their food and they ordered before us!  They had burritos... burritos!  How long can it possibly take to make a burrito?Dinner's over, and I decide to try a refreshing sorbet I had eyed on the menu earlier.  I don't eat dairy or wheat, so when I see a dessert item that has neither ingredient, I get excited.  There are not too many deserts around that are made without wheat or dairy.  They had a few very good sounding selections, I opted for Passion Fruit.  So 20 minutes later, when my single scoop of sorbet arrived, I dove right in...... and almost spit it out!  It was the w-o-r-s-t tasting sorbet I have ever encountered... in fact, I don't think it was prepared properly, or even sorbet.  It was the most sour, most tart thing I have ever tasted.... to the point where it was literally impossible to NOT make a face after taking a bite (like the super-sour-face).  My girl thought I was joking and being dramatic so she took a bite.... haha, you should have seen her face.  Classic.  Un-edible.  It literally had the consistency, and tasted like that frozen fruit juice concentrate you buy in the store, without ANY sugar.  It was horrible.  Horrible.Sad really... I truly wanted to like this place.  The atmosphere and decorations are very cool, chic, and modern.  It really _looks_ tight, but produced one of my 3 worst experiences ever.  Funny thing is, I had a gift certificate, so I got most of the meal and 4 martini's free..... and I still hated every second of it and would have absolutely rather gone anywhere else and paid.Well to start off there was not much I could eat considering most of the food had trans fat. The ice cream they serve has mono and diglycerides (trans fat) they use grocery brand buns with High Fructose corn syrup and partially Hydrogenated oil (Also Trans Fat) Me and Jamie ate her on NYE so maybe it is different . Jamie ate an alfredo pasta that I didn't touch (white sauces disgust me) Later that evening she started shaking and holding her stomach. On the drive home she said she felt like she was going to puke but I figured she was just expressing how bad she felt. I offered to pull over and she said she couldn't wait that long. I look over and she had grabbed a Harkins cup from the floor and started puking in it then dumping it out the window to make room for more alfredo vomit. It was smelling garlicky fresh in there. I'm sure with it being New Year it looked great throwing cups of vomit out the window, even though we don't drink. Since we don't drink we were probably the only ones who knew this was not alcohol induced vomiting. Oh something else I saw that night. The chef brought out some food in a cater style pan. As he was setting it down the dish rag he was holding was dragging all over the food, WTF?!
Frank & Fina's Cocina=Met a colleague here for lunch the other day.  It was my first visit to Frank & Fina's.  I arrived early and was seated promptly by the hostess.  While I was browsing the menu, the owner Frank came out with Chips & Salsa and asked for my drink order suggesting a Margarita or Beer....hmmm, ok!  You don't have to ask me twice in a Mexican Restaurant if I want a Margi or Beer.  I ordered a Pacifico....what the hell, I don't have to go into an office and my afternoon was clear.While I waited for my friend, I decided I'd order the Nachos.  He arrived a few minutes later saw my Pacifico and ordered one for himself....I love how contagious Beer in a Mexican Restaurant can be!  We ordered our lunch and I like how the waitress asked me if wanted Jalapenos on my Nachos....I asked her if they could cut it fresh and put a lot on top...she said yes.We had a nice conversation while we waited for our food, which came out a short time after we ordered.  The place was packed for lunch and I expected the service to be much slower, but it wasn't.The Nachos were very good.  The proportion of Cheese, Guacamole, and Sour Cream were just right.  The proportion of Salsa and Onions were good too, relative to the amount of Chips.  The portion was on the Appetizer menu and it could easily feed two or three.  It's not a huge pile of Nachos like you find in some restaurants. For $5.50, it's not bad.  The flavor of all the ingredients were very good too.  The only complaint I have is that the Chips are too thin....they broke easily with the slightest amount of pressure....which forced me to eat most of the Nachos with a Fork.  That's sacrilegious to some Nachos aficionados...LOLWe had another Pacifico and continued our conversation for a while after lunch.  It was a pleasant experience.  As a bonus, I ran into two friends I haven't seen in 8 yrs who were sitting a the table next to us.Overall it was a good time.Will I return?  Of course!
Don Vito's Italian=Per the Yelp rating system, 3 stars equates to "A-OK".  That is exactly where I would drop Don Vito's.  Well, maybe not drop but place.  I would place them there.  Firmly and with authority but not in a harmful or diminutive way.  Anyway, Don Vito's is not a restaurant I would seek out but it's just fine.  If I stayed at South Point again I would probably eat here again.  Fair enough?I had basic spaghetti with meatballs.  It was tasty and filling, not spectacular by any stretch.The service was excellent throughout the meal.The atmosphere here is pretty much what you would expect for a casino Italian restaurant...maybe even a little nicer than you would expect.
Intermezzo Pizzeria and Cafe=For some reason the first time we went to Intermezzo I wasn't really impressed.  It was right when they first opened and we sat outside in the heat with lots of traffic passing by.  We didn't even wander inside.  I wish I'd known that dining inside is a completely different experience.  This time around I loved Intermezzo!  The atmosphere was very cool and cozy and had that Plaza Midwood feel.  They have cool local art work on the brick walls and they had kind of a funky music playlist that half the time included rave/techno ish music and the rest of the time was more low key alternative.I don't know if it was just because I was starving, but I thought their pizza was amazing!  I actually ventured to say it's my new favorite pizza in Charlotte.  We had the supreme style pizza and all the veggies were so fresh and full of flavor.  Yum!  Plus they topped if off with slices of tomato which I'm not usually a big fan of but this time around I thought it was delicious.  Their menu isn't terribly extensive but it doesn't matter to me because I will always be ordering this pizza from now on.Don't be fooled by the sign reading "Pizzeria and Cafe" on the outside of Intermezzo's flavor-filled walls. There's gold in them there walls. Lovely, Serbian and Italian culinary gold. That's right. I said Serbian. You're in for a roller coaster ride of freshness and delight. The location rests off of 10th street and accessed from Central. Pull into the gravel parking lot and sit in the small dining area or on their glorious patio. Stays cool even in the summertime! Intermezzo is a small staffed joint that makes everything in house. They don't even have a freezer! They make their own phyllo, mozzarella and salad dressings. It doesn't stop there. Ask your server and they'll be able to tell you ad nauseum on how many fresh items are being churned out of that tiny kitchen. It's ridiculous. So, feeling a bit nervous about trying Serbian cuisine? Never fear! Order the Burek and thank me later. Phyllo filled with cheese and spinach or ground beef. It comes with a house salad, the balsamic reduction and small side of tzatziki-ish cucumber salad. Each bite of the Burek is tender and savory. Mix up the flavors! I take each bite with a bit of salad and the cucumber mixture. Everything swirls with happiness. Best vegetarian lasagna I've ever had. The marinara and ricotta work together like old pals. My goodness these guys make lasagna like I've never had. Out of this world fresh flavors and packed full of zucchini, squash, onions, tomatoes and other veg. Bruschetta. All I can say is GET IT. House made mozzarella and fresh bread, tomatoes, basil. Need I say more? This place packs a punch with their small bar, too. Tons of local beers and plenty of mixed drinks for you to pair with your meal. Great wine list as well. What Italian joint comes sans wine? Not this place. If you haven't made it into Intermezzo yet, you're in for a treat. One of the Charlotte gems that you'll frequent on the regular. Cheers!Intermezzo is one of those gems that didn't catch my eye from the road but word of mouth about their delicious food caught my ear!  My short reasoning for giving Intermezzo 5 stars - a) food is amazing, b) price can't be beat.  My only desire for this restaurant is to update the decor inside, and dust the wine racks.  Other than that, I had no complaints.I went with some friends around 6:30 on a Friday.  We were pleasantly surprised to get a table immediately (only 2 left inside).  The menu made my mouth water.  The selection of appetizers, pizzas and entrees sent me into sensory overload!  Since we were all so undecided, we decided to share.  I was able to sample the Mediterranean Salad, the Grilled Eggplant and the Sauteed Spinach Pizza.  The Grilled Eggplant absolutely surpassed my expectations.  It was perfectly dressed in a basil olive oil, ripe sweet tomatoes, and a dash of balsamic - I could have eaten the whole plate.  Similarly, the pizza swept me off my feet.  I'm from NY, so it's hard to find pizza that can do that!  The dough is fresh, and allows me to fold my pizza (sign of a true NY'er).  All of the ingredients blended together wonderfully.  Last on my food list was the salad.  There was a mix of baby greens, feta, black olives, and we substituted the sun-dried tomato dressing for a balsamic dressing.  It was light and a perfect fit to our meal.The added bonus to the food menu is the martini menu.  Holy freaking cow.  There must have been 20 different choices.  I opted for the Cantaloupe - a refreshing choice it was!  As most martini prices go, they ranged from $9 to $11.  However, there are much cheaper drink options.  My friends opted for the draft beer specials - $3 Stella's!We will definitely be dining in again or taking advantage of their delivery very soon!We have returned to Intermezzo a few times and the Serbian dishes are very good.  The beef burek is very good.  Think of it is a flaky calzone with perfectly seasoned ground beef.  I have also tried the stuffed cabbage (sarma) which was very good.  Additionally, the sandwiches are very good since they make their own bread.   I highly recommend this place and it is reasonably priced too.
Courtyard Cafe=I read the other reviews before posting & this place has been treated pretty fairly. It's better than average most of the time.Its a casino cafe with a traditional American menu, cheap prices, good service and its open 24 hrs a day.One of the few casinos cafes still doing graveyard specials @ $3.99 & under. Good steak & Eggs! If your out late this is the spot!The Courtyard Cafe at the Orleans Casino has got to be one spot that any local or tourist come to! As you all know, this city is known as a city that does not sleep, and because we do not sleep as tourists coming here for the first time, or locals who are just plain insomniacs- we come to the Courtyard Cafe to take advantage of the Graveyard Special! Yes, there is such thing! The special consists of the infamous $4.49 Steak & Eggs (with french fries or hashbrowns)!  Along with the steak & eggs, they provide bread and butter, which you also have the choice of what type of bread to eat!  There are also about 3 to 4 things on the graveyard menu, but this is what we all come for!  If you do decide to visit the cafe anytime before midnight, there is a 24 hour special on the double cheese burger, which you can customize to your liking (the rarity to how well-done the meat should be, the type of cheese, and you can also ask for a side of sauteed mushrooms with extra charge, but so worth it!)While staying at Orleans to earn Mandatory Continuing Legal Education credits at a three-day seminar on Managing Use of Force, Diane and I sampled the Courtyard Cafe for the first time.  Not knowing their portion sizes, I ordered Louisiana Style Gumbo AND Hot Roast Beef.  I quickly learned that the gumbo was a meal in itself!  Served in a giant bowl, this tasty, jumbo-sized soup was down and dirty, slow cooked and chock-full of spicy sausage, cuts of chicken, celery, and rice bobbing in the currents of a thick Brown Roux.  But not a speck of seafood was in sight.  A Dinner Salad was graced by excellent hearty French Dressing over bright red Cherry Tomatoes, two types of greens, cucumbers, and croutons.  Numerous cuts of thin Hot Roast Beef slathered in earthy Brown Gravy were good and saucy, although the gravy-topped Mashed Potatoes accompanying the meat were a bit lumpy.  Diane enjoyed her Fish and Chips, which were ample and fairly standard other than being paired with a small Corn on the Cob.    Service was friendly and very good except that a small paper container filled with mayonnaise was mistakenly presented by our server instead of requested butter.  We were both quite full and satisfied when we left our table!3-1/2 stars!My friend and fellow Yelper SueSue and I came here late one night with Piper. I had no idea what a disaster it would have been or we would have went somewhere else. It was very late so we happen to be craving breakfast and where in the neighborhood, literally passing by so we stopped. We all ordered the steak and eggs breakfast which sounded good at the time.First of all the SERVICE sucks! The waiter was as excited about his job as he was to go and have his balls waxed! We will revisit this and the reasons behind it coming up.My meal comes and my toast is burned black, I had asked when I placed my order that my toast please not be burned. Perhaps that is just one of my pet peeves, I just can't do burned toast so I always inform in advance as a courtesy to them and I.My toast is replaced 10 minutes later, sighs. My steak was tough and rubbery, had I not had a steak knife it would have been barbarian style eating this night!My scrambled eggs were overcooked and rubbery, the taste of that bite in my mouth was FOUL. That is another thing  I dislike is over cooked eggs, I am a cook and that is a No No on my list and a mistake that people often make while preparing eggs. So I asked the server if he would replace them for over easy instead. The server comes back later with a plate and fork to scrape the scrambled eggs off of my plate. This was one of the most awkward and weird things that I have encountered in my years of dining. As this is happening for what seemed an eternity, my friends are and I are looking at each other completely buffoon baffled.To make a long story short, the service sucks, the food sucks and this crap house of a café is crossed off of my list!This is by far one of the WORST breakfast meals I have had in my life! Enough said.Steak and eggs.Steak and eggs.Steak and eggs.Steak and eggs.Do you hear that chant? Steak and eggs. For breakfast. Steak? For breakfast? What?!?!?Apparently the locals love it here and they have the cheap deals for them. You can get it for $9 on a weekday. That's still an amazing price.Too bad I came here on a weekday.Located on the first floor of The Orleans Casino, in the back, Courtyard Cafe lets you take in the wonderful smells and scents of .... the casino and the cigarettes. It's not that bad haha. It's just a really wide and open area and there's no wall/barriers, so you can see your Keno bets if you really wanted :PAfter waiting in the line for 15-20 minutes, we finally got a seat in the back (or is it front LOL) and our waiter came over to ask for our drinks. Water. Yes. Water. After that, he took a while to come back to get our orders. Guacamole Bacon Cheeseburger. They have a lot of guacamole in here. Since I had asked for medium rare on the patty, the patty wasn't overdone and hard. It was actually rare and you could taste the juices. The guacamole had a kick to it that I loved (it wasn't spicy per se). The bacon was overdone a little bit more than I would have liked, but it's wasn't to the point where it was burnt and not edible. That was the inside. As an overall taste, though, it was a good size for $9.99 (pretty big) but it was still average to me. I've definitely had better burgers but as my friend would say, this was decent. More than decent. I took out the onion rings because if I hadn't, my big mouth wouldn't have gulped this down. The onion rings were eaten last but they were a bit dry without any... hmm.. BBQ sauce! Or any sauce. So I guess maybe I shouldn't have taken them out? :(You could also get a side and it was fries but definitely ask if they make substitutions! I got hash browns on the side (or potatoes I guess) and I needed ketchup with it. They were lacking saltiess if you ate them solo.I didn't get too much of a chance to eat what present company had (I was pretty filled) but as I sat up and got away the chant returned.Steak and eggs.Steak and eggs.Steak and eggs.Steak and eggs.
Molcasalsa Mexican Food=Ever since I moved to Las Vegas from California in 2004, I've been looking for Mexican food restaurants that remind me of home. Even though it has always been against my best judgement, I had to settle for the inferior Roberto's. Settle no more. I work at a school up the street from Molcasalsa and surprisingly I never ventured in until yesterday. I ordered a carne asada burrito and 3 rolled tacos with guacamole. While I waited for my order, I filled up ramekins with molcajete, red, and green salsas. My order arrived after a few minutes and I started with the burrito. The beef was tender, the pico de gallo bright and fresh, and the guacamole was silky smooth. I loved the taquitos, too, covered in creamy guacamole and cheese.What surprised me was the restaurant's namesake, the molcajete salsa, was my least favorite part of the meal. However, both the red and green salsas make up for it in the taste and spiciness categories. I'm giving this restaurant 5 stars because the food is great, and great Mexican food is rare in Las Vegas.
Roberto's Taco Shop=day 17 alreadyi think of that song. should i stay or should i go now. if i stay there will be trouble. if i go there will be double. i miss my family already and waking up to an empty house in vegas. maybe i should have stayed in portland longer. but the idea of me staying anywhere too long sounds dreadful and me leaving places seems to upset others. my dad is getting really old...damn i feel worthless today. like i haven't accomplished anything in a while. i'm hungry. i need a burrito. i came here on the recommendation of a friend i am staying with. without jiu jitsu friend and yelp friends i would be really screwed. this place is in an area thats being bulldozed and redeveloped. the inside is typical mexican taco spot. the burritos are huge and cheap! very cheap. i had a chorrizo burrito for breakfast and now i need a nap.
Pho Loc=This is why I have stopped eating Chinese food and become a Vietnamese food addict...I have eaten here at least 15 times since they've re-opened and have become quite friendly with Sarah and Bill, the English names of the owners. Bill is a master chef and I am starting to understand why I like Vietnamese cuisine now where before, I just knew that I liked it better than Chinese.First off...the Pho. They really don't serve any seafood pho and I've come to realize by eating at other Vietnamese places that even though I love shrimp, it tends to make a rather flavorless pho and if you used a beef or a chicken base, it would overpower the seafood. So beef pho just makes sense. Their pho is terrific. I found it more useful to get one of the more standard pho rather than the 'spicy' and spice it myself. The thing I've learned is to taste the pho broth before I hit it with any of the toss-ins or sriracha. They seem to sell a lot of pho ga (chicken soup), but I haven't tried that...it would be hard for them to beat my mom's authentic penicillin. I will point out that their Sour Shrimp soup was fantastic but it's not a pho.Next - their bun...It's rather simple and plain - noodles with meat of choice (or shrimp/shrimp paste), optional peanuts and egg rolls, accompanied by the sweet fish sauce. The trick I learned here is that you put the chilies and/or sriracha and/or hoisin sauce into the fish sauce and mix it up and then dump it over the bun and toss it all with the fork and spoon. Without sriracha or chilis, bun is something any child would love. This is the absolute safe choice for anyone eating Vietnamese for the first time.Next - their broken rice...Again, it's rather simple and plain - meat of choice accompanied by rice, sliced pickled carrots and green papaya and surprises not on the menu, an egg, mushroom quiche type concoction that is called xeo (not clear on the spelling here) and some thinly sliced salt pork. The first time I got this, I just consumed and the second time, I started asking about the things I was eating. Clearly there is some genius here. Again, the trick here is to mix the chilis and/or sriracha into the fish sauce so you can distribute it more evenly throughout. There are a wide array of flavors, all very delicate and much more enthusing than any sauce drenched Chinese offering. Each time I order a broken rice dish, Sarah tries to substitute the barbecue pork which I absolutely love but it defeats my intent to try something different each time.I have since discovered that Bill makes vietnamese pancakes (quite tasty) and ox-tail pho (probably too fatty for my tastes). The pancakes are easily the most messy things to try to eat wrapped in a lettuce leaf with cilantro and dripping fish sauce. Utensils clearly don't work here.Here's a tip...sit close to the table and don't wear a new clean shirt. On the plus side, none of it is greasy so it won't permanently stain but between pho noodles, bun noodles, drippy pancakes, it's hard not to leave soiled and happy.
SKYE=OK. I'm a CenPho snob. A yelp elitist. I admit it. I own it. So when I found out I was going to Peoria for an event, I had already formed my opinion. Cheesey place with cheesey people. God, I love being right! This place is HUGE. Over 14,500 square feet of restaurant, bar, stage and patio space. The event was very disorganized and it was difficult getting a server. I can't knock the restaurant so much for this. And I'll yelp the event seperately. It seems as thoug the food du jour at restaurants everywhere is an upscale macaroni and cheese. And SKYE serves there's with chunks of lobster. Dee lish. Of course you could serve mac n cheese with human toes and I'd still scrape the plate with my fingers. The steak sticks were like skewers of shoe leather. Only leather would have been tastier. The calamari was crisp and tender served with sweet and sour and marinara sauces. Rickie's filet was devoured in seconds. So I'm assuming thumbs up on that. I wasn't feeling the pinot grigio so I switched to chilled Patron and Coronas. Seemed like a good idea at the time. Probably should have stopped drinking before midnight. But. I didn't. I guess if you live out here, this could be a happening place. It just ain't happening for me.After our week in Page, we spent a few nights in Sun City with my Mom and Grandma. Since we were there in summer (which is a rarity for me) I was able to talk Grandma into going somewhere besides the Elephant Bar and a place without having a coupon! As luck would have it, she suggested Skye saying it was a wonderful place and she knew we would enjoy it as an early birthday celebration for my husband. Man oh man was this a great restaurant. Actually it seems like it is half restaurant, half night club and with our 5:30 reservation (yes, this was a "late" dinner for my Grandma), we of course only spent time in the actual restaurant. We were a party of 6 and 4 of us had a cocktail to start. My cosmo was one of the "specials" and was nice and strong for only $6.00. It was the most creative cosmo I have had as it came with a little dry ice in it. Grandma was very happy with her martini and well, no one said much as we drank and perused the menu whilst nibbling on a really good and creative bread basket. My husband and I shared mostly everything and others on the table traded bites. We started with both the Caesar salad and lobster bisque. I was highly impressed with both. The Caesar had homemade croutons and dressing and were very tasty and the lobster bisque was heavenly-not too rich and full of real lobster (even in Arizona!). My daughter had a specialty salad with Gorgonzola and strawberries and loved every morsel. Since I don't eat stinky cheese, I cannot attest to the taste but she keeps talking about the salad. For our entree, Kevin and I shared a bone-in ribeye. This was what 3 of the six(4 if you count me) ordered. My mom had the fish special which was melt in your mouth to die for and my daughter had the filet. The sides are huge and are meant for sharing (like Fleming's or Ruth Chris), so 5 of us shared baked potatoes and mushrooms while the last of our party had the twice baked that no one else got to taste (must have been good).Our steak was incredible and rivals with my memories of Durant's. I savored every cholesterol increasing bite. My Grandma enjoyed hers so much she looked over to me and thanked me for insisting we go somewhere different.Unbeknownst to me, 2 desserts were brought out with candles to celebrate the upcoming birthday of my husband and other part of our party. The desserts were delicious and beautifully presented and since they were "on the house", my Grandma was pleased. I am coming back to the Phoenix area at the end of the month for a couple of nights and am already angling for a reason to come back to Skye...I loved it, I really loved it!
The Capital Grille=I felt very fancy schmany being in here for lunch.  You definitely receive the the same fancy schmancy service you'd expect too.  I was just very impressed with the whole experience from beginning to end.Trying to stay on the healthy side, I was a little nervous about going to a steak house.  Don't get me wrong, I love me some filet mignon.  And maybe another time, some filet will be had... But for now I had to stay on the safe side.  The soup of the day was lobster bisque.  Darnnit! I love lobster bisque!  That was a hard one to avoid.  So... I ordered that and kept the rest of the meal light.  The lobster bisque was awesome!  A tomato base with a HUGE piece of lobster in the bottom.  NICE surprise!For the main course I ordered the scallops in lemon sauce instead of butter and sauteed greens.  It was a fantastic choice because it tasted yummy and was on the healthy side.  The scallops were a great size, seared and cooked perfectly, with a light lemon sauce.  The greens were also served in the lemon sauce, which made them equally as delicious and flavorful.  I had one tiny tiny bite of their creme brulee cheese cake and it was to. Die. For!  Seriously, if you're going for dessert, any choice is probably going to be a good one considering the choices I heard that day!  I must say again, the service was stellar.  From start to finish everything was taken care of.  The servers were extremely friendly too, and seriously seemed like they enjoyed their job and the food there.  So if you're looking for a fancy schmancy night out with stellar service and food, this is your place!We have dined here many times and brought a guest this time. The atmosphere in the main dining room is very nice as in a warm gentleman's clubby room kind of way. There are great paintings on all the walls including a great one of Mr. Rogers and there are several mounted animal heads high-up on some walls.  Their bread and the selection is very good including the pumpernickel and lavash. They serve butter that is some the best you can get. "European-style" Cultured Butter I would say.From the Bar we ordered a Grey Goose martini with blue cheese stuffed olives perfectly made and the olives were some of the best I have had. The apple martini was weak for some reason but had good taste. With dinner a bottle of Concha y Toro, Marques Casa de Concha 2010 Carmenere went so well with our steaks.To start I had the Wedge salad that was pretty good for sure right up there with some of the best. The lettuce was appropriately extremely cold and crisp. While the blue cheese dressing was good indeed, it could have been a little stronger of the blue for my own taste, but the tomato wedges and the bacon were outstanding. The Onion soup was tasty with a great topping of oozy melted crusty cheese.  We also had Wagyu Beef Carpaccio that I would grade outstanding.Specials of the night are always worth a review and discussion with your server. Tonight, one that sounded great was a preparation of wild pacific salmon, but we were here for the steaks tonight.My dry age strip steak was a very flavorful piece of meat and the tenderloin with porcini sauce and the poached lobster was a super combination, tender and flavorful, decadent perhaps; just great . The filet that we asked to be treated with the Kona was very good. Also at our table we had he porterhouse which was a good size, nicely done and very tasty. To reiterate a bit, we enjoyed good flavor with all the steaks and all were prepared as ordered.Service, first and last was outstanding. Our server's knowledge was just short of encyclopedic. Everything about everything on their menu and anything about all the food and perpetrations she was able to recite.  She was very professional, fast and prompt in an apparent effortless and smooth manner. Wine she knew all about, yes she did. "Oh I think you would want that wine filtered", so she decanted our wine as her own recommendation for what we had. "Not going to finish the wine; want it back in the bottle", not a problem and immediately it was done. They are very busy on the weekends and when we arrived for our 8PM reservation the dining rooms were at 95 percent full. If you arrive without a reservation you might have a chance to eat in the lounge area high tops, bar, or the few tables in the area. If you like great dining and great steak and can afford an upscale price; Capital Grill is worth the occasional experience.My boyfriend and I went here two weeks ago before seeing "Wicked" at the Benedum Center. It's not a place we would normally do dinner unless it's a special occasion. However, since our tickets to the show coincided with Pittsburgh Restaurant Week, we decided to give it a try/see how the other half lives!We were running a little late, so I called to let the restaurant know and was told they could hold the reservation for 15 minutes. When we arrived, were were seated in one of the smaller dining rooms off to the side, with only six tables in it. The atmosphere was not what I expected, with interesting art choices. A huge picture of August Wilson was basically at the table with us, while a painting of cows in a pasture hung across the way and the counter had a strange, brass statue of a falcon. It was museum-esque, almost suffocating. The room was a little too dim for my boyfriend, who doesn't have the best eyesight.  Although I did like that the tiny, battery operated lamps at each table. I wanted to take one home! The rest of the restaurant and bar area seemed more lively and upbeat, so if we go back I would request to sit in the larger, main dining area. One thing that really bothered me was what happened when we were seated. The gentleman brought us to the table and, as he presented us with the special Restaurant Week Menu, said "This menu is a great deal, we usually average over $100 per head," and then he left. His tone was condescending and it made me feel uncomfortable, like I should have felt privileged to be there. It's expensive, dude, I get it. Our server, however, was fabulous. He was knowledgeable and attentive without hovering. The server's assistant, who was also serving our room, was also very polite and kept our water glasses full the entire night--even though we didn't order the fancy cucumber Fiji water like the table across from us. However, I think the uniforms/chef coat things they have their servers and other waitstaff wear are just weird, it didn't really seem to fit the who high-class, 1% vibe they had going on.On to the food! Nom! We each started with a Caesar Salad, which was small, but delightful. The dressing was good, as were the Parmesan croutons. For the entrees, I chose the Seared Citrus Glazed Salmon and my boyfriend got the Bone-In Dry Aged Sirloin Steak (14oz). My salmon was very good, but the real star of the night was the steak. It was seasoned and cooked beautifully, and I had never been more jealous of my partner. (He was nice enough to share a few pieces, though. He's a sweetheart!) With the entrees, we were served sides family style, Sam's Mashed Potatoes and Fresh Green Beans. The green beans were just "eh," but the mashed potatoes were some of the best I've had in a long time. Seriously, so good. When it came time to get dessert, we were slightly bummed as there were only two selections (Flour-less Chocolate Espresso Cake or Cheesecake with Fresh Berries) , while the website said there would be more options. I don't know if this is the fault of the restaurant or the folks who run the Pittsburgh Restaurant Week site. We both went for the cheesecake, but it turned out they had just run out. To our delight, our server allowed us to each get an order of their Classic Crème Brulee, which was also quite delicious. Next time, I really want to try the Strawberries Capital Grille! They sound phenomenal. Wine! The wine list they have here is ridiculous. It is so long! So. Long. It's about 25 times the size of their normal dinner menu. We ordered a white blend that we shared during dinner and it was good.Overall, our experience was nice. That steak. That steak gets 5 stars! As does the service we received from our waiter. I couldn't give the restaurant 5 stars though, because I was put off my the gentleman that seated us and by the atmosphere in the small dining room. I really felt like I needed to whisper, which is hard because I cannot whisper to save my life. I would possibly come here again for a special night out. And maybe this time, I will ask about getting one of those adorable little lamps!Such a great date night!Once we arrived our jackets were taken and we were quickly taken to our reserved booth. (Thanks to the FREE Open Table Android App) Our server Melissa S was great! We told her that we were celebrating a late Valentine's Day and she brought us each a complimentary Champagne Toast. We both had the Adults Only Arnold Palmer as our cocktails. The bread basket featured some really tasty bread to hold us over until our salads came out. We shared a delicious blue cheese and bacon wedge salad. The Applewood smoked bacon really made the salad. I just wish it had a little more blue cheese in the dressing. The wife had the Dry Aged Steak au Poivre (Tender sirloin flavored with black peppercorn) with a side of creamed spinach and I had the Dry Aged Porterhouse with a side Lobster Mac & Cheese. They were both superb! My Porterhouse was cooked perfectly and was extremely tender and juicy. The mac & cheese was delicious and had a good bit of Lobster as well. We both shared the mac & cheese and creamed spinach. The creamed spinach is blended with a béchamel sauce which is good but, a little too salty for my taste.  For dessert we had the Chocolate Hazelnut Cake. So good.The place was pretty packed our entire evening there but, our service never suffered. Our glasses were always full and when finished our plates were also whisked away quickly and without any fuss. Even the valet guys are nice. I'm having my yummy leftovers for lunch as we speak. I couldn't have asked for a better evening!
The Rose and Crown=that's it - I'm moving back to phoenix. All it took was for three local phoenix boys to open the perfect tavern where I can relax on a massive wooden porch with a pint of bass and wax poetic on the merits of the cure and the clash with a friend after work.Rose and Crown is a gorgeous home (formerly circa 1900) turned London pub with a warm atmosphere and *killer* music selected on the jukebox. The music I attribute to one of the owners, Chris, who, I eventually discovered, used to play in a mid-90s local punk band called Plinko. I found this tidbit of info out while eavesdropping on a conversation he was having with a couple that was sitting up at the bar. They were chatting about a 1993 punk show in Phx where Circle Jerks and Skankin Pickle played. I excitedly shouted from across the room, "Punk v. Ska?! I was at that show, too!" turns out the owner's band, the couple, and I were ALL at that show, and now ALL sitting a beautiful wood bar relaxing with our English pints (which are 20 OZ across the pond, btw, not 16)  - did I mention I LOVE THIS PLACE? Deets: It's nestled in Heritage Square - and directly across from Pizzeria Bianco - on a faux street (it was once a street but is now blocked from traffic passing through) with about five other early 19th century homes-turned-restaurant/bar. This really makes for a homey effect. Up a set of stairs and there's plenty of wooden tables and chairs on the enormous front patio (where, I might add, you can actually take your drink to - take that, Roosevelt!). inside is broken up into three rooms off of a foyer. the belly-up portion of the bar itself is kind of small - but there's plenty of high-table seating throughout the two rooms, and a pool table and dart board in the third.Food - didn't try it, but usual English fare; Shepherd's pie, bangers and mash, fish and chips. Happy hour meant $3.50 import pints (again, these are 20 ouncers) of Bass, Boddington's, Newcastle, Guinness, Stella...you get the idea.My one major complaint - the parking. There is absolutely no parking near the bar. There are of course plenty of garages nearby - this is right downtown - but on a game night you get screwed. you can try your luck finding a metered space that doesn't require money after 5 p.m. like I did. But that's not enough to deter me. The owner I mentioned before - who spotted me sitting at the bar alone while I waited for my friend and chatted me up - very much gave the impression that they're just three good friends attempting what every 20-30-somethings dreams about at one point - opening a cool bar. And they did. So go to it.Fail.They serve food till midnight, so we rolled through here at 11 PM on a First Friday. The waiter kept forgetting things we asked for... water, menus, etc. French fries - oops chips - tasted like they had been sitting out for a while. Cool and mushy... not my idea of a good chip.My clam chowder was kind of thin though it tasted OK. It was lacking potatoes. Kinda weird. Ordered a Strongbow cider on tap... and it's flat. Since the server was nowhere to be found, I went up to the bar. Bartender: "Oh the cider is usually a little flat! Don't worry about it!" (WHAAA???) Me: "No - it's really flat. I think my water is fizzier." Turns out it was the bottom of the tap and there's none left, and they aren't opening another till the next day. So no drinkey drinkey for Adam. Fail! Friend ordered some sandwich, she seemed to like it but it didn't look too thrilling to me. So whatevs.The wine list was pretty shallow. Other friend ordered some "fruity tart" type flavored white wine. She said it was "tinny" tasting and not good. Fail.The pool table takes up way too much room such that it's impossible to sit around the wall and not be poked by sticks. After being poked 3x by this daft fool I tapped the back of his cue ball and messed up his shot on purpose, because I was about to get it in the ribs. The paintings of the Queen and Churchill kind of suck, in a 7th grade kind of way. It looks like Queen E's hair is floating slightly above her head. I will not be back!every time i have been to the Rose and Crown it was a quick in and out..kinda like risky sex.the last two visits i was able to experiance this place for more then a quicky and i have to say..i kinda like it. Pros, awesome french dip slider sandwich thingy, Fish and Chips (everyone knows i hate fish, but this was tasty) average beer selection, outside Patio and wrap around seating area.Cons, bathrooms..umm no beuno. specially after a guy dumped a duece..i was forced to breath ass air and it was not a good experiance. another Con is the somewhat inexperiance bar staff. if i ask for a Beamish..i expect the first person to tell me "no we don't have it" not the third person. size..it's kinda cramped on a busy night, and not enough room around the pool table.i would have give 4 stars, but the cons kinda outweighed the pros.specially since my nose hairs are still curled from the experiance. but i doubt that is a every day occurance..
Saketini Japanese Sushi Bar and Lounge=Ive been meaning to come here and finally made it out Friday night with Daniel!  I consider him the sushi expert, and was finally ready to see what all the hype was about.We came in Friday night and the place was dead.  I mean not a soul but one guy sitting in the corner.  Where was everyone?  We sat down and the server came right over and gave us our menus and took our drink orders.  They seem to have a decent drink menu here and we both ordered chocotinis.  The drinks came out and they were tasty!  YUM!!  Anyways, we ended up ordering some food, and whatever we did end up eating was delicous!  (Daniel the expert did the ordering knowing that I am new to this.  We did a few different things and they were delicious.)Place is cute and well decorated.  Being a novice to this, I was happy with the taste and display of the food that we ate.  I really had a good time here.  As the night went on, we did end up seeing more people come into the resturant,  but that wasn't for a while.Service was great, and overall I had a good experience.  Will return in the future.YAY for another good find!!! Saketini has great service, wonderful chill atmosphere and a large food/drink menu. They have seating at the sushi bar, seating at the regular bar and then also table seating. They have daily deals..yesterday (Monday) was 1/2 off sake bombers..can i get a WHOOP WHOOP?!?They have an extensive sushi menu with both cooked and raw sushi.  We tried the Firecracker and they even let us add avocado into it. It was baked to perfection and we absolutely loved them. If you're not a huge raw sushi fan there are multiple options that consist of cooked sushi and whoever is serving you will be more than happy to suggest what you might like best. They also have a full non-sushi menu as well.  Shrimp tempura and edamame were delicious as well.Four rounds of sake and three plates all for $37 duckets!Check Saketini out !. Good food, service and atmosphere. You will find a deal that will work with you.. happy hour or reverse happy hour ,you 're bound to find something that will fill your belly with deliciousness and a drink that will warm ya up!My friend and I finished a workout and realized we were hungry and craving sushi.  We were frantically trying to find a place to eat sushi that was open late.  First of all, there aren't that many great sushi places in the Valley, simply because the fish is not fresh like any of the coastal states.  We were still on a mission.Saketini's was open pretty late so we made stop over here.  We got a sashimi platter, albacore with crab roll, and a few other things.  The albacore with crab roll (forgot name) was very delicious.  Some of the sashimi peaces were good, but some were not as great.Overall, we got our fix of sushi at a very late hour.  One thing that drops the rating of the restaurant is we got an automatic 20% tip added on.  We were only a party of two.  I usually leave a pretty good tip, but I do not like it when a restaurant mandates a tip.  A tip is something I feel is up to the customer based on his experience."I think that without sushi, there would be no David Hasselhoff because sushi is like the perfect way of describing the insides of David Hasselhoff. He is like a protein, clean and easy. That's how I feel about myself." ― David HasselhoffThis place is decent.  Friendly staff, ample seating, open until 2AM, there's a karaoke room, et cetera.  They even have a generous amount of time allotted for Happy Hour and Reverse Happy Hour.  Too bad the rolls are small and mediocre for the price they're asking.  I mean $7 for barely any salmon skin?  You're kidding me, right?  And $7 for a cocktail with barely any booze makes this girl sad.  Oh well.  I only come here when out-of-state and out-of-country friends want to mingle.
Palatte=Awwwhhh, I LOVE this place!Part of what I love about Yelp and being a part of the Yelpyness is discovering little places off the beaten path. Sure, I will occasionally get my McDee's Sausage McMuffin on or even crack for the Endless Shrimp deal at Red Lobster, but what I love more than anything are the little mom and pop's, the hole in the walls and places like Palatte.When we headed over here today, I honestly thought my friend got lost. Hey, it's her town and what do I know, I am just visiting, so you will hear no backseat driver antics out of me. Finally we pulled up to this little house in the middle of a residential area and voila...brunchtastic fun at its finest.I don't even want to venture a guess at how crowded this place must get on the weekends judging by how busy it was at 11:30 on a Friday, but if you have the patience, definitely stop in here. The atmosphere is great, the people working here are super cool, the cooks have tats (yay!) and the food is awesome!I ordered the Potato, which basically translates to eggs, bacon, caramelized onions, gouda cheese and fresh fruit and yummy lightly buttered sourdough toast. It was just like something you'd make at home...if you were a really good chef and awesome :) Tasty, filling, but didn't have me feeling that after breakfast lull like most brunch places can.If I lived in Phoenix this would be a must stop and quite often. Definitely check this out! You will love it!!Let's just say I am absolutely charmed and enchanted with Palatte! Can you actually have a crush on a restaurant? I have never, ever, in my entire life, loved a place so much that I actually wanted to move in to it!  That's how much I love Palatte!From the hospitality (one of the owners met us at the door and graciously pointed out the menu and ordering procedure) to the food, everything was spot on! Finding it neither pricy nor pretentious, even my husband, who was very skeptical of going on yet another Yelp inspired dining adventure, was also impressed!Arriving at 11ish on a Saturday morning, the crowd was lively and not too large, which made my husband very happy, as he hates to wait. After reviewing the very inspired and delectable menu, we got in line to place our order (short line, nice people!). The young lady who assisted us at the counter was absolutely delightful and after a few quick questions, we decided on the Lemon Crme French Toast, bacon, Tahitian vanilla yogurt, Melted Tomato Tarte, Iced Tea and Lemonade.We paid for our order and wandered out on to the expansive and inviting patio to find our place in the sun, and to my husbands delight (he hates the sun!) there was a lovely table for two on the patio with a great view of the courtyard and a pleasant distance from the guitarist who was unobtrusively entertaining the guests. We took our seats and continued to enjoy the morning.First to arrive were our beverages, which were both good, but unremarkable. After a few moments, our server appeared with our entrees. My husband really enjoyed his French Toast (coconut, lemon curd and blackberries.... yummy!) and remarked that although this was the first time he had ever had French toast without syrup, it was very, very good on it's own (with the lemon curd, of course) and didn't need any syrup. His bacon, like the beverages, was also unremarkable (we were hoping for something like they serve at Matt's) but it was tasty and not overcooked (a pet peeve of mine).My Melted Tomato Tarte was so darling, it was almost too cute to eat! The crust was light and flaky and the egg and bits that comprised the tarte were heavenly, although a few bites struck a sour note when what tasted like Dijon mustard had been mistakenly baked into the tarte. But since the rest of the tarte was awesome, and only two small bites struck that odd note, I let it pass without comment. The Tahitian vanilla yogurt was very creamy and flavorful, but had way too many sliced apples on top for my liking (a French thing, maybe?)Earlier, while waiting for our breakfast, I wandered back into the little shop that is part of the interior of the home and met a delightful young lady who was wrapping up little packets of silverware and napkins with bits of string. She was expecting and was actually past due, trying to pass the time while awaiting the arrival of her little girl, Ruby. I wished her many blessings and went back to join my husband at our table and enjoy the lovely surroundings.The guitarist was a very pleasant surprise as well. Although he looked a bit like a folky Joey Ramone, his sound and range were simply amazing! He really added to the ambiance and we found ourselves staying longer than we had planned because he was really that good! Armed with nothing more than his guitar, mic and small amp, his catalogue included smashingly good renditions of Harry Connick's Don't Get Around Much Anymore, John Mayer's Waiting for the World to Change and my favorite, the Gilberto, Jobim and Getz version of The Girl from Ipanema.... wow, that made my whole weekend!Later, as I decided to use the WC to wash my hands before we enjoyed the rest of the day, I ran in to the same young lady who took our order and mentioned how much we enjoyed our morning at Palatte and how darling everything (including the bathrooms) were and she told me that the whole place was conceived, designed and brought to life by the owner, Christine, who was trained in France and had a passion for what she did. She offered to introduce me to Christine, who she said, was just outside passing the time until her baby arrived. I told her that we had already met (even though I didn't know she was the owner at the time) and would be sure to let her know how much we enjoyed our morning. By the time we were done chatting, Christine was gone, so perhaps she was off to meet Ruby for the first time...which will give us yet another reason to go back to Palatte! Palatte was just such a pleasant surprise from the food and the servers to the atmosphere and the entertainment; I still just want to move in!! Even the toilet paper was soft!! I so heart this place and will be back again soon. Christine and Ed have done an excellent job in making their dream a reality and have created a little slice of  rustic French countryside for us to enjoy right here. They got every detail right and I will continue to call Palatte home (at least on Saturday Mornings!)Nothing like waking up at 5:30 am the day after an OYE... (not fun, and boy was I exhausted!)The good thing about taking Colleen C to the airport bright and early this morning was that I planned ahead and scheduled a breakfast meeting at Palatte.  And now, after a couple of cups of coffee and an incredible breakfast, I feel like a new person.I definitely recommend Palatte on a weekday morning - no wait, fast, attentive service, and yummy food!  I'm actually still hanging out here working as the atmosphere is perfect for just that - hanging out!  I had a chance to chat with Ed and Christine, the owners, and fell in love with Palatte even more this visit than last time.  I think they are still ironing out the kinks as it's only been 3 weeks since their transition to full table service, but they are kicking ass so far.  I can tell they get plenty of regulars, and I would be one also if I lived in the hood.  The house they are located in is fabulous - comfortable, welcoming, and homey - tons of character which is sometimes hard to find in this city.The Bev (sauteed spinach, tomato slices, and avocado) is what I ordered - and I love that they do it with egg whites for only $1 extra.  I chose whole wheat toast and fruit and it was exactly what the doctor ordered this morning!I can't wait to come back for lunch sometime soon, as their sandwiches, salads and tartes sound awesome from their menu descriptions, but it will be hard to tear myself away from the many breakfast items that are oh so amazing.  I guess I'll just have to come back again and again to make my way through the variety of selections.  A few more tidbits I noticed while hanging at Palatte today: **the bathroom is CLEAN!  So much so that I noticed... **with the check, you are given Bazooka bubble gum - who doesn't love Bazooka?!**they are planning some cool wine / cheese / live music events for upcoming first and third Fridays.****Note to self (and to all of you): Palatte is closed on Monday!  (I guess Ed and Christine need a day off also).
Half Moon Sports Grill=It's a hit or miss with this place. Sometimes you get great service and sometimes you don't. Every time we walk in the hostess usually just stares. The servers all suck at their job. I'm a server, I know what good service is. Our server was horrible! She literally walked up to our table chewing food, she stopped taking my friends order so she can yell across the patio to some friends driving pass us. Oh and don't let me forget to mention that she was playing with her hair brushing it with her fingers in front of us! Then serving us our food. This place is a joke, service is a joke. It's so bad that I know if I asked to speak to a manager the manager would have probably done nothing about it. However Unless I find a place with better wings I will be back but sitting on the bar. I always get better service from the bartenders. So heres a note to management. Retrain your servers or get a new serving staff!
Fiamma=Wow.  What an awesome experience we had.  We went during the middle of the week and it was pretty dead inside.  Thankfully, I didn't make a reservation for our first visit.  I would have looked like a dork.Fiamma doesn't look like much from the outside, but I had heard and read good things about it, so I wanted to give it a shot.  Once inside, it's very nicely decorated and, for lack of a better word, "quaint."We were greeted promptly at the door by the manager (I'm assuming) and then again at our table by our server.  Everyone was super-friendly.  Our server ran down the list of specials.  It took him about five minutes, there were so many.  My mouth watered more and more as he went on and on.  We ordered our wines and two appetizers.  One was a Buffalo mozzarella with tomatoes and the other was a platter of fried calamari, shrimp, and zucchini.  I liked that they had this option of a combo appetizer platter.  It allowed us to try a variety of fried goodies (covered in a light tempura batter).  The marinara sauce that accompanied it was delicious, too.  It was very thick and flavorful.  No Ragu here!The bread they brought out was fantastic, too.  It was thick, moist, and hearty, and tasted even better dipped in their homemade pesto dip.  Mmm...we couldn't stop eating the slices...and then they brought more!  After two apps and two helpings of bread, we were already full.  Then, of course, the entrees came (after a little lime/lemon sorbet to cleanse the palate!).   It was tough to choose an entree from the menu, though, because nothing was average-sounding.  Everything sounded exquisite and was a gourmet take on traditional Italian entrees.  I wanted to try them all.  I love not finding traditional spaghetti or ravioli on an Italian menu!  I finally went with the black linguine with shrimp, covered in a spicy red tomato sauce.  It was definitely spicy and definitely delicious.  My partner went with my other option, which was a linguine with a cream sauce and a variety of items sprinkled throughout it.  It, too, was very delicious; it was very creamy and flavorful.   We didn't have one disappointing food item.  Everything tasted so fresh and authentic.  And, again, the service was fantastic.  At the end, because the restaurant was so slow I think, our server even brought us a complimentary glass of their homemade limoncello drink.  I was excited since I've never had limoncello before.  It made for a tasty, sweet ending to our delicious meal and excellent experience.  We were SO full the rest of the evening, but it was SO worth it.  Fiamma was fantastic.  We can't wait to go back...but will probably eat less!  Well...maybe not.I went to Fiamma on a double date last night - and overall it was a really great time!  We were greeted immediately upon entering and the decor of the place was really quite charming.  The waitress was very on top of the specials and recommended a very good white wine for the table.  We ordered 3 appetizers and all were piled high with food and tasted amazingly good.  For the main course, I ordered a pounded chicken over potatoes and caramelized onions.  The potatoes and onions were great, but I wasn't too excited about the chicken - it was good, but it definitely wasn't mind blowing or anything like much of the rest of the meal.  Everyone at the tabled seemed to really enjoy the overall experience as well as all of the different foods that we were able to try.  This would be a great place to take someone on a date - moderately priced, quiet, low level lighting, easy to find - overall a solid 4 star experience for me.I'm surprised I haven't been here sooner. After reading the rave reviews over the past year, my husband and I finally choose to dine at Fiamma for a date night. It's tucked away in a shopping center area among a few other popular restaurants. Parking can get tight since this little area draws the hungry crowd. From the host, to the server, and the rest of the wait staff we felt truly special. I felt like the server took pride in serving. I really appreciated that. The server listed off quite a mouthful of specials...hard to keep track. Perhaps providing a nightly list with descriptions would be helpful because after the third special, I could't take it all in. Each item on the menu sounded delicious and everything is made in house. I love fresh!The only thing that made me frown was that there were no side salad prices on the menu (or we completely missed it) and when we got the bill they were near $8 each...for a side salad! Granted, the salad was delicious and the service was fantastic (that's how we made sense of why it was so pricey). The rest of the food was excellent and seemed to measure up to what we expected to pay per entree. Added bonus is not feeling rushed. In fact, they bring out sorbet to cleanse your palate before you main entree. The ambiance is dim and intimate, which allows for easy conversation (which is great for a date or if you have company). Also, the dress code may not be absolutely dressy, but I wouldn't feel comfortable wearing really casual attire. We will definitely come back!Oh Fiamma will you marry me??? Just promise to cook for us every day!! What a gem this place is, so cozy and quaint. From the homemade pesto, sorbet between courses, waiters that can barely speak English... The calamari app was so unusual with avocado (we got it sauteed instead of deep fried and it was so delish!) I had the pasta with chicken and sun-dried tomatoes and my friend got the fettuccine with mushrooms...Unreal meal. So full at the end of the meal we could not eat dessert but they brought us some complimentary homemade limoncello already cant wait to go back!!!I was a bit hesitant to write a review on Fiamma....mostly because my first (and only as of now) experience was during Charlotte Restaurant Week (CRW). But, alas, I believe CRW is a huge opportunity for restaurants to shine. And in a sink or swim kind of world, Fiamma floated. First off, hubs and I had a bit of an ordeal with our reservation. As soon as the dates of CRW were announced, I called Fiamma one early January afternoon and made a reservation. Moments later I realized the guy on the phone never took down the time. Hubs called back a few days later and confirmed the date and time - which were never written down in the first place. Because of the inconsistencies we called a few hours before our reservation to confirm the exact time (as we never received a confirmation phone call, etc) and we're pretty much told - yeah, come on in around 7 or 7:30. Um, ok. Nevertheless, we walked into a very busy restaurant and sat immediately at a table next to the door. Chilly in January, I say! It's important to note that the CRW menu had a plethora of choices for each course...lovin' the variety. Here's a breakdown of the meal and service:Bread basket & oil: 5/5: I have to mention the bread & olive oil mixture because they were slammin'. Freshly baked in house and different varieties.Delizia Contadina: 3/5: Mixed greens with pears, spicy walnuts and Tuscan pecorino cheese sticks. This lightly dressed salad was nice and refreshing but the dressing was a little tart for my taste. Regardless, it was a nice size and a decent start.Ravioli of the Day: 2/5: The CRW feature was fresh lobster and shrimp ravioli in spicy tomato sauce. I took major issue with this dish. It was so, so bland - I didn't taste any spice whatsoever. And the filling within the ravioli was pretty inconsistent - it varied from a delicious lobster mix to a fishy shrimp mix. I appreciate they make the pasta in house, but this dish let me down.Tortino Al Ciccolato: 4/5: You can always get me with chocolate. While I expected more of a baked torte, this little nugget came out as a mini lava cake. The flavors were nice and rich. I would have liked a bit more ice cream, though! Service: 3/5: It started off really well - our server was attentive, helpful and efficient. But as soon as we had our salad course, it really fell off. Now, I'm sure he was super busy considering CRW and the full restaurant we were dining in. However, we waited at least 35-40 minutes between our salad course and our main dish...and we only saw our server once in that time increment. You may think I'm being nitpicky, but when you shell out a bunch of cash (yes, well over the $30 per person), you hope for nice service. Fiamma was a fine meal, but not the great meal I was hoping for. I will absolutely give them another try when they aren't overworked during CRW. Hoping my next visit will leave me more enchanted than the last.Awful!  One of my worst restaurant experiences.  This is my first review in yelp, and I probably wouldn't be writing it if the manager would have been more professional.  But that will come later in my review.  To start, the service in general was awful.We got 3 appetizers which were ok.  but the jumbo scallops, although cooked well, were not jumbo.  The other appetizers were ok nothing to go back for.Our main courses is another story.  First, we got the lamb chops which were quickly returned for being overcooked.  It is also important to mention super tiny.  We also got a posts dish with chicken, also overcooked.  The third dish we got was the grilled seafood.  The scallops were ok, everything else overcooked and chewy.  The fourth meal was pasta with crab.  This dish was just tasteless.After returning the lamb dish they did try and make another one.  This time some random asparagus appeared on the plate with some overcooked lamb. the chicken dish was just returned and not replaced.The manager did come out to apologize when he came back from running errands.  My friends and I believe the tip is based on service.  Usually it is 20%.  But the food and service was so bad we left 5%.  The manager picked up the check on our way out and yelled to us "thanks guys, that was really nice".  Maybe instead of yelling at us he should do his job and manage his staff to ensure guests have a good experience and want to come back.I guess the good thing that came out of this is that I will start writing reviews on yelp.  Hopefully the rest of them are how great my experience was.I'm having a tough time reviewing Fiamma - I think it aspires to be more than it actually is, and despite my inherent desire to love this place, something just seems off.  Atmosphere: Fiamma is located in a rather non-descript shopping center that is also home to Ru San's and Fran's Filling Station (along with Run for your Life and a wine store).  The interior layout is kind of awkward, with many tables in a small footprint and not much privacy between parties.  The back half of the restaurant is very crowded, with tables along one hallway wall and the bathroom door basically being a 5th chair at the back table.  If one were to squint, the bathrooms might seem "quaint" or "authentic trattoria," but in reality, I think they probably deserve a good scrub and new coat of paint.Food: I wanted to like this place so badly that I went back the following night after a less-than-enthusiastic Restaurant Week meal.  Meal 1: I had the soft-shell crab appetizer and found it overly fishy and pokey (yes, pokey); the lamb shank was also disappointing, as I thought it was a bit fatty (although the side of gnocchi that came with it was downright delightful); that was followed up with the chocolate tart dessert that was more lava cake consistency than firm tart, but it was a pleasant surprise.  Meal 2: I ordered the beef carpaccio as my appetizer, and was shocked by the amount of parmesan cheese that accompanied the plate - two of the largest slices of parm I've ever seen were atop my arugula and beef.  For my entree, I ordered the black linquini with seafood and was in love with the tomato sauce kick and flavors.  Having already experienced the wonder of the chocolate tart, I knew I didn't want anything else and ordered it for the second time in 24 hours (although I had tried the tiramisu and ricotta cheesecake from others at the table and those were good as well).  So, night 1 was an unexpected letdown, but night 2 held up to my high expectations.  The breadsticks and foccacia that started the meal were like a carbohyrate dream, topped with homemade pesto olive oil.  And the one person who ordered wine received a (very) healthy-sized pour.Service: If you consider Restaurant Week an opportunity to introduce your resturant to a new clientele, I would assume you would want to represent the experience in the most normal and typical way possible.  I was shocked when we asked to see a regular menu (we'd just been given Restaurant Week menus) and were told the special menu was the only one they were doing.  However, they did fulfill a special order (doing a full entree of gnocci instead of as a meat accompaniment) when our table's vegetarian balked at only 1 veggie entree out of 9 options.  Finally, I would have expected our extra wine glasses to be removed once we declined wine, but they remained crowded on our table for a good 5+ minutes until we pushed them together and out of the way to the edge of the table (minor in the scheme of things, but an annoyance).  Price: Given that we were there during Restaurant Week, we were anchored to a $30 price point.  Especially on night 2, I was very pleased with the quality and value that I received, and a quick look at prices on their website seem incredibly reasonable for a typical meal.  Most likely, I'd return to Fiamma, but I just can't shake the doubt in the back of my mind that it's not as great as it should be.I have been to Fiamma twice and both visits were during Restaurant Week.  From the outside, I was very unimpressed.  It's located in a strip mall that offers no pzazz.  Once inside, however, the ambiance is intimate, warmly lit, and romantic.  Most of the tables are separated but there are a few that are connected by one long booth seat.  Unfortunately, this is where my party of 3 was sat.  Even more uncomfortable was that the table was actually comprised of 2 separate small tables covered by a table cloth.  It was notably a tight space.  Thankfully we overcame our discouraging seating situation by ordering wine.  The pours were generous and the prices ranged from $6.00 to $9.00 per glass.  It was quite reasonable. In addition to some wine, we also ordered food off of the restaurant week menu.  My first item was sauteed sea scallops in a cauliflower puree topped with mushrooms.  It was simply delectable.  I would order this as an entree if I could.  My second item was a pacific white fish served with two sauteed potatoes and white asparagus covered in a caper sauce.  It was a nice dish but it didn't knock me off my feet.  I felt the fish could have been a bit more moist but the flavors were tasty!  Lastly, we all ordered and sampled each others dessert.  The creme brulee took the first place ribbon.  It was a generous portion topped with delicious berries.  The ricotta cheesecake was a runner up.  It was light and did the trick to hit my sweet spot.  However, if you are a cheesecake lover and like the rich, creamy  versions - this would not be your pick!The service we received was adequate but not superb.  I had a much better waiter the first time I visited.  There were a few times I found my eyes wandering to see if I could get his attention.  Additionally, only 2 out of the 3 entrees were brought out together.  One of my friends had to wait a few minutes before hers arrived.  It certainly didn't ruin the meal but it's always nice begin eating your dinner at the same time.  Overall, Fiamma did not earn a 5 star review but I would return.  I enjoyed the atmosphere and they have some great dishes.  There are just some areas that could be tweaked to make the overall experience more enjoyable.This is the best Italian I've had outside of Little Italy in New York City.My bride and I have been regulars at Fiamma for just under four years now.  Each and every time, we request Yoshi as our server.  He's knows the food and wine menu inside and out and can easily guide you to your likings.  May I recommend the Il Poggio Sangiovese (Red Italian Wine)... It's our go-to.  The house-made pesto and focaccia bread is insanely good and is a complimentary item.If you like basic Italian, there are dishes that will keep it basic and knock your socks off.  My recommendation under this would be the Papardelle Bolognese.  It's a fantastic meat sauce featuring their housemade pasta.  It's simple yet slammed full of flavor.  Even better, it's only $13.  Why on earth would anyone go to Olive Garden or something of that nature when for a few dollars more, you can have fresh and high quality food.If you like things a little different or more authentic, there are a host of options for you.  My key favorites would be the Osso Bucco with Risotto, Tagliatelle d'Alba, or a fish special.  Great finishers would include the Panna Cotta (creamy, fresh fruit, light) or Tortino al Cioccolato if you are like me and require chocolate as a final bite!If you haven't had Fiamma, you are missing out.  I highly recommend you visit.  It's one of the best values in Charlotte.I'm not much of an Italian food fan boy, but Fiamma is definitely one of the more understated powerhouse restaurants when it comes to the well-executed Italian fare in Charlotte. Made it in on a weeknight for a semi-late dinner and had a fantastic time. We skipped the drinks this time around, but they had a rather extensive wine menu. The focaccia and pesto they start you with is phenomenal. I'm a huge proponent of good focaccia and Fiamma's recipe is perfect. I barely have words for how good that pesto was. Fresh, aromatic, and strong. The smaller breadsticks in the bread basket were a nice touch as well. Entrees were stellar. I stepped out on a limb and ordered the veal chop, which was the special for the evening. Side of gnocchi and a killer red wine reduction. The veal chop was tender and packed with flavor. Stuffed with spinach and onions and each bite was better than the last. While hugely different than what my typical order would be, I was very pleased. The gnocchi....man. So good. Subtle, chewy, sweet with the tomato sauce and fresh herbs, and a perfect combo with the chop. I'd order that as a side dish again in a heartbeat. What really set this place apart from other eateries was the service. Our server was one of the most professional I've had in a long time. He knew the menu like a second language and offered great input. Also, being served some comp limon cello at the end of a meal is always a nice touch! Great flavor and super strong. They also had live music while we were there. The guy had some serious talent and really set the mood. Really looking forward to heading back in for a special occasion or date night.Ecuadorian on Italian (I think)... Today I wanted Itailian Food without the Italian 'tude, if you know what I mean and knew I would be safe here... This was my first Lunch here, I've been a few times for Dinner and it is always a five star experience... Really I never think of this as a Lunch place... NOW I will remember it is a Lunch place, it's a Deal, it's a Steal, if fact I do not want to tell you so I can keep my table! Most of the pasta is made In-House and you can tell...This Bread Tastes like it is made In-House!  The Sauce I Chose today was Bolognese, their version has Beef, Veal and Pork and is NOT Creamy YAY!!!  Lasagna - I'm unable to read menus more than a few words long... Cheese Browned on top, thin layers on flat Pasta, thin layers of Cheese and MEATY Bolognese!Sit down and they bring you the most unique version of Pesto I have seen... More than half Olive Oil the rest you know about : Pinenuts, Basil, Parmesan and maybe some Garlic, though just a little... Thin Bread sticks and Thick DENSE Bread that makes me want to visit a Bakery that makes it like this!!! (Yelpers tell me of a Bakery that does Bread like this - PLEASE)!Lemon Sorbet for Dessert!  Very Nice!  Wish I knew how to photograph it!Zagat Rated 2012, 2013Service is always GREAT!!! No Italian 'tude!!!Three Italian places left to review before I move to Raleigh... Today it was Fiamma
Basil Thai Urbana=I'm not the type of person who lets one bad experience ruin a restaurant, I know that sometimes people make mistakes and running a restaurant can't be easy.I went here 3 TIMES, and every time something bad happened.First time I went here, food was good if not expensive, but immediately afterwards I felt a sharp pain of sickness to my stomach. Let's end the story there.Second time, food was alright with no "incidents" until my friend discovered a long black hair in his food. That's flavour country!  OK, so it's one hair - NOPE, there's another friendly hair in his food! The guy working there refuses to give a refund, only offering more of the same food that had made my friend feel like throwing up after his nice discovery. Good business!OK, Basil Thai - you get one more try. I go there and my other friend orders Basil Chicken which is made with "ground chicken." Upon receiving the order, we notice the chicken is "ground" into pieces of the size of bacon bits, not to mention there was barely any of these "chicken bits." So, we ask for more chicken, since it's a chicken dish, and the same douchebag refuses, saying we should pay for more chicken and that it's "our fault" for not reading the description. He refuses to give a refund because "we already paid for it." What the fuck? How exactly would you get a refund if you haven't paid for something in the first place? Genius! No reason to go here, if you crave Thai food - make it yourself and save yourself assholish service and high prices.
Montana Meat Company=Had lunch with my Mom here last week.  It has been over a year since our last visit.  It is a restaurant/video poker bar.  The restaurant is on the left side of the building.  We were pleased to see that it was still kept well and clean.  Many video poker bars in Vegas go downhill rapidly.After taking our drink orders, the server told us the Lunch Special was Buy One Burger, Get One FREE.  We decided to go for the Special and ordered a BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger and a Montana Peppercorn Burger.After a short wait the server brought out our food.  I should have paid closer attention to the menu because the Montana Peppercorn Burger was served open-face with Gravy smothered all over the Burger & Fries.....not exactly what I wanted, but that was my bad.  Mom wasn't that hungry, so she was nice enough to trade with me....so I had the BBQ Bacon Burger.  The Burger was pretty good, not great....the Onion Rings that were served as toppings for the Burger were great.  The Steak Fries that came with the Burger were awesome.....they were cooked just right so that they weren't too soft or soggy.....which happens a lot with Steak Fries....they made it just right.Mom couldn't finish the Gravy smothered Burger, so I had a couple of bites....I didn't really care for it....I'm not a fan of Gravy unless it's with Turkey & Stuffing.  I could barely taste the Peppercorn Burger under that Gravy and Grilled Onions.Overall, it  was an ok lunch.  Will I return?  Yes, but not for the Gravy Burger.Did I ever mention I love this place so much?????----- maybe NOT because I couldn't find my reviews here. However, Yes, I do. I do love MMC 100% for sure ( I mean their lunch special )!What I still remember is that they provide LUNCH SPECIAL for ALL burgers, salads, sandwiches and wraps $5.95 $5.95 $5.95.What I still remember is that I usually order:1. Filet mignon salads2. Turkey wrap3. Chicken caesar wrapAlso my co-workers always have:1. Walnut chicken salads2. French dip3. Burger --- sorry! I'm not a really real burger fan, so I couldn't remember their names, but you can ask for it :)One one one thing I need to mention: PLEASE DO NOT GO DURING 12:00-1:00PM because it's going to wait at least half hour for just order your food. Their service is kind of slow. Oops! Do I say their slow? Yes, they are..... but Filet mignon salads without onion is my best dish. I'm here just for it.... worth it! P.S.: you will meet many of G4s during lunch hour  :)I used to come here all the time, and it was awesome. Then they changed bartenders... Here's what happened.Came in with a few friends around 3AM on a Friday night. We were all a little tipsy but wanted to stay close to home so we made this our choice of bar. The bartender took about 15 minutes to come over, my friend actually had to shout out "excuse me" to get his attention. Normally i would make an excuse for a bartender not noticing someone sit at the bar, but he had to literally buzz us in since it was after midnight. When we ordered our drinks he then went over to the group he was chatting up prior to us "interrupting" him. 15 minutes later he brings us over our beers. No reason this should have taken so long. But we were gaming so my other two friends didn't really notice.It then took us several attempts at getting another round. when we finally succeeded we decided we would go somewhere else. We had gamed a total of 280$ between the 3 of us and each had 2 drinks. We asked for our bill and when we received it we noticed not a single drink was comped. I'm not one for complaining when i don't received something comped but that is ridiculous. We paid our bill and still left a 10$ tip. My friend also asked the bartender for a pack of cigarettes but we noticed it wasn't on the bill so we figured he just didn't charge her. When we were leaving we walked out the door and out comes the shouting bartender. "Excuse me!!! You guys didn't pay for those cigarettes." My friends laughed, threw him a 20$ and we left.The only reason I'm giving 2 stars instead of one is because I hope to return to this bar and see another bartender. But until then... this will be my review.I'll start by noting that a big part of this relatively positive review is because of the excellent service by our waiter. Aside from that the food was nothing to write home about.My friend and I came in around 7 craving burgers. We decided to split a pastrami patty melt and a BBQ bacon burger, one with fries and the other with onion rings for good measure. I sampled the BBQ bacon burger first and was not excited in the least. I commented to my friend that it tasted just like a bacon western burger only four times the price. A few seconds later our server came by to check on us and commented about how much she likes the BBQ bacon burger because it tastes like a western bacon cheeseburger. Guess I was right! I didn't care for the BBQ said very much so I stuck with the pastrami patty melt, which was decent. The fries and onion rings were a lackluster way to round out our meal.Service was excellent and friendly, but there wasn't much else to make me want to return.
Manchu Wok=Holy God, I should have checked the reviews before eating here. Because of my tragic inability to read a map, I apparently walked to the completely wrong end of the Atrium in search of Salsaritas. Near some other unsavory selections, this seemed to be the quick & easy choice.I'm no stranger to food court Chinese. In fact, I used to look forward to stopping in the mall with mom and brother to cheaply nibble on the toothpicked free samples of sweet & sour chicken before buying a plate and splitting it three-ways. Americanized Chinese food is comfort food in a way. Dependable, affordable, tasty.This was none of those things. I went for the two-item dish which comes with rice (no white rice or brown rice option; only fried). I chose General Tso's and Beef & Broccoli. Both were dished up in IDENTICAL sauces. Let's call it Brown Sauce. Brown Sauce has no flavor. And it's cornstarched to hell, so it's thick and blubbery like day-old gravy. Brown Sauce has no business being on General Tso's Chicken. Brown Sauce made me embarrassed FOR my food. I ended up dumping half my meal... and I never do that.I love CLT's classy atrium, but can't recommend this dining option. If you need me, I'm brushing up on my cartography.
August Henry's City Saloon=I have eaten lunch at August Henry's several times while working downtown.  The food was always pretty tasty.  I never had an issue of not liking what I ate, but I seemed to always have an issue with getting my food in time to make my hour lunch break not run over.  Even going during off lunch hours (like after 2pm) we have waited 30+ minutes for our fare.  This part I have never been a fan of, especially when several times I was there with a friends and there was literally no one else in the dining area.  The servers though I have never had any particular issues with rudeness or anything, have a very lax perspective to urgency.  I went before with a friend and the bartender/waitress came over to our table about 5 minutes after we sat down for drink orders and disappeared for 25+ minutes after that.  No one at the bar, no one in the dining/bar area.  It felt odd.  When she finally came back our food was still not in sight.  We had to yell across the empty restaurant to get refills.  When she came we asked how long until or food, she said a few minutes.  When she finally did bring our food, sandwiches mind you, about 40+ minutes had passed and we needed to book it back to work.  We asked for our bill and boxes.  So there is that, I don't really recommend coming here if you are on a strict time limit.My last visit here was just for drinks.  My one friend is moving to Houston so we did one slightly crazy night bar hopping and August Henry's was second on the list due to one member of our party holding strong that they have an abundance of beers on tap.  When we got there it was pretty busy.  We luckily found a few seats at the bar and sat down.  It took a while to get anyone to wait on us.  I know it was busy but here is the weird thing.  Me and my husband order while he is getting our drinks my friends are talking about what they want.  He took my card brought our drinks and disappeared!  My other two friends sat without a drink for several minutes before he returned.  Thought that was really not cool, but whatever they weren't upset but I probably would've been if it was me.  So I guess the strangest thing about our short visit that Friday night was that the Pittsburgh Opera Performers were there doing improv opera... :/  Just as we start to drink they begin to belt out some sort of story line, I don't know what it was, it was loud and not enjoyable for me or my friends so we were one and done and onto the next place to continue our night.  I would go back to August Henry's but only if I had a lot of time and probably not for Happy Hour.
101 Bistro=101 Bistro. It sounds like a class in culinary school. Or a cafe off the freeway. But. It's not. It's downtown, close to the Dodge Theatre, so we picked it as our pre Margaret Cho chow place. It's a nice big room with lots of windows. Nice. It was filling up quickly and had a fun, urban energy. I was bummed when I ordered a beer and was told their liquor license was suspended and she can't serve any alcohol. Damn! No worries. We'll order, eat and walk around before the show and find a bar. I point to what looks like a bar across the street and ask our server what it is. "I don't know. I don't live down here. I just work here." Nice. What charm school did you graduate from? Bitch Academy? Rickie had a Philadelphia Cheesesteak - like pita sandwich while I had a roast beef panini. Both came with a small greek salad. Not great. Just. Well. Nice. The Caprese appetizer, while tasty, looked as though it had been assembled by a nervous monkey. It was also strange when little miss sunshine dropped a full glass of ice for Rickie's ice tea with no explanation as to why and without refilling his ice tea. Oh. Such a charmer. 101 Bistro, I give you a C minus. Average food. And a minus for the oh so helpful server and the unusually uncomfortable chairs. I still have the wicker imprint on my ass.I don't know if this qualifies as an update. However 101 Bistro is now closed. Eighty sixed. Nada here anymora. Adios. Hasta la pasta.RIP 101 B!
Pure Sushi=** If you are a parent that thinks it is acceptable to allow your child to run amuck, please stop reading now **I really like sushi.  I love sitting at the sushi bar, enjoying some good food and conversation.  So, when my friend suggested that we go to Pure I was looking forward to trying this new-to-me sushi spot.  What can go wrong?  A lot.Upon arrival we were seated at the sushi bar, and immediately noticed that a boy around the age of 10 was seated alone next to us.  I wondered where his parents were (this was at night, and I thought it was strange to leave a child alone where liquor was being served), but really didn't think it would be an issue.  Mistake.  It quickly became obvious that he could not be unsupervised.  Disruptive.  Food everywhere.  Impossible to ignore.  I am not exaggerating.  Ick.  This is not McDonalds - where are his parents!?  My friend mentions this to our waitress not once, but twice.  This is when I expect one of two things to occur:   1) we would be offered different seating, or 2) a manager would ask the parents (who I realized were dining separately at the complete other end of the sushi bar - WTF?) to bring him to sit with them so as not to disturb others.  Neither of these things happened. In the meantime, we have a pear martini (excellent), yellowtail sashimi (OK, not great) and attempted to enjoy a crabcake (blegh).  It was not fresh at all.  It tasted metallic.  Inedible.  I know what crab should taste like, and this isn't it.  Back to our young diner - my friend, realizing that this kid is a nightmare, approaches the parents to explain the situation.  Why did he have to do this?  Because nobody on the Pure staff would step up to deal with it.  At this point I am very irritated (and hungry!).  Oh, it gets better.  My exasperation is interpreted by my friend as annoyance or maybe embarrassment that he spoke with the kid's parents.  No, no, no.  I cannot explain this for some reason and now everyone is aggravated.  Oh joy.  The waitress chooses this moment to offer to bring us something else to replace the crabcake, but I was pretty much over the whole experience at that point.  Scary kid, creepy food, my friend is annoyed with me and I really just want to leave.  I cannot get my credit card out quickly enough.  Get me out of here - that year-old hot pocket that is lingering somewhere in the back of my freezer is sounding pretty good right now.Our waitress was extremely apologetic, and didn't charge me which I thought was nice (thus additional star).  However, some things you can't make up for.  Pure, you left a bad taste in my mouth.
Big Al's Oyster Bar=This is the first time for me at Big Al's... Believe it or not, I've passed by many, many times and little did I know what I was missing! Opted to sit at the bar and have my lunch. They have really friendly service here and that makes a lot of difference! I ordered the combination pan roast which has crab and shrimp in it. They are very generous with the shrimp. The broth was really smooth, although I would have preferred it to be a bit thicker. It was very tasty and it is served with rice pilaf. They also give you a basket of bread with your meal. Warning: don't fill yourself up on the bread because the portions are good sized!
Buzz BBQ=I had another BBQ attack & decided to find a new place to try in the neighborhood. After a little searching I found Longhorn's BBQ on N. Rancho.After a little looking around I found it in a little strip mall but it had just closed up at 8pm. Damn it.Still hankering for some BBQ I recalled Buzz BBQ being somewhere of the 95 Hwy in this area and went off in search of some BBQ.Buzz BBQ was voted #1 BBQ joint in Las Vegas 2008 and there business is proudly displaying all their new banners and even had it painted on the front doors.It is not a small place-it actually a regualr size restaurant with lots of boothes and flat screen tv's for the sports fans. Most of the decor is Western.The hostess was very friendly and helpful describing all the different meats and her favorites. We settled on a 3meat family meal with 2 sides & rolls. I ordered ribs(3), beef brisket and chopped pork with mac-n-cheese  & baked beans plus rolls.We only waited 5 minutes and it was ready to go. The damage $20!All the meats were very moist & quite smoky but not overpowering. You could not really taste any rub but it was decent meat.The ribs were large and tender but a little fatty. The chopped pork was the best thing but it had no crunchy pork skin in it. The brisket was very tender but really fatty too.  The sauce was sweet but came on the side. The mac-n-cheese wasnt very good and the baked beans were canned. Overall it was a little disappointing considering it's suppossedly the BEST. For the same 3 meat 2 side combo I could have got it at CJ's for $12.99 & it was alot better there.Went here for the first time tonight. And all I got to say is, WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH ME? I've been going to that shitty sushi restaurant next door for the longest time and never once gave this place a second glance. In fact, that was where I was going tonight buuut I was in for a new adventure. And I'm glad I took it!I walk in and I'm seated, I'm the only one there besides a group of 4 or so. I ordered the 3 meat combo, picking the brisket, the pulled pork, and the ribs. (I know, my new years resolution to be a vegetarian took a dump on me) For the sides, i got the sweet potatoes and the BBQ baked beans.First though, the waitress brought me out sweet rolls, which were warm, squishy, and awesome. Pretty surprising, seeing as it was already closing time.Oh yeah, Yelp needs to change this page, it closes at 7 now, not 9 pm. I walked in there at 8 like the jackass I am. I awkwardly saw it was empty and asked if they were open, she said no, but they'd still serve me anyway since the other group was there and they were still waiting for people to pick up their to-go orders. Talk about service! (Calm down bleeding hearts, I left a good tip)The lady didn't even have an attitude about serving me. I know some places you walk in an hour before closing and they act like you just ended their world or something.The food was great. The brisket was tender, pretty lean, and the ribs were fall-off-the-bone juicyness! Pulled pork was also a winner-winner. I dug into this meal with such fervor that about 1/4 the way through it, the waitress apologized for not bringing me the BBQ sauces sooner. WHAT? Sauce? Sauce-smosh, this dead cow/pig is so good, I didn't even notice that I didn't have any, or needed it. I accepted it just to give the tasting-a-testing. The mild sauce is your typical BBQ sauce, and the hot one has a little spice to it, almost teriyaki like. I preferred the hot one.The beans were pretty good, I did mix alittle BBQ sauce in them to get that "BBQ backed bean" taste, they seemed more just baked beans. The sweet potato fries were delicious, it was interesting that they seasoned it with sugar, I've never had that before. I'm used to the olive and rosemary type seasoning for sweet potatoes, but this was a pleasant surprise.I couldn't skip on the cobbler, so I got a blackberry one to-go, and I wasn't trying to stay too long either.But enough of that posh-posh, the whole reason I gave this place a 5 star is cause on the way out, the teenage girl at the front counter told me "sweet dreams!" HAHA! YES!I said "....you too" and drove all the way home laughing so hard, tears were running down my face, that was the most ADORABLE thing I've ever heard in my entire life and it totally made my crappy day a +100.I expect a "sweet dreams" everytime I leave this place now! ;)
Switch Restaurant & Wine Bar=I'm continuing with my downtown streak of reviews... I finally made it to Switch!  This review is for my experience at lunchtime... and let me warn you, it gets busy during the weekday lunch hours, so go early or go late, but arrive at noon, and more than likely you will have to wait.  However, the community table is an option if you go solo or with a small group.Another warning - the parking situation at noon - I think I lucked out and got the last spot in the lot; I happened to see a truck leaving when I came in, but there didn't seem to be any other open spots.  I noticed that Durant's next door offered 'humble valet parking' (interesting signage), but not sure if you are dining at Switch where you would park in this scenario.I walked in through the back, and I liked the atmosphere and vibe immediately.  I was told there was a 20 minute wait for my party of 3, so I found myself a seat and did some work while I waited.  Pretty sure they have WiFi although I was using my Verizon card.  Great people watching was distracting me too; enough so that I missed when the rest of my party walked in!  Anyways, I caught up with them and enjoyed a great lunch...Service was right on, and it was an overall delightful dining experience.  I had the 'Super Chop' salad - it had a little bit of everything in it (artichokes, olives, tomatoes, cucumbers, corn, sunflower seeds, sun-dried tomatoes, spinach & field greens) - and I added turkey for a small extra charge... it was a huge serving and the perfect healthy lunch!  (Note to self and to anyone else that may be interested in adding protein to your salad in the future - go with something other than the turkey... I hate to sound picky, but it wasn't amazing).  Anyways, my two new friends (Kate and Angie) are regulars at Switch, so they ordered the hummus and lamb apps and shared - good idea!  I tried the hummus and it was tasty - I like how they served it with pita and sides of artichokes and peppers.  It was a tad different than the hummus at Fez, or at least that is what we all decided.We were all very satisfied and too full for dessert... I guess I'll have to come back to try that another time.  Dessert and a bunch of other menu items that sounded good.  I also noticed that Switch serves breakfast all day on Saturday and Sundays, and does catering - good to know!We took the train from Mill to downtown Monday night, and heard that Switch does half-priced sangria, sooo, had to check that out. Pretty cute place.The sangria was indeed special, and on special. We also got the hummus plate, which was really good, and I wish it came with more roasted red peppers, they were addicting! Yum. A couple little weird things though, the host stand is at the back, or middle if you consider the patio, which I guess makes sense for them, but was kinda confusing for a first timer and there was nobody manning the stand there which didn't help. We also had a total of three servers, maybe we should consider that special treatment :) But I'll be back, gotta try the brunch still!i like Switch, the long European style bar is great for a large group of friends or making new friends. the food is pretty good. happy hour is awesome with the 2 for 1 Sangrias and glasses of wine.plus they make a really good Caipirinha. which i believe to be a better version of the Mojito.atmosphere is cute and friendly. inviting. staff is usually attentive. only had one bad experiance..but i just notch it up to how busy it was. no foul. i will keep coming back.Lame joke alert :Okay, I think I have switched over to Switch , I am finally making a switch to Switch  whew almost over , after you try Switch you'll never switch.  And done.Thanks for letting me get that out of my system.Lunch today was delightful. Mom and I were downtown playing around and we tried Switch for something new.  Glad we did.  Our server Matthew was helpful, courteous and efficient. He really made the good food stand out .  For being at the peak of lunchtime it was nice to see the restaurant wasn't packed but they were well prepared for the lunchtime crowd.Food was served fast without feeling rushed. Drinks were filled promptly without hovering.We had the Beef Galletta , a puff pastry with mushrooms, tender beef, brie , onions and a light sauce. Great size not too much but definitely filling.  Mom had chicken chop salad that looked fresh and tasty.  She really enjoyed it.   I look forward  to coming back and trying other items here.I will never give this restaurant another dime as long as i live. I have spent countless hours and dollars here as well as refered many family members and friends here. The food is great, but the recent visits have been inexcusable. Friday night the place was semi busy but had 3-5 empty tables and about 8 open seats at the bar. We asked for a table and were told it was a 45 minute wait so we opted to sit at the bar, but were told there was a wait there as well. I told the hostess there were empty seats all over and asked if we should go somewhere else. She told me very annoyed that we could sit at the bar. Through out whole meal nobody else sat at the bar. I wonder who was waiting. Today i just returned for sunday brunch and was told there is a wait for a table, again plenty of seats open. So i said can i sit at the bar? She replied she was trying to keep those seats open "incase a large party comes in." i asked ok where can i sit prior to being told "just wait for a table." again i askes should i just go spend my money somewhere else? She then fumbled and said let me see what i can do. What can she do im thinking? What the hell there are open seats everywhere and nobody waiting and one of your best regulars wants ONE seat. Needless to say I walked right out.In an economy where places are shutting down and losing their lease, id think you would hire nice and intelligent people. There are lots of over qualified people who need any job they can get. I dont know why i would spend my money somewhere where people are rude to me and incompetent. You lose, switch.dear switch,  thank you. from the bottom of my heart. for hosting a crowd of rowdy drunken and often shouting yelpers to your oh so generous weekend brunches.i hope to make this a weekly ritual, wherein i pay my respects to the patron god of the aztecs and their sacred drink the bloody mary; poured into a massive carafe, garnished with celery and made from the fresh innocent virgin blood of pubescent spanish girls. on behalf of my yelp crew and im gonna go ahead and say all of the phoenix yelp community: thank you, you make sunday/saturday mornings a happy blurry drunk driving fun day that i cherish!Dropped by for lunch with a friend.  I love the vibe an decor here....it's very modern and chic.  I ordered a Triple Grilled Cheese Sandwich (Provolone, American, and Cheddar Cheese on Griddled Texas Toast, $7.95 & Tomatoes, $.95).  It comes with a complimentary side of Caesar Salad....bonus!The Grilled Cheese Sandwich was awesome!  The thick Texas Toast was griddled perfectly....not too burnt, but not too soft....and the combination of Cheeses was just right.....the Tomato provided a nice, juicy & sweet flavor to the Sammie!  Next time, I'll also add Avocado to the Sammie for $.95 more.Our server was great too.....patient with us as we talked and browsed the menu.Overall, it was an awesome dining experience.Return Factor - 100%For pure delight, I have to give this place 5 stars. YOU MUST TRY: Very Berry Turkey Sandwich, Thai Braised Beef Tacos, Apricot BBQ Chicken Skewers, and the Red Sangria! I also highly recommend the Sunday Brunch Drink Specials; the mimosas and bloody Mary drinks are $3. They fill one glass up and bring you the rest of your drink in a carafe. They're strong and after just one you'll be pretty happy :D Other items worth noting: Margarita Sunrise, Blueberry Cosmo, Drunk Italian SodaWe had a reservation for 18, but our other 7 friends wimped out at the last min.  The 11 of us enjoyed Switch.  We had the high table by the bar and kitchen.  Tim was our server and he was awesome!!!  The weekend brunch menu looks so yummy.  I ordered the Breakfast Gallette (large puffy pasty topped 2 eggs, sausage, jack cheese & cheddar cheese, & served with breakfast potatoes. Everything tasted so so good, one minor thing I did not know the eggs were over easy.   The rest of the group polished off their food too!  Some of us ordered off the regular menu.  OMG, the burger looks and smells delicious!  I so need to be back to order another things off the regular menu!!!!Wow...I don't even know where to start.  (The beginning...that's usually a good place)So, the little lady and I had just finished up with yoga, and Switch was in the very near vicinity,  so we figured it'd be a good choice.  Wrong.  We were greeted in a somewhat timely fashion and seated.  Then we waited for a while...and then a little more.  The hostess was wiping off a nearby table and asked if we had been helped yet, and when we said no, she went to find our server.  Apparently he didn't know we were his table.  Ok, it's happened to me before, I'm willing to forgive.  Our server, Chris, came over and we ordered our food and drinks.  He came back with our bevs and then he didn't stop by again until food came out, meanwhile we had pushed both of our empty water glasses and my empty coffee mug to the end of the table...hoping that he would get the hint.  Nope.  Then the food came and he finally asked if we wanted more to drink.  He dropped off water and coffee and was gone until the END of our meal (which wasn't even good).  Was this a joke?  He comes over and says "So, how is everything guys?" My woman replied with "I've had better, can we please get the check?" and he didn't even ask what was wrong.  He brought the check and we were going to split it down the middle, and he said they were having system issues and couldn't split it.  Fine, one card...just get us the eff outta here!  When he brought the card back he literally tossed it on the table and told us to have a good day as he was walking away.Yeah, where's the manager?  I told the manager all about our sucky experience and our even suckier server.  I was given some excuse that their computer systems were down due to a hacking of sorts and blah blah blah...give me a break.  I understand things running a bit slow due to a computer problem, but NEVER coming to check on our meal and us having to ask a different server to please get us condiments and then to not even acknowledge when we tell you we've had better...that's not a computer issue.  That's a server who doesn't care about good business and doesn't know how to do his job.  We were given a comp card for the next time we come in, but really I doubt that will happen.   It's a shame, because I really do love supporting local gay businesses.  But they make it so damn hard with their declining service and mediocre food.Switch, our relationship must come to an end, because when it comes down to it...it's not me, it's you.Unbelievably rude service. I came here on a Sunday with two friends and we were the first people in the restaurant. We waited at the front for a while and the servers were too busy chatting with each other to acknowledge us so we sat ourselves. Once our server realized we had sat ourselves she had the audacity to tell us to in a very condescending tone to "wait for the hostess in the future". Again, we were the only people there. Do you really think you can be that rude to people when they sit down and expect them to stay?We got up and left, and I will not return. Switch has been officially scratched off my list of Sunday brunches for this ridiculous behavior and I will be sure to tell anyone who suggests we visit in the future.Came here for a fabulous lunch with ten other people.  Understandably, the wait time was a little long since they wanted to bring out all eleven dishes at once but it was worth it!I got the Chicken Pot Pie Gallette, Crème brûlée for dessert, and a Caipirinha to wash it all down.  That chicken pot pie was flaky buttery goodness!  The non-tradition pie and crust with a delicious savory cream gravy was some good old comfort food eating.  Even after offering bites to some of my lunch patrons, I still ate it all up with a happy smile.  The green beans were also really fresh and crisp.  Although I was content with my dish, I gotta say I loved my friend's Mac N' Cheese Plate even more.  Oh man, how I wish I got the same.  Yum!  Their fish and chips were also pretty tasty.  I especially like the dill tartar sauce accompaniment. Although I was full, I couldn't pass up on getting a crème brûlée.  Let me indulge a little!  It was a decent brûlée with the perfect caramelized crust and creamy custard goodness.  I ate it all, my dress was feeling a little tight, but I have no regrets.  The Caipirinha cocktail is a delicious mojito drink so no complaints there.  It was a bit light on the booze though but at 11:30AM in the morning, I shouldn't be out getting wasted anyways!Switch is a swanky place with a cozy simplistic atmosphere.  I like it!  I would love to come back again.I enjoyed a delicious meal here for a UYE lunch event. The restaurant was very accommodating for our party of 11 and provided excellent service - keeping our water glasses filled and ensuring all of our meals arrived at the same time. I enjoyed the Thai Braised Beef Tacos ($11.95) during a previous visit and they were just as delicious this time as I remembered! The 4 tacos have the perfect combination of spicy and sweet braised beef rib meat on corn tortillas with Asian hot sauce and tangy slaw. The tacos are accompanied by jalapeño slices and sweet pickles for those who want to "kick it up a notch." All of my dining companions seemed equally pleased with the mac 'n cheese, burger, salad, and lobster & seafood crepes. I will definitely return to Switch for the variety of entree options, cocktails, and great service. This is a great restaurant for a number of occasions - a birthday lunch, romantic brunch on the patio, or dinner with friends.I heard tons of positive reviews on this restaurant particularly their famous 'Switch burger' so I thought I'd give them a try.Location & Aesthetics - Located in Phoenix and on my initial drive to the restaurant I sadly missed it even though the GPS said we had reached.  The facade of the restaurant looks unassuming and, in my opinion, the signage could've been a little better.  When I turned around, I didn't miss it the second time.  Apparently parking is in the rear and you can also choose to enter in the rear or in the front.  To me it was easier to enter in the rear as I parked there.Lots of parking when we arrived which was around 1630-1700 for dinner.  Our initial thoughts was we were going to be the only ones there as the parking lot was empty.  My advice, if you're going for dinner, get there early because as we were leaving, the parking lot was full with no spots left.  In fact, when we pulled out, another potential customer took our spot immediately.The restaurant itself is snazzy, chic, superbly clean, uncluttered, lots of space between tables/chairs, and well decorated.  One can chose to sit outside with what looked like comfortable chairs and tables, and even fans attached to the wall to keep folks cool.  We chose to sit inside where the A/C was on but wasn't blasting, just comfortable enough.Menu - Well laid out, self-explanatory, and wasn't overwhelmingly 2-5 pages/leafs long.Service - The staff was really nice, friendly, warm, welcoming, and accommodating.  Any questions (about the menu) were answered promptly.  Our waitress checked on us several times throughout the meal to ask if everything was good, asked about drinks/refills, and asked about our appetizers.  Food - For my drink, I ordered the sweet tea vodka lemonade which was positively addicting!  I wanted more but since I was the designated driver, one was where I drew the line.For appetizers we ordered the onion rings.  Initially we were told it was just going to be around 8 but instead was greeted with much more plus given 2 dips - ketchup and another whose name eludes me now.  The onion rings was hot, fresh, crunchy and very tasty with not too much batter surrounding the onion itself (not overly fried).For the main course, I ordered the 'Switch House Burger' which was out of this world.  The beef was well seasoned and cooked to perfection, mouth watering, and juicy, and cooked exactly how I asked -- medium-to-well done.  Many of the ingredients it contained balanced each other out, e.g., the tartness from the goat cheese was balanced by the Switch fig dressing; and the zesty taste of the Arugula was balanced out by the onion strings....everything was perfect!The only reason they lost a star was because toward the end of the meal, we felt rushed as the waitress asked if we wanted to order any dessert, we declined, and immediately presented with us with the check.  Not a big deal in my book but the gesture was noticed by another in my party.This place really some nice looking tasting items on their menu and, for me, it's definitely worth coming back to try some of them.
Yucca Tap Room=Went to see My Doll tonight and walked from The Sets.  This is an awesome place to see live music, especially if you are a punk like me!It's really well-lit for a bar!  Never a cover charge, which is always a plus.The shows are always fun and tonight I almost got wiped out in the pit.  500 cool points for that!Takes awhile to get a drink from the bar, but that's a good and bad thing.  Good - you know there's a crowd.  Nothing like a dead place with bands playing.Bad - well, if you're really jonesin' for a drink, you have to wait.  Suckas!Oh great, just what I needed, another strong beer and craft liquor bar bar full of great people, nice pool tables and next door to my favorite music venue in the city of Tempe.They've done a great job with this place.  You could still smell a bit of the varnish from the new bar and walls when I went in, very cleanly done in greens and wood to reflect the three pool tables.  They have a nice selection of taps and a huge selection of bottled beer.  The owner said that they've got local artists bringing in rotating art starting next week.The liquor selection is a thing of beauty.  Rodney has sought out the best micro-distilled spirits he can find.  He poured us a little sip of the Dry Fly vodka and gin, both amazing, beyond your normal liquor for quality and smoothness.What I like best about this place is that it isn't trying to hard.  The crowd was still a Yucca crowd, the music was still rock, nothing loungey about it. Though my wallet dies every time I say it, Long Live Yucca.If I had to choose between sex and another visit to Yucca Tap, women everywhere would be bracing themselves for disappointment.While many bars aim to boast the LARGEST beer selection, Yucca keeps it cool, with a nice ratio of staples like PBR and Red Stripe for $3 to obscure drafts for as low as $6. Many of them come in 10-12 oz. glasses, and that's so they don't completely kick your ass. I had:Deschutes Hop Henge Experimental IPA (8.5% ABV)Mission Shipwrecked Double IPA (9.3%)And some other ale from Goose Island Brewery I was too buzzed to bother noting details on. Also, the liquor selection. Just do it.You don't even have to drink to enjoy this place. There's a good bar menu, a Foosball table, pool, some casino game I don't recognize, and A WHOLE OTHER BAR FOR MORE LIQUOR AND LIVE MUSIC. And they don't even charge a cover.Just writing this review makes me wanna race out there right now, and it takes a lot to get this excited about a dive.Serves food until 2AM!Saturday specials: $4 red headed slut shots... I think we are tempted. Too bad we didn't see the 3rd red head who walked by us as we all agreed to take it on the 3rd one that walks by. :(I've been eyeing this place for the longest time since I've been seeing my two friends from Arizona checking into this place. Finally got to try it out and....I only liked the drinks, atmosphere and the pool table. Totally did NOT like the food that night. On their menu, there is a bar snacks and entree section. I decided to eat something small since I know I cannot finish a burger or a taco by myself, so I got the chicken and beef kabobs. Some of you should know how a kabobs look like right? If you don't, they look like this http://yieatn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/kabobs-719954.jpg and what yucca gave me was only meat and no veggies. Disappointed...I wished they at least listed on the menu somewhere 'just meat' When I got the kabobs, my chicken tasted fine, but my beef tasted like it got dipped into salt at least 5x... Ugh. I hope the food only tasted that yucks because of not having enough people in the kitchen. I mean... if you're going to serve bar snacks, it shouldn't take 40-50 mins. Gah....Pool table entertained us the most throughout the night. $1 quarters a game. Plus there's a live band in the other room if you're interested in listening. By the way, there's also another bar in the same room where the band places but only a couple of tables to sit down. maybe it's a bad night that we went...I guess we'll have to find out the next time I visit! Until then...this place was OKAY.
Village Inn=Just as I nestled my tired butt into our booth, two cute elderly ladies were getting up from their table right next to us. As one helped the other into her walker, well, how do I put this delicately? Hmmm....as one helped the other into her walker, the lady with the walker, she, umm. Ok. Well, she ripped one. Ok. She farted. Yes I said it. And everyone heard it. But, unfortunately for me, my face was a foot from her polyester crack. Welcome to the Village Inn. As we awaited our food I noticed one employee at the counter chewing her nails. Really going to town. Like trying to break the Guiness Book of World Records. It was distracting. And disgusting. That said. We had a wonderful server with a nativity scene apron. Wow. Hmmm....I believe Mary has mustard on her forehead.  I enjoyed the basic eggs over medium, hash browns (perfectly crisp on top) and my buttermilk cakes. So the food was actually tastey. The flatulence and nail biting I guess were just a bonus.
Sushi + Sake=Ended up eating here on 3 occasions while at the GVR. This is a small space, with only a few tables, but plenty of seating at the sushi bar. Lots of creative and traditional rolls on the menu. I pretty good selection of nigiri, and a nice variety of sake. My favorite was Sparkling Blueberry Sake, very refreshing and you can taste the berry flavor.They offer an all-you-can eat option from 5-7 pm for $28.95. This is a very cost effective way to go when you are hungry and the all-you-can eat menu has almost everything on it. Beware, they will always serve rolls first to fill you up, so if you order nigiri make sure to specifically ask to have it brought out first.P.S. You have to try the steamed chicken dumplings off the fresh sheet.
Pappadeaux Seafood Kitchen=We came came for a schmoozing from a corporate client. It worked. We had the Mediterranean Calamari for apps. They were really good, I like the deep fried artichoke. I had lobster bisque, it was really creamy and had great flavor. The lunch was a halibut fillet sandwich and dirty rice. The rice was perfectly seasoned and fluffy. The halibut was cooked perfectly and was a very nice size. It was flaky and not dry at all. The building was really neat, I think a nice outside happy hour would be great in mid to late October. The service was perfect, not over pretentious or up on you the whole time.I really love this place!! Nothinglike a fun Sunday meal with my family to make me love it even more. We stuffed ourselves with delish catfish, fried shrimp , and tasty hazelnut Mahi. Service from Rocky was really fast , effiecient without that fake cloying attitude. Felt like we werethe center of the restaurant. Funny how things like fast drink refills, quick service and welltime plate removal can do that.  And here is the kicker of the evening ..I know have ordered or tasted every dessert on thier dessert tray, scary but true. Did you know that three of their desserts are made fresh there the rest including cheesecakes are made in Texas and brought in. I got the fresh Brulee  . yummy.   Can't wait to go back.$6 for a dozen Texas Gulf oysters Mon-Thur.  We ordered 8.Waitress was slick and upsold us on alligator, which contrary to popular belief, does not taste like chicken.  Get the spinach dip with real crab meat - it's fantastic.My first visit to Pappadeaux was in Houston in the early 80's. Living in the dessert now I miss the great tasting flavors of living on the Gulf Coast and then some. This is the place we migrate to when we are looking for a that type of feel good food.Both outside and inside is fixed up so that you feel like you are in New Orleans or nearby. Service is exceptionable. Just let them know what you need and / or want and they will make it happen. Grandpa Mark says so. Trust me!Food is always very good and tasty. We like to start off with a  large portion of fried alligator with an extra side of their special Creole dipping sauce. The complimentary French Bead with butter definitely take it to the next level. Dip Me Baby!Some of our favorites are anything deep fried of coarse, the blackened fish, all the items they grill, as well as the gumbos, salads, all the etouffees dishes and the dirty rice. Tally ho! The menu is just too big to go over it all.  Yummo!Last visit with the extended family we ordered the Ginger Salmon, Blackened Mahi, Blackened Catfish. Sampler Seafood Platter, Shrimp and Catfish, and of course some Alligator to get things rolling.Mention a special occasion like a B-Day celebration for an extra special treat. Hmmm? This is not a Long John's Pete's type fish place so prepare to enjoy. Place gets really busy and loud at peak times. Recommend going there for an early lunch to get the extra attention. Mr. Mark ........ table ready.Ah-YEE!Spend your money elsewhere!First time at Pappadeaux we had a bad experience with 1 staff member, brought it to the attention of management and were given a $50 gift card to make things right (was a pretty bad experience, not normally complainers)When returned for a 2nd time, to use the gift card, the hostess sat our party of 3 in between 2-10+ person parties.  Our 4 person table was squished in between the 2 parties that when the server went to take people's orders at the big party she was literally standing over top of me, shouting to the people on the other side of the table.  We asked to move as they clearly had open tables in other areas that were not so cramped - it was such an ordeal to allow us to move 30 ft to a new table.We get a new table and it takes 15-20 minutes before anyone comes over.  By this time it's about 6:15pm and we know happy hour is only until 6:30pm.  We asked for a round of drinks and are told happy hour is only available in the bar area.  WTF.We decline ordering drinks at the table and one of use walks to the bar, orders happy hour priced drinks and brings them back to our table.  Genius!  Apparently this is frowned upon though, oh well.  And the happy hour drink prices are laughable, a sweet tea...whatever its called was $8 - what the hell does it cost non-happy hour.  Their food is horribly over priced for what you get, its on par with Red Lobster and almost twice as expensive.  My friend ordered the stuffed crab and the server lets her know there is no crab in this dish, its 2 empty crab shells stuffed with breading, shrimp and fish bits.  12 shrimp cost about $17, I did not see any evidence that they had been dipped in gold prior to the fryer.  My friends Caesar salad has ONE lone crouton floating in the soggy, limp lettuce.  Our server, Jimmy was empathetic that we were having a rough experience and he gave us a creme brulee on the house.  Not to sound unappreciative, but I'm glad we didn't pay for it, was just meh.Time to pay.  Our bill comes to $72.  We have the $50 gift card and throw in $40 in cash and decide to let Jimmy keep the difference which is a pretty nice tip, since he had given us dessert.  He picks up the check book and we tell him we are good, no change needed.  We start to get ready to leave and another server/manager perhaps comes over w/ a receipt showing we owe $18 after the gift card was charged.  The $40 has disappeared, did Jimmy think we gave him a $40 tip??  To avoid any further annoyance we just leave and leave the $18 DUE receipt on the table.  Go to Red Lobster :)oh nom nom nom nom here. I've been to the one in New Mexico - but for some reason, it didn't stand out as much there. I think it might have been the Lunch course.THIS was definitely a much better experience.We got here a little after 8 pm, a bit early for our 8:30 pm reservations. They had our table ready and whenever we were ready to go. They were uber accommodating - even when our party of 10 became a party of 8.Brook was our server. AWESOME MAN. Fantastic suggestions, substitution, and all over awesomeness. Wished I lived closer to have this place all the time.Wine cellar for our private party. You should ask - it fits about 10-12 people comfortably. What we ordered-* Mississippi Catfish Opelousas - Blackened catfish with shrimp, oysters & jumbo lump crabmeat in a lemon garlic butter sauce with dirty rice ... It was so light, so flavorful. OH my. I totally understand why my friend LOVES this dish. $29.99*Atlantic Salmon Yvette (11 oz. 26.95 .. 7 oz. 22.95) Char-grilled salmon with shrimp, crawfish, mushrooms & spinach, in a sherry white wine sauce, with dirty rice.* Pappadeaux sampler - Fried fish filets (choice of catfish, tilapia or both), shrimp, blue crab cake, stuffed shrimp & stuffed crab with extra fried shrimp & crawfish)... the extra is what separates the seafood platter vs pappadeaux sampler. ($32.99)*Oyster sampler appetizer - with both of their baked oysters (Oysters Pappadeaux - Baked oysters on the half shell with crabmeat, spinach & hollandaise and Oysters Baton Rouge - Oysters on the half shell baked with a Parmesan Romano cheese sauce) - $13.95, with three of each oyster.*Appetizer Trio - Mini shrimp & crawfish fondeaux, fried alligator & hot smoked salmon* (we switched the salmon for Coconut shrimp) OH nom nom nom. This was one fantastic appetizer - can be shared or ordered as an entree - $22.99Somewhat disappointed in their section of raw oysters - Gulf Coast and Blue point only.Lobster tank in front, with their prices per pound. Will definitely come back especially now i know what I ordered. Pretty pricey, but totally worth the flavors and food. OH nom nom nom indeedHoo, boy..these are some good eats!We stopped in for lunch to find a bustling crowd in a massive restaurant, though the attentive staff more than made up for the lunch rush.We were seated quickly and had little trouble finding something on the seafood heavy, Cajun-inspired menu. Kicking off the meal was an order of the alligator bites: spiced, fried chunks of alligator with a zesty red sauce for dipping and a heap of crispy potato straws. The gator was cooked perfectly, neither mushy nor rubbery with a noticeable punch. Figuring it would be awhile before I saw alligator on a menu again, I went for the half po boy/gumbo lunch combo. The baguette was stuffed with fried alligator, lettuce, and pickles covered with tartar and cocktail sauces. Topped with a squeeze of lemon, it was hearty, delicious, and paired nicely with a cup of fiery andouille and seafood gumbo, packed with crab meat, sausage, shrimp, and that holy trinity of bell pepper, celery, and onions.Worth the trek from lower Phoenix (or the suburbs).Several years ago, when business travel to Houston was regular, I became a big fan of the Pappas family restaurants-- Pappadeaux Seafood Kitchen in particular.  As we drove north from Phoenix airport to Sedona I noticed a sign for Pappadeaux, and knew that this would be a lunch stop when the final portion of our vacation brought us back to Phoenix.The restaurant is large, attractively appointed and comfortable, with an encyclopedic menu of fish and seafood offerings.  Although best known for their Cajun preparations, there are abundant choices for everyone who enjoys well-prepared fish and seafood.Our server, Nicholaus, effortlessly navigated a crowded lunchtime dining room with our order.  Although a bit distant, he was a consummate professional.Brought first to the table was a large platter of crispy fried alligator nuggets, served with a full-bodied spicy sauce.  I ordered a platter of fried oysters, one of my favorites, while my family selected po boy sandwiches of shrimp or alligator.  We each had a cup of their Andouille, Crab, and Shrimp Gumbo.  The sandwiches were bountiful, and from what I was told, absolutely delicious.  The same could be said for the fried oysters.  A tartar sauce whose consistency was a bit less obvious as a packaged commercial product is all that separated this lunch from greatness.  The seafood was all fried just to the point of presenting a crispy coating surrounding tender, moist and flavorful protein.Hardly an inexpensive lunch, Pappadeaux Seafood Kitchen is in that class of restaurant that I would seek out wherever they operate.I prefer my food from the land and not the sea so seafood is not a dining favorite of mine. My picky style has never resisted me for taking up an opportunity to dine at Pappadeux as they have on shore tasty items on the menu. I always seem to dive into the crispy chicken fingers along with the wide variety of sides, however my last visited I was tempted to try the broiled half chicken. Boy was I impressed. It was so flavorful and fell right off the bone. Not only was it not dry but it was juicy. Matter of fact those seafood eaters who dined with me tasted a sample and wanted to clean my plate. Too bad and so sad for them they will have to come back because I ate it all. Along with the spaghetti squash and a bed of white rice. The great thing about this restaurant is they have a wide variety of options to choose from. A large dining area for larger parties and even a private room. You can dine casually to a romantic date or even have a party the whole crew will be impressed. They even have a full size bar with the same great menu. Pappadeaux the place to go!Always a fan of Pappadeux.  The last time I was here was for a group Valentine's date with two other couples.  Love was in the air that night especially since the couple at the table next to us got engaged.  Not exactly what I would call a romantic intimate setting but hey, it worked for them because the lady said yes!I love their crawfish, the fried alligator, and the Pappadeux oysters.  I haven't really ventured out to try anything else besides those three items.  The crawfish they serve up here has good flavor and are big but not exactly the best with all the new crawfish boil shops popping up.  I do think their fried alligator is still the best in town especially with their dipping sauce.  As for the Pappadeux oysters, what's not to love?  It's a dressed up oyster!This place gets packed fast, it's always super loud in here, and the decor is kind of tacky and gimmicky but it's a seafood restaurant so what do you really expect?  Come to Pappadeux for a fun night out with some decent eats!
Yogi's Teriyaki=For those looking for a decent teriyaki place, this is it.Skip all the fast food places that surround this place. These guys are kind of hidden in the back. But once you find it, your taste buds and stomach will thank you later. For those that are familiar with Flame Broiler in So Cal, these guys are pretty similar.What I got was the #11 Chicken and Beef Combo Plate with Vegetables and Brown Rice. Right away I am liking the fact that they don't charge you extra for the brown rice. The vegetables, which they give you good portions of, are consisted of broccoli, cabbage, and sliced carrots. The teriyaki sauce they have there are in big squeeze bottles. They also have sriracha for you spice heads. They have many other choices besides chicken and beef like short ribs, fish, tempura, miso soup, and California rolls.Prices are a bit cheaper than Teriyaki Madness and their customer service is very good.Too bad this is the only location they have because I live over by Aliante and this is kind of a drive for me so im jealous of those that work and/or live around this area.
Tommy Rocker's Mojave Beach Grill & Bar=Once upon a time, this place rocked.....always packed with people and had a great vibe.  Then, inexplicably, it became a topless strip club....wth?  Where were all the partiers who wanted to sing along with Tommy and his band go?  Who knows.Now, it's no longer a topless strip club, but it's lost the momentum it once had.  Which is too bad because it was a really fun place to go to meet up with friends, have a few drinks, shoot some pool, have some food, and sing along with the band.  Well, not really sing along, but the bands were so much fun (think Jimmy Buffet style) that you couldn't help but sing along with your drunk friends.I recently stopped by the joint to see what it was like now.  I walked into the place and it just didn't feel the same.  It's the same building and not much as changed inside the bar, but it was missing the people that made it fun.  It was replaced with other people, but it just didn't seem right.  I had a Beer and left.Despite losing it's luster and momentum, this place is one of the best places to be during a weekend that Jimmy Buffet is performing in Vegas.  Although Jimmy has opened up a joint at the Flamingo, many Parrot Heads still come here.  Before Margaritaville opened up, this was Parrot Head heaven during those weekends.Will I return?  Only during a Jimmy Buffet concert weekend.I purchased the Groupon for this place when it became available. Despite the good deal, I didn't have high expectations for this place. We came here this evening and decided to share several appetizers and a we each got a drink. The prices were pretty good. We shared buffalo wings, nachos with chicken and some sliders. Our waitress was beyond amazing. I was really impressed by how personable and attentive. She was friendly and always made sure our drinks were filled and had everything we needed. The food was surprisingly good as well. It wasn't gourmet by any stretch of the imagination was it was very tasty and affordable. I look forward to coming here again for some affordable drinks and grub. Their happy hour specials look really good as well and they last until 7 daily.
Fellini's Ristorante=Frederico Fellini was a brillant and enigmatic Italian director of films in the 50's, 60's and 70's. 4 of his films won an Oscar for best foreign film.If you talk to any film afficianado, they would recognize his titles, like La Dolce Vita, 8 1/2, La Strada, le notti de cabaria, and Amarcord . His movies were known for their psychological content, influenced by the famous Swiss psychologist Carl Jung, and their clever sexual innuendos (i.e. train entering a tunnel). He enjoyed the great Japanese Director, Akira Kurosawa, because they were both inspired by their own dream worlds, and Fellini influenced, by their own admissions, great international directors like Ingmar Bergman, Stanley Kubrick, Martin Scorcese and Bernado Bertolucci. He is considered by many one of the 10 best directors of all time. One of his characters in La Dolce Vita, named Paparazzo, who took pictures, inspired the term Paparazzi.This Fellini's isn't a legend like Frederico was, but it is a solid Italian restaurant in the Stratosphere Hotel and Casino. The prices, for Vegas, are reasonable, and the food is tasty and well done if not extraordinary and memorable. The Carpaccio ($12.95) was nice, with capers, dry cheese, olive oil and arugula; the Angel Hair pasta with Rapini ($18.95) was very good and a lot of food; the Fettucine Capri was enough for 2 with a nice sauce that was in between a cream and a tomato base. Garden Salad was $6.95.  A nice Ruffino Reserve red wine ($37.00) added to the enjoyment of the food, and the Tira Misu ($6.95) was classic and light.Service was good, although Steve, the best server, was off that day. Inside this Fellini's, you can get a good reliable Italian meal, unlike an unpredictable, wild and crazy, sexually charged Fellini Film. For something more like that, just step back out onto the Strip!TIPS: Free valet parking at the stratosphere. After walking in to the building from valet parking, head towards the CASHIER sign and make a right. Go all the way down, pass the poker room and you'll find it tucked away on the left. Also, TravelZoo coupon online, deal ends 9/30/2014.So I may be slightly biased because we bought the travel zoo coupon and everybody knows that a good deal always seems to make food taste better. Well at least in my family haha Despite the voucher's fine print that limits one coupon per table, the restaurant was more than happy to let us use 2 coupons for our party of four. For $49 you get a soup/salad (specialty salads too, like shrimp caesar, caprese, etc.), an entree up to $32.95 in value (which is basically everything but 2 dishes on the menu), and a dessert to share (any of the desserts on the list.) They automatically added the gratuity which is a percentage of the actual bill price but it still is a pretty sweet deal. First they bring out fresh bread and butter that is sitting on a bed of minced roasted garlic with olive oil. Really yummy. We also ordered some chardonnay- a liter was only $20 so each of use had about 2 glasses which I thought was a good deal.  I ordered the mozzarella caprese (large slices of fresh cheese!), my aunt's chicken caesar was pretty big, and two other had the tomato salad. For our entrees, my dad's linguine with clams was overflowing with shellfish, I had the gnocchi with filet mignon, my step moms lamb shanks comes with about 5 shanks, and my aunt's rib eye was huge. We all were pleasantly surprised. Lastly, we picked the tiramisu and godiva chocolate mousse cake. Yum and yum.Service was a little slow at first but once we told them we had a show to catch shortly after dinner, they were much more attentive and told the chef so that we could get out of there on time. Overall I think we still saved quite a bit of money, so if you're unsure at least check it out with the coupon to see if ya dig it as much as we did.
King's Fish House=Tried this for the first time Saturday night.We got there around 9pm and it was still really busy - we waited in the bar and enjoyed bloody marys and popcorn shrimp. Both were excellent.Once we got seated (about :30min later) we ordered the breaded halibut and the crab legs. I was impressed by the excellent service and overall food quality. I will definitely return and recommend Kings Fish House.Hungry ? Want something to eat , like maybe fish?  Well this place has fish. This is the kind of place to go when you want food but not really caring how good it COULD be .  Service was great and very prompt. The host  , bartender, and wait staff seemed very into their jobs.  But the fish itself was not memorable.    A bit pricey , but offered many kinds of fish which seemed to be flown in?   I wouldn't go back unless a group of people were meeting there and it was what everybody else wanted. Enough said.3.5 starsAfter a failed attempt to dine elsewhere, we ended up at King's.  Unlike Maria Maria, King's was more than happy to promptly seat us without an unnecessary wait.There is quite an extensive menu, and a lot of complaints on Yelp about price.  I didn't think it was all that expensive.  Most of the entrees were under $20 and that includes two sides.I had the crab cakes with french fries and mac 'n cheese.  The crab cakes were good even if not the best I've had.  Mac 'n cheese fell a little short for me.  Not much cheese.  More like mac 'n bread crumbs.  My husband had the king crab legs.  Expensive ($43) but 1 1/2 lbs and tons of crab meat.  I tried and it was delicious.We had excellent service.  Could not have asked for better!  My one suggestion would be to serve the sourdough bread warm!  At least until June!WOW... being from New England area "Mass-hole" , i usually am pretty lenient to places since we are "land locked"..Sourdough bread to start.. hard exterior, did not taste anything close to fresh,, anyways,, looking over the menu, and was a little shocked.. prices higher than "pappadeaux" n thinking the food quality better match..Appetizer PEI mussels - decent flavor , but 1/3 look over dehydrated, almost as if they were dead way before cooking time. or recooked or something,, those we un-edible.Wife got the clam chowder which was actually really good..  hence 2 starsI thought, 22 bucks for some scallops,, hmm, let me try that out.. huge plate came out with these little marble sized scallops, 12 of them.. thats almost 2 dollars a piece for each lil scallop, Side zuchini was ok, but the cole slaw definitely not great,, some bites had that sour weird rubberband taste,,Waitress, awesome, always smiling, refilling our drinks,, Finished with a $60 bill,, not even close to satisfied and never going back..If you want seafood on the east valley, go ahead n hit up red lobster, if you want some great seafood, hit up n. phoenix to pappadeaux(worth the drive and time, will never be dissatisfied)Lesson Learned. :-(I've been driving by this place for a long time every time I go into Tempe Marketplace and was always curious about this place. So today I decided at the last minute to give this place a try. The place is very modern looking and my son commented that it was something like a boat house. I could somewhat see that with lots of wood and pictures of fish. Anyways, they started us off with  sour dough bread and butter. I always love sour dough bread and it was very good. For appetizers we had fried calamari and a few cups of clam chowder. The calamari were huge pieces with a very flakey batter on it. Excellent. Really enjoyed it. The clam chowder was gobbled up by my wife without no complaints. I tried it and was pretty good. For our main course, I had the Ono fish with rosemary potatoes and mac and cheese. Ono fish is somewhat like the swordfish which is a little dry so overall I thought my meal was good. Loved the Mac and cheese with the rosemary potatoes. My wife had the Mahi-Mahi with spinach and carrots. Her meal was really good. This fish was very tender and juicy. Cooked perfect. She enjoyed it. My son had the linguini with clams and he gobbled it up so he really enjoyed it. My mom ordered the full fried catfish and when they say full. They mean full. Head and tail included. Huge catfish which was bigger than the plate but she ate it all and thought it was really good. So overall, we had a good meal. Service was good. Our server kept filling our water cups up all the time and the food came out in a timely manner. All I can say is huge portions, good food, good service and we will be back again. Enjoy.I came here for "easy hour" a while back with my ladies and what can I say...At 5pm on a Friday, business was crazy busy!  We waited around for about 30 minutes before we were seated.  The wait time isn't so bad when you're guzzling pina colados and bloody marys with great company.  When we finally were seated, we ordered two oyster samplers, the baja ceviche fish cocktail, a garden salad with Caesar dressing on the side[my friend is quirky like that], a hot seafood combo, and the macadamia nut crusted Alaskan halibut.  The oysters were delicious and the ceviche was refreshing.  The salad had ranch dressing poured all over it even though we had asked for Caesar dressing on the side.  When we asked our waitress about this, she apologized and said she'll bring us a new salad in 5mins which actually came out 20mins later after a reminder from my friend.  Oh well.  It's just salad and it *was* pretty busy.  The seafood combo was very flavorful and delicious but the biggest disappointment was the overcooked halibut.  I was most excited for the halibut so when I ate a fork full of dried fish, I was pretty sullen.My overall experience with King's Fish House wasn't too bad but I think I'll just stick with drinks and oysters the next time I stop by.
Island Sushi & Grill=The search continues to find a good AYCE sushi restaurant in Vegas...and Island Sushi and Grill has been getting quite a lot of attention as of late.We had to see what the fuss was all about as well, so we came on a Monday night to enjoy their $24.95/pp AYCE sushi dinner.  (Lunch is $20.99/pp.)  When you first walk through the doors, you'll find yourself at a walk up counter.  This is just the 'grill' part of the restaurant serving up lots of Hawaiian plate options.  If you make a right, you'll enter the 'sushi' part of Island Sushi and Grill and if you want AYCE, this is where you want to be.After being seated and our beverage orders were taken, the waitress came by to ask if we wanted to start with any appetizers.  She also gave us a sheet and pen to fill out for our nigiri and sushi roll options.  Appetizers: * Ahi Belly, Garlic Pepper Sauce (limit one order per person) - A small portion, but tasty!* Ahi Poki - Pretty good!* Deep Fried Geso - Our favorite was the deep fried baby octopus.  It comes in an order of three with a dipping sauce.  Pretty good stuff!* Edamame* Garlic Chicken* Hamachi Kama (limit one order per person)* Pork Gyoza* Raw Crab Poke (limit one order per person)* Tako Kim Chee Poke (limit one order per person)Nigiri - They do give you small pieces of fish on small mounds of rice, which is a good thing. It's AYCE after all, so you can order more.  But it can be discouraging when you first see it.* Albacore* Amaebi (limit one order per person)* Garlic Tuna* Hamachi * Hirame* Ika* Ikura* Saba* Sake* Scallop Mayo* Tai* Uni (limit one order per person)Things we forgot to order because we were so full: Eggplant Fries, Fried Tofu Poke, Lomi Salmon, Mochiko Chicken, and Salmon Kama.Everyone seems to rave about their rolls, but we're not big on rolls with just the two of us.  So, we didn't have any.  But if we were with a larger party, there were definitely a few that we would consider.I wouldn't say their sushi is the highest quality, but I think people come because they do have a few other items like mochiko chicken, garlic chicken deep friend baby octopus, ahi poke, raw crab, tako kim chee poke, etc.  Like many AYCE sushi joints in Vegas, it's about what appetizers and cooked items are offered as well.They are quite specific about any charges for leftover food - $1 for nigiri and $3 for an 8 piece roll.  So take you time when ordering, especially if you're ordering rolls.   You are limited on one dessert option per person.  Everyone talks about the 808 Special, so we got one of those.  It's a deep-fried banana, ice cream, fresh strawberries, whipped cream, and chocolate sauce.  But our favorite was the Malasada Sundae.  One very delicious malasada cut into four pieces, ice cream, whipped cream, and guava(?) sauce.Service was quite efficient and the waitresses were friendly.  We didn't have to wait long at all for any of our orders, which is definitely a plus.  Beverages were refilled without having to ask and any empty plates were cleared quickly as well, so no complaints about service at all.They also offer a frequent eater card, ten AYCE and you get one free.What makes this place a real locals' place is all the specials they offer.  You can tell there are a lot of regulars here - families, couples, singles, etc.  Some are here for the grill menu to go or the sit down sushi.

I've been wanting to try this and it's right by their house (lucky them!). With so many AYCE places, it's hard to pick and choose. Even having tried many, I couldn't really pick a "best", but had more of they're all good, but here's the pros and cons of each particular place kind of answer (IE- some have bomb apps but meh sushi, great nigiri but rolls and apps are boring). I'll go on a limb that this is the best that I've had since it meets a lot of points. First point- appetizers are interesting, and have a wide variety. Sure, sure. Come for nigiri to get "moneys worth" but it gets a bit repetitive that way. I think I get my worth through the variety of foods I get to eat. Ahi Belly with Pepper Garlic- the sauce was light but not overwhelming that you can't taste the fish melty, fatty yumminess or the nice char.Deep Fried Geso- delicious!! perfectly cooked baby octopus is always a favorite for me.Salmon Lomi- it was just okay. It was more tomatos than anything.Ahi Poke- very nice version. ordered 2!Tako Kimchee- nice thin sliced octopus stirred in with kimchee.Hamachi Kama- I love kama and theirs had such a good char and perfectly crispy skinNigiri- the fish was fresh. The plus to me was that they do nigiri smaller than average (dont worry- the rice to fish ratio is very fairly proportional). Now some people might be taken aback since were all used to largesse given in cuts but, the smaller cut is perfectly bite sized and gives the opportunity to sample more variety. Some of these restaurants serve a two bite nigiri and with the BFs braces and jaw he dislikes how he has to bite in half and break it to eat. Standouts:Escolar/Super White Tuna- pretty good. Cajun Albacore- very nice seasoning and ponzu sauceCajun Tuna- this has the seasoning and then has a wasabi aioli which was quite unique and goodYellowtail- this is one of my favorite fish and it was very freshAll the rest were good too. Only one that was just okay was the mackerel which had a bit of a salty quality to it that isn't the norm.  We also got a special chef creation which was also a highlight of the night- it was a thin slab of rice on nori that was toasted to a crispy cake and topped with spicy chunks of tuna, thin slab of avocado, a dot of siracha, and a sweet sauce- probably eel sauce. It was very nice textures and flavors together. Rolls- not usually into rolls but only because most places its 90% california roll with different toppings and sauce. Boring. They had some interesting rolls. We tried The Croc which combined a few favorite elements- it has some spice, it has soft shell crab, sweetness from some unagi. Pretty good. I would have gotten more, but between just the two of us, whole rolls is a lot to eat and we wanted variety. Next time when we bring our friends to share with. They don't do half rolls, except on your very last roll you want to order.  I kept getting my favorite handroll though- salmon skin which is lovely here. Dessert- not just the standard ice cream or mochi, though they do offer that too. They have a malasada sundae, the 808 special and creme brulee. We got the malasada which was yummy and the creme brulee had nice flavors but it wasnt so solid as it should, more runny, but it was still good. I like that this place can satisfy appetizer people, nigiri people, roll people and even dessert people. It's that reason why I think this is my favorite that we can bring all types of ayce people and their needs can be met. It's $24.95, cheaper by a few bucks than most dinner ayce and I think has better quality than those that hit the $30 mark. They give you 90 minutes which I don't really need, but I just like places where they're not timing you....I think here they realize people like to pace and sometimes, you're just waiting for food since it's all made-to-order stuff. Did I mention the hospitality? The sushi chef/owner was very attentive, talkative and seems very cool. The staff never even let our ice teas hit halfway and came to check on us a few times to see if we want more appetizers from the kitchen. Oooh if I lived on this side of town I will come by all the time! Since I don't, we just have to make day trips to Henderson more often! Onolicious food, Hawaiian hospitality- whats not to love?!  ALOHA!Aloha LV Yelpers!Came to Island Sushi about 3 years ago when I was visiting Vegas... stopped by to pick up a plate lunch to go... 3 years later... I'm back at Island Sushi as a Las Vegas resident! Came here the other night... AYCE!!!I'm a huge fan! Everything I love from seaweed salad, poke, lomi salmon, mochiko chicken, garlic chicken, teri beef, malasada, coco puffs, unique rolls with fun names... I'm sold!I wish I.S. was closer to me... I would be there weekly for sure! If you're looking for Hawaiian food and sushi with a local twist... Island Sushi is the hot spot!I feel at home when I'm here... locals everywhere... Big Island pictures on the wall... including Hilo my hometown... one of the girls working there as a server is from Hilo... I love being around Hawaii people!I'll be back for my Hawaiian fix... AYCE works for me! A must while in Vegas!Mahalo Island Sushi!-Miss Yelp 2011My Island Sushi cherry has officially been popped! My cousins have been telling me to try this place out for months, and finally we all got together to feast!! (I was the only newbie).WHERE: Located on Eastern & Serene.WHAT: As a first-timer, I had to do AYCE!! Wouldn't it be a waste if I didn't eat all I could?!! Ok so back to my experience.  I am in love with baked rolls, and the only downside to this place was that AYCE did not have ANY baked rolls whatsoever! I was bummed at first, but when I tried what they did have, my "bummness level" decreased.WHAT I HAD:The appetizers I had were: ahi poke (I might have to say that this is one of the best I've tasted in town! It was very fresh and tasty), mochiko chicken (ahh, I fell in love after the first bite!), seaweed salad (sweet & delishhhh), and baked mussels (always one of my favorites when on any menu).Special Sushi rolls I had:-Mt. Charleston roll; Since they didn't have baked rolls, they did have baked scallops on this roll.  I had to take advantage because this was the closest thing to baked that I'd be getting that night. Haha, when I did get my roll, I was very pleased!-Ahi Poke roll; I apparently couldn't get enough of the tuna in my system, I needed more! Kudos to this roll though =).-Island Special roll; this roll was my all time favorite! Everyone must have this! It hit the spot indeed.*NOTE: if you do decide to do AYCE, you get to choose a free dessert! I always have room for dessert in my tummy =D. There were malasada&icecream, brownie&icecream, just plain icecream, mochi, and I believe there were a couple more.  I settled for my mango mochi of course.WHY: A lot of people have been comparing Island Sushi to 808 Sushi (because of the whole owner/chef switch, I actually am not so clear of it myself), but I have personally come to conclude that Island Sushi defeats 808 Sushi in my book."Whoa, do all the ladies from Hawaii look like this?" my poker buddy ask while showing me his phone."ummmm....what?" I say, lost, looking past the beautiful wahine and trying to see the food on the website."Maybe she works there.  If the next flop is red, you're buying lunch" my bud says excitedly."Book it." I say and the rest is history.It's the usual, great Vegas AYCE place.  Super creative rolls filled with lots of deep fried stuff (soft shell crab, shrimp tempura), stuff mixed with spicy mayo, usually coated with a sweet, teriyaki eel sauce.   Most of the fish taste previously frozen or gassed.  All good though if you skip the nigiri.What sets this place apart is the local Hawaiian style flavors.  Paniolo roll (teri beef inside, miso sauce, outside) and the poke roll (as its name implies).  Only disappointment, the Maui Wowie. Dang it. (You're a better person if you don't get it.)Oh yeah, plate lunches are as good as back home.  Local style mochiko chicken, teri beef, mixed plates, and fried noodle combos.  Usual AYCE prices.  Lunch $21, Dinner $25.  All day happy hour with 50% off all rolls (not the AYCE) Mon - Wed. for the lighter eater.  Plate lunches are very reasonable averaging $7.50.Great place when you're jonesing for a taste of Hawaii.This review is for the sushi portion of dinner. The restaurant is located on Eastern past Serene, but before Richmar. If you get up to BJs, you've gone too far. Inside of the restaurant is sectioned off in to two areas. Entrance area seems to be designated for traditional Hawaiian grilled dishes, and the area thru the door on the right is the sit down sushi area. We came here on a Friday night and it was packed. They do have a wide selection of AYCE sushi and many sides to choose from (although the sides appear to be half of what you'd get if you were ordering a la carte).The AYCE menu has two symbols that denote different things. Chopsticks next to the item indicate it is a dinner only item, while the sushi icon indicates it is one order per person.  The rolls were fine and fish relatively fresh. One thing to note is their speciality rolls were in fact not drenched in Yum sauce or mayo concoctions of any sort. A lot of what we ordered had their garlic sauce on the roll itself, and I wasn't a fan. It tasted like gin ...I know strange.  We sample several rolls: Joe's Special, Black Widow, Spicy Mexican, Lava Lover, Lasagna, Surf and Turf. I also had their scallop mayo and salmon nigiri. The salmon was fresh, the scallop mayo was very bland and forgettable. My favorite roll of the group was Spicy Mexican, the rest were decent, but nothing I would rush to eat again.The service was fine, minus the initial hiccup. It took a little over 20 minutes to get our first three rolls to the table. I know that it wasn't our servers fault, and it was pretty packed in there. They didn't bring it out roll by roll so we had food coming throughout, instead they waited for all rolls to be made before they brought them out. I guess it makes more sense that way, especially with being so packed.  So although, famished by the time we got the food, I won't hold it against them.I would recommend this place is you want more simple, non yum sauce heavy rolls with fresh fish and friendly service.3 star service but I actually like this place! I've eaten next door multiple times for the Hawaiian food and came with friends to get poke but never got around trying the AYCE here..Looks run down and outdated which had me iffy about the place before .. But it was the closes sushi joint from the gym so I gave them a chance.We ordered..Puhi Maki Roll (daily special) - spicy soft shell crab, assorted fish on top with garlic ponzu sauce (Very Tasty!)Salmon Skin Handrolls - crispy salmon skin, just enough sauce and not too much rice wrapped in seaweed (DELICIOUS!)Raw Crab Poke - fiancé got this, looked appetizing and plentiful but I wasn't daring enough to try it..Eggplant Fries - crispy, sliced, battered eggplant came with Spicy Miso Sauce, which I think didn't really compliment it, but I'm one who doesn't really care for dipping sauces.Baked Salmon Roll - it was good but nothing special about it, loved that it didn't have so much rice nor cheese on top! Tofu Poke - so simple, yet sooo good! Fried tofu in their poke sauce with onions! (SOOO GOOD! Lol)Malasada Sundae - the malasada (aka Hawaiian donut) tasted like cardboard, was dry and seemed like it's been sitting there for days.. Strawberries were sweet and the vanilla ice cream.. Was just ice cream.. Not a fan.Sushi chefs were attentive but the waiters/waitresses were not.. Service was slow from the waiters, i.e. took almost an hour to get my eggplant fries.. Bit of a turn off..Overall satisfied with my meal and will def come back for the salmon skin handroll and tofu poke!I remember when this place used to be my favorite sushi restaurant in town, Koto. I've given this place a few tries. The food has improved but the service has not. AYCE susi with a taste of Hawaii. Hawaiians are known for being laidback and friendly. There were plenty of empty tables when we got there yet, we had to wait for a table. Really? We placed out order. Some items took forever but some we never got. I guess our previous server was finishing up his shift but didn't notify us. We tried a few nigiri, rolls, teri beef sliders, garlic edamame, ahi poke, salmon katsu and malassadas. We didn't order that much but we spent 2 hours total here.Lunch AYCE is from 11:30am-4pm for $21.95 and dinner AYCE is from 4pm-close for $26.95. There are certain items that are only available for dinner, limit 1/person, 2 desserts/person and there's a 90-minute limitfor AYCE. With service slower than molasses, you'll easily go over 90 minutes! The food was good but the service really turned us off. My boyfriend is very calm and laidback and for him to even say something about the service says a lot. The female server was borderline rude. No smile on her face, no nothing. The servers don't even look up to see if anyone in the restaurant needs something. They walk around with their head down or pretending to be busy. 3 servers and 5 tables, c'mon!Solid place to get local Hawaiian food and poke!I've been coming here quite often to get my sweet taste of home here in Henderson and I do approve! I mean nothing beats some of the joints back at home, but this place is great!If you are every craving poke or Hawaiian or local food (yes, there is a difference between Hawaiian and local food), then this is a wonderful spot to go to. I've been to both the plate lunch side and the sushi side and both are great dining options. The sushi side is especially good during happy hour where all of the rolls are 50% off! I believe happy hour is Mon-Wed all day! It's a great deal for delicious sushi. They also have an AYCE option but I've never tried it yet since I usually just go for happy hour!As for the plate lunch side, I've had the bento boxes (which are really filling) and the spicy tuna bowl which I am a fan of, especially the taro chips inside.The poke is also not bad. I really enjoyed the spicy tuna avocado one. The fish was good quality and had a nice texture but I wished there were more fish/avocado and less of the spicy mayo. The parking lot can sometimes get crowded as can the restaurant so try and come early or later in the evening. Also, the sushi side of the restaurant does take reservations so call ahead if you can and know that you have a big party!I've heard mixed things about this sushi spot over the years, so I finally ventured over with my OG for some all you can eat sushi action and see for myself.The wait was pretty long but they were able to seat us quickly if we sat at the bar. The restaurant is very small and cramped. The seating was especially tight at the bar. I figured sitting at the bar, service would be better since we had direct access to the sushi chef, but I was wrong. It was hard to get his attention to order anything and there was a number of items we ordered and never received. The service from the kitchen was the same. Slow and on several occasions they brought out what we ordered to another table only to let us know and we were forced to wait a little longer for our items. The service issues were enough to make me not interested in returning, but the food didn't really do it for me either. No standouts and almost every dish was something I've had better versions of at other sushi restaurants.I've had this place bookmarked for a few weeks now and decided to try it yesterday. My friend just got back in town and we wanted to catch up over sushi and sake. I Love Sushi (also on Eastern) is our usual go to but I suggested to be adventurous and try somewhere new!When you first walk in I believe you're in Poke Express, a separate quick service restaurant inside Island Sushi. There is a place to order to the left and casual seating straight ahead. To the right is an entrance that opens up to Island Sushi which is a pretty small restaurant. We waited to be seated and the host said it would be about 30 min for a table. We decided to get started on sake at the bar and was seated at a table shortly after. We weren't starving so we ordered a la carte rather than AYCE. I had the spicy garlic edamame, tuna poke, and a spicy tuna hand roll. The tuna wasn't very fresh in either of my tuna entrees. Hand roll was pretty tasteless, so I doused it in soy sauce/wasabi. The tuna poke was highly disappointing!! It wasn't flavorful and the texture of the tuna honestly felt like it sat out for a few hours. Some pieces were dry and chewier than the norm. The tuna was on a bed of seaweed salad, which was also dry. SO dry that when I tried to gather some seaweed salad with my chopsticks, I picked up ALL of the seaweed salad in an large chunk instead. The spicy garlic edamame wasn't bad, but didn't taste extraordinary enough to make me want to come back to this place...No complaints with the service, however, the dishes I tried here weren't memorable or enjoyable. Doubtful I'll return.Superb Sushi!It's pretty ridiculous how much I enjoyed their sushi.  We decided to try them for lunch since it was recommended by friends. The right side of the restaurant opens at 11:30.  We chose to sit at the sushi counter in front of chef Jason.  He was friendly and quick in preparation.  We had a great lunch thanks to him! Since they have AYCE, it worked best for us to try several different creations.  Jason suggested the Hamachi which is yellowtail.  In the first bite there was a unique flavor.  We asked him what it was.  They combine orange and lemon into the yellowtail for this distinct flavor.  We immediately loved it.  The 007 was our second choice.  Crab and cucumber topped with shrimp, avocado and eel sauce certainly made this a winner.  The Island Special with soft shell crab topped with spicy tuna, spicy aioli and eel sauce did not disappoint.  Incredible flavors from each roll this far! The cherry on top was our final order of the Baked Salmon.  This is a California roll topped with cream cheese, salmon and dynamite.  It just melted in your mouth.  I cannot wait to come back and try some of their other choices.  I have a feeling I'm going to enjoy every bite.Recently I have been an adventurous eater set out to explore the Hawaiian restaurants in the ninth island of Las Vegas. It all started with a few visits to L&L Barbecue that got me hooked on the Hawaiian plate lunch. On a couple of recent weekends, my adventures in dining led me to Island Sushi and Grill.    Island Sushi and Grill is located along the thriving Eastern Avenue Corridor south of Interstate 215 between the signalized Serene and Richmar intersections on the east side. It is in a small shopping center that doesn't draw much attention to the business. The first impression of Island Sushi and Grill from the outside is that it is a fancy sushi restaurant. It is a false impression because inside Island Sushi and Grill is a diverse dining experience.    Island Sushi and Grill is really two different restaurants that are divided into two rooms. The first room when you enter is a Hawaiin restaurant with pastries and take out sushi. There are a few long tables and two counters. The counter close to the door is where you order the Hawaiin food. The counter toward the back by the condiments and beverage machine is the sushi counter. The room to the right is a full service restaurant offering sushi and other entrees. In summary Island Sushi and Grill is a restaurant specializing in two areas of food: sushi and Hawaiin food. Pertaining to my experiences I experienced the plate lunch dinners on my two visits prior to penning this review/reporting of experiences.    On visit number one, I exchanged around $10 for a garlic chicken plate lunch with fountain beverage then a week later on visit number two, I exchanged around $10 on a chicken with eggplant plate lunch with fountain beverage. Being that they are plate lunches they included white rice and macaroni salad. The food was served in a styrofoam box that I brought to the table after they called my order. On both visits the chicken met my expectations. For safe measure, I added schirachi sauce to it just as I added soy sauce to the rice. L&L has far better macaroni salad and Ross J's  Aloha Hawaiian Barbecue serves far larger portions. This is the first restaurant that my food adventures led me that offered chicken with eggplant. It seemed to be chicken over eggplant with a lot of white rice around it and a little cup of macaroni salad nearby.    Being an adventurous eater, I foresee many more restaurants to explore. Before I set sail for further dining adventures, my report on dining two times in Island Sushi and Grill is that it is a three star  experience.
Penn's Thai House=Sunset Thai House has taken first place in my heart for Thai in Las Vegas and Henderson. This quaint restaurant is nestled in a spot which most would overlook. Not for long cause  the mutha effin Goonies just discovered the cave of Thai treasures! Do the Truffle Shuffle! Every dish I've had here has been golden.The restaurant is nicely decorated and kept clean and pristine by the friendly staff. I have dined in, but now prefer to order takeout so I can enjoy the flavorgasms in the comfort of my flannel pjs parked in front of the telly. Both ways my orders have been handled quickly and accurately. Now to the good part. The food.FIVE GOLDEN RINGS!!! Or Golden Stars in the Yelp World. FYI- For you Heat Lovers like moi just know if you say HOT it's gonna be H-O-T. If you say Firecracker Hot you will be shootin' fireworks out of your bungholio after. No joke. Also they are closed on Sundays.*Egg rolls-  Bangin' with flavor. I can thank these bad boys for that added inch to my waistline this month, but it's the holiday season so who's counting?*Panang with Beef- The best Panang I've ever had! Blows those other places in Commercial Center out of the water. If Sunset was in a knife fight with my ex Archi, Archi would leave in a body bag. Just sayin'. If you come here and you like curry this dish is a MUST.*Spicy Chili Chicken- On point with heat from the sliced peppers and complexity of flavor in the sauce. Me like. *Chicken Pad Thai- A simple dish done very well. In the future this might be added to all of our orders.*Crispy Garlic Chicken- I refer to this beauty as Funnel Cake Chicken with a kick. The chicken is almost candied and oh so crisp. I have craved it's goodness hourly since I killed the last of it Saturday morning. This dish is my Precious and satisfies both my need for heat and sweet.If I was wealthy enough to employ a private chef it would be the talented owner/chef of Sunset Thai House without a doubt. Five Stars all the way. Now race your Yelpy butts down here and get your Thai on!First things first, I gotta give a shout out to my girl Jaime W. for telling me about Penn's Thai House! It's not our #1 pick for thai food in Vegas (nothing beats Komol for my hubby!!) but it's really close to our house and the Penn (the owner) is fabulous. The location isn't the best, but that can be said about some of the other fantastic thai places in town, like those in Commercial Center. This isn't a fine dining establishment by any means. Aesthetically, the place could use a little work.  But for people that like take out, Penn's is fab! Unlike some places in town, when you request your meal hot at Penn's, you are going to get it hot... regardless of your ethnic background. My husband likes his food HOT, to the extent that he will break out in a sweat halfway thru his meal if it was done right.. Not only has he always been happy with the heat factor on the food he has ordered from Penn's, but the owner goes above and beyond and will package up containers of the different spices and chilis so if he needs a little extra OOMPH, he can add it. She does this without us asking, just because she remembers his request for hot food from the very first time we went in.I am not a big fan of spicy foods, in fact I'd go as far as to say I am a wussy when it comes to the heat. Penn's still keeps me happy with their delicious egg rolls, tasty stir fries and, mmm is there thai tea ever good! If you find yourself out in Henderson, craving some spicy thai grub, give Penn's a try.Penn's you are that pair of jeans that just seems to get better and better with every wash. Thai masterpieces keep consistently coming out of this kitchen.FACTS: I have taken over fifteen close friends to Penn's and every single one of them have been back two or more times. I've also never been disappointed with the spice level or overall delivery of anything I've been served here. That being said, the past two months most times I have gotten takeout and it's still on point.Latest faves here are the Cashew Chicken, Tom Kha, Pad Thai and as of this evening the Pad Woon Sen. That dish actually inspired me to write an update. The balance of spice level HOT with the coolness of mass amounts of veggies like baby corns, celery and tomatoes mixed with glass noodles and seasoned eggs rocked my freakin world tonight and has been added into the rotation. Pad Woon Senhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sUXs9ATmb423TcxgtMalzQ?select=rQ7FSaL5ggQupO_DAD7LQg#MyzsS1JQ39DVzYJQWSRxlAPenn's has only gotten better with time. Read the press or read my reviews, but I am not the only one throwing props to this place. They even take the time now to make designs out of the straws. For a small fee or a Nordstroms gift card I will gladly show you how she does it. (Mine come out like Special Olympics straw art a lil' bit, but I'm working on it.) The service and food are FIVE STARS every time for me. Tip: If you have been here ONCE and maybe not had a five star experience, please give them another shot. This place is a treasure from every angle and I personally cannot find fault. If you don't feel the same than just take your ass back to Applebees for a REAL meal. I take zero credit for discovering this treasure. I will forever be grateful to the foodie who turned me on to Penn's and also to Penn for letting me explore the incredible world of Thai cuisine through her dishes.I don't how to really write this one, but here goes. Have you ever had food that was so good that it literally made you forget about everything else? Have you ever left a restaurant smiling from ear to ear and feeling like you're floating on air because it was so damn good? I did that today at Penn's. Just when I thought it couldn't get any better I followed Jaime W's advice and tried the Pad Woon Sen. In the past I've had bad experiences with noodle dishes and it's been almost 9 years since I ate my last one that was similar to this one. The wait was worth it because this dish truly exceeded any and all expectations I had. Screw this nice writing crap, it was totally freakin awesome. Ok, these are supposed to be fair and balanced reviews and after today, any chance of being fair and balanced towards Penn's is hopelessly gone. I'm flat out in love with this place and their food. Resistance is stupid and leaves you hungry, I give in, I'm hooked, and this case is closed. 5 Stars earned, re-earned, and validated over and over again. It's at the point I take family here. I'll pay for their dinner just to get them to try it. I'll need to become a reverend so I can preach about how good this place is. While YMMV: Your mileage may vary, for me, this is truly as good as it gets. I have never had a food experience that comes close to what I've experienced here. Yeah, seriously, I really think it's worthy of the praise.I've had this place bookmarked for a while. After trying it this past week, I'm already looking forward to going back for more wonderful Thai food.We ordered pad see ew with shrimp, cashew nut with chicken, and their crispy garlic chicken, along with a Thai iced tea. They had a copy of a newspaper feature at the entrance that was done on their restaurant. They raved about their food, and I know why. The pad see ew wasn't like many noodle dishes you get from, where the noodles are either very greasy with oil, or the noodles are just stuck together with a bland sauce. The crispy garlic chicken - I try not to eat much fried food, but it was so delicious, I gobbled this chicken up! I think the only thing I didn't particularly care for was the chicken cashew nut. It was tasty, yet the sauce was watery and the serving was quite small, made with more cashew nuts than chicken. However, their menu has good selections to choose from and very decent lunch specials.This place is definitely off-the-beaten path, in a corner of a deserted strip mall close to Gibson. But if you're in Henderson close to the 95 or Sunset, I'd highly recommend coming here for Thai food. Our server was very personable and patient, even when I was very indecisive about what to order, which happens to me a lot! I'll come back for their panang curry soon...I got greedy.  I monopolized the duchess Jaime W. at Penn's Thai!  We met today for a girl's night out spicy food style, and this was quite the satisfier.  Jaime was sportin' a new 'do and of course the server and the owner greeted her like family.  Apparently her a/c in her car is shifty and Penn's husband, owner of the car joint next door, came for her keys to check out her car while we dined.  Now that's service!Jaime W. suggested trying the beef nam tok salad, pad woon sen (we got tofu), and panang curry (chicken) - though she had good word to say about everything on the menu she had already tried.  It made narrowing our options hard.  I really want to try the spicy eggplant next time!The beef salad was very delicious, thinly sliced beef and red onions on lettuce with tomatoes, carrot strands, cilantro, cucumbers, and a spicy lime dressing.  The pad woon sen included glass noodles, fried tofu triangles, baby corn, tomato, green onion, and other veggies - deliciously spicy.  Our panang had a thickness that was sooo good (too many watery curries being served these days)  and great peanut taste, and was served with plenty of steaming hot rice.I also enjoyed a Thai iced tea which was tasty.  We had just the right amount of heat in all of the dishes (an assortment of hot and medium) and also had plenty of spicy condiments already on the table if needed.  The service was great and I talked to Penn about my trip to Thailand last year, especially about Chiang Rai near her family.In the end, we had so many leftovers.  Jaime W. took the salad and I got the curry and noodles (load me on those carbs baby!) so I have my lunches covered for the next 2 days.  Best advice: try this place if you haven't.  Even better advice: dine with Jaime!  Lunch specials M-F, but the prices are right for dinner and there are many dishes to try!  I will be back, and hopefully with Jaime!I can't say I was as blown away by the food as many of the reviewers were, but the food was well above average. We got there a little bit before they were going to close, so my experience may have been lessened by the fact that i had to rush and shove the food in my face as quickly as possible. The girl working there was super nice and genuinely interested in feedback and our experience at the restaurant. I had the pad woon sen and boyfriend had pad kee mao. His dish was a lot better. Mine was good but fell a bit short in the flavor department -- it was plain and the chicken was dry and tasteless. The pad kee mao was good with just the right amount of heat. I did not care to try the curries because after making my own, I realized how idiot proof making a delicious curry really is. In flavor department Naga wins out by a high margin, but service wise Penns definitely wins. I will go back and sample more of their dishes.Many restaurants can crank out good food for customers who sit down to eat. But the equation changes dramatically when it comes to carryout food as horror stories abound. Once again Penns hit a grand slam in my book with a carryout order of Cashew Nut Chicken and Thai Iced Tea that even after making the 20 min ride home was absolutely perfect in every way. The container was foil lined and wrapped in plastic to prevent spills too. It's the little things that make the difference. Service....for a Sunday night was a little aloof. I asked about egg rolls and the lady working kind of had an attitude so I skipped ordering any. Still Penn's placement on my Best of Las Vegas list and at 5 Stars is in no danger of changing anytime soon.Cold Food = A Cardinal Sin. And Penn's committed that today around lunch time. I went in for lunch at about 12:30 and ordered Chili Mint Chicken off the lunch menu and Thai Iced Tea. The tea was good...as always. The eggdrop soup was hot and very good as it typically is. Then they bring out my main plate...and it's barely lukewarm. By the time I put some soy sauce on my rice and mix everything up it's cold. And by the time I finished the plate as I had to eat something, it was definitely cold. I said something about this to the staff and at first they were like you could have added more heat from the spices they brought to the table. That much is true, but that's not the heat I wanted. I want something that has some physical heat...the kind that comes from an open flame under an open pot or wok of what is normally some of the best Thai food in Vegas without question. My disappointment is expressed in a 2 Star drop...There's a lot of things for a place to get wrong but if you can't even properly cook the food and serve it at an appropriate temperature you've got a fundamental problem that must be addressed.First off, thanks to Yelpers in the recent Thai Talk threads for this find!  This Thai restaurant is listed among the top of several Yelpers who's opinion I trust.  Once again, I was not steered wrong!  I managed to get a few friends to eat family style at this Thai restaurant  this afternoon (is there any other way to eat Thai food?).  We ordered Thai Iced Tea, Tom Kha Khi, Pineapple Fried Rice, Panang with Beef, Lad Na with Pork, Garlic Chicken, and Papaya Salad.  All dishes ranged a 4-4.5 for me!The Thai Iced Tea was not that sweet, and very bold in herbal tea flavor.  Yum.  The Tom Kha was really, really good.  While not the best in town, it was probably the dish I enjoyed the most.   It was creamy, yet savory and lightly sour at the same time.  The complexity of the flavors played off of one another brilliantly.  The mushrooms and chicken were excellently prepared as well.  My second favorite dish was the Beef Panang (thanks, Jade!).  It had a strong, bold flavor for a Panang, with just the tiniest hint of peanut.  It was rather thick as well, and very hardy.  Mixed with the minced Garlic Chicken, it really made the lunch.  The flavor profile was one of the most complex (yet balanced) I have had for a Panang!    The Papaya Salad and Pineapple Fried Rice were pretty good, but not completely mind blowing to me.  The Papaya Salad had an excellent balance of flavor, but both dishes were a little lack luster.  The Pineapple Fried Rice was a tad bit on the soggy side, and was just a little bit boring.  No worries though, everything else rocked!The Lad Nah with Pork, while again not the best in town, was expertly prepared.  The gravy had a nice thick consistency with beautiful savory flavors.  With added chili peppers and fresh Chinese Broccoli, it was also one of my favorites of the meal.  Overall, this is probably the best Thai restaurant on this side of town.  Not all of the dishes wow'ed me enough to give it a 5 though, and I thought the portions were a little small.  However, if I am on this side of town and am in need of good Thai food, this will be my spot!Oh what a difference a year makes. One year ago I loved Penn's Thai House. The awesome Jaime W. recommended this place, and she was right in recommending them. Penn's was good, so good that I went outside of my comfort zone to try different textures and flavors that I never thought I'd try. Lunch, dinner, persuading my family to pay a bit more and give them a try, I had Penn's at 5 stars and showed my support with my feet walking in the door and spending $50 minimum on my night orders and giving 25% tips for lunch.That was then. The love I had for Penn's has been crushed. I visited about 2 months ago hoping to rekindle the love and happy Thai food experience I missed. Instead the food made my family sick and my sister in law said never again. I would pass over Sunset on the 95 and look over at the green neon at night...And wish for the old days. Then came word of Penn's making it onto the dreaded Channel 13 Dirty Dining segment. I read the story, SNHD said Penn's hired a top food safety expert to clean them up. I found myself craving good spicy Thai...and through strange circumstances I found myself with 45 minutes to spare and I'm 3 blocks away. Off I went...would I be able to find happiness again? Had the expert done his job? This is Vegas, sometimes you gotta take a chance....The building is the same, but the soulless lunch plate of chili mint chicken and boring egg roll and circa 1980 school cafeteria grade egg drop soup left no doubt in my mind that the Penn's I loved was gone. Tack on the extra $1 for using a debit card under $10 and service that was cold and aloof and when I walked out the door I said I was done. I believe in redemption and giving second chances. Penn's got that opportunity...and they blew it. When it was good, it warranted placement on my Mythical 6th Star list. Now it's just a waste of commercial space. Better alternatives are less than 15 minutes away. You would be better off to use the Yelp app and find them. 1 Star, under protest....what a shame.How has a review not been written about this place? Thai food is not one of the cuisines that I will go out of my way for. Yet when I do crave it or think about it, Penn's is one of the restaurants that sticks out in my mind the most. I tend to get the same thing every time. The crispy garlic chicken is crack. The crisp and light outer shell does not get soggy in the tangy and sweet garlic sauce. I could eat this for days. I wish that I could justify doing so. The pad thai is good. I like that it is not super sweet. The massaman curry is delicious. I try to vary my ordering habits, but it is so difficult to change from certain items. I keep wanting to save room for these famous green tea buns, but I tend to be out of luck. The two times that I have been here, they have always ran out. Maybe I should just elevate my chances of success by going more often.More like 3.5 stars rounded up based on my experience. First of of all, they are located in kind of an obscure place alongside other businesses. If you werent actually looking for this place you will have never known these guys were here. When you come in the place does not look like a typical Thai setting. You know like some kind of Buddhist doll statue or painting of some sort. I do admit though their menu is nicely organized and has pictures for your visual reference.I came for lunch so specials for this time frame is what I look for. They have a decent section on the menu for 6.95. Your choice of entree whether its pad thai, chow mein, chili mint, etc. Then you choose the type of meat whether its pork, beef, chicken, or tofu. Comes with eggdrop soup, eggroll, and steamed rice. Refer to my pic for the complete details.What I got was Mongolian Chicken. The Eggdrop Soup came in a standard small cup. It was hot and flavorful. Would of been even better if it was my soup of choice which is Hot n Sour. The Eggroll was really good. Crispy on the outside with accompanied by the semi crispiness of the veggies inside. Dipped in the sweet chili sauce it comes in only makes it taste better. As for the main course, I thought it had good flavor to it. The carrots were cooked just right where it's still a bit crispy but soft enough to chew easily. Only thing lacking I thought was the portion size.Since I had my eye on the tofu appetizer, I ended up getting that because I was not yet quite full and my love for tofu will always be there. When it came out I was very pleased with how the tofu was cut into perfect small squares and cooked to golden crispy perfection. Of course you gotta have the sweet chili sauce with crushed peanuts to dip in. You can eat it by itself but the sauce is the Ying to its Yang so dont be afraid to drown those suckers in that bad boy!Service was very good. From the moment I was greeted all the way to the moment I paid, I didnt really have to ask for anything except order the tofu.In closing, this is a solid place for that Thai food craving any time you are in the area. Just dont forget how they are situated in this weird plaza/strip area. Next time, I am getting the Garlic Chicken for sure. Oh, and paying for your meal with plastic there is a 15 dollar minimum. You can still pay with plastic still even though its under 15. They just throw in a dollar fee for the convenience of you not carrying cash.Yelp 2014 365 Review Challenge #104 "Thai Me Up!"This is a reason for people to get on Yelp or else they would never find this hidden Henderson hole in the wall restaurant located near our auto body shop.Special thanks to my Yelpers for their great reviews on Penn's...even moreso for their recommendation on the CRISPY GARLIC CHICKEN and GREEN TEA BUNS (Not on the menu and I would appreciate you keeping it a secret as well ;)Green Tea Buns...deep sigh. I never tried them but saw they were a popular Yelp item so I wanted to see for myself. I almost made the mistake of getting only 6, but quickly rectified my order to 12 when I imagined my voracious family gobbling them up like Pac Man pellets. I am so glad I did. As soon as I brought home the dozen of these cold little buns, popped them in the microwave under a damp paper towel for about 25 seconds (did 2 at a time), they were gone! These fluffy buns are so light and the green tea filling is so delicately sweet with a slight coconuty taste that melts in your mouth. I LOVE these and will be back for more.The Crispy Garlic Chicken is perfect. Crunchy, deep fried battered white meat chicken with the best crust in a sticky, sweet, salty, tangy sauce that is perfectly balanced. This is another favorite that I will come back for.Ambiance is nothing special but who cares...the food is great and service is friendly. But keep your hands off my buns!My favorite Thai place near my house! The owner makes her own sauces and even makes Green Tea Buns on occasion. All of the waitresses are really friendly and the quality of food is great whether dining in or taking to-go! My go-to's are the Pad Thai of course, Panang Curry, Pad See Ew, and Tom Kha. It's pretty funny cause anytime I go with my mom, they already know my mom is going to have the Pad Thai and that I'm going to have the Panang Curry lol It's hard to try something else when you're always craving those certain items! Their Pad Thai isn't as sweet as some places like Archi's, and also their Panang Curry is a bit thicker than other places as well.  Which I prefer for both. Everything is always super fresh and really flavorful.They have great lunch specials for $6.95 Monday-Friday from 11am-3pm:-Pad Thai-Chow Mein-Mixed Vegetables-Beef Broccoli-Chili Mint-Red Curry-Yellow Curry-Green Curry-Spicy Chili Pepper-MongolianThey all come with Egg Drop soup, Egg Roll, and steamed rice.Next time I swear I have to try their Crispy Garlic Chicken, Green Tea Buns, and Beef Salad!Sticky, sticky, oh so sticky crispy garlic chicken!I don't know exactly what goes on in this dish at Penn's but I like it. There is something in that sauce that makes you want to lick the entire foil plate clean. (Not even kidding) That sauce goes great with everythingggg and the chicken is so crispy and tender that it just makes for a delight in your mouth :OOther than the chicken, the other Thai dishes are really tasty and good quality. I've have the pad thai and fried rice from here and I can definitely taste the difference here compared to other Thai establishments in Henderson. But that chicken though!I have to admit that the first time I came to Penn's was not what I expected. It is located in... a less desirable? side of town and you wouldn't even think there would be a Thai restaurant in this plaza but behold!Parking has never been a problem here so that's another plus. Have I mentioned the chicken yet?A Thai place with "Beef Jerky" on the menu? Penn's Thai House is truly the restaurant that time forgot. Old school vinyl booths, plain walls, and a large fish tank to most likely distract you from the plain surroundings. I sat down and was greeted with water and a menu. Looking around, there are only about eight booths total with a few tables in the middle of the restaurant and manning all of these tables is one server, the co-owner maybe? She took my order and within about seven minutes I had my first item ordered, Beef Jerky. These aren't the road favorite you're thinking of, but are strips of skirt steak, marinated and flash fried. These are delicious with a slightly crispy outside and tender, but chewy inside, hence an elevated style of beef jerky, very good and great meal starter. These also come with a bizarre spicy dipping sauce that I couldn't quite my finger one. Sriracha with something else? I also ordered one of the five lunch specials. Yellow Curry plate with chicken. This comes with egg drop soup, tossed salad, white rice, and a single egg roll for under seven dollars. The curry was delicious, great flavor; color and I really enjoyed the egg drop soup. The soup had a great consistency with a unique homemade flavor. The egg roll was ok, but lacked flavor and was pretty greasy. The service here was quick and the food was great. I wanted to try their famous green tea rolls, but unfortunately they were out. I'll get you next time... next time. Can Yelp talk Thai? Yes. Quite well in fact"Yay! I'm a fan." Thanks to fellow Yelpers who highly recommended Penn's Thai House, I finally can remove this from my bookmarks list as I dined here last night. Tried to find Penn's a couple months ago and that turned into a failed search & rescue mission, so we ate elsewhere that night.Mission #2...Last night, I found it! +Convenient Parking.++Devoured the authentic foods.+++Appreciated the exceptional customer service.++++and dining solo, I really enjoyed the intimate ambience.Tucked away in a neon lit commercial strip center off Sunset, between Eastgate & Gibson, on the north side of the street.+A-Rated by So. NV Health District.++Dine-In or Take-Out.+++Six comfortable booths and two rectangular tables. ++++Capacity 36 patrons. +++++Open every night til 9pm. ++++++Cash, Visa, Mastercard.+++++++Lunch Specials $6.95, Mon-Fri, 11am-3pm.The Pad Thai w/ chicken was excellent at a spicy level 8. (see photo)Kra Pow (Basil) w/ pork at a spicy level 8 was a bit too hot for my taste buds, considering the green chili peppers; but still managed to empty the plate into my stomach. (see photo)Hot Jasmine tea was good. Served by the cup w/ teabag.They were out of their $1 green buns until Monday and sweet mango is not in season. Coconut ice cream was available, but I passed. Next time I hope to try all three of these desserts, along w/ their crispy garlic chicken, beef jerky, and chicken satay.My waitress was a very friendly and service oriented Thai lady who checked on me every 5 minutes or so. She even took the time to explain to me a bit about the wall decor I was admiring that I took several photos of. She deservedly earned a 30% tip!Walls were adorned w/ beautiful artwork of ancient Thai royalty and warriors. (see photos)I've been to several Thai restaurants throughout the Las Vegas Valley and after last night's dining experience, Penn's Thai House is now included among "My Yelp Favorites" list!YELP 250 CHALLENGE 2015: #200We really like Thai and wanted to try a place we had not been to yet.  In looking for places and reading reviews, I came across this place that had a review written by Nate M. about 3 months ago.  It was a decent review, he gave it 4 stars so it had to be a decent place.The place is tucked in the corner of this L shaped shopping center on Sunset east of the 95.  The Penn was a little hard to see but the Thai House is very prominent.They have 8 booths and a few tables which where put together as two long tables going down the center.  There was one other booth with 3 people and one table was taken with 4 people.  It seemed liked there was only one lady working the room and from time to time another lady brought out food, she looked like she was in the back cooking.I ordered the Egg Rolls to start and even though the were very crispy in the outside, the were soggy on the inside and obviously not made there, they all looked identical.  These were not really to my liking so I won't order those again.  We also ordered the green papaya salad which was very good and almost identical to a place in Oceanside we love.  We also got the mixed vegetable with chicken and the Pad Thai.  Both dishes were excellent.  The sauce on the mixed vegetable was AMAZING, it was not a heavy sauce and was very week made.  The Pad Thai was very good as well.This is a place we will go back to, everything tasted fresh, the vegetables were crispy and overall the price was very reasonable.
Grand Lux Cafe=So... where are all the slot machines, poker tables and cocktail waitresses? I swear I just walked into a hotel restaurant off of the Vegas Strip... not even keno at the table. What?? No, wait... where are the 4,000 flavors of cheesecake? This IS the Cheesecake Factory, right??? No??? Okay, Grand Lux Cafe is so confusing. I think it is going through an identity crisis because it looks like a cross between a casino hotel lobby and The Cheesecake Factory, but without any personality. For dinner on a Wednesday night, in this great of a location, I was shocked to see this place so empty. Maybe everyone was across the street at Pink Taco. Or, maybe people just do not like being served by a wait staff with a perma-fake smile on their face all night. The one thing I will say for GLC is they have a LOT of options. However, I find restaurants that provide such a variety generally have anything exceptional to offer as far as the meal is concerned. I believe this is true for this establishment, as well. The waitress recommended the Vegetarian Chopped Salad saying she thought it was the best thing on the menu. I found it to be pretty bland and uninspiring. I guess I'm spoiled by the Cowboy Ciao Chopped Salad. But I digress. I would have gotten the tofu dish they have (orange glaze with sesame seeds, I believe) but I was informed that they cook it with a fish sauce. At least the waitress knew it was a non-veggie friendly option, but why serve a tofu dish that is not veggie? My dinner date ordered the BLT with fries. I think she ate about five bites and a couple of fries. She was equally unimpressed. I snuck a fry and they certainly are nothing to write home about. Limp and soggy, just the way nobody likes em. They did have a good Riesling a good selection of coffee drinks as well as an expansive dessert menu. We did not try a dessert (they have baked items that take about 30 minutes to cook.. probably pretty good, but I'm on a diet) but my gal pal did order a Mocha Coffee which she seemed relatively pleased with. We ended up sitting around chatting for 3.5 hours and they never kicked us out or made us feel bad about not ordering anything else, so I would give them an extra half star if I could (Gabi, are we EVER going to get half stars?!?!?). Grand Lux ... I am going to sum you up into one word: Uninspiring12/29/09(Disclaimer: Originally a four-star, but had to take one down.  Details below.)Checked in for another happy hour (HH)!  This time, I thought I'd try the Tuesday daily drink special, a Mango Sling ($5), along w/ a glass of red ($6 and up).  For nutritional sustenance, I ordered the Warm Goat Cheese Salad ($3.95 HH); the Stacked Chicken Quesadilla (around $6 HH); and the Warm Rustic Apple Pie (around $7 or $8).I really liked the Mango Sling!  Cool and refreshing, not too sweet and just the right tartness!  Don't quote me on the ingredients used, but I seem to recall mango puree and rum were involved.  Be careful, as the alcohol content is potent!  But then again, I was having wine AND a cocktail!  :)The goat cheese salad was divine!  A definite go-to item, but I'm a sucker for goat cheese, and if you aren't, you are SO missing out!  Just sayin'.  [Before I proceed, I'd like to posit, why is anything deep-fried just so so yummy, yet so so bad for you?  Why must the universe/powers-that-be be so perverted like that??]   (Ahem...)  6 pcs. of slightly sweet and not too salty, yet crispy goat cheese on a bed of perfectly-dressed greens and a few roasted red pepper slices for garnish made for quite an appetizer!  If I ever am at a quandary as to what to have the next time I visit Grand Lux for happy hour, I know I can always order one or three of these starters, along w/ wine or a daily cocktail special, and I'll be happy!  (I don't think I can order just one, bec., well, for 1) it's just so delicious not to have more!, and 2) the few sips of wine AND the Mango sling were really powerful!)  I loved the presentation of the initial Stacked chicken quesadilla, but, unfortunately, I had to return the dish; Unbeknownst to me, it contained an allergen that was not included in the veggie description on the menu (why this is so, since everything else was on the description, I'll never know.  The manager said there were so many ingredients in that dish, so they can't list everything.  I just wonder why list all but ONE veggie, and an ever-increasing in popularity allergen at that??)  But no worries, he was glad to re-do the order and bring me a new one.  A few minutes later, I was handed a sparse-looking plate, sans the lavishness of the initial dish.  Where were the veggies?  I only had a complaint w/ the one!  And the ooey-gooey cheese?  Oh, well.  I'll survive :)  Especially after what came next... the warm rustic apple pie!  I politely asked if I could have the whiskey creme anglaise sauce substituted for the vanilla ice cream since the brand GL uses is made w/ corn syrup.  Management obliged, but not too happily.  [He gave me the eye-roll.  I think I'll take a star down just for that (as well as the allergen not being noted down on the menu).  I wasn't born yesterday, and I know that many have cursed me in the past BOH, but why let a paying customer see that unprofessionalism?  But overall, management complied, and I'm grateful for the good food had that day.]  The apple pie was hot, spiced just right, and not too sweet!  The creme anglaise really balanced out the dish.  Perfect!I'd go back, and I hope that management here, as well as in other venues, will consider adding all veggies used in their menu items, especially those known to be allergens, just so that customers may request these be omitted.  In the end, it'll save the restaurant money AND will make the staff shine even more brightly in their clientele's minds for such great service, for after all, what is The Cheesecake Factory, and its affiliates, known for but their excellent customer service, right?Welcome,ome,ome,ome to,to,to the,he,he Grand,and,and,and Lux,ux,ux,ux:)The Grand Lux Cafe does not occupy a small, cozy space...the echoes, the click, click, click of shoes on concrete, the reflected din of conversations, even quiet discussions reverberate throughout the place:)The hard edged, high arched ceilings don't help...they seem to actually redirect and amplify the noise.Grand Lux has concert hall acoustics in one sense...the back rows can hear every syllable of the play, even the whispers...but the quality of the sound you hear is marred by the fact that there are generally 137 individual plays being staged at any one time...the result is cacophony (one of my favorite words, BTW, the word sounds exactly like what it is:)How's the food and service you ask?Sorry, I couldn't hear you clearly, even though you are right across the table:)Well, the food isn't half bad:)In fact, it's pretty decent...the meals I've had have been tasty, well prepared and well presented and the service...the service is everything you would expect at the Cheesecake Factory (oh, come on, you already knew that GLC was the slightly awkward stepchild of TCF...didn't you?:)GLC is to TCF as the Pink Taco was to Morton's:)...a little Stanford/Binet reference:)The menu is almost pure TCF, just pared down to a manageable size (from the novel that you're normally presented with at TCF) and reconfigured (with a few additional "GLC signature items":)Surprisingly, some of those items are worth your consideration!Sure, you can get their burger or chicken sandwich or omelet or  chopped cobb salad...the same one that you can get pretty much anywhere (and maybe a better version in a number of places)...but you can't get their braised short rib sloppy joe's or three cheese and short rib grilled cheese sandwiches just anyplace:)Those two bad boys alone are almost worth the ringing in my ears that usually persists for 48 hours after a visit to GLC at lunchtime:)On the plus side, GLC is nearby and safe (in the sense the a Mickey D's is safe) for the inevitable business lunches...I can say "meet me at GLC" and everybody knows what to expect, just like they do with TCF, Houstons, and the rest:)And they can have their favorites...the things they always order...the chicken sandwich...the chopped cobb salad...the burger...oh well:)As for me, I just try to meet people after the lunch rush so I can hear what they are saying and enjoy my grilled cheese with braised short ribs:)The last time I tried to have a meeting here during the noon hour, I almost agreed to become a marketing rep for the National Association of Fur Lined Toilet Seat Cover Manufacturers...I thought we were talking about something much different:)
Buca di Beppo Italian Restaurant=Took the family here to celebrate my Son's Birthday.  He likes Buca because of the large portions of food.  Even though it's a chain, I don't mind coming here....as long as the family is happy, I'm happy.We ordered:Gnocchi w/tons of Gorgonzola Cheesehttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jO3ikdNbF_TGGv87izTkEg?select=3qVOP1NznI8rb9uw84uXBgFour Cheese Pizzahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jO3ikdNbF_TGGv87izTkEg?select=7KaVTCG5abfIpQWIuWsK2QGnocchihttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jO3ikdNbF_TGGv87izTkEg?select=PrqdCTcI_HIpPzo3S7JxGwRigatoni w/Spicy Chickenhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jO3ikdNbF_TGGv87izTkEg?select=5jiuqfiAmQqm6ISEG67_OwThe food was good and the service was OK.  We didn't have any issues all evening.  Of course kiddo got a nice Dessert and serenade for his Birthday....http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jO3ikdNbF_TGGv87izTkEg?select=tepqp9VLKDixAnmyVhpNyQOverall, it was a fun time had by all.Return Factor - 60%So it's a restaurant chain. That doesn't matter to me I'm a fan. I admit that I don't ever eat at Buca unless I have a coupon, but come on they send them in the mail all of the time! I'm also signed up on the e-mail list so they send offers that way too. I received a $20 off with purchase of 2 entrees and wanted to take advantage of it since I hadn't had Buca in a while, and it was better then the $10 off they generally send.  We arrived just after 5 pm. The parking lot was pretty empty and when we got inside we were able to have our pick of where to sit since they weren't busy. We must have just beat the dinner rush coming in because the restaurant soon filled up. Our server brought some complimentary bread that I had to force myself to put down to save room for my meal that was coming. I could have eaten the bread all to myself! Since Buca serves family style meals the portions are big. They have small and large sizes, but don't let the small size trick you into thinking it isn't much because it is plentiful. I ordered the "Penne Arrabbiata" priced at $19.99 for the small. It had spicy Italian sausage on top of the pasta as well in the sauce. I wasn't crazy about this dish simply because it had too much sausage flavor. I like sausage, but don't like it overpowering certain dishes. The sausage that was on the pasta also was a bit dry. The other dish I ordered was the "Baked Lasagna" priced at $19.99 for the small. This is so good! The meat sauce it tasty and the cheesy goodness it what makes it! There is ricotta, mozzarella, provolone and parmesan cheese in this lasagna. Very comforting and delicious! You can phone your order for pick-up if you don't feel like eating inside. Buca has several options as far as catering goes. You can pick up "Party Pans" (they have a menu for this) if you are having a gathering at your house and don't want the fuss of cooking. They offer different sizes and menu options broken down to how many people you are entertaining. They also offer a catering service where you can have Buca deliver the food along with tablecloths, plates, utensils, etc. so this is probably a great choice for a corporate party. They also have banquet rooms (some themed) and offer group menu options. When the server told me about the themed rooms I wondered what they could be like since there are pictures of naked people hanging on the regular dining walls. I crack up every time wondering how they get away with that since Buca is supposed to be a place to bring the familia, but it is just part of the character and I guess it works!We have stayed away from Buca di Beppo because of their reputation for huge portions.  We would be in the area for an appointment and decided to go here after for an early dinner.  As form the portions, we're at the age where early dinners and take home boxes rule!  :)I had checked the menu online and knew pretty much what we wanted before going there.  Our server, Casey, was a gem!  She asked us if we had been there before and answered questions and gave advice as we asked.We ended up ordering a small portion of their summer tricolore salad.  It was a good starter of sliced tomatoes, mozzarella, and avocado rings topped with fresh basil and olive oil.  A very summery kind of salad.For our main course, we chose the spicy chicken rigatoni described on the menu as chicken breast, garlic, crushed red pepper and peas in a spicy rosa sauce.  This came with a recommendation from a friend and it was a good suggestion.  (Thanks Shawn H.)  The bowl of rigatoni was huge.  Note that the menu states that a small order is meant for 2 or more and a large order is meant for 4 or more.  We had generous servings at the restaurant, not overdoing it though, and we brought home a container for an additional meal.  The take home packaging even had a reheating instruction sticker on it.  Since we didn't overdo the main course, we had room for dessert.  They have a couple of desserts that have single serving versions (well actually they're also for 2 people in reality).  We got their single serving version of the colossal brownie sundae.  It came with two brownie pieces, two scoops of ice cream and some whipped cream.  A very nice dessert for two people to share.I was very pleased with this first visit to a Buca.  Considering the amount of food, the price is reasonable.  Service was outstanding.  Thanks, Casey!  We'll be back to try some other things.  And, by bringing home a box, it saves me from having to cook a meal on a future day.  Score!
Legume=People, the reviews don't lie, this place isn't good...it's AMAZING!!From start to finish I had a perfect experience here.  The ambiance is so romantical and intimate.  I felt like I was on a dreamy date, with two other good girlfriends (although, side note, it would be a a great date night spot for your lova!).  First off my drink was awesome!  For only having a bar for 2 or so months in the new location, they've got it goin' on!  I had the Papa Dobé, which had Mt Gay Eclipse Rum, Maraschino Liqueur, grapefruit and lime.  I love grapefruit juice, but only the bitter tasting kind....not the sugary sweet kind.  This had the right amount of grapefruit, not too sweet, with a hint of lime...I was in love!  I started off with a beet salad.  I am FOREVER criticizing restaurants for skimping on the beets.  I buy them, I know they're not an expensive veggie, spare me some large slices....or even, gasp, the whole beet!  What I got MAY have been one or maybe two beets.  It was the perfect size beet salad, with delicious creamy goat cheese, candied walnuts and a hint of oil.  Perfecto!For the main course I had the Lobster Ravioli.  It was a hard decision with all the amazing looking choices, but a soon as I dug in, I knew it was the right decision!  It was incredible!  Tons of lobster stuffed into 4 large ravioli in a wonderfully light reduction sauce.  That bowl may look small, but it really fills you up!  I love me some super sized American food...but this was thee perfect amount!  My dates and I decided to just go all the way and get dessert as well, since again, they all looked so good.  I ordered the Gingerbread with pears and whipped cream.  It was warm, cinnamon-y and delish!  With warm pears and a fluffy dollop of whipped cream to top it off.  Great end to a fantastic meal!The service was also excellent from start to finish.  The server was incredibly knowledgeable about the food choices and described very item perfectly (and convincingly since I wanted every item!).  This place will definitely be put on my fav "fine dining" restaurants in the Burgh.  It's a little pricey, but worth every dollar!Actually about 2.5 stars.Why?Greeters were confused and confused the few groups (3 couples) that were all entering at the same time.Wine list has nice variety, finally decided to just order a bottle.After over 10 minutes, waiter comes back and said they were out of that bottle.  No other recommendations.Decided to go with wine by the glass because some nice selections and could have different wine with app. and meal. Ordered wine. Ordered dinner.She: "Why has it taken over 15 minutes to get our wine?"Apps. are delivered to table.  Then wine shows up.Apps. are good.Salads are delivered to the table.  More wine ordered.Salads are good. She: "Why has it taken over 15 minutes to get our wine?"Entrees are delivered.  Wine finally appears. She: "Very good meal."Me: "Eh, OK meal."She:  "Let's go to Coffee Tree for desert and coffee."Conclusion:  Food is good, service sub-par, not really worth the price! OMG!I know it might be super lame to write another 5 star update... BUT in my defense it's been 2 years since I wrote my last review here and they're now serving lunch!!You heard it here first (maybe not first), their lunch is a matching 5 stars to their dinner. And Butterjoint. And pretty much anything they do! But the thing that impressed me, maybe most, is when a place is packed during lunch! AND, it's not as if they're in a really busy area of Oakland. People WANT to come here. They know what's up! Let's face it, lunch can be the most boring meal of the day, I'd eat eggs and toast and a meatloaf for dinner and love them all. But lunch, yuck. I hate it. I don't hate it when I have lunch here! The tomato soup? So delicious! My yellowtail tuna melt. Incredible! I think the bread underneath may have been brioche and it was incredible. I also liked that it was open faced so I could eat it with a fork. Scrumptious! And you get a side of potato salad! All for $15. That's a steal!I could come here everyday for lunch. Then my afternoons would never be boring!I think my husband summed it up when he said, "It feels like the chef won a restaurant on a reality tv show and just didn't know what to do with it."  We went here for a special occasion but nothing, nothing made us want to stay.  * Service - awkward, inattentive, slow* Food - tasteless salads, excellent entrees, dessert missed the mark* Atmosphere - loud off putting music, empty strange decor, beat up bathroomsI had higher hopes based on yelp reviews.  We had a 9:15 reservation and were not seated until 9:30, even though we could see empty tables.  Others who were waiting just decided to leave.Our waitress should be fired.  She described the food in the most unappealing way possible: "We don't have a lamb chop, instead we are substituting a lamb leg, it is cut in half at the bone, it has lots of sinew, tendons, connective tissue, so it is pretty chewy and tough, and it looks worse than a chop but it is still really good tasting."  And, "Monkfish is really good like lobster, but it is a super gross looking, ugly fish."  Way to turn our stomachs.Many different people waited on us.  The person clearing our salads put our dirty knives straight on the table.  At this price restaurant they should bring new silverware with each course, and if not, then at least don't put it straight on the wood top table.  They also cleared things too early, placed things awkwardly, didn't ask if we wanted drink refills.  Did anybody train this staff?Menu: I understand seasonal cooking doesn't leave many options in January.  But I also think there is a real lack of invention here.  75% of all the dishes had escarole and fingerling potatoes.  It all just sounded the same.  Get more creative with what you have at this time of year.  Mussel salad was utterly flavorless.  I don't know how you can make a salad that has mussels, fennel, and caper berries that has no flavor.  It sounds impossible, but true.The monkfish was delicious.  Well seasoned, big piece, tender, lovely tomato accompaniment.  Spanish mackerel was good.  Small.  Could have used a bit more sauce or flavoring.Warm gingerbread came with ice cold quinces on top and was so slathered in whipped cream it looked like a three year old plated it.  The gingerbread was fine but the fruit should have been warm and saucy.  The whipped cream tasted like cool whip and was about 8 times too much.At an odd moment, the music started blaring, the Smiths, which I love, and strange dance party music.  Just too off for this type of restaurant.  We had a strange oil lamp on our table that had a tiny blue flame.  There was a big empty wall behind us with a picture hook and no picture on it.  The bathroom has a strange shelf right when you walk in with q-tips and OB tampons in a tray.  Just so odd.****UPDATE: The owner of the restaurant contacted me via yelp and addressed the above concerns point by point.  She did so very respectfully and with tact, which I appreciate.  They are sending me a gift certificate and the next time I am in Pittsburgh I will give this place another try and can hopefully leave a more positive review.  I am very impressed with how they handled this and am updating my 2 stars to 3 stars for the time being.We had a great dinner at Legume last evening. This was a very pleasant evening in North Oakland with just a hint of rain in the air with the pre-summer weather being some the best in recent years. One thing for everyone to be cognizant about is, Legume does has Valet parking across the street which is vital in this part of Oakland.The hostess greeted us with a great smile and we were seated immediately at our reservation time and given a four top for a party of two because all the others were occupied. Some restaurants will not do this and make you wait. Legume was very generous and hospitable in this aspect. The menu here changes frequently, actually daily, so you can come and enjoy the revelations when you arrive or visit the menu online which they post each day after 5 P.M.For our meal we started with a sharing plate of Goot Essa Blue Cheese with Oat Biscuits, Honey, Candied Walnuts and Apples. This was an excellent Blue and the Oat Biscuits were delicious and unique. We finished every morsel and were happy to be left want for more, since we had two more courses to come.The service at this point was very good: water glasses filled; drinks promptly arrived; silverware efficiently exchanged. Speaking of drinks, we had the house cocktail 'full stop' which was expertly made at the Butterjoint, which is Legumes connected lounge. You will love this drink if you as we like Boyd & Blair vodka; green Chartreuse; St. Germaine; and lemon.Next course we had a house salad Mixed Greens with Bistro Vinaigrette, Radish and Croutons which was just so light and delicious. The radish was sliced so thin as to be light as the greens and the croutons were also so thin, light and crunchy and matched perfectly.  Also we enjoyed today's soup which was Chilled Asparagus Soup with Buttermilk Panna Cotta, Preserved Lemon and Dill. This soup was remarkable, unique, outstanding and delicious enough to rave about it. Service, again remains outstanding at this point with team service, refilling water, clearing and replacing utensils and always unobtrusive but very attentive.Training here is obviously a key part of the business.  For my companion we asked for a wine recommendation to match her next course. Our server was extremely informed and trained on the wine list and recommend two that would match. One of her recommendations I had also considered as appropriate so we chose that one. There are somewhere around eighteen wines by the glass all well chosen to have a high likelihood of matching anything you may be having for dinner. The list is quite international with sparkling, whites and reds from around the world.  So what did we choose, well the Villa Pillo, Sangiovese/Cabernet Sauvignon/Merlot from Tuscany which was perfectly delicious.For our entre course I chose the Salmon and Linda decided to have an appetizer size and whet with the Chicken Livers. I will explain each preparation a little more so it may make your mouth water like it did ours. Linda's was Chicken Livers with Polenta Croutons, Bacon, Pickled Cherries and Spring Onion   Linda just kept saying,, oh this is good; oh this is delicious; oh this is wonderful between complementing this dish with a sip of the great Tuscan wine to go with it. Tender, altogether delicious, unique, and great culinary talent from the kitchen best describes this dish in the fewest words.Mine was the Wild King Salmon with Crispy Potatoes, Asparagus, Nettle Salsa Verde and Spruce Tip Hollandaise. With salmon, I can only eat it 'wild and king'. King is called king for good reason. The salmon was cooked a nice medium rare that maintained its soft unctuous wild salmon flavor with skin so crispy that it crunched and melted in our mouth. All the ingredients on the plate were a great complement to the salmon and to each other. This dish was very well matched and beautifully plated. The asparagus was favorable and tender. The hollandaise was light and a perfect example of how it should be made. This sauce performed its role well by being just perfect on its own, deliciously complementing the other components without taking over, and being very memorable. The crispy potatoes were small pieces that were light with a nice crisp on the outside with a tender wonderful potato flavor on the inside.  That was pretty much one outstanding meal, prepared and plated perfectly with numerous excellent service interactions and darn, no room for dessert.
Rikki Tiki Sushi=I hate to admit it, but I'm guilty of being a bit of a sushi fan. I was planning to wait until I got back home to New York but my cousin recommended this restaurant to us. I've been spoiled since I went to Narita, Japan for the summer. For those of you who are as obsessed with finding some good fancy none AYCE sushi places with class, this is the place to bring someone if you got the pockets. What you get here is 5 star atmosphere with a  2.5 star food and 3.5 stars for service. Amazing is just a word, and it really can't describe the design of the restaurant. Teru Sushi is located within LVH along with 888 Noodle Bar and a Hibachi restaurant. They have a myojin torii (japanese spiritual architecture) along with a waterfall and pond display as the center piece of the restaurants. What we ordered and the price!Salad: $4 Miso Soup: $4Sushi/Sashimi Plate $24Lobster Roll: $19Shrimp Crunchy Roll: $12Las Vegas Roll: $12The salad is crisp green, carrots, tomatoes in ginger dressing with A LOT of salt! The salad seem to have been washed with salt water. I love my food to be salty but this was a overstatement for the salad. Will avoid this when coming here. The miso soup was nothing special and was pretty standard. The Sushi/Sashimi plate differ depending on the chief. According to the menu "chef selection of fresh sushi and sashimi served with rice." Since I worked in the restaurant business this means fish that are about to go bad or is bad and that need to be served ASAP. The sushi/sashimi plate was not the freshest sushi but it was not bad. The Lobster Roll was very decent but had very little lobster and a lot of crabmeat. Probably not worth the money to order this roll again. The  Las Vegas roll was spicy because of the large amount spicy mayo and sriracha that was on the sushi. Once you get some of the sauce off it is a decent roll to try. The roll that I will order again will be Shrimp Crunchy Roll. It also something for the none raw fish lovers. I will recommend the Shrimp Crunchy Roll and the Las Vegas Roll. Local (Nevada Residents get a discount) get a discount.
Mel's Diner=I swear this place is a cover for some type of organized crime (Russian, maybe?) but hot damn if they don't have the best home fries in all of our fair land (that includes Matt's Big Breakfast... I know, right?) They always cook everything to perfection and it tastes really fresh. It's also the location of the original Mel's Diner TV show (EDIT: Korina and Pierre have brought some conflicting facts about this statement to my attention. So when I say "Really!" in the next sentence, I actually mean "Not Really!"). Really!Okay, here's what blows:-Disgusting carpet.-Awful bathrooms-Let's just say the waitresses (all are remarkably sexy in a scrappy exotic gangster kind of way... I guess you really have to see for yourself) are less than happy to be serving you. That goes for the "busboy" who, with the way he barks at the servers and talks shit about customers, is probably the owner. Actually, this guy kind of rules. So, back to the bitchy server girls. They never wear any clothing that could possibly be misconstrued as appropriate. Always teeny tiny jeans and shirts to match. So strange.-The decor is ridiculous. It's overly patriotic.-The clientele is a mixed bag of cops (cool), tweakers (uncool... but they get booted pretty fast), grizzled old men (intimidating, but cool), and aging republicans, complete with anti-everythingelsebutamerica sentiments emblazoned across greasy shirts (SO obviously not something I like). All in all, this place is about food and people watching. And, if you like those games where you make up stories about random passersby, you will have a field day with these people.I stopped in Phoenix to have lunch with a friend and he brought me here to Mel's.He told me Mel's Diner was used for the exterior shots of the '76 to '85 TV sitcom, Alice.APPEARANCE:  Mel's has seen better days.   The food was still good, but.... let's just say the place is looking and feeling a bit tired.   I went to wash my hands and the restrooms were... basic restrooms, older like the restaurant.   The soap dispenser was empty so I stepped in the woman's to get some soap.   Also when I sat down back at the booth I bottomed out on the springs and the boards supporting them underneath.  2 stars.SERVICE: It felt like a small local "diner" where they are very friendly and everyone knows everyone.   They're always smiling and happy to take care of most any request.  4 stars.FOOD:  I ordered the pork loin sandwich and my friend had the BBQ pulled pork sandwich.   Both my friend and our server told me the sandwich I ordered was really big and boy they weren't kidding!    Check out my photos, it could have used 2 buns!   After having a cup of chicken soup, fries and that sandwich, I'd have to say the food is pretty good, yes diner food, but still pretty good none-the-less.   On the plus side, the prices are EXTREMELY reasonable!   3.5 stars.OVERALL:  The food is good, the service is very good and the prices are LOW.   But the building and decor is old and out dated.  I suppose that's how they keep the prices down............  I bet if anyone tells the owner they should remodel, they'll just say "Kiss My Grits!"   ;-)
MedFresh Grill=I am a hummus fiend. I have made tabbouleh so delicious that the heavens parted and rained down tears of joy upon its consumption. I will cut a bitch over the last dollop of garlic dip. Don't even get me started on baba ghanoush.So it's almost a guarantee that I will like anything that draws upon a Mediterranean flavor palate. Med Fresh is no exception.It's technically Turkish, but I don't split hairs when it comes to Mediterranean. The pitas are fresh and flavorful, the tzatziki is kickin' and the gyro meat (beef and chicken) are always moist and delicious. Everything is prepared as you order it and you have a clear view of the goings-on in the sunken kitchen. The staff can be a bit terse at times but they're always professional and quick to disperse a busy lunch rush. The platters are priced well for the mound of food you receive, and while I have had some tonsil-scraping dry chicken on occasion, the majority of the time the kabobs and koftas are moist and tender. If you simply can't be pressed to make up your mind, go with the mixed grill and get a bit of a variety. The pita sammich special (#16) is the best bang for your buck on the menu. Pita, meat, tomato, lettuce, weird pickles and secret sauce. Served with tzatziki and their killer spicy red sauce. Salad or fries on the side. $6.95. Oh yeah.
Charcoal Room=The Charcoal Room at Santa Fe Station: Cutting to the Chase  The pretzel bread sticks are fabulous, arriving at the table piping hot, soft and salty.  I ate the two that were in the bread basket.    None for my boyfriend.  There was other bread in the basket, though.  The Caesar salad is good, with small pieces of crusty bread as the crouton-like accompaniments.  A generous helping, I didn't finish it because I wanted to leave room for the main course.  The half roasted chicken is tasty.  I ate the breast and took the leg/thigh home.  That sounds a little strange.  The baked sweet potato is huge!  Regular butter and cinnamon butter are provided; put them on the spud, watch them melt, and consume. I ate half there and took the other half home, too.  This is a great place for date night, which we had the night we went.  The service is attentive. The manager came by our table and checked on us.  Sunday night was so steady for them that there were no booths available, so we were seated at a round table that sat four.  I always prefer booths unless with a large group of friends. Not that we are the type of couple to sit side by side in a booth when it's just us, because that's weird, but I didn't feel like waiting. Reservations are suggested just in case, which we had.   Caesar salad+ lobster corn chowder + half chicken + petit filet mignon + sweet potato + asparagus + sauteed mushrooms = $85.00  We were very full when we left with our doggie bag.  The end.Finally!! I've had the Charcoal Room on my list of eats since I moved out here a few years ago.  My neighbor, some co-workers, and even friends/family from California even recommended the Charcoal Room to me. But when it came to other Yelpers, most haven't been here or reviewed them.  The Charcoal Room has a lot of pros and very little cons.  You don't get what you pay for here, you get more.  And if you're having steak, you get a lot more.  I got their petite filet and it was delicious.  Their petite is about 6 oz, juicy, and most importantly, very tasty. Don't let the price fool you.  For less than $30, I had a steak that rivals some of the 5 star steak houses out here.  My filet was so tender that I think I used a butter knife to cut through it.  I had my steak with a side of their Caesar salad, lobster corn chowder, sautéed mushrooms, and asparagus.  All portions were huge and I ended up with leftovers. My GF opted for their roasted chicken and baked sweet potato.  Her meal was hooked up too.  I swear she was served half a chicken and a football sized sweet potato.  She said her meal was good as well.  I have no complaints about the service.  We were seated right away, our orders were taken, and our food was served in a timely manner.  I left the Charcoal Room very satisfied and my only regret is not coming here sooner.  We got a lot of food and paid less than $100 for it.  Yes...I'm sure I will be back.PS: No pictures of their steak and no pictures of their fabulous forks.  I was focused the night I ate here....focused on my beautiful date.  1OAK!I'm a bigger fan of the location at Palace Station- this one has similar dishes, but they're not as well executed. Came here with a large group for a birthday reservation, and service was very polite but spotty- timing of dishes was off and a couple of orders were mixed up.I opted for the seared ahi app and the heirloom tomato and mozzarella salad. The ahi was a generous portion for $10, perfectly seared, and I enjoyed the tamari soy sauce but did not care at all for the wasabi cream. The salad was a disappointing mess of underripe tomatoes and flavorless "mozzarella"- it didn't even seem to be that cheese, the texture was crumbly and it was dry and flavorless rather than soft and mild. This location does not have a private room, but they were able to place us toward the back for some privacy. We were informed from the start that they were unable to do separate checks, which was a bit frustrating and led to several of our party using the $4/fee ATM outside. However, we were given a $40 discount card after being seated, which offset that inconvenience.
Lucille's Smokehouse Bar-B-Que=I love BBQ, and am new to the scene in regards to dining out at different locations trying to figure out who's BBQ makes me the happiest. Lucilles definitely has it going on. Its a large restaurant and its well decorated. PLENTY of seating for all different sized parties.   Blues music playing in the background.  Remarkably, Patrick (my Sunday date guy) and I had no wait whatsoever.  Usually, when I see this place, theres always people waiting outside.  Not this time!they served us a basket of biskets.  um, but only 2 biskets were in there.  um, WHY?  WHY ONLY 2 AT A TIME?  That was annoying.   We didnt like that!!  Why couldnt they have given us at least 4?  They also served us our drinks in Mason jars.  I think thats a southern thing?  I liked it!  Eventually our food came out and I got the brisket sandwich with garlic potatoes and Patrick got the shreded chicken sandwich with Macaroni and cheese as a side.  We passed on desert.Anyways, I would come back here.  It was a decent time had by all.Mind-boggling rhetorical question of the day: Who on earth chooses to have their bachlorette party dinner at Lucille's? My down home girlie girl, who, bless her sweet heart and wonderbread palate, absolutely adores this joint. To start, the service was absolutely atrocious. Party of eight on a Friday night. Annoying? I can see how it could be. More annoying? Losing the reservation and shoving us into a corner designed to seat five, maybe six max. A bunch of elbow bumping, scantily clad chicks all dolled, sipping fruity ass hurricanes and the like. Probably pretty humorous to observe. Not so humorous to navigate.Put on your woo-girl face though because this is a par-tay! Woo!Bring out the mildly scandalous goodie bags filled with penis lollipops, dirty fortune cookies and flavored lube (i.e. the tame stuff). Just scandalous enough send your Great Aunt Esther into a conniption fit. Seriously, if this was the genuine highlight of this meal, it really does not speak highly of the hot garbage being slopped on a plate at Lucille's. Woo!And we wait, and wait, and wait. Bread, finally! Woo!Wait, are you sure you didn't confuse biscuits with hard tack? Because not even the scrumptious honey butter you've got is worth the dental bills incurred from teething this rock. Again we wait, and wait, and wait. Pulled pork! Woo!Hold up. How does a pulled pork sandwich manage to be incredibly greasy and dry as a bone at the same time? Have I slipped into some alternative dimension? Is it opposite day? Because if so, this shit is finger-lickin' good. You best slop on that BBQ sauce to add some semblance of flavor to the sandwich and hope it doesn't soak through the bun in 2.5 seconds flat. Worst pulled pork sandwich I have ever eaten. Hands down. The garlicky mashed potatoes as a side were the only saving grace of the meal.I seriously have no idea how this place stays in business. If it were not for the over abundance of low swingin' crotch fruit I brought to the party, dinner here would have tanked, hard and fast. It was awkward, drawn out (3 hours!) and ridiculously expensive. The best part about the experience was walking out the door. Woo!SO disappointed.My husband and I went last night with our infant daughter (asleep in her carrier) and here is a rundown of how it went:We were promptly greeted and asked by the hostess if we needed a carrier sling.  I declined and said I'd just tuck her carrier under the table by my leg.  The hostess then had a sub-hostess (?) come over and take us to our table.  She also asked if we needed a sling.  Again, I declined.  Minor annoyance.  What wasn't minor what that she took us over and seated us with 80% of the other patrons in the mostly empty place!!  We were almost all grouped into the same corner of the restaurant.  Nobody wants to go out to dinner and listen to all the conversations of everyone around them when there is room all over the restaurant.  Spread out your diners; give people some elbow room and privacy!So then our waitress comes up and takes our drink order and that's when I saw that they are asking almost $5 for a mason jar full of strawberry lemonade.  I almost laughed out loud.  Seriously, who the hell thinks that $5 is a fair price for a mason jar of strawberry lemonade? *raises eyebrow*  Uh huh, that's what I thought too.  Absurd!So I ordered the 'bargain' $4 plain old lemonade.  (I'm definitely not a cheap ass, but I'm also not an idiot.)The lemonade price actually made me think of the $5 milkshake scene from Pulp Fiction.  And if you don't know what the hell I'm talking about then stop reading this review right NOW and go rent get Pulp Fiction on streaming Netflix.    I'll wait for you to come back...*drumming fingers*Okay, done watching the movie?  That scene was good, right?  Okay, back to the review...Anyway, the drinks were prompt and I'll just say it, "That's a pretty fucking good lemonade. I don't know if it's worth five dollars but it's pretty fucking good."So the waitress then asks if if we'd like an appetizer so we order a $4 'half order' (the full order was $7) of fried green tomatoes which, by the way, is also an OUTSTANDING movie.   What???  You've never seen that either??  *gasp*Go on, I'll wait.  Again.*taps foot*Back?  Outstanding film!!  Amiright?Back to the review.  Again.  The half order of fried green tomatoes was a complete fucking joke.  There were TWO (yes, I said 2) fried green tomatoes.  Not only was I flabbergasted at the utter lack of value for the $4 I just paid for that tiny plate with 2 pitiful tomato slices but they were impossibly hot, mushy, and utterly tasteless.  Even the shitty red pepper sauce they were swimming in was completely bland.  Unbelievable.  Should I even bother adding that it was delivered to our table by a different server who walked by us with two plates, looked confused, turned around muttered something under her breath that sounded like "they ordered the wrong tomatoes", put it down and walked away with the other plate; still looking utterly lost.So when we ordered the 'World's Biggest Rip Off Of for an Appetizer', we also placed or dinner orders.  I asked for the BBQ Shrimp dinner ($20) and I substituted mashed potatoes for the cheesy grits (sounds yuck) and I decided to stick with the greens that it comes with originally.  My husband ordered the beef ribs and corn on the cob, I have no idea what that cost, but our final bill was almost $60, you sort that shit out because 'I can't math' very good.Our food came right away which was good.  What was VERY bad was that my plate was utterly covered in some parsley and dry rub garnish that had been liberally sprinkled around (and over) the whole plate by someone I'm assuming must've had a grand mal seizure right as they were holding a handful of this stuff.  My food and plate was COVERED in this crap.  I scraped it off as best I could and easily came up with 1/4 of a cup of this sprinkled garbage all over everything.  It was awful.Adding to that the greens were horrendous.  Bitter, cold and tasteless. The shrimp were drowning in this ghastly BBQ sauce that was an unappetizing blend of too spicy and not quite BBQ'y sauce.  I can't put my finger on it, but I didn't care for it one bit.  So I sat there and choked down my $20 worth of shrimp and picked at my mashed red potatoes, which were the only thing decent on my plate.  I even complained to my waitress that my plate was covered in this nasty crap and had ruined my food all she could do was look at me and say "Oh, I'm sorry."Really that's it?  No offer to get the manager, or replace my food, anything?Worthless.In comparison the husband's food looked pretty good, as I looked on mournfully at his plate and looked back in disgust at mine.I wanted to like this place, I really, really did.  The decor is fabulous and the place is uber cute, but the bizarre seating patterns, the ridiculous pricing for things like lemonade and 2 inedible FUCKING tomatoes, and the overzealous garnishments of inedible, chopped parsley and dry rub were too just much.Came here for the first time to meet some friends for lunch.It is located in Tempe Market place but, has its own parking lot,which makes going here much easier than a lot of other places here.We sat on the back patio which was so nice. It is a nicely decorated place, Very Southern. It reminds me of a place in Florida or in the South.Well ,it was a lovely day outside,not too hot or cool so it was great for sitting outside.We got fried green tomatoes for appetizer, which was really good and the first time I had ever had them.I had the BBQ chicken Salad, Sue got the breaded and fried cat fish with shrimp ,it also came with Sweet potatoes fries. She said it was fantastic, my other friend Alan got the fried Chicken and he is from Mississippi and it was very true to how they do it there.Bathrooms are nice and clean.Nice Hot water to wash off all the sticky BBQ.Staff is a little frazzled at times, there seems to be a bit of disorganization going on.2 of us received our food and Sue waited quite a while to get hers as well.She did have the Strawberry Lemonade which she thought was Heaven.This is a pretty good place and very busy. We came in on a week night, I was surprised how really busy it was.  We sat on the Porch, which is just an addition made to look like an old Southern style home.  It is nice. Nice old 50's style furniture. I like it!I had some Watermelon flavored Ice Tea.  It was truly good. Even had a slice of watermelon with it.  We had green fried tomatoes as an appetizer. So so on that not too good.  Dinner was quite good though. BBQ chicken, some ribs and briskestWe had enough to bring home for yet another dinnerOur server was very good, her name was Allison. She went into a lot of detail about the menu items. I did appreciate that certainly.Dinner was good and the side BBQ sauces are an added plus.
Golden Corral=Several members of my family and friends are completely obsessed with this place.  Ob. Sessed.  And so - I go.  Ya walk in, pay the lady and pick your drink.  Someone leads you to a table.  Shortly someone will be over with plates and rolls.  At that point - the feeding begins.  And when it ends is all up to you.  As long as you're there they'll keep bringing on the plates and more of their really good warm rolls with honeybutter.  Their steaks are surprisingly good.  You walk up to the window and tell the guy how you want yours cooked - he pokes around at a few and hands you a steak.  There are sauteed mushrooms and onions on the side for you to serve yourself.  Nice.  To give you an idea of the variety and the general immenseness of the place, I'm going to name of just a few of the things I saw there on just our last visit: BBQ Beef w/ opt Buns on the side, Tacos, Black-eyed peas, fried okra, pork & potatoes, steak, spinach salad, mixed green salad, chicken salad, fruit salad, ice milk, brownies, cookies, cakes, blueberry pie, bread pudding, chocolate pudding, cottage cheese, fresh melon (you can see them cutting it putting fresh stuff into containers), Fried clams, Fried shrimp, fried rice, fried chicken, mashed potatoes, and several soups.  It's so much larger than that sounds.Servers are great at  offering new plates (dang food pushers) and refilling your drinks.  The place is also surprisingly clean.  It's nice to be able to see so much going on behind the counters - slicing the fruit, mixing things in bowls, decorating the cakes - it's all done right there where it's visible to everyone.  I've been told several locations out of state are much larger than this one - but I certainly can't imagine the need.  For about $10 a pop it is quite a deal for a great range of food that actually tastes good.  Come hungry.Next time I want to feast like a queen on a budget I will go to one of those Taco Bell/KFC/Pizza Hut/Long John Silver locations and buy one of everything. That would be better than eating at Golden Corral.-PARKING: plenty-DECOR: what is with the BRIGHT fluorescent lights during dinner? Most places have softer lighting during dinner. Plus, it smelled like dirty carpets and felt like some kind of church hall meeting with the strange lighting.-RESTROOM: Smelled like sewage and needed to be cleaned, like someone just had a toilet paper party in the ladies restroom.-SERVICE: all of the employees that I encountered were friendly.-PRICE: Not too bad for dinner, like $10 bucks and change.-FOOD: Pretty good. The Chinese was not good, but all of the American "comfort" foods were pretty tasty. Decent selection.-BEVERAGE: They give you your beverage when you pay and the waitress gives you refills. No access to coffee or your own refills. Reminds me of the Vegas buffets where you are at the mercy of the Food Server for refills.****Four Stars for good food and friendly service.To Serve or Not Serve Hello Yelpers Recently,  I had a experience at a Golden Corral Restaurant that concerned me enough to write to their corporate office not once but twice.  After receiving "no response" I thought I might as well add this to my " Yelp" reviews".  I believe it's incumbent upon management to put things right for any and all concerns a guest may have while dining at their establishment. I have never experienced Management at a corporate level fail to respond in a timely manner when a guest addressed a concern. With the vast amount of establishments to dine at one would think that the last thing management at any restaurant would want is to have a guest  leave unhappy or, in my case to never come back again.  Rather then writing a strategic rant, I have decided to attach the letter I sent to corporate headquarters. September 23, 2013 Corporate Office of Golden Corral I am writing this letter to discuss a recent experience I had at your Golden Corral restaurant located at 420 N Dysart Rd, Goodyear, Arizona (623) 925-9075.  I have visited this location many times and have always enjoyed the quality of food and superior service.  However, my latest visit to Golden Corral has me very concerned as a guest.   On Saturday, September 21 around 1130 A.M. I visited your restaurant to purchase a dozen rolls for a BBQ I was having later that day.  When I returned home and opened the box of rolls I noticed that the rolls were hard and somewhat overcooked.  I realize this has happened to us all at one time or another. Each of us has ordered food at a restaurant and gotten something that differs from our expectations to some degree. I appreciate that restaurant work is a very challenging business, and sometimes cooks and chefs can get caught up in a multitude of orders, all at the same time and the quality of a product can suffer.  I usually do not return food but I really wanted to serve the rolls at the BBQ so I went back to have the rolls replaced. I arrived at the restaurant around 1:25 p.m and asked to speak with a manager (whose name I do not recall).  To be fair, the manager came over apologized and he offered a replacement dozen of rolls fresh out of the oven and advised it would be about 6 minutes. That was nice; my concern lies in the statement the manager made after he took the dozen rolls I brought back.  The manager asked if I had "touched the rolls" because if I had not touched the rolls they could be used to make "bread pudding".  At that moment I wanted to leave the restaurant and I would have left had the replacement rolls not came fresh out of the oven. My concern lies in the area of food, health, and safety issues.  Is taking returned food from guest and reusing it standard operating procedure for Golden Corral? I am not an expert by any means in the area of food preparation.  However, I do realize that food safety is a scientific discipline and the proper handling, preparation, and storage of food is the only way  to prevent foodborne illness. Food can transmit disease from person to person and standard precautions should always be adhered to.  When you are a guest at any food establishment your thought is; the food ought to be safe, and the preparation of the food should be such as to avoid potentially severe health hazards, such as taking returned food from a guest and reusing that product. I am not sure if I will ever revisit Golden Coral again but I know without a doubt that  I will never go back to your Avondale location.  The thought of reusing food that a guest returned is enough to keep me from coming back to that location.

Shane's Rib Shack=2ND Annual Rib Giveaway. 1st 100 customer got a t-shirt, 1/2 rack of ribs and a coke.When I arrived at 9:45 for the 10 o'clock openiong I expected to be 70-80 people back but I made it at #23/#24!!Las Vegas is so spoiled people just don't get out to these things.We are not a city where people camp out overnite or even plan ahead for anything.By the seat of the pants thats how we roll.So they brought out numbered shirts and cups for free drinks then let 10 people in at a tim eto get their ribs & order sides if they wanted.I went in the 3rd group which I only had to wait 5-10 minutes and I was sitting in the A/C chowing down.Despite the turnout being kinda lazy it was fun & I will be out next year to take advantage of their hospitality. Thanks Daren!-owner(hope I didn't mispell it)
Enoteca San Marco=The new Mario Batali restaurant in the venetian, much more casual than B&B, yet still very cozy and gorgeous.  They are conscious about keeping it portion controlled, so i didn't get too full, which was good.  We had the carne grande appetizer, which was 5 different italian handmade meats (such as prosciutto and finocchiona) and different cheeses such as parmigiano and gorgonzola.  Very good, very light.  They brought apricots to add on and made it extra tasty.  Also had a margherita pizza and a pennette pasta with eggplant.  All quite good.  For dessert, try the salted caramel gelato...after the strange initial salt burst, it's a nice taste (if you can get past salt on gelato).on a side note - the menu is in italian and the staff is more than happy to explain everything to you.  Our waiter explained everything to us and was extremly helpful and courteous...check this place out when you need a light lunch!Long overdue review. We went here 1.5 months ago. With a $25 restaurant.com certificate. I wanted to like this place. I really did. The wine was fantastic, the service was fabulous. Wish I could say the same about the food. They don't seat people early. So we were seated a few minutes after 8. No problem, we were hanging out at the bar anyways. We were greeted with a smile and individually packed crunchy bread sticks. Awesome. We ordered a cheese plate with five varieties. It came with three dipping sauces. I prefer the cheese without the sauce. Maybe that's just me. We've heard great things about the prosciutto balls. An order comes with six. It's salty. Very salty. Didn't go down well at all. Then we had the crispy duck. More like burnt, overcooked duck with no flavor except charred meat. And there was barely any meat. The goat cheese pizza did little to salvage the meal. But it was the better of the three dishes. Overall, I was thoroughly disappointed. How did Mario Batali become an Iron Chef if these are the products that his restaurant comes out with?I originally wanted to do brunch at Bouchon but they are closed on Mondays for brunch. BOO! We ended up wondering around for a while and ended up here. (Lots of the nicer restaurants are not open at 11am on Mondays.) Sitting "outside" in the Canal area at the Venetian is beautiful, the people watching and the performers are fun too.  To start off they gave us this bread but it was burnt?? The waiter tells us that "the crust is suppose to be that way." hmmm?? okay? I didn't get it, it tasted like burnt bread to me. We ordered an Insalate- grilled radicchio with smoked mozzarella. This was good the cheese was baked on top with the crispy radicchio at the bottom. Yummy!As the main entrees we had the Gemelli - house sausage and broccoli rabe. I love the gemelli noodles they were cooked perfectly, texture was just right and they had a unique shape. The other dish was the Bavette Cacio e Pepe- black pepper and percorino. A very simple dish however, full a flavor you can really taste the noodles but it was a salty. The portions seem small when you look at them compared to how much pasta you get at other restaurants but, I was stuffed by the end of lunch. And you should be with a $50 lunch tab. I wonder how B&B would be??? (A lot more expensive, I know that much) :P
Lucky Boy Burger Shop=OMG!  The BEST French fries in town!  Real, fresh-cut fries with the skin still on. The perfect crispness and greasiness!  Their burgers are to die for.  Freshly cooked, pure beef.The place has been around for 57 years.  It's had a total of 4 owners in that entire time.Really nice people and service, too!I finally convinced Hubby to give Lucky Boy a try, based on all the rave reviews by trusted Yelpers. We almost didn't get out of the car, however, when we pulled into the back, only to see a group of apparent drug addicts huddled at the side of the Circle K. One woman (?) was alternately pounding a man in the chest, snapping back his head by means of his hair, and then spooning him. Ah, meth. You are truly a showman.Anyway, when we decided to brave it, it was well worth the risk. The burgers were made from fresh, great quality beef, cooked to almost crispy on the outside, and yet still magically juicy on the inside. Fresh bun and toppings, and absolutely awesome fries. Super hot and wonderfully seasoned. I usually get some heartburn after eating fried foods, but had zero issues with Lucky Boy. We got some shakes to go- I had strawberry and Hubby had peanut butter. They were good, and very thick, but we both agreed that we prefer the more intense flavors of the shakes at the Chicago Hamburger Company.Will we be back? You betcha. And not just for the "scared straight" factor.Think In-N-Out burger on steroids before it became a chain. That's this place. I officially 'heart' Lucky Boy Burger Shop. I really can't imagine anything bad to say about the food, prices, or service at Lucky Boy. Some people might be offended by the location or the decor, they definitely didn't splurg on interior design. But, it's part of the charm and it keeps prices low. Where else can you get a 1 lb burger and fried mushrooms for less than $5? I just wish they were open on Sundays.I had to make the Great Circle trip to DoPho and CenPho, although I always think of it as GoPho (going to Phoenix...it seems like a long journey).Today I got to take a baseball bat to the temple twice in one day!I had to spend quality time with my accountant and more of the same with my health insurance agent...just one of those mornings.I needed to treat myself, although after a visit with my business friends, I somehow felt it needed to be an inexpensive treat.My insurance agent is just north of Lucky Boy and that's where I went for my late lunch. I needed a scotch, and a Lucky Boy burger may not be the next best thing, but it's pretty damn good.I had not been here since last fall, but it really never changes (at least not since I came to AZ). They just make a good, simple burger. There aren't any tricks (no butter flavored whatever on the buns). The fries are crunchy outside and fluffy inside. The buns are soft, but hold together well and the meat is charred, but not crusty and overdone.Are there better burgers in the Phoenix area?...I'd have to say yes. Are there better drive-thru burgers in Phoenix?...I don't think so. Lucky boy is terrific...fresh, tasty, inexpensive (my meal was under $5.00), fast and the people at Lucky Boy are just extremely nice folks. Let's all do our  part and make them busier!I recently had one of the worst days of my life and that's not an exaggeration. I received some really bad news mid day, mid week and kinda walked around in a fog until I get off work at 5:00pm. In a Xanax induced coma; tired and starving due to skipping lunch I happened upon Lucky Boy. I've been meaning to stop in for awhile but just never made it happen.Now, I'm not one of those chicks that drowns her sorrows in french fries and ice cream, quite the opposite actually so I figured I'd take advantage of my appetite. I ordered an "international burger" and fries and some sort of large carbonated beverage. It was wonderful. The fries were crispy and perfectly salted and the burger was one of the best I've had in a very long time. The ingredients were fresh and the price was right. I'm sure there are better burgers out there, but I can't think of any. I ate the whole fucking thing and was actually sad when the experience was over. I'll be back soon to gorge myself on some other menu items. Maybe I'll wait for PMS to kick in, maybe I wont. All I have to say is this- there is something comforting about smothering your insides in cheese and oil. Lucky Boy may not solve all of your problems, but it fills the void in your tummy without having to prepare a meal when you are out of your flippin mind.And that's something....I would say my husband is the "Lucky Boy" with a wife who is more than happy to dine at such a fine establishment.  You won't find kobe beef or antelope on the menu, nor some crazy topping like foie gras.  And brace yourself, no sweet potato fries either.  But you will find a pretty damn good burger and fries for under $4!  Who knew they still even existed?The burger is everything an old-fashioned burger should be, standard with mustard, ketchup, chopped lettuce, tomato, and onion.  And just so you don't forget we're in Arizona, they offer pepper jack cheese and green chilies.  The fries are thick cut and crisp, and they mix a mean milkshake, too.  We ate inside, and yes, it is kind of a dive, but a clean one.  It reminded me of the kind of burger joints that were around when I was a kid.  Yes, they had burgers back then.A nondescript little place off 16th Street that is light on ambiance but heavy on tasty old- fashioned hamburgers.  The thousand-island combo was a tri-monthly ritual when I lived in that part of town.  This is the type of place that cable channel "hole in the wall food showcase shows" are made for.
Joe's Farm Grill=why is this place so far away??we ordered a burger, the grilled chicken sandwich, fries and onion rings. we topped it off w a fresh strawberry shake since it was the special for the day. we split everything and boy oh boy was it great! I have also heard that their pizza is awesome and their breakfast. I need to go back and get both.also, don't forget to check out the bathroom. i think i spent like 15 minutes in there. lol jk. it is pretty entertaining though.9/11Finally made it out here!  While they were offering up their "Dog Days of Summer" (everyday in September offered two different gourmet hot dog selections, most of which sounded divine even though I rarely consume them nowadays) and fresh lemonade, I decided to try their bacon blue cheese burger with sweet potato fries.While I waited for my order, I decided to check out the restroom facility to wash my hands and found, to my slight discomfort, an animation film classic "Stingray" playing on a 13" television console inside (along with showcases of Barbie and Ken on the walls).  While novel to see, as I said, this blast-from-the-past just made me want to leave the facility as fast as I could.  Something about those faces creeps me out!This burger was SUPERB!   I cannot find fault in any of the components, from the grilled bun and perfectly-grilled patty, to the tasty homemade BBQ (a popular offering from JFG's sister company, Joe's Real BBQ) smothered on huge and crispy bacon and onion rings, to the heavenly chunky blue cheese dressing!  (Oh, that blue cheese dressing... Just give me a cup of this dressing and a straw to slurp it all up and I'm a happy camper!).  The sweet potato fries were amazing!!  Yes, I'd gladly drive 70 miles RT to order this platter of food again and again.  But, let's not forget to make room for dessert!  Hot fudge sundae lovers must try the mud sundae, a twist on the classic hot fudge sundae with malt added.  Mmmm....It was a little busy when I arrived at 11a, and thankful I was to arrive then for the lunch time crowd was ridiculous!  Patio-seating (shaded by trees) was crowded, and indoors soon mirrored the patio, with a line threatening to extend beyond the doors (and it was so hot that day, too!)It's confession time: I love a man and his name is Joe Johnston. Not in the way you might think, but in an admiration and respect kind of way. Johnston owns some of my favorite southeast Valley eateries, like Joe's Real BBQ and Liberty Market. He also has another place, Joe's Farm Grill, that's been featured on Diners Drive-ins and Dives.Built out of his childhood home, Joe's Farm Grill is at Agritopia, a neighborhood being built around a farm in Gilbert. Many of the vegetables and herbs come directly from the farm and right into Joe's kitchen. It doesn't get more local than this.You'd have to squint really hard to figure out what the house may have looked like before it was converted into a restaurant. The place has a retro-modern flair with a nod to the 1960s. The lighting fixtures are groovy, baby.The ordering process is as straightforward as the menu approach the window and place your order. You're given an electronic buzzer that gives you a good scare when your food is ready. I swear, I jump every time.The interior is relaxed and comfortable with plenty of open seating, though the best seats are actually outdoors under giant shade trees.Also outdoors is the condiment bar with ranch dressing on tap. Any place that has one of my favorite dips for French fries on tap is a winner in my book.The mainstream menu of burgers, pizzas and salads caters to the stroller pushing set that frequents Joe's as well as anyone who enjoys fresh, well-prepared food.My mouth started watering instantly when I saw how good the food looked. I quickly sank a bite into the Farm Burger ($7.99), which was well seasoned and perfectly juicy. Weighing in at 6 ounces, then covered with a choice of cheese and grilled onions, this is one tasty burger.The Thai Chicken Salad ($8.99 small/$9.99 large) takes local greens and veggies, crispy rice noodles and peanuts, then tosses them in spicy Thai vinaigrette. This one was a disappointment because I felt that the dressing was unbalanced with too much sweet and sour and not enough spice.Joe's pizzas take on a slightly crisp char from being grilled rather than baked. Knowing that Joe does barbecue right at another of his restaurants, ordering the BBQ Chicken Pizza ($8.99) was a no brainer. Smoked chicken breast, bacon, blue cheese, fresh tomato, red onion and with Joe's Real BBQ sauce sounded like a lot of ingredients, but they worked surprisingly well together. The tangy bleu cheese and smoky sweet BBQ sauce created a yin and yang of flavors, a great combination.For dessert, Joe's has milk shakes ($3.99) including vanilla, chocolate and seasonal fruit.So it's with much love that I say I'm looking forward to visiting again soon.I've run the gamut on onion rings... from two days ago experiencing the worst at Pete's, to today experiencing the best at Joe's.These people were on their A-game tonight. The pulled pork & baby backs had such a flavorful smokey essence, while the chicken strips were an amazing taste combination between chicken parm and BBQ sauce.  Did I mention they have the best onion rings ever?A great example of a restaurant that doesn't skimp, rather display an eye for detail. It takes more prep time, but it's worth it, and it shows.The shrimp basket was very good, and the homemade cocktail sauce was the crowning jewel.What's better than a surry with a fringe on top?  Howz about a hot dog with an egg on top.  Delectable!Dear Mr. Johnston,The trifecta that is Liberty Market, Joe's Real BBQ and Joe's Farm Grill are bad for my diet.  I'm not saying it's your fault but if the food at your fine establishments were not so darm fresh and tasty, I would be thinner.  I crave your food.  And when I went to Joe's Farm Grill for the first time it was so good, I went back the very next day!!  Obviously you love what you do and we reap the benefits so thank you!  But my waistline does not thank you.  Sincerely, Lynn W.7/07/10Don't get me wrong, I still love JFG; I just didn't care for its BBQ pulled pork sandwich and fries.  The coleslaw was good, but not so fantastic that it's worth the pain after.  I thought that the pork had too much of the cloyingly-sweet sauce.  Wasn't so sweet when paired w/ the garlic toast points.  However, if you look at the included photo, you'll see that the two pieces of bread were under the pork, and therefore completely saturated w/ sauce.  I like accompanying bread to be crispy/crusty (love that crunch!), so all I had to enjoy that afternoon w/ the pork was the part that stuck out from under all that sauced meat!  What a waste (tsk, tsk)!  The boat of fries was just a complete soggy mess.  I should've asked them to sub sweet potato fries instead, but why must I pay extra to get a perfectly crisped product?  Then again, one (wo)man's treasure is another (wo)man's trash, and vice-versa, eh?Today wasn't a great day for me w/ regards to Mr. Johnston's two restaurants (see my "recent" Coffee Shop review).  I hope my next visit to a Johnston concept yields a happier adventure!Is there anything better than eating outdoors on a nice sunny day with temps in the low 80's on green grass among plenty of citrus trees and evergreens  in Phoenix Arizona??  Well this is the setting everyday throughout the fall and spring at Joe's Farm Grill!!I can't believe I haven't written a review on Joe's Farm Grill already.  It's an awesome place to take the family and friends for breakfast or lunch.  Their menu is built around things people love to eat now a days and it starts in their garden rather than in their restaurant.  They actually grow most of not all of the produce they use in their dishes on site. They will offer some seasonal sides, dishes and deserts based on the seasonality of their fruits and veggies.  There are loads of reviews already written about specific dishes that are favorites at Joe's Farm Grill, so I wont go into a lot of details concerning their menu.  Some of my favorites at Joe's Farm Grill ~ BBQ smoked chicken pizza which is grilled with some char, topped with plenty of blue cheese, some veggies and BBQ sauce.  It is DELISH and the perfect app to share with friends. Some of my fav's: ~Fontina Burger, Chicken Pesto sandwich,~Sonoran Dogs ~ get the X2 for $9.99 with either their tasty onion rings or sweet potato fries with their Pineapple-serrano dipping sauce,~Ahi Tuna and the grilled peanut butter and banana sandwiches~Thai Ahi Salad and Chicken Caesar Salad All of these are a flavor-fest your mouth and tummy will thank you for later :^) Don't forget to leave room for desert at "The Coffee Shop" or a tasty shank/malt!  Everything at Joe's Farm Grill is is well prepared and they are consistent in delivering quality, fresh tasting food.  This place can get insanely busy on the weekends especially when the weather is nice.  You may want to plan your visit to Joe's either early lunch or late breakfast during the week.  Bring your dog and kiddos so they can play on the green grass and enjoy a meal outside.  I hope to see you at Joe's soon!I wanted to move to Agritopia when my ex and I were looking for a big old house in east Gilbert.  I urged him to consider Agritopia.  I extolled the virtues of the charming neighborhoods, tree lined streets, real front porches, alley accessed garages, the centrally located elementary school for our son, the availability of fresh produce raised within the subdivision, and I went on and on but he wasn't having it.  I think he secretly suspected that I was trying to indoctrinate him into some new fangled 21st century commune or something.  Now I realize exactly what I did wrong.  I didn't force him to come get a meal at Joe's Farm Grill, which just happens to be within a stone's throw to Agritopia and also uses Agritopia's produce garden.  (Or maybe it's Joe's Farm Grill garden and Agritopia uses it?  I dunno, but I do know the two are somehow linked.)    If I had only dragged him into Joe's Farm Grill I could have sealed the deal, I'm sure of it.Joe's is a really neat little place, surrounded by towering Tamarack trees that have been there forever.  The structure was originally the late 1950's to early 1960's ranch style family home (and former farm) of the same family that now owns Joe's.  Also the family has two other top-notch restaurants, Joe's Real BBQ and Liberty Grill.  The house has since been professionally and radically retrofitted into be a sleek, yet still somehow retro, restaurant, with bathrooms that are so fun and funky that you just have to go there and see for yourself what I mean.  (Trust me.)  The restaurant still retains the old front room of the original house, including the fire place, and it is now a dining room.  It's not hard at all to imagine Joe's family settled around their Christmas tree in their pajamas in the mid-1960's opening presents, completely oblivious to the fact that someday their front room would be a seating area for one of the best places to eat in the whole damn Valley.  Yep, I said it: One of the best places to eat in the whole damn Valley; that is NO exaggeration.The food here is amazing.  It's wildly flavorful, perfectly cooked, and deliciously paired with different sides and it's all reasonably priced to boot.  They know what they do here, and they do it perfectly.  My personal favorite here is the seared Ahi Tuna sandwich with a Wasabi dressing.  I can't even describe how good it is.  It's just a flat out flavor bomb.  (Tip: I will reiterate that the tuna is seared, so if you get it and are expecting a fully cooked tuna steak you will be confused and perhaps even disappointed; don't be, just eat it and savor the deliciousness of a perfectly seared tuna steak on a toasted bun with a wonderful Wasabi dressing and a zesty Asian slaw.)  It is my favorite sandwich from anywhere, ever.  I have also tasted their pizzas, burgers, hot dogs, shakes (come topped with a green cherry!) and French fries and all have been outstanding.  I really cannot find a single criticism for this place.Oh wait, I just thought of one criticism; that there isn't a Joe's Farm Grill closer to my home, since my ex refused to let us buy a house there.   *pout*Fast food quality, with high end restaurant wait times.My wife and I live near downtown Phoenix/Mid Town, so when people give us restaurant recommendations to trendy spots, we love to check them out. This place was horrendous. First of all the wait, when we went, there was a line, we later discovered the reason for the line was they had one person on the register. Even though the owner was out shaking hands and getting ready to leave, the second register was never opened. By the time we got to order, 50 minutes had passed and we got to the point of where "maybe" the food quality may make up for the horrible wait.Nope! It took about 5 minutes to actually get our food, so the issue wasn't food prep, it was just the horrible logistics of this business. I ordered a farm burger, medium with bacon and cheese. What I got resembled something that had been marinated in grease for about 12 years then under cooked and served on a delicious bun, but 2 minutes into the meal the bun resembled a soggy rag. The fries had a weird taste to them, I ended up not eating my meal. My wife got through about half of her burger before she complained about the greasiness.I put the burger quality on par with an in-and-out, smash burger, five guys style burger. However, would you wait 30+ minutes for one of those? No, so I will never return here and I will chalk up all of the recommendations for this place to, suburb folks that have never experienced real dining.This is one of those local restaurants where you know you can bring out-of-towners to that is sure to impress!  The restaurant is built out of the owner Joe Johnston's 1960's childhood home (renovated of course!).  The bathrooms feature kitschy glass box displays of vintage Barbies and GI Joes.  It's a really cool space!  You order at the register, are given a vibrating pager, and can choose to sit inside or outside under the trees overlooking the Agritopia urban farming fields.  The vibe is super relaxed, patio dog friendly, and most of the vegetables are freshly picked from the aforementioned Agritopia fields -- as fresh and local as produce could possibly get!  The place has even been featured on the Food Network.Food-wise, everything here is good.  Great pizzas (I love the veggie one), burgers, (once again, I'm a fan of the veggie burger), fries (regular, garlic, and sweet potato -- yum!), salads, strawberry lemonade, date shakes...the list goes on.Side Note: Come here on your birthday and get $10 towards your meal (you can also do this at Joe's other 2 local restaurants -- Liberty Market and Joe's Real BBQ if you're up for the challenge!).
Z'Tejas Southwestern Grill=As far as location and overall vibe of Z'Tejas goes- it's a hit. It seems to serve alot of young, attractive people... The outdoor eating and bar is fun- and the big screen TV's are a cool... but the food and service was just a total miss for me. Unfortunately, the food just didn't have much going on. First, the cornbread is a fun idea and is a nice change to free appetizers- but it was super thick and lacked any real cornbread flavor or consistency. The Catfish Tacos were a whole lot of cabbage and not much else... i literally could not taste the meat flavor hidden under the amount of cabbage stuffed in. And sadly, the Baked Seafood Enchiladas were another miss- it appeared to be two tortillas covered in sauce and rice with two shrimp inside... i couldn't taste much else and felt i could have taken a better stab at making this meal at home myself =/ (See my pictures to get a better idea)On top of this, the service was a bit lackluster. There seemed to be a waiter and waitress simultaneously serving us- one taking the order, one getting our drinks, the other bringing out our food, the other with our check-  As confusing as this was, it was difficult for me to get my water refilled and had to flag down the waiters 2-3 times to get their attention.I'd like to add that during my stay in Phoenix i saw the hottest girls of my entire vacation at Z'Tejas(which was a plus, lol) But seriously, If you're cruising the mall and looking for a quick bite to eat- it wouldn't be a bad idea to check out Z'Tejas, just don't expect to much... i'm sure this place does it's drinks much better =)L.W. and I stopped here for a quick HH bite before a Yelp Shop Local event.  We were greeted immediately and seated in the back.  It was nice!  Our server came to greet us quickly and took our drink orders.  The drinks came quick and we placed our food order of many appetizers.  Catfish Beignets - They are catfish crusted with cornmeal and fried crisp served with jalapeno tartar sauce.  WOW, these little fried strips of heaven were so so SO GOOD!  Smoked Chicken Quesadilla - Grilled chicken with onions and green peppers, cheese, and salsa stuff.   I am not sure what but both L and I thought it was ah, ok.  Green Chile Shredded Pork Nachos - OMG... These are SO SO good.  Only minor con:  The server had to be reminded to refills our drinks.If I am at Scottsdale Fashion Square this is my go-to place to eat, and I happen to usually end up there during happy hour!  The Raw Ahi Chipotle bites are fantastic!  But, it is not a lot of food to fill you up, so I recommend getting it half price during happy hour.  The pork nachos are good (but my favorite are at Fuego), and the street tacos hit the spot.  It is always pretty busy in here due to it being attached to the mall, and the servers always seem to deal with it in stride.  Their margaritas are fabulous and they have a great variety.  The sampler is always a good way to start if you have never been to ZTejas.  The only reason it gets 3 stars is I never seem to crave ZTejas; it is simply my go to place at the mall that has good food and a great happy hour... No complaints, it just doesn't wow me either.
Mrs White's Golden Rule Cafe=We have been going to Mrs Whites for years now. We would go there as a treat every so often because there food was fantastic. Unfortunately it has really gotten pretty bad in the last year or so. Its really sad to, we loved Mrs Whites but not anymore.     The last couple times we went the food was pretty sub par. The portions were much smaller and the quality and taste was rather poor. A couple of times ago we went with myself, my mother and my brother. I dont want this to sound racist but I feel it needs to said. I felt like we were definitely the wrong color to be eating there.    The service was ok but i noticed it was much better for the "locals" who were there at the same time. We ordered and sat and waited for our meal. I watched as some of the people around me were brought the same thing I had ordered and it looked fantastic. Nice big pieces of chicken with large portions of sides.     Well finally our food came and what a disappointment. Our portions were MUCH smaller then everyone elses and the sides were about half the size. My mother ordered catfish, (her favorite thing there) and it looked like it was half a filet. My smothered chicken was 2 very small wings and one small breast, (I had ordered all white meat) and there was very little gravy and cabbage.      I went ahead and tried Mrs Whites one last time a couple weeks ago and it was more of the same thing. I ordered the smothered chicken again and when it arrived I received 2 small wings and a back bone with no meat. The table right behind me had the same thing and received 2 large breasts and a nice sized wing. After attempting to eat the skin off the back bone I gave up and ate what little else there was on the plate. My mother did get a nice sized catfish filet but both our sides were very small.     I no longer recommend Mrs Whites. It looks like the kids have taken over running the place and I think thats the problem. The gentleman who was always in the kitchen did a wonderful job of making the place a great choice for fantastic food but i dont see him there much anymore.    Stay away from Mrs Whites unless you happen to be the right color. Very sad.I'm not sure what is worse; ordering my food to go, eating fried chicken, eating fried chicken in the heat, or all of the above. Well, rain or shine, I love eating Fried Chicken and nobody can take that away from me. So I saw this little bungalow-like restaurant, which is located a block away from Chase Field and also not far from my hotel, that serve authentic Southern and Soul food. But my dining experience and decision-making has costed me my hopeful solid meal.I ordered the Fried Chicken dinner-combo for $12.00. The combo includes two sides with a slice of cornbread and I chose Rice and Mixed Collard Greens. I made a big mistake and opted to take my meal to-go to stuff my face with the fried chicken like a barbarian in my hotel room. My side of Collard Greens were very tasty and full of flavor, but a bit too watery, in which caused my side of rice to taste like a soup-like side and my monster-pieces of fried chicken's crispy skin and piece of cornbread were soggy. The fried chicken were very tasty, but it would've tasted a lot better if it wasn't for my misfortune. This restaurant accepts only cash. I should've ate in the restaurant, because the friendly workers treated me very well and strongly convinced me to eat in. I'll definitely will eat in the restaurant  next time.The restaurant has numerous awards from various sources including having the famous Yelp-sticker posted on the front door. The restaurant is also a favorite of the NFL's Arizona Cardinals, and NBA's Phoenix Suns with numerous pictures posted all over the facility.He confidently pushed the menu to the edge of the table with a hand calloused, wrinkled and bent by time and years of hard work fixing cars and pushing brooms. "I don't need the menu. I have been coming here for 30 years and they have the best chicken fried steak I have had in my life.""Hey, I know better than to doubt you, grandpa." replied the young man with the same face, minus 40 years and 30 lbs but with the benefit of an extra 4 inches in height.The old man ordered a lemonade to wash it down and the kid took a sweet tea, both ariving in giant plastic cups that reminded the kid, now nearly 30 of his childhood summers spent with his family in El Paso,Texas with his father's family who had moved with the army from Mississippi many years before he was born but brought the traditions of cooking for taste and comfort and damned be anyone for telling them it wasn't healthy.They sat quietly, tired from a morning of moving furniture into the young man's new home, reading the signatures on the wall. The old man pointed out and explained who some of the old-timers were, mostly polititians and actors who, while big in their day, were not legendary enough to cary into the vernacular of pop culture 30 years later, and the young man pointing out and explaining the athletes and musicians of his era.The waiter dropped off their chicken fried steaks along with their sides: Red beans, rice with gravy, greens and potatoes. They grinned in acknowledement of having made the right choices and began to eat."You know, her son opened a chicken and waffle place not too far from here." ther kid said, "but you are right; this place is better. Thanks for your help today grandpa."First off I would like to punch the dip Shit on the food network who said this was the best chicken he ever ate. Yeah the place is filthy, but how they operate their business is redicolus. Service sucks, 49 minute wait for the food sucks, waiting 20 minutes from the first  entree being dropped off until the last person luckily receives their food sucks, being told on the 59th minute of a hour wait for your food, that they are out of your side dishes, sucks, spending my hard earned money at a place that is Ass backwards in any kind of business sense, sucks. At first our group thought it was a joke, then the reverse racism theory was brought up, then we noticed that every table was experiencing the same lack of service. Black, white, purple,orange. They just sucked.So I admit I am a food network junkie and I honestly only went to this place because I saw it on best I ever ate fried chicken episode but come on best I ever ate fried chicken in Phoenix I had to see for myself.  Well Mrs. White backed it up with some amazing chicken and I don't know what previous reviewers were talking about with the sides because my grandma from North Carolina was in town and her and I both liked the red beans and macaroni salad.  The staff was friendly and even sent me home with two extra pieces of chicken for later.  This place is awesome and I will for sure be a repeat customer.Also whoever said KFC has chicken as good and it's cheaper well keep going back to KFC and stay outta places like this cause you don't belong.  Just sayin'.  KFC aint got nothin on Mrs. White.I have vascillated on Mrs. White's for a few years now. Today's visit sealed the deal for me on why I won't return. I got a to-go order of fried chicken, black eye peas and rice with gravy (since they were out of mac & cheese at 11:30 am). As I waited for my order, I watched several plates of chicken being delivered to customers eating in. The pieces were so huge they were half falling off the plates and towering above them. I looked forward to the same as I drove home, especially since I paid $14.81 for my lunch- and that did not include a beverage. Imagine my dismay as I opened my box at home and discovered three tiny pieces of underseasoned not-so-fresh tasting chicken. What the hell? You give the sit down customers the best you have to offer because they might complain otherwise? You give me some bullshit chicken because I am doing carryout? The peas were mush, the rice & gravy was bland, and the cornbread was overdone on the outside and heavy and underdone inside. I guess you're overcharging your customers to bank-roll your retirement, which will surely come sooner rather than later since I can't imagine how you're keeping customers.Where to start? Let's start by addressing the false advertising on their website.  After hearing a few people talk about how good the food is there , we wanted to give it a try.  We viewed their website and if you look under Entrees, you will see the meals are all priced at $10.18 per plate.  Good deal! We arrive at the place and our first impressions are, the place needs cleaning and a paint job.  Most anyone can look past how a place looks if the service is great and the food is really good.  Most dive places I've been to have both... so the decor isn't something I get hung up on. Service...  marginal at best.  Some guy... guessing the owner... arguing with the staff, singing... just doing whatever.  I guess this is acceptable since he owns/runs the place?  Not the best thing to do in front of customers. (again... it's a dive... not expecting 5 star services)Server---  stops my wife in front of the bathroom door to ask if she knows what she wants to order.  Maybe wait until we are all seated and ready to order?  Thought this was pretty strange! Now the food comes out.  Chicken wasn't horrible, wasn't great.  The canned mac-n-cheese... right up there with the best High School cafeteria mac-n-cheese.... not good!  Right from a box or can... no flavor... not homemade.   Very disappointing to say the least.  The greens... again... from a can... maybe some additional seasoning added... but.. odds are... if they were too lazy to make real mac-n-cheese... then they were too lazy to make real greens.  Gravy on the chicken... same sad story... from a box/can.... just not good or great. Dessert--- sweet potato pie   not bad... probably one of the better things ordered.  What was crazy... if you can imaging this... take a normal/decent size slice of pie... now cut that in half and this was the serving size we got.  All for $4.99 a slice. NUTS!  $10 for two slivers of pie. A joke! Remember I mentioned the FALSE ADVERTISING at the beginning of this review.  All meals $10.18.  NOT TRUE!  The site hasn't been updated in who knows how long? You sit down and the menu does not show the pricing... only mention of pricing is the Ox tales for $15.00.  So... you would assume from the website the meals are $10.18 each.  WRONG....  for  two meals, two very sad/small slices of pie.... $41.00 No breakdown of the pricing ... the owner/manager just punched up some numbers on the calculator and that was the bill. All in all... this place needs new management... some passion put back in to  the kitchen... and they need to update/clean the place.  Not to mention... in this day and age... no excuses to not having an updated website.... to properly reflect your business and pricing.  I have a feeling when Mrs White was running this place... it was awesome... not anymore. Bad experience.. not even close to being worth the money spent. Avoid this place...save your money....Will not be going back... will not recommend this place to anyone I know.Went back today and took out another 10 vehicles as I rammed into the left lane to make the turn into the lot...I meant to try pork chops, or catfish...nope, I couldn't get past the chicken.Once again, this chicken did not disappoint.  I had an annoying end to this long work day when I got home with this chicken.  But as soon as I picked up the drumstick and took a bite, it ALL washed away...seriously.Let's back up.  When I opened my styrofoam container, I noticed that the chicken had gotten slightly moist from the being closed up for almost an hour after I got it.  I thought the experience was going to be lessened.  No.  The drumstick was a bit soggy on the bottom from sitting so long, but like I said, I bit into it and all the annoyances of life went elsewhere and bothered some other guy.Perfection.Even when soggy.Even when sitting for over an hour.If fried chicken remains absolutely delicious even after all that, you know you've got some special stuff.What gets me is that I saw some young folks in the kitchen, I don't know if either of them fried the chicken, but if so - someone has been teaching them the real deal.  This tastes like some old woman who has been through years of hurt and pain but also joy and love has cooked this.  Someone who KNEW what bad chicken was and KNEW how to avoid that at all costs.  Someone who cared what their food tastes like.  And if youngens' are producing this kind of fare, that deserves proper kudos.I notice there is not a 'professional' atmosphere here.  Like another reviewer said, anything seems to go.  Honestly?  So what.The food is too friggin good.  Yes, we are entitled to good customer service as customers.  But like I said before, you get what you put in with the people here.  You come in with an attitude, that is what you get.I know some people put a high high value on customer service and how staff presents themselves; I do, too.  But chicken THIS good, and I mean specifically THIS chicken that is THIS good...I can accept the very casual atmosphere here.Yes, I wish they would put a bit more pride in their professionalism.  But I promise you, this chicken will make lovers of fried chicken not give a flying flea's fanny about anything else.  In each experience I've had with it, the chicken is THAT good.When you go to Mrs. White's you will get down home food. You will also get down home service, which means prepare to be ignored while the staff talks and laugh among themselves.The food was good but the only problem is if you go two hours before closing time they will be out of most (if not all) of the side dishes and desserts, which is very odd. You rarely find it crowded (except maybe on Sundays after church) so it seems as if they would rather have less sides or just enough than too much. I can't imagine a restaurant constantly "running out of food" all the time.It took us about 45 minutes to get our food and only after the waitress told us every 15 minutes they had no more mac and cheese, then no more sweet potatoes, then no more greens. The chicken was very good and so was the cornbread, but I've been here several times and the service is the same.As we were looking to pay our bill the owner (or someone related to Mrs. White I assume) was on the phone talking to someone about going out that night, over charged us, swore we owed more than we did (all the while he's still having a conversation on the phone) and when we finally told him he over charged us he just said "oh".The food isn't enough to make up for the service and vanishing dessert and sides options, so I think I won't be going back.Whoever's got the Gold makes the rules and Mrs. White makes gold in that kitchen.While I'm pretty sure that's not the golden rule Mrs. White is talking about, I think this one is more fitting! Her Smothered Chicken Fried Steak, dripping in gravy might as well have been dripping in gold, it tasted awesome! I ordered mine up with Mac N Cheese and Sweet Potatoes, deciding on those over the okra and the collard greens was tough, but worth it.Unless you're on one of those reverse diet plans eating a minimum number of calories like an Olympic swimmer, you had better check you diets at the door; this ain't no place for calorie countin'. I told mine I was going out for a light jog on my lunch that day; "You really don't need to come along." I told her; I hope she bought it! The ambiance here is likened more to a waffle house experience than 5 star dining, with old school fast food type booths and seating. While you're here, read the wall closely enough, and you will find many Cool signatures penned right on to it. Famous musical entertainers, local and nationally accomplished athletes, and other famed diners can all be found to have dined here once upon a time.Our waitress was surprisingly fit and trim for someone who serves food at a Soul Food spot. I had to ask, "Just how do you keep that girlish figure while working and dining here?" which she replied with "running back and forth with orders all day" and "hiking my favorite trails" on her off days. I have to note that she is now my new inspiration. Maybe I need to get a job here. I wonder how that would go over for my diet plan? Hmmmm.Happy Yelping Phoenix, it's time to go for gold!This place has been around since I was born and critics seem to love this place. I am a big fan of Lolo's so this place should be even better right? I brought two of my foodie friends and we were excited about trying this place. Our high expectations were shattered with the worst service I've ever had and just downright lame food. The "world famous fried chicken" (which took 20 minutes to bring) tasted like Banquet frozen chicken. The server brought our cornbread 10 minutes after our lousy chicken. We had no silverware for a while.  My other colleague ordered the special ribs. He compared them to the McRib sandwich which I thought was an insult to Mickey D's. The men's bathroom didn't have hand towels to add to our misery. The coup de gras was we paid $16 for a crappy chicken plate and an iced tea. Everybody has a bad day but if you've been around for 48 years, you have no excuses.I honestly don't know how anyone can rate this restaurant more than 1 star.  We saw this restaurant featured on Check Please Arizona and being from the south, we were excited to try it.  I decided to take my husband there for his birthday.  Let me start off with the review of the food - it was terrible.  The chicken was greasy, and had no flavor.  The sides were as bad as a school cafeteria.  But the service is even worse!  We arrived around 1:30 on a Saturday.  There were 2 large tables of people and a few other tables but still lots of empty tables (the place is pretty small).  We chose a table in the back - huge mistake, because it reeked of the smells from the bathroom.  But I wanted to try to stay positive since it was my husband's birthday.  We waited only a few minutes before a waiter came by to give us menus and get our drink order.  We ordered non-sweet tea - however, we got one sweet and one non-sweet, we were able to get that remedied, but when the waiter came back to give us the tea, he wouldn't take our order even though we said we were ready.  He said he had to get a pencil and paper and would be back. Well, he didn't come back for almost 45 minutes!  That's not to say he wasn't around, when the large table's food was ready, the brought out the plates one by one - several minutes apart.  Several other tables came in during this time, while we were still waiting to order, he actually took he new tables orders before ours!  Finally, I spoke up next time he was in our vicinity and told him we still hadn't ordered.  Even after this, it took him about 10 minutes to come back!  We should have walked out, but now it was a mission to see how long it would take.  After we ordered, we waited again.  At some point, a man came out and asked a table near us, but who had came in well after us, how long they had been waiting, and this nice lady told him that our table had been waiting longer than hers.  Turns out, they got their food before we did!  In fact several tables that came in after us got food before us.  Finally, we got our food and let me say that I have had better fried chicken from KFC - I actually think they might have gotten the chicken from KFC, because I don't remember the smell of chicken frying in the restaurant.  And of course they got our sides wrong.  At the end of our meal, a lady came by again to the table near us and apologized for the delay and asked if she could provide a dessert on the house, again the nice lady customer informed the employee that in fact we had been there much longer than them, The employee then just looked at us and reluctantly came to our table and asked us if we wanted dessert.  Having lived in the south, I am familiar with racial tensions, and I have read the other Yelpers mentioning the disparity of service for non-dark customers, this place is worse than anything I have ever experienced.  Two hours waiting for a lunchtime meal!  That's CRAZY!  I felt unwelcome and unimportant to the business.  I will never go there again.  And after all of that, it was $34.00!!  Maybe they charge by the number of minutes you occupy the table?  I think I owe my husband another birthday dinner....
Sacks Art of Sandwicherie=Sacks is where the beautiful people live at lunchtime. The menu board is mind boggling for the newbie. Step back and absorb. I got the Dali (all of the sandwiches are named for arteests) For me, it was my way of paying edible tribute to Subs by Jim, who went out of business recently. I even bowed my head for a little moment of silence before my first bite,... tear...I always got egg salad there.The Dali is Egg Salad, bacon, lettuce tomato, cream cheese and mayo. I held off the mayo, because my rule is if the filling has mayo, it is a sin to add more. Cream cheese was a little weird on egg salad, but it grew on me. Lightning quick service, but it should be with about 8 people behind the counter. Little cookie in the bag was a sweet bonus...haha, puns.Poore brothers chips, holla! Sweet Maui onion, yeah baby. Has anyone seen Parmesean and Garlic anywhere lately? That is my favorite, and according to the bag they still make it,  but I can't find them.Like this place. Will be back.
Primanti Bros=Local dining icons deserve their own criteria for recognition.  That said, adding sliced tomato, coleslaw and a pile of fries to a deli sandwich defines the Primanti as a Pittsburgh-area institution.  Their cheesesteaks will never threaten the best of Philly's, nor will their pastrami or corned beef be mistaken for New York deli; this only serves to make the Primanti style unique.  I find their meats to be generally good, and reasonably generous.  Tomato on a corned beef sandwich can only be regarded as an acquired taste.  Personally, I'm not a fan of loading a sandwich with fries, but again, this is a matter of preference.  The assembled work is a massive sandwich which invites a machismo-driven, face-first dive into its mismatched imperfection.  After the second or third surfacing-for-air, the conclusion I've always had was of an enjoyable adventure.  Prices are downright cheap.
The Original Sunrise Cafe=The gf and I continue to hit OSC on the weekends before or after our work out at the neighboring Las Vegas Athletic Club.Since my last review, the service continues to excel, the food is above average and overall, we enjoy the experience.  Slight ding - seems like the hash brown servings ( and they make very good hash browns ) are shrinking.I continue to order Jacobs  Slammin' Platter ( two eggs, slice of Canadian ham, bacon, sausage, 4-5 dollar pancakes, hash browns and bread with no charge option of a bagel ) three out of four visits.  The gf orders her egg white veggie omelet EVERY TIME.  Her dings - occasionally they put onions in the omelet even though she orders without.  She prefers a mixed fruit option instead of their banana slice only option.We will continue to visit OSC.attached pic of the slamming platterA friend recommended the Cafe as being one of the best places to have breakfast and I decided to check it out and see if he was correct.  Yes, he was!The place was very busy when I got here about 10 AM on a Tuesday morning.  The hostess asked me if I wanted a table and I asked if they had a counter.  They do and she took me there immediately.  The counter area was relatively empty.  From where I sat, it  looked like the place was once a pizza joint because of the oven along the wall there.Regardless, I was given a menu and brought a mug of coffee very quickly.  I then checked out the pancake/waffle section but they all seemed like they'd be larger breakfasts that I wanted to get.I settled on the Brooklyn Benedict which consists of two basted eggs on an open faced bagel with turkey cubes, spinach, and melted Swiss cheese all topped with Hollandaise.  It was excellent!  You are given a choice of bagel and I opted for the sesame bagel.  The combination of flavors--the turkey, Swiss cheese, and spinach--was wonderful!  The bene also came with potatoes.  I could have had fruit but why spoil a good breakfast?Coffee was refilled often and I was asked if I wanted a cup to go at no charge.  The staff was very accommodating and service was top notch.I wouldn't hesitate to return for breakfast here.  It is very good and they have a large variety of breakfast dishes.The OG. This place is your classic diner spot located in a strip mall. Sadly this is the norm in Vegas, but it doesn't take away from the fact that this place is actually a great option for breakfast and brunch.I highly recommend the snowcaps. Bagels cut into small pieces, pan fried in butter and topped with powdered sugar. These little sugar bombs will definitely shattered any diet plan you had going for you, so I would share these with your brunching buddy. Trust me, they give you plenty. The omelets and benedict's here are very good and satisfying, no small portions at the Sunrise, but my favorite is the Fiesta Benedict. An open-faced bagel with jalapeno bacon, pepper jack cheese, two eggs and a spicy hollandaise sauce, this meal is amazing and really has a great kick of heat. The hollandaise sauce is rich and creamy and the eggs are cooked to that perfect point of soft/medium yolk. I would avoid Sunday mornings and come right around 12:30pm, right as the crowds start to disband and there's no wait for a seat. Brunch proper my friends.Absolutely love this place. The interior may throw you off a bit as it is religious, but you can tell they put their heart in their food. My first impression was it was sort of a diner setting with (delicious) diner food, but respectfully, I'll call it a café.I came around 10am on a Saturday and the place was packed, both bar and tables. However, the wait was fairly short, which is appreciated. I ordered the eggs benedict over a sesame bagel. The hollandaise sauce is on the thin side and not super acidic (woohoo!). The hash browns are thinly cut, crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside. Their sausage pancake wrap is pretty bomb too. It is both savory and sweet so if you're in the mood for sausage, yet want the sweetness of maple syrup, I'd recommend this.Service is quick, efficient, and a GREAT place for breakfast!
Thai Style Noodle House=5 stars for hole-in-the-wall Thai - great food, bargain prices, basic atmosphere...often that's just what I'm looking for as a foodie.I've tried a number of Thai places in Vegas and this is the best by far.  Thai Style Noodle House could hold it's own in the Bay area...and that's saying something!As any good Thai restaurant should - TSNH brings the heat so aficionados can rest assured they will get the goods.  Thai newbies - I wouldn't order above a 5 (they do 1-10 on the heat scale).This will be one of my go-to spots in Vegas from now on!Thanks to Misti Y's review tipping me off to the vegan-friendliness of this place, I have expanded my realm of Las Vegas Thai food! Important note: do no use google maps to find this place, because you will end up at a XXX bookstore.  Which is cool if you need some porn to read over lunch, I guess, but annoying if you're just hungry.  The map shown here is correct (why didn't I just trust Yelp??) - it's two doors down from Veggie Delight.So, yes, they are very accommodating with the vegetarian/vegan requests and happy to oblige.  I went at lunch, but ordered off the dinner menu.  Now, this may have been a mistake simply because they have an awesome lunch special! You can choose an appetizer (fried tofu, soup, or spring roll, I believe - the fried tofu looked awesome!) and one entree (~$5.45) or two (~$7.25).  That's a lot of food for cheap!We shared a papaya salad, green curry with tofu and vegetables, and chili basil fried rice with tofu and veg.  We ordered everything a 7 out of 10 spicy, and it was perfect (I do like pretty spicy food!).  First, let me give these folks some love for NOT putting the much-maligned baby corn in any of our food.  The mere appearance of those mutants is always a buzzkill when I'm about to dig into a dish.  Second, the portions were very generous.  I'm a hearty eater as is my friend, and we had enough leftovers for at least one of us to stuff ourselves again.  Third, everything was very tasty.  Maybe not the best I've ever had, but delicious enough for me to eat til I hurt.  Four, the prices! Cheeeeeaaaaaaaap! $6.95 for a huge entree? yes please!The ambiance was nil, but the service was friendly and fast, and I don't got to a tiny Thai place for lunch because of the ambiance.  This place is definitely going in the rotation, and next time hopefully I won't forget to order brown rice!I crave Tom Yum Soup every time I get sick... and so I went out in my quest to find it. Not only did I discover a new hole in a wall place, but I have to say is my new favorite place for this particular soup.The location is a hit and miss.. You can barely read anything that says Thai Restaurant, but instead look for Noodle House... you'll have a better chance in finding it. Even parking was bizarre to me... you can park in the back alley, but I prefer somewhat of a parking lot... so I parked a few blocks down and walked over.The place itself is tiny.. nothing fancy, maybe a bit run down, but they had a flat screen to watch some T.V. and posted up new items specials on the wall to read. I ordered their Thai Style Tom Yum House Soup ($6.50) which had slices of fish cake, fish balls, ground and slice pork, shrimp and chose flat noodles which I love!!! Something about the thin fat noodles that makes it so much more enjoyable.. Absolutely loved this combination. I also requested to add extra sliced garlic... and even though the server looked at me like whoa are you serious... I told her I was sick and needed the extra garlic to help me get well. Then she understood and added it on. She even sprinkled fried bits of garlic on top to finish it off. How sweeeeet!!!When the soup came... boy was it in a huge bowl. I was so delighted and happy to see such a generous portion given to little ol' me. Yes I blinked a few times out of excitement and joy to see this beauty of Tom Yum unfold before my very own eyes... the colors were beautiful and vibrant. Almost like looking through a warm sunset in Laguna Beach... Okay okay enough of day dreaming... but this soup was enticing to just look at and the aroma of sourness and spiciness just flowed all through my senses.. giving me this watery gulp of happiness. One sip and I was in LOooove. I literally said Aaaaaaaaaaaah. *sighed on how good this tasted. I mean the elements of tangy and spicy hit the right notes and everything blended ever so nicely. The pork meat was tender, fish cake and balls were soft and fluffy, and the flat noodles I can't stop raving about. I literally took half of the soup home and ate it twice throughout my day. It was still delicious and the flavor was still consistent to how it tasted at the restaurant. The only thing I would point out.. especially if you love shrimp... I only had one in my entire soup. Maybe it wasn't suppose to be in there... or it only comes with one lol Oh and I ordered some hot tea... which was Jasmine Tea and it was gooooood!!! I mean it almost had a light vanilla hint to it, but right when I was down to my last cup... the kind, attentive server asked if I would like more... and so I finished two tea pots of that delicious tea. I enjoyed sitting there by myself... drinking this tea for the enjoyment of having it. Great stuff....Overall, I will definitely recommend anybody to check this place out.. I was very pleased and felt 100x better after eating there. I even thought about eating there the next day!!! I'm going to be a regular... since this is my new Thai/Chinese restaurant that I can't get enough of. Maybe I'll even see you there :)*11/10/10I actually did eat there the next day LOL (Today) Lily I hope I spelled her name right.. served me again and this time it was for takeout. She recognized me on the spot and said... OOooh you're back!!! I told her I loved the soup and my body wanted more. Ordered the same as yesterday... Tom Yum House Soup... with extra sliced garlic. She even asked me if I wanted some hot tea to go while I wait... that tea was so good so of course I said yes!!! She even asked if I wanted it refilled before I go... how nice is that?!??! I told her I was sick and their soup was the cure for me... She sked me what my name was and before leaving suggest next time to order the original Tom Yum to help my sickness since it's more stronger. Lily wanted to introduce me to the lady chef that made my soup for me... and not me but She wanted to thank me for enjoying the soup she made. I thanked her for making it sooooo good!!! So good I had to come back the next day!! And that never happens... sometimes when you're sick... your body tells you what it needs... and sometimes you have to be your own bf/gf to your soul and feed it. I literally drove myself down there in traffic hours to get that soup. Yes my soul was determined :)  Great service, food, and price. It's a must try!!!*11/15/10Went for lunch and had their Spicy Eggplant and sticky rice w/ mango dessert which completed my meal. Lily, my favorite server... greeted me by name and welcomed me back. She was so attentive and remembered my request of extra garlic and put some fresh garlic slices on the side for me and got me my favorite hot tea in a flash. The Spicy Eggplant was delicious.. it's sauteed with bell pepper, white onion, Thai chili, and basil with the choice of pork, chicken, or beef... I chose chicken which was tender and juicyWe've been frequenting the Thai Style Noodle House's Fort Apache location quite a bit lately, and I wasn't even sure if I had been to their Wynn location yet.  I looked all over for my review of the place confirming whether or not I had been, and lo and behold, I find it in my "Unfinished Reviews" section.  So, here it is...finally.Thai Style Noodle House offers both Chinese and Thai food, but mostly Thai.  Our party of four ordered a few dishes to share so we could sample a bit of everything.* Beef / Pork Jerky "Beef / pork marinated in special Thai herb, dried in one sun and deep fried" ($6.95) - We chose the beef option and the Husband is the real expert on this since he tends to get it a lot.  I found it to be just okay though, it was a bit too dry for me.  (Whereas other places make their variation a bit more moist.)* Grill (Chicken, Pork, or Beef) Salad "Your choice of sliced meat cooked with red and green onions, mint leaves, ground roasted rice, chili, and lime dressing." ($6.95) - We chose the beef option and the Husband loved it.  I thought it was just okay and lacked something - a bit more sauce and zest would have been nice.  Then again, this is something that the Husband has had a lot of.* Roasted Duck Noodle Soup "Noodle with boneless sliced roasted duck and Yao Choy in Thai herb duck broth." ($6.95) - This wasn't my top choice to order, and it was just okay.  There was nothing special about the roast duck at all.* Pad See-eu "Stir fried flat rice noodle and egg, Chinese broccoli in sweet black soy sauce." ($6.75) - This was okay with chicken and greens, although it was a bit flat.* Red Curry "Thai red curry with your choice of chicken, pork, beef mixed with bell pepper, bamboo shoot and basil served over steamed rice." ($6.75) - We chose vegetarian with soft tofu and I'm always a big fan of Thai curries.  They didn't disappoint here - good flavor and spice.  This was the real winner for me and I definitely would be back to try out their other curries.We also had Thai iced teas all around.* Mango with Sweet Sticky Rice ($3.50)* Fried Ice Cream ($3.50) - It had a nice crunchy batter with little ruby-like things in condense milk.Things I do appreciate about Thai Style Noodle House is that there are a lot of vegan and vegetarian choices, and they don't charge for brown rice.  I also like when they offer you a choice on the tofu - soft or fried.Service - it was busy the evening we went and with one waitress, she was kept on her toes.  She was friendly and on the top of her game, but then again, Bobby Y. (a regular) was dining with us.  So I think that may have helped us there.3.5 stars(I'm confident that I would give them a four star if I go back and try out their other curry dishes.  But since I've been having them at their Fort Apache location, I can definitely say their curries are yum!)Small little Thai restaurant in Chinatown! When we arrived right before lunch time on a Sunday, it wasn't too crowded, just one other table. We ordered and by the time our food arrived all the tables were full. I ordered the yen to fo noodles:http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=h4o8e_Xbca2kXQO_vzOqgg&select=KnaYT5QPzf1s79FqVfIg5QFlavor was good and I really liked that they added the fried wonton. I haven't had this soup for years, so it was nice to see it on the menu. And speaking of menu, they had such an extensive menu with lots of Thai dishes that you usually don't see. Everything we ordered was great. So if your in Vegas and your craving Thai food then this place is a great little Thai restaurant. By the time we headed off, there was a line next out the door waiting. After getting Thai food, make sure you also check out the poke place next door!Before I hit my errands, I need some fuel for my mind and body. So what better way to fill my tank up with my favorite Thai restaurant. I actually drove down the street to drop off my clothes to the dry cleaners and next to it was a Thai place to eat, but even that couldn't stop me from driving another three miles to eat where my heart tells me.I was greeted ever so kindly when I walked in and it wasn't surprising that almost every seat was taken. Luckily it was only me, myself, and oh yea I that wanted to dine here this day. The server asked what I wanted to drink, unfortunately they didn't have the Chrysanthemum tea, so I did my usual hot tea, but even that is soothing and delicious... tasted like a light caramel tea, but it's really jasmine tea. I was debating on the Duck Fried Rice, since Lily (server) recommended it when I ate there a couple of months ago. But I wanted some soup for my soul, because today was a very chilly and windy day. I ordered the Chicken Tom Yum Noodle Soup, Flat (fat shoe lace) Noodles, since it just makes it more delicious to me... mild (5) for how spicy I want it and this time I didn't want to torture myself as I usually do ha! and extra diced garlic.. what??!? I love garlic ok it does the body good! The soup came out in zero time and I loved the way it smelled. The steam evaporated in the air in slow motion, made it looks so heavenly fresh and I had to take a snapshot of it against the sun.. it just looked so Food Digest front cover magazine-ish. I sipped the soup broth first, it was like liquid nitrous for my engine.. my eyes lit up and made my facial muscles break a happy smile. I literally said Mmmmm gulping it down... Yea tell me about it... sound good right??!? It tasted so good, my own body melted. It had bits of cilantro, diced green onion, bean sprouts, and TONS of chunky sliced white chicken meat. Loved the flat fat noodles... it was just the right amount to make me a full bear, where I could hibernate right then and there. But all that time I was enjoying my soup, I was also craving their Mango with Sweet Sticky Rice. I ordered that dessert right after and when it came out.. I heard from the table across from me whispering.. that dessert looks so good!! And then all this time, two guys watched me devour my lunch and then this delicious dessert... I heard him say to his friend.. Dayam that girl can eat!!! Dayam right I can!??!! I'm not shy when it comes to eating and definitely will eat to my heart's content, bet your butt I will! So I just smiled at the guys and kept on eating. I'm enjoying my meal, so let it be! The dessert was the icing on the cake... the finishing touches of a great phenomenal meal. The mango was riped and perfect to eat. Every bite of the sticky rice was warm, soft, and soothing. Loved the coconut milk that drizzled down every time I took a slice from it. The ratio between the mango slices and sticky rice was even to every single bite I took. Absolutely loved this dessert. It's my favorite Thai dessert from any other. Their food has been consistent every single time I have gone here and the service is always very attentive and friendly. Refilled my tea without being asked and always came back to see how I'm doing. Loved the fact that after I finished my dessert, the server asked if there was anything else I would like haha I could possibly go for another dessert, but no I'll definitely be hibernating in that restaurant if I did. I always leave so happy and satisfied... No joke. And off I went to do my errands... it was a great day for another great Thai food experience.I really am a Lotus of Siam devotee, but this is food, not religion, so we're allowed open relationships.  If Lotus is my classier and more diverse wife, Thai Style Noodle House is my down-to-Earth and no BS mistress.  There are times when I just want to be taken care of, I don't want frills, just delicious, authentic, straight-up Thai goodness.  Those are the times I go to Thai Style.  She's all content, inexpensive, gives more than receives, and I love her.Everyone loves the noodle soup for a good reason, it's probably the best and cheapest you'll get in Vegas.  But don't forget to try other things, like the ginger snapper or the duck pad kee mao, both yummy!  The squid salad is not as good as Lotus, but it's half the price so there you go.  I'm sure there are things Lotus doesn't do as well as Thai Style.  Oh, am I defending my mistress over my wife?  I'm sorry, sometimes I can't control myself.Well, there's another thing with my mistress.  She surprises me with how thoughtful she can be.  There's a waitress at Thai Style that has an amazing memory.  I've been there three times, and she already has my preferences tattooed into her memory.  Yep, come on in to Thai Style.  She doesn't have to just be mine.One of my favorite Thai places in Vegas, and they fixed my one complaint about the place, they remodeled it so it looks way better!!!!Grilled beef salad, pineapple fried rice, pad se ew with shrimp *shoves face into food*One of my Vegas top 10 for sure!!!!  Don't expect to get the greatest service because you are not paying that much for the food.  But don't get me wrong, everyone is really nice and courteous, just don't expect a sommelier (I googled the spelling of that) to explain their wine list to you.  The place is packed, sometimes you gotta wait a while to get a table, sometimes you will be ignored when you want someone to take your order, sometimes you may feel rushed.  But you know what?  It's still THAT good, and everyone comes back.  Speaking of thai food, can someone invent a somewhat healthier version of Thai Iced Tea?!?  We have invented cellular phones, we send space ships to the moon, but we can't make a healthy Thai Iced Tea???!!!!!!  I was excited earlier, but now I am upset!!I've got a serious addiction to Thai Style Noodle House.  I've been here an embarrassing number of times and I don't think that I will be letting up any time soon.I can't say I would have ever tried this place if it wasn't for Yelp.  It's tucked away from the main road and is just a tiny little space with only a few tables.  And, let's face it, Chinatown isn't exactly vegetarian-friendly.  Luckily I have Yelp to fill me in - not only is this place good but it has a separate vegetarian menu as well! With a ton of items to pick from!! I really enjoy the Panang Curry but I have a spot in my heart for Spicy String Beans.  I don't know why I love it so much and I'm starting to question if they load it with nicotine before they give it to me.  It has a lot of flavor and the veggies are always fresh.  My husband switches between Yellow Curry, Spicy Noodles, and Thai Fried Rice and loves them all.  We've also had the Tom Kha soup and Vegetarian Dumplings and they were great as well.  Don't worry, my non-vegetarian friends, there are plenty of choices for you and everyone I've seen dining at the restaurant seems to enjoy their meals.Things to keep in mind: The place is very small so expect a wait during lunch and dinner rush.  Also, the tables can be a little tight so if you don't like eating close to strangers you may want to come at an off-time.  Finally, and most importantly, they are not joking around with the spice here.  I usually order a "medium" everywhere I go and am fine with it and can usually go spicier.  Here, I get a 3 out of 10.  And there have been a handful of times where it was still too spicy for me.  I say to err on the side of caution- you can always add more chili to your food later.So, vegetarians, rejoice!  There is another restaurant for you to add to your arsenal.  Just make sure to specify "no fish sauce."  While they are usually good about it without needing to say anything, we did have one experience where fish sauce added to our meals.If you ever find yourself in Chinatown looking for a new place to try, get your butt on over to Thai Style.  Just don't be hogging my table during the lunch rush!Small little mom & pop restaurant; if you're going to come here with a big group then you might have to wait. Great place to come after a night of partying & clubbing on the LV strip where you know you're trying to get over a hangover hahaha.. =)Noodles were very tasty & Yummy...5 starsPad keep Mao: Not greasy / oily but yummy 4 starsPad Thai so so yummy & tatsty noodles were awesome 5 starsPapaya Salad yummy & had a spicy kick to it. 4 starsThai Tea: yummy & thirst quenching 4 starsFood: A - (Portions are generous, but to go orders are very small) Don't order to go because the portions that they give in their to go orders are so so much smaller than when you sit down & eat inside the restaurant. -1Service: B-  (can be a bit slow)Decor: A - (interesting giant mural on the wall for you to check out while you eat) =)1/5 for the interior.5/5 for the food.Average: 3 stars. Seems a little unfair because I loved the food that I got here! The law of small numbers sucks and that's math for you.Okay so upon walking in, you can see clearly that it is just a hole in the wall kind of restaurant. I will go as far as saying that if I were to sit down and eat here, it is like eating in the bathroom of a gas station. I'm truly sorry if I just ruined your appetite. Instead, I asked for a to-go order of a papaya salad and a red curry with tofu. The papaya salad was extremely fresh because the vegetables were very nice and crunchy. Love it!!! Similarly, the red curry had just the right amount of viscosity while being flavorful and delicious and full of fresh ingredients. So good that I ate half the container without even realizing it. I plan on coming back for more as I'm now a  huge fan of the food here!Having read the reviews for Thai Style Noodle House I was really downhearted by the results. I found this location on yelp after some grocery shopping. The picture that are posted will tell the short version of this long tale!Thai Style Noodle House is small and can only sit a very limited amount of people. This is not the best place for a party greater than 4-6 people. The table are usually set for two people and if a table with 4 shows they will combine a table for you. They only have two racks of hot sauce  holders which you must share with all the table in the restaurant. My table of two ordered Chicken Pad Thai, Chu Chee Salmon, and Duck Fried Rice. I also had the Thai Style Ice Tea. The place would have received four stars but some error occurred on the waitress side. I placed an order for Thai Style Ice Tea in the beginning when they ask for drinks. She returns with water for my guest and nothing for me. She places our three orders and I start to wait. Once the chicken pad thai and duck fried rice has arrived I informed her about my miss drink. She recalls and bring me the Thai Style Ice Tea. I highly recommend the pad thai because it was delicious and the thai style ice tea. I was a little disappointed in the duck fried rice since it seem to have more pork than duck. We informed the waitress that we have not gotten the Chu Chee Salmon and she informed us it was coming. By the time we finish the pad thai and was almost done with the duck fried rice the Chu Chee Salmon has arrived. I am guess she has forgot about the order until the reminder. As the two star states: "Meh. I've Experienced better."Consistently bomb Thai food is in a tiny hole-in-the-wall spot in Chinatown. When you want solid staple dishes like pad thai, pad see eiu, tom yum soup (best with chicken), or green curry rice (love it with shrimp!), TSNH has you covered. But I think their specialty dishes are even better- especially the panang curry with avocado and salmon (so creamy!) and the pad ped snapper (maybe order a little lower on the spice scale than usual). Portions are generous, prices are low (rarely over $10 unless it's a seafood special), $30 can easily get a couple a takeout feast dinner with leftovers.
Islands Restaurant=Burgers and fries...oh my!   Surf videos.  Wipeouts.  It's always good, consistent, and family-oriented.Burgers:=======My fav burgers are the: Hula (sauteed mushroooms), Hawaiian (pineapple, teriyaki), and the Point Break (Gruyère & bleu cheeses, caramelized bacon & onion relish). About 12 kinds to choose from, all burgers can be made with beef, turkey, or veggie.  Price ~ $10.50, but carb heaven --- fries (all you can eat come with each burger!). Salads/more:==========The salads are large, the nachos are a monster (and great), and I also like the soft tacos with chicken (a lot!).Desserts:=======Kona pie is one of the best things in the world.  Mocha almond fudge ice cream, oreo cookie crust, topped w/chocolate fudge, whipped cream.  C'mon now!  Seriously, just pop in for one of these things (and don't share!).Happy Hour:==========Served 4pm-7pm, Monday-Friday --- with good options!  Chips/salsa ($1, made fresh, thin, and served warm), cheese quesadilla ($2.95), 4 sliders ($3.95), among other items. Drinks featured: drafts ($2.95-$3.95), wines ($3.95), and mixed drinks ($4.25).What's unique about this location?:===========================* service: nice, fun, and responsive* lots of parking, but busy busy lot...making it not as easy as it looks
The Urban Tea Loft=I  have tell you I am just Enchanted every time I go back!Thank You Glynis you are such a Gracious Host!**UPDATED**I went back for lunch today and all I can say is WOW and WOW!!!So Wonderfully Delicious!! I'm home now and want to go back and eat again!This is now my New Favorite place, I want to try everything they have!Have a look at my pics from lunch :) I Got the special=Turkey chowder in a bread bowl, mixed salad and dessert for $10. And Trust that it tasted even better than it looks, I wish it would have never ended!+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++As I was strolling along in downtown chandler enjoying the weather I had stopped at each restaurant to look at the menus they had posted outside hoping to scope out my next lunch spot.I stopped to read the menu here and a friendly girl approached and asked if I would like to be seated, unfortunately I had already ate but went instead to grab and iced tea anyway.I was greeted with a friendly face from behind the bar who offered to whip me up some suga! Sounds good to me.As she whipped, I browsed the wall of tea ,two of the most helpful girls were telling me all I need to know about loose leaf tea and so on.Suga's ready, Jasmine citrus tea with pureed strawberries shaken up with club soda on the rocks and on the house!....I'm in Tea Heaven! Then I'm offered a sample of tea leaves in bag to take home and make myself.I'm gonna have lunch there tomorrow!5 Stars for Amazing customer service and Hospitality and the Most Delicious Food Ever! And I do Believe the Sweetest Owner/Manager I've ever met!A funny thing happened on the way to the bathroom.  We were dining at Latitude 8 with some other yelpers.  I excused myself and headed to the restroom.  It is in a shared hall in the back of the building, so when I entered the hall from the restaurant I was facing a door labeled "Urban Tea Loft."I poked my head in and decided we should pay a visit as we were wrapping up our meal at latitude.What a gem!  We met the owners Eric and Glynis and they were charming!  Service was outstanding and Eric took the time to explain all about the teas - flavors, health benefits, etc.  He also explained how to operate the tea pot which is good because we would have had a mess otherwise.We shared a large pot of jasmine tea.  It was good but a little flowery for my taste.  The strawberry lemonade was excellent.  The atmosphere is both warm and hip.  They have two private rooms as well as outdoor seating.  They offer wine, beer and bar drinks.  I'm not sure how extensive the drink selection is but they looked to have a fairly complete if basic bar selection.All in all an excellent addition to any neighborhood dining area and a great place to come after meals to hang and have a drink.  I'll be back to try the food and update later.Admittedly, I had prepared to hate this place with a passion you only see in the movies.The name just screamed "flax seed and watercress salad".Not that I'm hating, mind you. I'm sure the same people that just had a foodgasm thinking of flax seed and watercress will look right back at me and go "raw fish? chinese-mexican fusion? GROSS". I just realized that's the first time I've ever used the word "fusion" to describe a restaurant. I finally feel like I'm grasping the intricacies of foodie lingo. The next test is to say the word "shi shi" in a sentence with a straight face. When we sat down in the purgatory of warm, earthy tone-laced interior design that was the restaurant, the waiter informed us it was "soul food night". Normally, when some restaurants say it's "blank blank night" that usually mean that's what the special is or that it's a bargain. No, at Urban Tea Loft, "Soul Food Night" means that's all they're serving. We all ordered what we thought would be amusing forays into "Chandler nightlife with a hint of elegance" or some nonsense. After browsing the extensive tea menu, we settled on a pot of Rooibos Chai, iced. The waiter brought out a pot of lukewarm tea and three glasses with ice in them.Kay......I realize, in retrospect, that serving the ice separately was the wiser move, but I remember feeling really confused at first.It'd be like saying "I'd like that on the rocks, please" and the bartender gives you your drink in a martini glass and a shooter full of ice cubes and lets you at it.Actually, that's not "like what happened" at all. That's EXACTLY what they did.In its defense, the tea was magnificent. Fantastic, really. It was spicy, creamy, and smooth. I almost wish we could've afforded to order more of it, but we just had to try the food. Stupid hunger.For 13 dollars I got a meager filet of shake and bake catfish, a cup of watery coleslaw, and a cornbread muffin. And not even the puffy, scrumptious muffins you find in grocery stores.No, that was not to be my fate. The muffin was barely poking out of its holder. I remember being upset that for 13 dollars they couldn't even be bothered to take it OUT OF THE FUCKING PAPER, but I realized that was for the better; the moment I took it out of the paper, the muffin disintegrated into crumbs, and I spent the rest of my meal spooning it up.The coleslaw was soggy. Yes. I said it. Soggy. I know, right? How can something that sits in mayonnaise all day be soggy?I DON'T KNOW EITHER!Perhaps I've been spoiled on British and German cole slaw, but I expect it to have a bit of a crunch to it. It's not boiled cabbage, after all. It's not wrong to expect some life in  your slaw. And not to call a "tea loft" that serves soul food unimaginative, but c'mon, where's the creativity? Where's the apple or pineapple chunks? Usually with such a pretentious atmosphere you get a little "experimentation" with the menu to make it seem "urbanized".Oh well. The catfish, while crunchy and delicious, just wasn't filling. Again, in their defense, most places that serve fish try to gip (sic) you on it.No wonder people stick to Red Lobster. It's corporate and soulless but at least you don't have to hit a drive-thru on the way home.Look, I know we live in a land-locked state, but it's not like you're fishing for the damn thing yourself. I don't see you out there with a harpoon. Don't try to fucking fool me.Misty S got the vegetable plate for 9.75. By far I think the best deal. Sure, it's just a bunch of little trays of sides and is even less filling than the aforementioned meat entree, but you get twice as much of the "New American" feel and flavor.Fun Fact: Having spent my childhood in Europe, I was raised to believe that fish does not count as meat, and I still have a hard time remembering NOT to suggest sushi to my vegetarian friends.So, come for the tea, and stay to pay for the bill. BUT ONLY FOR THE TEA.Anything else and you're just wasting your money.Which can't be that bad. Everyone's doing it these days.Amirite, GMC?As a SF Bay transplant taking another SF Bay transplant out for dinner, there is a certain level of one-ups-manship to our dinner plans. What, you thought the whole "everything with me is a competition" bit was just talk? With both of us coming from the land of non-chains I was desperate to find a venue that was quirky, urban, hip and made me seem a lot cooler than I am. Urban Tea Loft, that's your cue.The yelp reviews swayed me, the charming interior lulled me, the super polite staff put me at ease. The seating was a modern blend of "I'm a couch, no, I'm a booth!" mixed with tables and chairs. Buddy, Jetta R. and I decided to order a pot of Rooibos Chai to start. It was the last smart decision we made.Weekends are "soul food" only. That's cool, I like collard greens. You're allowed to chose your "meat" and one or two sides. Vegetarians can chose three sides. The menu leads you to believe you'll be getting a meal. Don't be fooled. While Jetta R.'s catfish was exquisite and a decent portion size, the sides are served in tiny little cups. My "three meatless sides and we'll call it a vegetarian option" dinner was...not enough. When have you ever seen "soul food" in tiny portions? Doesn't that defy the cuisine? That's like non-fat Indian. See also: Bombay Spice.Everything we tried was delicious, and it's a damn shame the portions are barely large enough for you to figure that out. TL;DR version: Visit this spot to relax, bring your own company or a lap top, and stick to the fare this place is named for - the tea. You won't be disappointed.As a Chandlerite, I've been here several times. Every time has been stellar. My sister and I went for tea and noms last Friday, and we split the Bruschetta and a Caprese tower. My mouth was in rapture! The apple pear green tea was tasty and even better after the second steep. We left stuffed but satisfied.They've really made the space beautiful, and I found myself thinking of reasons to rent out that awesome back room with the rad, artsy chandelier. Maybe for my next birthday.I give this place two enthusiastic thumbs up.
Dakao Sandwiches=Boy I was hungry for lunch! I wanted Vietnamese sandwich and someplace new. So, I called Dakao to see if they had a vegetarian sandwich. Check! I asked if they accept credit card! Check! I asked if there is a minimum! $8! Ouch....all I wanted is one vegetarian sandwich. The gentleman said that he will process the transaction with 1 sandwich for $3. So, I jumped in my bat mobile and off to Dakao I go!!Once I arrived it was all wrapped and ready to go. I did a squeeze test and it felt a little hard. With an open mind, I proceeded back to the office with my Dakao Veggie sandwich. A las! Back in the office and a bite I go! Indeed and which I was afraid of...bread was hard and crispy, I prefer my bread Fresh as in a hint of crisp on the outside, soft and warm in the inside! Although I was disappointed with the not so fresh bread and they didn't have any hoisin or siracha sauce, the inside of the sandwich tasted yummy and fresh. Tofu was sauteed with veggie soy sauce, Cilantro, carrots, daikon and cucumber was organically fresh and crispy. I will give Daikao a chance and next time will request for a fresh bread by expressing my last experience to the gentleman.All of the Vietnamese sandwich shops that my family went to when I was young have long closed, or sold off to people who let their quality decline. So my mom and I ventured to try this place next to her hairdresser after the owner suggested this place. The young cashier speaks Vietnamese and English, so you do not need to fear the language barrier. I saw many people of all different ethnicity enter and order without issues. They are also patient enough if you are like me and get into fights with your family about who gets to pay. There is one table inside the restaurant and two outside. This place is more of a take out venue for a quick grab and go lunch. Although it does not provide places to lounge about, it offers a wide range of excellent Vietnamese options. We ordered five special sandwiches, one meat stuffed bun, a plate of ground pork and mushroom rolled noodles, and a plate of red pork bites. The sandwiches were everything a good banh mi should be; crunchy, savory, sweet, complex, with a bite from the green peppers. The noodles are a favorite since childhood and I recommend getting some Vietnamese sausage to go with them. The steamed meat bun, after reheating, is the perfect breakfast with a cup of strong coffee.It doesn't look like much from the outside... Actually, it doesn't look like much from the inside either. But this poorly decorated, seemingly run-down little shop is home to my 'Holy Grail' banh-mi.There's no seating; unless you count the rickety plastic patio furniture out front. There's a single table and 2 chairs. Don't expect to claim it yourself. Its usually taken by patrons of the nail salon next door or little old Vietnamese grandpas. The meat tastes better here. The veggies fresher. And the bread softer and more delicious than any other banh mi bread I've ever had. As much as I'd prefer to stop at Dakao, I find it an epic struggle to make it during business hours. They close at 8pm during the week and 6pm on the weekends. I generally don't work at 9-5 schedule so I consider those hours a little limited for me. Regardless, when I come I'll order a variety of edibles  and can't forget a refreshing Vietnamese Iced Coffee. If available, I'll stock up on the rolled noodles with pork, sesame balls, and any other good-looking sides they have available.There's also deli case filled with things I cannot actually identify. In my years of patronage, I've never asked nor purchased anything from said case. There are meat looking items and jellied things in there that I've found a little intimidating and downright unappetizing. I suspect the contents to be more popular with the authentic Vietnamese customer.And like many Asian owned establishments on Spring Mt -- cash Only.This is a very unassuming little shop. I have had them bookmarked for some time, but finally got the chance to pick up a little something for lunch. I tried the BBQ pork banh mi. They take credit Visa and Mastercard with a minimum $8 purchase. They advertise that their bread is baked fresh every 45 minutes and you can tell. It's crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. The sandwich is quite large as well, compared to some of the other banh mi places I've been to, the prices are really great as well. Just $3 for every sandwich on their menu. Definitely a great deal, I'll be coming back again soon to get my banh mi fix on.NO TABLESNot long ago, we use to get our haircuts at Ann Salon and it was uniquely convenient to pick up a Dakao sandwich to carry us over to dinner. We would experiment with different selections but we would always resort back to either Dac Biet, Bbq Pork or Grilled Pork. Yu-go loved the pate but It was just too pungent for me.Besides the banh mi, the Vietnamese coffee is Yu-go's favorite. It's equivalent to drinking jet fuel. LoL Dakao also sells prepackaged desserts and cold soft drinks.Unfortunately there is no place to sit and consume the sandwiches on site. Given the ambience, you might be better off taking it back to the office or apartment.
Centro Paninoteca=Thanks Trish for planning tonight's UYE (Unofficial Yelp Event) at Centro Paninoteca, and thanks Casey, Steve, and Jody for taking such great care of our group!What a pleasure to sit outside and enjoy wine and live music (from David "Axis of Ebel" E) and to hang with a good sized group of yelpers!I wasn't feeling 100% so I didn't partake in the appetizers or panini sandwiches but based on the appearance of the plates and delighted expressions from those who did, I'll have to return for sure!I'll update my review at that point... if you didn't make it tonight, it seems that every Wednesday is Wino Wednesday at CP - you can't beat the unpretentious atmosphere and $5 glasses of wine!What a cute little place! I never would've found it without a Yelp UYE (tiny little thing next to Handlebar J's) but glad I did. It's so cozy and truly unpretentious in spite of a pretty good wine selection! A highlight was the turkey and green chile pannini (I sorta built my own... a twist on the ham offering which they graciously obliged.) and the sweet potato chips were a nice compliment.Cute Cute Cute! I really like this little place! I'm a big fan of wine bars that are small and unpretentious. I attended the UYE organized by Trish and I was so happy I did! For dinner, I ordered the Caprese Panini that boasted a LARGE tomato, basil, and mozzarella. I asked to add prosciutto and they were very happy to oblige. Each and every person that I spoke to on the staff was friendly and conversational. I really like that. I will certainly visit Centro again! I would love to try some of their other paninis!4.5: The only thing keeping this place from 5 stars is the location. The view from the patio is pretty much parking lot and the backs of buildings. But, holy cow! The wine selection is VERY good. The staff are friendly and helpful and make excellent suggestions (thanks for the zinfandel tip! YUMMM). The prices are fair too!And, as much as I love green chile, my new fave is the fig and gorgonzola app. Still a pannini... I didn't know blue cheese could get that creamy when it melted!Man, I wish this place was closer... I'll still be back!
Panera Bread=WOW. What a disaster today was!First off, you walk in, and it is overwhelmingly warm.We ordered, I had the asiago roast beef, with tomato soup, and a baguette.My aunt had a turkey sandwich, but she asked them told hold the onion, and instead of the chipotle mayo, if they could substitute it for regular mayo,...(she doesn't do spicy very well), and ordered a bag of chips with her lunch.We find a place to sit, and our plates come.The chips and the baguette weren't on the right plate, but okay. I guess that's an easy switch.But you could clearly see the huge slices of red onion, and the huge glob of chipotle mayo on my aunt's sandwich. She takes it up to the counter to have it remade.I'm sitting with my daughter, and before I take a bite out of my sandwich, I see a stand of plastic wrap hanging out of it. It is VERY noticeable, and I am beginning to wonder how no one saw it....I then take my plate up to be remade.The manager informed me that it was "from the cheese".Girlfriend, I do not care where it is from. I don't want it in my sandwich.She came by with our new plates afterwards, and offered us a free cookie, but we declined.The food was Ok. The soup was the savior of it all for me.Yikes.WHERE'S THE BEEF?   It amazes me how restaurants could mess up such a simple sandwich like a BLT. A BLT is not exactly a culinary work of art. It is beacon, lettuce, and tomatoes with mayonnaise on bread. Yet, some restaurants mess it up. When I set eyes on my Panera Bread BLT, or more like LT; I was asking the exact question that the old lady asked in the 80s Wendy's commercial "Where's the beef?" In this case the beef was beacon. What I saw was a few pieces of ordinary beacon with lettuce and tomato on bread.  The bread was comparable to Wonder bread which is ironic considering that this is Panera Bread. I was unimpressed that there was not a choice of bread and that it was untoasted. The potato chips that I picked as the side was actually better than the sandwich.    This is my second time at this Panera Bread. A few weeks ago, I dined here with Shirley. B. The roasted turkey & avocados BLT that I ordered then was a tasty sandwich. And I know that Shirley liked her soup. But that doesn't make up for the atrocity of a sandwich that I had tonight and for the record, a good amount of it was leftover bread.  The restaurant itself, which is in the Paseo Verde Parkway side of The District, is a clean and attractive dining environment. The noise level is average with some rock playing in the background. And there is sufficient seating and lighting. Panera Bread is on the dining level between fast-food and casual dining. You step in line then order off the menu board. After paying, you bring a number to a table. They bring you the food, but you serve your beverage. When your done they bus the table.  A BLT gives me an impression of a restaurant. And when a BLT is so short of the beacon that it becomes a LT it is leaves me with a poor impression.   I never say never. I could return to Panera Bread. Maybe their speciality is bagel sandwiches. Who knows! If I cross that bridge and return to Panera Bread, and leave satisfied with a different sandwich, I can always update my review with a reference to this one. After tonight's sandwich, color me unsatisfied.Panera has been a consistent chain in my life.  This location in the District has a constant stream of customers.  They do a good job of keeping tables clean and cleared for the next guest.  The service has been polite and helpful.  They also make it easy to call in or order from the app.  The Panera menu updates just like many other chains.  Pick two is still available for your choice of soup, salad or sandwich.  The menu boards show the calories for each size item.  That is always helpful! I have always enjoyed their various salads.  Recently I tried the BBQ chicken salad.  Yum! The sauce has a great smokey flavor.  There is plenty of grilled chicken with corn and fried onions.  It's surely a winner! If you sign up for the free Panera card, you get a free treat in your birthday.  During the year they will also load coupons or specials.  Thanks Panera!This is a great spot to pick up lunch. A newer location opened up closer to my home but I just feel comfy and familiar at this PB. Being a bakery and cafe, they offer lunch and breakfast. They have some tasty options when it comes to breakfast you can choose from bagels, pastries, souffles, breakfast sandwiches and fresh baked bread. It wouldn't be breakfast if coffee wasn't offered so they do have a nice variety of options for that too. The lunch menu is my favorite. I love that they introduce new salads & sandwiches, but also love that they bring back old seasonal favorites. The "You Pick 2" option is great. I love that I can switch it up between soup, salad, and sandwiches. I have eaten inside this location a couple times, but usually just phone my order in and pick it up. They have a program called "My Panera" that you should look into if you plan on eating here more then once. You can earn free food and other cool stuff. I am able to log in online and check the status of my rewards. Please note that currently if you have a freebie and don't use it for 60 days that it will expire. This last visit I saw a sign that they offer catering. I never thought of PB for catering needs, but I bet it is a big hit at most offices. My absolute favorite sandwich from PB is the "Roasted Turkey Artichoke Panini"and it really hit the spot last night it is so good! I get the "Broccoli Cheddar Soup" and love dipping my panini into it. Such a nice combo and a comforting meal no matter what time of year it is. I'm glad we have PB!This location is in a small strip mall with other popular places and the parking lot can be packed. Patience is key!I think of Panera Bread as comfort food for me.  The food here reminds me of food you'd get at a Bed & Breakfast.  Or, food your neighbor's cousin's sister's mom use to make when you were a kid.  The menu is basically sandwiches, soups, and salads. But there's enough on the menu to satisfy almost everyone.  One thing about Panera Bread is that their food is always fresh and price is even better.  You can even getaway with a sandwich and soup for less than $10.  My order is usually the same...turkey something.  Either I'm getting a turkey in a panini or their smoked turkey sandwich.  Also don't be surprised if I get my turkey with extra meat.  The restaurant itself, along with their service, is always right on.  I tend to frequent Panera Breads that are located inside shopping malls, which tend to be smaller. So you can imagine the shock when I walk into a freestanding or strip mall PB.  I had a great time on my last visit, more of those great times to come.

Company American Bistro=Yay, celebrities love new american cuisine as much as we do! Forget about the ridiculosity of the investors (Nick Lachey & Nicky Hilton & Wilmer Valderrama!) - the food here is actually excellent.  It's super trendy & you will be surrounded by people who think The Hills is a documentary but you will feel better after you have some complimentary warm pretzels, a few bottles of Vosse water, some freshly fried felafel, a fancied up Big Mac & some chicken and waffles. 5 stars is probably a little too much, but it was a pleasant surprise and you get to go into LAX for free, which is still paying too much, but it's very easy to make a night out of coming here, which I can appreciate.
San Francisco Shrimp Bar and Deli=I always make a point to stop by Shrimp Bar & Deli at the Golden Gate for a shrimp cocktail (or two) and a French dip sandwich before we leave Vegas. Plus, I'm usually broke by then and a $10 meal is much needed. Do: Order either the Big Shimp Cocktail or a couple of the regular ones.Don't: Order the combo one with krab - it's no good.Do: Order a French Dip or the Gold Rush sandwich.Don't: Order the Gold Rush with the au jus already on it, get it on the side.Do: Listen politely to the piano player.Don't: Try and play the piano. The folks at the counter get mighty upset.Thumbs Up:-Cheap!-Live entertainment!-Tasty!Thumbs Down:-Long lines and sometimes no seating.-A greasy French dip isn't the best thing to have directly before a four hour drive home.
K Sushi Bar & Grill=I have never left a sushi bar so angry and exasperated in my life!Koi has more rules than a elementary school cafeteria at lunchtime!They don't let you go outside for ANYTHING once food is on your table... not until you pay the check. They tack on a 15-18% gratuity even if the service is sub-par, and normally at places where gratuity is automatically tacked on to the bill it is. I was included in a party of 15 for my friend's birthday party and part of the desire to give our patronage to Koi was the All-U-Can-Eat Sushi (which a portion of this party has indulged in on a previous visit). When we were seated the waitress told us that a portion of our party couldn't order the All-U-Can-Eat Sushi, it had to be all 15 of us or none of us. We were contemplating just getting up and leaving, and we should have. I had a feeling this wasn't going to end well and it didn't. The birthday girl decided to stay and we ordered. Then we were informed that they wouldn't accept certain coupons from the Arrowhead Koi... this is like a disenfranchised franchise. The owner seemed to be creating his own rules. It didn't even say Arrowhead on the coupon... it just looked like one they didn't take... according to the waitress. The service was slow... very slow and we waited to get drink refills. Then the waitress came back to tell the birthday girl that someone took her order... so she had to wait for it to be remade. All the sushi rolls looked the same. There was no artistic value to the food. I couldn't tell the spicy tuna tempura apart from the tempura calamari roll, and the taste reflected sameness. Quite disappointing since sushi is an art form when done correctly (or just done better).The waitress left dishes and empty glasses on our table for the entirety of the meal, and when she did finally clear things away she dropped dirty soy sauce chop sticks right on the birthday girls lap. Yes there was an apology on the part of the waitress, but it shouldn't have happened.According to the friends that have come to Koi before they raised their prices... and they don't take American Express and they don't have a Happy Hour - the large beers were $6 - at Yen I could get the same for $3. We ALL decided that we are not going to Koi ever again, tonight they just lost 15 customers. Pretty pathetic.
Mastro's City Hall Steakhouse=Ladies if you're looking for a sugar daddy, you're bound to find him at this Scottsdale steakhouse. While there's no denying that the steaks are tops. I'm more of a fan of the bar atmosphere. My friend and I cruised into the see-and-be-seen restaurant for a drink recently and within in a matter of minutes, we were approached by a group of  sharply-dressed guys in their late 40s. We politely declined their invitation for dinner and drinks, but their next target group -- three buxom blondes who appeared to be in their early 20s -- took them up on the offer. If you're planning to come for simply cocktails, be sure to bring some extra cash because drinks are pricey. And if you order a martini, try the fruity flirtini, it's my favorite.The steak was so good I started having heart palpitations.  Oh my god, I don't even know where to begin.  The dining room is beautiful.  The service was flawless.  And the food was out of this world.  Really tremendous.  The ahi tuna tartar?  Amazing.  The bone-in-fillet? Amazing.  Lobster mashed potatoes?  Are you kidding me?  Ridiculous.  By far, the best steak I have ever had.  Better than Flemings, Capital Grill, Morton's, Ruth Chris, Durant's, El Chorro...  Seriously.  You are looking at about $100/head including drinks (not wine) and it is worth every penny.  I'm going to go pass out now.Ok so us 5 hot chix got all dolled up for dinner at City Hall it was about 7 when we arrived on Saturday. The service was top notch from the get go starting with the valet. We were seated by a pleasant hostess in the large main room. Our waiter was an entertaining gentleman, that's one huge plus I have to say about Mastro's is they "usually" have seasoned wait staff they really know their product.They brought us the great basket of warm breads, we ordered bottled water for all and a bottle of some 06 Sauv Blanc that was mighty tasty. It was impossible to have an empty glass this night!Everyone had fillet's but me of course, I mainly had apps, side's, wine and desert ;) I did try the seared ahi tuna it was ok I wasn't too impressed with it though. Beefsteak tomato & mozz (see pics) very yummy! The creamed corn, sauteed asparagus and mash were all very good!! I couldn't talk anyone into the lobster mash or any caviar boohoo me. =(  Everyone loved their meal!!My g/f was coming back from the bathroom and missed a step or something somehow she lost her shoe but there was a busser or someone right behind her he picked it up for her and even put it back on for her! Now that is what I call 5 Star Service!!We had creme brle they served it with various fresh berries and a huge bowl of their fresh made whip cream yum-gasm's were had all around. While Mastro's is not my top choice since I am not a "Steakhouse kinda girl" it was all good stuff. They always play some  Michael Bubl and who doesn't just love him!?! It was about 3 bills total and we went home with doggy bags and full tummy's.P.S.  I had their sweet potato fries they were good but I like the ones at Fez better....just sayin. (O_o)To celebrate our anniversary, the boyfriend and I ventured out to Mastro's City Hall for dinner.  Do not let the businesslike exterior fool you...this is a beautiful, fine dining restaurant.  Upon entering the restaurant, we were greeted by the hostess and escorted to our table.  Didn't have a chance to check out the patio or bar, but I will say the dining room is gorgeous.  Low, but not dark, lighting.  Music piped in from the piano in the lounge, I believe??  Tables that seem packed in the room but have plenty of room between to allow you to move around.  We were seated at a two top, which I usually do not like, especially when there are fours available.  I understand why restaurants do this, but the tables are usually so small that we run out of room quickly.  This table, however, had more than enough space.  As the hostess seated us, she asked us what color napkin we'd prefer, black or white.  Never experienced that before.  I'm sure there is some sort of fancy-schmancy etiquette rule about which napkin is better, but we aren't really fancy-schmancy people.  We stuck with the white napkins that were already on the table.  Next we were given menus and greeted by the server who asked about a drink order.  I asked for water while I perused the wine list and the bf had a jack and coke.  What the waiter returned with was a water and a glass of jack (nearly full) and a bottle of coke.  A jack with a splash of coke just like he likes them.  The bf was happy.  Let me cover the service aspect of our evening.  Our server was awesome.  Very professional, educated and willing to educate us first timers on the menu and specials.  He made an excellent wine recommendation and helped us choose the apps for our seafood tower.  Additionally, it was also election night and we debated even going out as opposed to staying in and watching the returns.  But, the server kept us updated with results on a regular basis from the bar tv.  Yay!  Back up staff was generally good about filling water, clearing tables, etc.  But sometimes it felt like we were being rushed.  Staff approached the table to see if we were finished when we were obviously still eating.  Like actually chewing with food still on the plate.  Nothing too major, but I would expect better here.Ok, food...We had the seafood tower (shrimp, oysters, lobster), filets, asparagus and....wait for it, wait for it....the lobster mashed potatoes!  The seafood tower made a dramatic entrance complete with dry ice.  Again the server was very accommodating and helpful.  He made great recommendations and basically was able to create this dish as we wanted it.  Everything was delicious and the creamy mustard sauce was phenomenal.  I would choose that over cocktail sauce anytime.  I had the petite filet and the bf had the regular.  Both were cooked perfectly and melted in our mouths.  Also, the bf's steak seemed much larger than 12 oz.  Asparagus was bright green, firm but tender.  If you read the reviews here, people are raving about the potatoes.  With good reason...they are delectable.  Ridiculously good.  Seriously, my mouth is watering right now.  Do not fret if you don't see them on the menu.  They are a special item that they almost always have.  We paired a bottle of Cab with our entree which was very nice as well.  After dinner was cleared, we gladly boxed up our leftover mashers (seriously it could serve 4 easily).  I thought we were ready to go, but out came a slice of delicious chocolate cake as a treat for our anniversary.  We didn't order this, they just brought it out.  Regardless of what kind of restaurant you are at, this is always a nice touch.  Even with our best efforts there was no way we were going to finish the cake so after a few bites that went in a box as well.  In spite of the earlier rushed feeling, once we finished our meal we were left alone to finish our drinks.  This was easily one of the best meals I've ever had.  It is spendy, so we won't be back often.  But we will be back again and be recommending it to all our friends.  ps...the bf paid so I can't really complain, but those take home boxes??  They made it home, but I've never seen them again. :)The Beautiful Carin and I ventured out for steak a couple of nights ago and ended up walking over to Drinkwater's.We hadn't been there for several months, but I love the fact that it's walking distance (so I can have a couple of single malts and not have to worry about the drive home).We sat out on the patio and the fire was going and the weather was cool, but not cold, really pleasant (although I would like for things to get a touch warmer...but, that's a quibble). The ambiance is nice both inside the restaurant and out on the patio (nice fireplace!).We started with scotch and martini's and they do pour a nice drink! I was pleasantly buzzing by the time we got our salads. The steaks were very good, and we always stick to the simple steak and salad formula when we go to Drinkwater's (BTW, is there really any other cut besides a bone in Rib-eye? Honestly, I was born and raised on a cattle ranch and there just isn't a better cut for steak, IMHO:).The service was very good, as always, and the drinks, salads, steaks and sides arrived hot (or cold as necessary), and on time.Drinkwater's ( I know, it's Mastro's now, but old habits are hard to break) is good place for a simple steak and salad. The do it very well. A little on the expensive side (approx. $250 for the 2 of us), and as always, for that kind of dough, I need to be thinking "foodgasm" for 4-5 stars, but a very credible steakhouse.Three words... bone-in-filet or is that really two? I'll leave it to the more talented wordsmiths to do the math. Last Friday I had one of the better filets of my life. Cooked to medium-rare perfection you can't really get a better steak. Also watch out.. their pretzel bread is insanely addictive, just say no (actually say yes, eat a couple, then have them take the rest away). I'm a steak purist and it's worth noting they do add some butter to the steaks after they're cooked, if you're like me just ask to opt out. Service was good, but know the ambiance is a little old school. The musical act in lounge reminded me of that two person band in the movie Swingers... cheesy, but you don't really hear it in the main dining room.I'll start off by saying that the meal itself was 5 star all the way. I mean hello!?! Butter poached, bone in Filet Mignon!?!  Need I say more?Indeed...Based on the previous few experiences I've had at City Hall I would have happily given both the experience and the food 5 stars. This time however I cannot, but I can give 4. We had a 8:00(pm) reservation on a considerably busy night. Upon arrival, we were sat immediately at a booth in the bar. Normally, this wouldn't bother me at all except that when the reservation was taken, we specifically requested the dining room. We were looking for a  level of ambiance that is difficult to obtain surrounded by fairly raucous bar goers on a Friday night. Clearly we were squeezed in at the last minute. There was no room for us in the dining area so we say screw it, we'll just eat some amazing food, drink way too much and join the 'party' in the bar area. We're not pretentious assholes, we're flexible, we know how to get the fuck dowwwwn, no big deal right...wrong. While being seated I notice the rather close proximity of the patio door. I take my coat off and within minutes I'm frozen. I know what you're thinking...'well, maybe you shouldn't have been dressed like a $3 hooker Kristi', but you would be wrong. I pulled out all the stops for this one. Needless to say, we notified the server and were promptly moved to another booth. Annoying, but certainly not night altering. Our server seemed a bit distracted and it all felt a bit rushed at first but  seemed to mellow out when we made it clear that we were indeed camping out for the next 3 hours. There is not much that can be said about the food other than 'it's amazing'. I had a perfectly mixed dry Kettle martini to start of with. (Must get buzz going before food consumption) We shared a bottle of Cab with our meals which consisted of the Petite Filet, (MR) the NY Strip, (R) the out of this world Lobster Mashed Potatoes,  and steamed asparagus. Perfection! This is what a steak should taste like. The Lobster Mashed was divine and trust me, I don't throw the word 'divine' around EVER. We shared the Creme Brulee for dessert as well as a chocolate martini. I was sufficiently liquored up at this point not to mention fat and happy. Don't ask me what happened after dessert because I don't remember. There was some champagne involved, maybe a creepy cab driver....the details are fuzzy. All I know there was enough food left over to make a delicious breakfast of steak and eggs in the morning, which paired well with the Advil, Alka-Seltzer and gray face of death I was wearing. Whoo-Haa Mastro's! I am no match for your sexiness. U.N.C.L.E.Yes, it's true that I would have been happy eating anywhere on the night of my birthday while getting wined and dined by my bf, but it just so happened that I was taken to City Hall, so it was a delightfully tasty night!The minute I stepped into City Hall, it felt like I had left Old Town Scottsdale and entered a city steakhouse in a Chicago or SF. It was cozy, dark and smelled absolutely delectable. We began the night with some cocktails at the bar. I ordered a delicious fruity beverage and enjoyed it as as the evening air blew through the open doors of the patio. Following our cocktails, we were seated in the dining room and the birthday feast began! We enjoyed delicious pretzel bread, crunchy Cesar salad, filet, macaroni and cheese and Lobster mashed potatoes. That's right. Lobster mashed potatoes! Every bite was bliss and I ate until I couldn't psychically take another bite. The mac and cheese has got to have about five different cheeses in it and each bite is filled with gooey cheese that melts in the mouth. The Lobster mashed potatoes are just as delicious as they sound and are filled with butter garlic and plenty of Lobster meat. The portions are hefty and we luckily had leftovers to enjoy tonight! The food is delicious, the atmosphere is cozy and the staff is friendly and helpful. I'm not sure there's much more than I can add, but if you're in the mood for delicious steak and complimentary sides, I suggest keeping a Mastro's in mind.Looking for an incredible steakhouse in AZ and not concerned about the damage you'll do to your wallet?  City Hall is the way to go!I've been to City Hall more than a handful of times through the years as well as it's sister concepts: Ocean Club and Mastro's in North Scottsdale.  You cannot go wrong with any of them.  I just happen to prefer City Hall because of the convenient location to where I live and work!I've been to meet a friend or two for happy hour at the bar, I've been for a bachelorette party, and I often go for celebratory date nights with my husband... as we did on this past Wednesday evening to celebrate my birthday!  If you're up for a bit of a scene, some live music and great people watching, I highly recommend sitting in the bar.Let me reiterate: this is a high end steakhouse.  Expect to valet your car and bring cash for the bathroom attendant as well.  But you get what you pay for.  Service is top notch and the food is the best quality I've found in the state and beyond.Starting with drinks, there are plenty to choose from.  I am a dirty martini girl and they make a mean one here.  It's actually two for the price of one, since they bring you the entire shaker and refill it when necessary.  Awesome wine list as well.In addition to the complimentary bread bowl which comes with my favorite pretzel rolls in town, my fave appetizers are their oysters, calamari, and seafood tower if you're with a group.Next up, I am a huge proponent of the Mastro's House Salad.  Tip: it's large, so my recommendation is to share it with someone.  If not, you could easily make a meal of the salad, the bread bowl, and a drink!And for the main course, if you're going with steak, go for the Bone-In Ribeye, and if you're more in the mood for fish, I say Chilean Seabass all the way... you can split either of these also.  Both arrive on Mastro's signature hot plates, and they've always been cooked and seasoned to perfection.  Pair 'em with your favorite sides - you really can't go wrong here although my top picks would be sweet potato fries, creamed spinach, steamed broccoli, and grilled asparagus.  I've never heard anyone complain about the signature lobster mashed potatoes either.By now, you're definitely full, but keep drinking or hanging out digesting until you make room for dessert.  Don't miss the Mastro's Signature Warm Butter Cake.  Thank me later!  You can't go wrong with the Key Lime Pie or Cheesecake either, but again, that butter cake is to die for!On my recent birthday visit, I enjoyed many of the items mentioned above except for the dirty martini and oysters... I'm prego at the moment, so sadly, I had to pass on both.  But after this baby comes, I can't wait to go back for another incredible meal.  Who wants to join me?!It kills me to give such a low rating to a Mastro's Steakhouse...I've been to most of the Mastro's around the country, and the food at the Scottsdale location does not disappoint. The factor that DID disappoint was their hostess staff. Here's a quick summery of what occured:I called early in the day to make reservations, was informed that 9:30pm was the earliest for that evening. No problem, it was a last minute reservation, I could understand. We show up around 8:45 to try and grab drinks at the bar (was overcrowded so decided against that), I checked in with the hostess just to inform her that we were there. She rudely snapped at me saying that they were behind, and that they might be caught up by my reservation time. Again, no problem, I wasn't expecting to be seated early. We waited patiently in the front lobby, along with other groups of guests...9:30 came and went....10:00 came and went. At 10:15pm, I begin to notice that there were groups who arrived after us who were being seated. I approach the hostess and ask when we might be able to get our 9:30 reservation, and she starts yelling saying that they were busy. By 10:30, we are the only people left standing in the lobby. So I again ask if we were going to be seated, especially since everyone who arrived after us was already seated at this point. She starts yelling, again, saying that it is impossible that they would seat anyone who arrived after us. I turned around and pointed out that there was no one left in the lobby...except us...where did they all go if they weren't seated? Surely we were not the last people to arrive on a Saturday night...since we arrived 1hr 45min ago. She proceeded to rudely call another hostess over and said "fine, seat them," and rolls her eyes at me. Thanks Alexis...for a night I will never forget. Low and behold, once we were seated, there were plenty of empty tables. Anyways, that was the end of the horrible part of the evening. Many thanks to our wonderful server, Bobby, who picked up on the vibe that we were upset and really made our dining experience enjoyable. Gratitude to the GM as well, who personally came to apologize for the long wait. Those two individuals were the reason I gave this Mastro's 3-stars...one star for each of them and one for the ever-delicious food. (Recommendations: Shrimp cocktail appetizer, bone-in ribeye, butter cake desert)I really hope that the hostess staff was just having a bad day and that they don't normally treat their patrons like the way they did that evening. Will I eat at a Mastro's again? You bet...Will I ever eat at the Mastro's in Scottsdale? Never againThis was the 2nd Mastro's I've been to in the city.  My 1st experience was with their Pinnacle Peak location.  I was curious to see if the quality of the food and experience would hold up.....and yes it did!We joined a group of friends here for dinner and they accommodated 10 of us near the bar area.  We were able to enjoy the live music throughout dinner.  Of course, I had to order my fav dishes here:Wedge SaladBone-In FiletGorgonzola Mac 'n CheeseThe food was phenomenal, just like the other location.  The Wedge Salad is fresh and crisp....very refreshing.  The Bone-In Filet is simply out of this world....the Bone just adds so much flavor to it....yum!  The Gorgonzola Mac 'n Cheese is addicting and is worth the nuclear explosion of calories....I just can't say no to ordering it.The service is outstanding and we were well taken care of.  Our party of 10 felt like we were at home because we were so comfortable and didn't have to worry about anything all night.  We put away 5 bottles of Wine and the server ensured that we didn't have an empty glass until we were ready.Tip: The food prices are not cheap here...if you can't fade a large dinner bill, I don't recommend coming here.Can't wait for the next time!Return Factor - 100%I surrender to the Carnivore Food Gods!Made sure I was not late for my reservation. Got there and suddenly felt under attired! Asked the valet what he thought and he said "oh! very casual...no need to worry..." And so begins my story.Decided to dine at the bar (my favorite place most of the time) rather than at a table already reserved for us. Dining at the bar in itself was a great decision. Ambiance? outdoor fire place for the wintery days and the patio dining. Main Dining Room sexy and well laid out (for those of you from Hawaii, the dining room is similar to Morton's and how Morton's is laid out) and the bar is huge! a rectangle surrounding the bar with at least 40 seats and high tops surrounding the bar area (nice touch). Regardless of where you sit; the table is set for a perfect 5 star meal!  Mastro's house salad- iceberg lettuce and freshly chopped tomatoes with shrimp floating around the salad chased my Bone In Ribeye OMG!  The King Crab and Truffle Gnocchi was absolutely amazing which was broiled but still creamy and the hint of truffle JUST THE RIGHT AMOUNT...Crème brulee for desert and it was served with a scoop of fresh tossed fruits laced in some sweet liquor and a bowl of FRESH WHIPPED CREAM..... Oh! they did give us a basket of breads to chase our bottle of champagneA perfectly prepared meal and the service? 6 stars! from the valet, to the hostess, to the bartender (our server) and the ladie's room attendant! Who could ask for more service!My plan is to try the other Mastro's locations in the PHX area.... If I had to rate the PHX City Hall location to the other Mastro's in OC, CA, I'd have to give the thumb's up to PHX City Hall.Oh! One more thing! Live entertainment; pianist and singer with perfect selection of music to fit the fare!
Fuji Buffet=Good food and actually good customer service!This is a new ownership compared to the last incarnation under a different name, and they are much improved!The food is varied and of decent quality; my Discard Pile* was very small.  There was an assortment of seafood, pork, beef, chicken, and vegetable dishes.  Nothing I had was too greasy, either.  The only item I'm used to that I missed was bean sprouts.  I dug the honey chicken and orange chicken, the pork spare ribs were nice even though the sauce was too sweet, but the beef short ribs tasted too much like plain old roast beef.  I don't like mushrooms but would bet that most folks would appreciate their unusual addition to the inside of the springroll style eggrolls.  The real standout for me that day was the customer service.  In a boofay? I know!My experience at Fuji Boofay was the exact opposite of China Star http://www.yelp.com/biz/china-star-super-buffet-phoenix-2#hrid:CjQqXNGlBOFi-aVdY6VWIw Allow me to briefly elaborate (ooh nice oxymoron)I walked in and had already noticed the quite clear signage stating that lunch lasted until 3:30pm and dinner began at 3:35pm.  It was 3:32pm. [dun dun DUUUHHHNNNN]  I braced myself for the worse (see China Star review), when the smiley young lady at the counter asked, "Do you want lunch or dinner?""I get to choose!?  Well, I don't eat any seafood.""Okay, lunch then.  You'll pay later."   ...and I'm led to my seat.Yea_eah.I think I like that kind of service very much.I will come back when ever I get my vehicle serviced next door.* I measure the quality of a boofay, especially its meat items, by the size of the pile of grisle, fat, and ? that is uneaten and cut off or spit out onto the plate.  Of course, smaller is better when it comes to the Discard Pile!
McDonald's=This McDonald's in Viva Las Vegas is particularly nice and clean.  The parking lot is pretty easy to navigate in and out of with the busy traffic on W Charleston and the restaurant's close proximity to the freeway.Great place to grab your morning coffee and breakfast and take a lil break and relax.  The food has consistently been quality and fresh tasting, the service very good.Nice plus?  Close proximity to the hospital. Bring your own coffee and nosh when you're headed over to visit a friend in the hospital.  Bring 'me a little breakfast danish or cookie as a treat!
The Cheesecake Factory=This Cheesecake Factory sucks. Ain't no other way to say it. Let me explain why.I pull into the parking lot and am waiting on my wife to show up as she's on her way. I call and speak to "Frank" who tells me the wait list is only 5 minutes. I'm only 5 spaces from the front door and can see both front doors so...I'm thinking we're going to be good to go. Well 4 min later we're walking in the door and I get told the wait is now 20 minutes. Wow, that's quite a jump in only 4 minutes and there wasn't a horde of people rushing the door. Either someone can't count or someone was lying...got a hunch the counting ability is just fine....So we get on the list, get our pager and then cool our heels outside. And outside stinks. Literally stinks. Like has anyone emptied the trash by the benches? Finally after a 25 min wait someone comes out and calls for us by name...the pager never did go off. I got the excuse that it doesn't work outside. Hmm, I guess having equipment with a range of 100 ft from the base station is asking too much. So we finally get seated. And service...well, it was slow. You wait for bread. You wait for drinks. You wonder if the waiter went to the bar to watch the baseball game on TV. You wonder if there will ever be peace in the Middle East. And then you get to place an order.When you finally get your food well quite frankly it sucks. My soon to be 3 year old wanted chicken strips and he wanted apple juice. He picks up the juice, starts to move the straw to his mouth and is rewarded with an apple juice shower as the lid was not snapped all the way down on the cup. Nice...now I got a soggy kid. And that soggy kid ate some of the french fries but spit out the chicken. As for my wife, she ordered Spicy Chipotle Chicken Pasta. She ate about 5 bites before she pushed it away. And I ordered a Mexico City Chicken dish that was marginally passable, but after a couple of bites it left my mouth feeling...well it's starchy...or like it's powdery..it's just weird. 2 hours after leaving the place my wife and I still have this strange aftertaste from their food. I've never really had an aftertaste like this before. Again it's just weird. From walking in the front door until we left took almost 2 full hours. We spent $80 and ended up leaving well over 3/4 of our food for Republic Services to send to the Apex landfill. I can write that it sucked, but quite frankly that's understating just how bad it was. My wife said to show mercy and give 2 Stars? Not a chance. If it sucks it sucks. Call it as I experience it and be done with it. 1 Star. And when you see penquins inside the gates to Hades, you might see me darken their doors again. Until such time...oh no Boo-Boo. Ain't going back here even if you tried to drag me in. (With apologies to my wife who had a rough day and I thought a good meal with cheesecake might brighten her day, but instead these jackasses made it even worse! I waited a while to write this one so I could cool off but needless to say I was not happy when I left).This location is in Green Valley just off the 215 freeway.TOTAL meltdown in service. Slow and non apologetic about the service from the management. Wasn't just me, it was all tables and they keep filling em up no matter what. Was there 1 1/2 hours and couldn't even get dessert. CRAZY!Huge food portions, blah nothing to taste but presentation of the food was nice.Lack of leadership with excuses. Didn't really care too much about excuses as I'm the customer and went with an expectation of quality food and professional service.Neither was delivered on this visit.I may or may not go there againYou'd think that clean eating and the Cheesecake Factory would not compute, but you can find clean eats most anywhere, even here at this chain restaurant.  Yes, it's a bummer not to indulge in their red velvet cheesecake at the end of the meal, but you don't always have to eat cheesecake just because it's the name of the place.  The Skinnylicious menu has many items to choose from that can be made even cleaner.  I'm a big fan of the turkey burger, ordering it protein-style (without the bread), hold the mayo.  The side salad it comes with is good with its balsamic vinaigrette dressing, too.  The b/f and I had lunch there today and he had grilled chicken breast with brown rice and broccoli, also very clean.  I'm a fan of being able to order our meals the way we want to here with no fuss from the staff.  Major kudos and it keeps us coming back!Staying in Henderson this Cheesecake Factory was the first I've visited which I didn't have to wait for seating at dinner. I was seated at a booth which I requested and was comfy.My friendly waitress greeted me asap and gave me a menu with the large variety of choices to choose from. I ended up going with the Salmon Miso which was topped on steamed rice and served with pea pods. The fish was fresh & moist and the miso sauce went good when combined with the rice and pods. Instead of going with a fancy cheesecake I chose the original which was served with whipped cream. The cheesecake was silky smooth and creamy and not overly rich but filling.Overall for me - the large variety of choices, good quality in a pleasant atmosphere make Cheescake Factory a solid choice to dine.This particular location brings back the first time I ate here:I am down with the swirl, have jungle fever, a checkerboard chick, and all other silly names people come up with to express that they are open to all types of races. I love all guys--black, white, Asian, Hispanic, Middle Eastern, European, tall, short, skinny, heavy, muscular, etc. I have no specific type. If you're hot, you're hot! RIGHT?So, one of my friends started this interracial meetup group and at the time I was NOT interested in dating. I am happiest being a loner. She talked me into accompanying her to the Cheescake Factory with the rest of the group that signed up. Now, I have enough common sense that groups like this rarely turn out the way you want because for one thing people in their 30s just don't sign up for stuff like that. This was a Monday evening (happy hour) and it was fairly crowded. We were waiting for the RSVP's to show up and it was starting to crowd. While waiting a few males showed up and I could tell they were NOT her type. She was looking extremely irritated and I was having a blast, watching it all go down. LOL.... This man in his late 40's showed up and without any kind of greeting she jumped up from her seat and said, "How old are you?!" After he reluctantly said 47, she made it clear that this group was for no one over 40. I felt bad for him as he walked away and I secretly hoped he didn't return to shoot up the restaurant.Another male approached us wearing coke bottle glasses, a striped stained polo shirt, dirty, baggy bum jeans, and velcro snapper shoes. He looked just like Robin Williams in "ONE HOUR PHOTO." To make matters worse, he was hoarding several overused Walmart bags full of personal property! Maybe he thought he was gonna get lucky and have a place to stay tonight?!She tried to eliminate him by asking his age. He was a smart man, and he lied. Haha..... Out of no where, I could see her hopes rising when two extrememly tall white males entered the restaurant. The kind of lads you see posing in an Abercrombie ad. She jumped up immediately and said, "Are you here for the meetup group?!" They looked surprised and said no. She slumped down like she had just completely given up. Inside, I was cracking up! The happy hour menu is extremely cheap, nearly half off so I ordered a few appetizers. I got the calamari which is lightly breaded and extremely tender and juicy. It comes with 2 different dipping sauces, but the calamari is so good it can stand on its own with a little lemon juice. I like ordering off of their SKINNYLICIOUS menu which are items that are healthy and less calorie. The Arugula Salad containing Arugula, Marcona Almonds, Golden Raisins, Parmesan, Lemon and Olive Oil.....is sooooooo light and refreshing and is a great accompaniment to something that is fried. So I sat there, watching some people make a connection and others look like they were ready to go. I chose to sit in a nuetral seat, meaning I sat between two females so that no one assumed I wanted to pair up. I wasn't there for a love connection--just a really yummy meal. This evening turned out to be hilarious--at my friends' expense. She didn't find anyone that fit her type. Oh well! I left with a delicious OREO COOKIE CHEESECAKE! That's the ultimate love connection!Walking into The Cheesecake Factory (at night) reminds me of a Las Vegas Casino.  Not the downtown casinos that are all closed in and almost claustrophobic, mind you, but the expansive Steve Wynn casinos on the strip.  It's huge.  It borders on gaudy, but in a nice way.  You also can't really tell what time of day it is - probably so you don't mind how long you wait for your server to come back to you (though we did).I'd imagine that during the day, the monstrous windows in the front of the place give it a ton of light, and it would be a completely different feel, but at night, it just gave that vibe.  The noise is pretty incredible too - like the old noise of casinos (they don't have noise any more, sad to say).As to the food - pretty impressive overall.  I just wish that they didn't have 300 items on the menu.  And I didn't count, the server gave that number when I asked for a suggestion since I didn't feel like opening the tome of selections.  I eventually settled on one of the items from the specials list (Caramel Chicken).We also had some crab cake appetizers, a massive double BBQ burger, a chicken sandwich and an order of popcorn shrimp.  The fried food overall was the worst.  The burger was good, but huge.  The crab cakes were surprisingly good.   It was really the service that did them in, but to their credit the manager (or someone doing an imitation of a manger) came out to tell us that the food would be out some time.  Then we had to also wait on the bill, and to pay the bill, and so on...If I had any suggestions, it would be for them to go on "Kitchen Nightmares" with Gordon Ramsay.  Not because the place isn't clean - it's immaculate.  But the size of the menu, coupled with the portion size, is insane.  Cut the menu in half (or quarters), and do the same with the portions.  They could even shave something off the price at the same time.That way every person wouldn't be walking out with leftovers and they wouldn't have to spend so much time at every table trying to help diners navigate the menu.  Not to mention, there would be room for dessert.  You know, the cheesecake?
Gallery Restaurant=One of the best things about living in the 'burbs is Gallery at Ballantyne Hotel.  I love this place for a lot of reasons, great service, wonderul bar menu and atmosphere.  During my most recent visit I enjoyed a beer and wonderful cheddar cheese and bacon sliders.  My friend had a great berry martini and fish tacos.  Her two generous fish tacos were more than enough for a meal and got two thumbs way up!The bar has the best atmosphere and the most comfortable seating. Even when it's crowded, you can always converse without having to raise you voice while continuing to sink back in comfy chairs.  They have wine and other drink specials and don't forget the great patio that overlooks the golf course when weather is great and the sky is Carolina Blue!
BJ's Cocktail Lounge West=Over the past few weeks this has become my neighborhood bar.  Probably because it's in my neighborhood, and is also a bar.  And, the employees remember who I am!  Sure, they all call me "Mr. Manhattan" because I order that drink most often, but still.  They recognize me!Happy Hour occurs on weekdays from 4pm-7pm, making it the perfect after-work pitstop.  Long day at work?  No worries, BJ's has 50% off drinks and $5 appetizers to keep you going.  I've had their Tempura Calamari and one of their chicken sandwiches, and both have been tasty.  A step above average bar food.  Be sure to try their herb-infused fries, they're an addicting side to have while enjoying a few drinks.  The decor, staff, food, and friendly atmosphere have kept this spot in regular rotation for me recently, and I don't see that changing any time soon.  I'm a fan!
Native Grill & Wings=What qualifies them to call themselves "Native New Yorker"?What does peddling cheap batches of taste-impaired wings, crunchy pizza and nacho platters have to do with New York?Or even "New Yorker"? Where's the man in the fancy hat that serves me my wings? What, you don't have one? Then again, I ask, what's "New York" about you?A checkered tablecloth and some black and white photographs? Oh wow, a picture of an old automobile. Get the fuck out of town..50 extra for a cup of ranch? Have you the brain worms? What, has there been a ranch dressing famine? And not to be picky here, but usually, you're supposed to wait for the cheese to melt before you serve the smothered fries. Is that why I'm paying the .50 per ranch? Is your "shredded cheese heating machine" broken? Does New York know you're up to this?My yelp review for the missing dozen wings got the Manager's attention back in December 20, 2012, so I thought I would write an update.  Message from the Manager:I have put you in my manager log for a dozen wings on us.  Please let us know immediately if there is ever a problem and we will happily correct it. If you wouldn't mind updating your yelp review stating that this has been resolved, we would greatly appreciate it.That is nice that they really read the reviews.  I just have not had time to go back since December.  Thanks for reaching out to your customers.
Claim Jumper=I'm gonna take some heat for this, but I really don't care.  I LOVE Claim Jumper.  Say what you will about chain this and chain that, but I hold this restaurant higher than your average chain and with reason.It takes everything bad about American dining - huge portions, over-the-top decor incl impressive old-school ceiling fans, fattening desserts and huge tedious menus and unabashedly flaunts it.  I call it the Sierra Nevada version of Cheesecake Factory.I've been going here for years - so I may be blinded by the nostalgia value, but I think the food is of better quality than your typical chain.  I very rarely come here anymore because every location is far-flung since Claim Jumper is adored by suburban soccer parents from here to Chicago, but my buddy out in South Tempe got me to make the trek last week for his birthday.My favorites here are:* Tri-tip french dip, which is delicious and classically Californian.  * Rotisserie chicken with red skinned mashed potatoes or cheese potatocakes as an option.* Country Fried Steak - with the mashed potatoes adorned with a red apple. :)* Parmesan crusted chicken with angel hair marinara.* Meatball calzone which is bigger than your face.If you can finish dinner here AND leave room for the gluttonous Chocolate Mother Lode cake or Mud Pie for dessert, I would like to meet you and shake your hand just to be sure you are human.So out of the blue our Boss who was celebrating a birthday along with two other coworkers within the same week says were all going out to lunch, he didn't get any arguements from me! I figured it would be one of are usual spots, but to my surprise he said  we were going to Claim Jumpers.From the moment were walked in we were quickly greated by the hostest with the mostest, he was funny & friendly and laughed at my inability to count to 4.Mike our waiter was friendly, and took great care of our table. I ordered their infamous pot pie and was not disappointed. It was way too much food but tasted so good it was difficult to resist pushing myself into a food coma. I snuck by the counter and quietly mentioned it was a three people bday lunch and before crazy birthday surprises could commence my team decided it was time to go. Before we could get out the door the hostess with the mostest and waiter were bagging up baked birthday to go treats. Great customer service goes a long way.... thanks for helping us celebrate! We'll definitely be back!I have been here a few times now. Each time we had a different server,and each time they were good. Every time we came for Lunch we try to get there around 11:30am,  because, by 12 noon the joint is Jumping!The Clam Chowder is good, not great . Salad ,just OK. The food is good,but my friend likes to go there all the time. I think It is a place you could visit once and awhile and be good with it.I have never had Desert here. But, they display them in the Showcase and they look amazing. I should of taken a photo,but I did not. They have the largest slice of cake I have ever seen. From one of the Tallest cakes I have ever seen.It is decorated very Rustic, as if you are in a hunting lodge. It is very clean and parking is all around the building. So there is a lot.it is worth a visit. They are very friendly. The greeters in the front are very happy to see you. I like it.
Takumi Japanese Restaurant=Can I give ZERO here?!?!What an awful place for sushi and I literally cannot believe this is so-called "best sushi" place in Madison!One of the sushi we ordered was Inari sushi (bean curd). The first second I saw it I know it might not taste good. But I put in my mouth anyway. What a bad idea! It tasted like they put cooking wine in the bean curd, which is absolutely not right becoz the bean curd tastes either sweet or sour but nothing like wine!!! I don't think they were fresh! It tasted like the bean curd had been kept for way too long and it fermented!!! I had to spit it out bcoz I didn't want to get food poisoning!! The waiter came but denied immediately anything wrong with the bean curd. No apology or anything. I heard the guy behind the sushi bar even asked the waiter whether we are Chinese. They were talking in a dialect from China. But unfortunately, I happened to know that dialect. They came back and denied any bad food again but still no apology for anything. The guy behind the sushi bar also had a weird smile on his face and was looking directly at me. Some kind of provocation?!?!Didnt touch anything else, I left. Def NO COMING BACK!!!
Andreoli Italian Grocer=Andreoli's Grocer is a little expensive but the ambiance alone is worth paying for. The Italian and European groceries - pastas, grains, baked goods, olive oils, wine- and the Italian conversations you hear while sitting at their antique tables and chairs, makes you feel as if you were in Italy. On the other hand I have mixed reviews on their food. I was disappointed in my cheese and cured meat platter. Their menu claims that their antipasto will "take your breath away." I ordered the il tagliere del maresciallo and it was kinda boring. I expected the dish to be simple but not poorly crafted. I was expecting a variety of firm and soft Italian cheeses and a variety of smoky, spicy, and salty cured meats but got nothing more than a few flavorful meats, a handful of briny olives, and a glob of mild gorgonzola cheese. It would have been really good with one or two more cheeses.I also ordered a panino forza Italia that was really good. The panino, English translation for sandwich, had a wonderful paring of proscuitto, gorgonzola, mascarpone, and arugula that was served between a perfectly golden crusted and soft baguette. I plan on going back to try a couple of other things on their menu. Until then I'm going to give them a three. Ciao!Gimmee an A...Gimme a T....Gimme a T...Gimme an I...Gimme a T...Gimme a U...Gimme a D....Gimme an E...what does it spell?  ATTITUDE!This review is not for the food, but for the attitude we experienced at Andreoli's.  As visitors to Scottsdale we were looking for a place to pick up talian specialty and deli items and two options, Andreoli's' being one, popped to the top of our list.  Since my hubby is Italian American and grew up in an Italian neighborhood in Brooklyn, he has more than a passing acquaintance with good italian deli's and "attitude".  Loves the former and the latter doesn't phase him a bit.  Usually.  But at Andreoli's he walked out without making a purchase.  Here's why...We were the only customers in the store at about 6pm on a weeknight, so it's not as if they were too busy or we were too impatient.  But we waited for some time before a staff person, who had just been complaining - loudly - to someone else about a rude customer - asked "You know what you want?"  When we said we were new to the store and trying to decide the response was roughly, "When you figure out what you want call me, I'll be in the back."You know that old comic phrase, "This job would be great if it weren't for our damned customers"...well, we wonder if that' might be the slogan at Andreoli's based on this single experience.   That said, it seems as if Andreoli's has a decent selection of deli items (although not as good as  one of their competitors perhaps) and a great selection of imported Italian specialty items, like taralles, capers packed in salt, nougats and so on, and a freezer case full of ravioli with different fillings that looked pretty darned intriguing. So, we wondered, why was the place empty at about 6:00 on a weeknight when one might think people should be coming and going to pick things up to take home or eat in?   Maybe we're not the only ones who decided the attitude wasn't worth it?We left without making a purchase.  But given all the great Yelp reviews, maybe we just hit this on a bad day.  Still, we'd echo Jan S's observation in her review from her experience in December that there is a sense the staff doesn't care.  And in this economy in particular, we want to do business with people who do.Andreoli, you disappoint me. Here's why...After not visiting you for nearly a year, I craved your food. Either you are resting on your laurels or stopped caring or both.With crummy weather that we had today, a friend suggested your restaurant. Well other than the coffee that is consistently excellent, the pasta dish I ordered left everything to be desired...I ate because I was hungry but there was nothing in that dish worth recommending - dried pasta, uninteresting ragu - no sauce whatsoever....blah! So much for driving 20 minutes to come see you, I'll stay home next time thinking of you and make my own meal and not spend $ 13 for a dish that's not even worth two bucks.On top of that, you are too busy talking on the phone instead of taking care of your customers. Not even one person bothered to ask us how our food was.First and foremost Andreoli's is an overpriced Italian grocery store.  As it is a grocery store, visitors should not expect table cloths or good service,   Many of the unusual items it carries can be found for less at nearby AJs, but not the broad selection of cheeses or salumi.  The homemade hot lunches can be very good, but this is not the place to bring the boss.  Because the food is homemade, it varies in consistency from day to day.  I will say, as one who lived in Italy for many years, the dishes are indeed authentic and worth a try, if not worth the price.  One warning: Don't order the pizza and expect an ordinary pizza.  It's a rustic pizza, made with bread dough.  We did not like it.  Andreoli himself, incidentally, can be quite grumpy to those he does not know.It was a Monday and there's nothing too great about Mondays. It was lunchtime and it was hot outside. I didn't bring my lunch into work so I had to go somewhere. I sat and pondered about where to go. I started driving and kept driving and it then hit me...I'd been wanting to try Andreoli for years and this Monday lunchtime was going to be the day! Would it be everything I dreamed of? Would I silently thank the owners for making me happy on this hot and miserable Monday? Would it feel like I stepped into Italy in the desert? Would I gorge not one both both halves of my sandwich? Would I leave with chocolate in my hand? The answer to each question above is yes; a thousand times yes! I parked my car and walked through a game of two patrons playing Foosball. It felt very much like Italy and it felt even more like Italy once I stepped through the doors. The grocer is open in the middle with plenty of homey tables and chairs and different types of Italian groceries line the walls. I immediately noticed the tasty dishes in the glass refrigerator at the counter and most importantly, the rows of desserts tempting my taste buds. The menu is lengthy and everything sounded delicious. From pasta to sandwiches, this Italian grocer has it all. Experiencing my typical menu anxiety, I stared anxiously at the menu and finally, asked the man behind the counter what he suggested. He said to go for the # 3 named the sempronio which had prosciutto, mozzarella and pepper sandwich on sourdough. It sounded delicious so I said "sold!" and moved my way to the cash register. Before I could escape though, chocolate caught my eye. Yes, I was coming off of an eating binge in Chicago but I couldn't resist so I asked for a little slice of the chocolate with marzipan in the middle. I lunched alone and I felt just fine doing so here. Everyone is very friendly and everything is very casual, so I sat at my table and waited for my meal to arrive. And now let me tell you about the Italian goodness known as my sandwich. The sourdough bread was soft, crunchy and blissful with every bite. I read in one of the reviews that the prosciutto was so good it was almost a sin to eat it with bread. That is exactly how this prosciutto was. It was salty and moist and very lean. Absolutely delicious with every bite. The peppers complimented it perfectly and I didn't even mind the biteful of garlic clove I discovered. I asked for a to-go box. I did, and I had every intention of wrapping up half of the sandwich and saving it for later. But how could I do so to something so delicious? So, the other half stayed in the to-go box all of five minutes before I consumed the remainder. I was full and satisfied. Here's a very important note: do not ask to change anything on the menu. What they offer is what you get and not only is it delicious as-is and shouldn't be changed, they will also refuse you if you request any substitutes. Hey, it's the Italian way and as a fellow Italian, I can honestly say: that's how we role!I cannot wait to visit again and again. I also can't wait to buy products from their and have an Italian feast of my own at home!I'd been hearing about Andreoli for quite some time, but it took me until last Thursday to go for my first visit.  That first visit was so good that I returned for dinner tonight (just a few days later).On that first visit, I was with three other people and we shared a large mixed salad, oilves, and two different kinds of focaccia.  I had the minestrone soup for dinner that night and then we all shared several desserts.  My favorite was a merengue dessert with frosting - delicious!Tonight's visit was just as good.  My husband once again had homemade pasta with veal meat sauce (their version of Bolognese).  I shared the fettucine with lobster in a light red tomato sauce with my mom.  My brother and dad both ordered the pork sandwich, and we again started the meal by sharing a large mixed green salad, fresh bread, and an antipasti platter.  Once again, we couldn't end our meal without something sweet, so my dad chose a nutty nuget for us to share.While it's a casual atmosphere / grocer, and you place your order at the front counter, the service is attentive and the food is as authentic as I've found in the Valley.  We will for sure be back with the bambino in the future... Bellisimo!Ok this is hard for me beause the food is 6 stars.  I take my friends, family, clients here and everybody raves about it ..... but.  The smart ass kids at the counter have got to go.  I don't know their names but  one in particular should retire and become a lawyer because when you ask if you can have your sandwich on Italian (roll) instead of focaccia he says "Focaccia is Italian" and then looks at you smugly.  I took the high road and neglected to point out to him that a baguette he offered was French.  He should  pay less attention to geography and work on his note taking skills because after all that, the sandwich still came on a focaccia.So I hope the owner hears this, your front line of sales at the counter makes me want to go somewhere else.  Your six star food, averaged with your zero star staff puts you at a 3.  And yes Guiseppe, I want to drink diet coke and I don't need a lecture on how it has "echemica that is a bad for your brain". If you feel so strongly about it, then don't sell it !  I'm sure your meats contribute to heart disease but you're not grimacing when I order a porchetta sandwich (which is unbelievably good by the way)So Andreloi, please get someone up front with a smile and who, at a minimum, has read a pamphlet on the basics of customer service.Hate having to write this one.Not a fan. Today Vermont Sandwich Company was packed, so my girlfriend and I thought we would walk over and give this place a try. Big BIG Mistake. Now I've been to Italy, hell ...I grew up in Nice, France. Not 'old world' enough for me, I ordered the Maresciallo Italian antipasto with their meats & cheese which took forever to get and charged me over $10 (big rip off) and my friend ordered a Bastard baguette (dis-appointing). This place is too over-priced in their offerings.The main reason for this yelp is the rudeness of the staff here, the woman behind the counter had a chip on her shoulder and treated not only us but others in line with arrogance. Also the old man, possibly the owner had the same air about him.Granted there were many off duty scottsdale police hanging around, but the whole scenario reminded me of a mafia 'front', just like back home. I guess this is a hit or miss from reading all the reviews, maybe its just from others low standards?I can't believe I have not reviewed Andreoli's before.  I have been having their sandwiches and Chocolate croissants since the twins were born.  Andreoli is so close to the Scottsdale Shea Hospital.  When I delivered the twins I had to stay there for I think 4 or 5 days.  I sent my hubby everyday for chocolate croissants and sandwiches.  Hospital food is yuck compared to it.  I went back again today, I needed some comfort food after the stress of my little girls surgery, hey I need an excuse for the carb overload. I ordered the Porchetta and the Forza Italia, plus of course a couple of chocolate croissants, 1/3 of a pound of salami and some Zuppa inglese for an additional dessert.The food here is amazing, yes, the customer service is not the best.  They remind me of my Zio Aldo.  Always with his smug smile and always telling everyone around how "stupido" they are.  I miss him.  You need to think like George Costanza, not make any sudden moves or comments for fear you will get "No croissant for you, one year!"If you are not one of their paisans (part of the Italian family or go there every week) they treat you like crap.  Food was good but would not go back. We waited 15 minutes for a seat and when the owner finally got up from taking up a table of 4 to sign papers for a car he was buying....... they tried to give the table to one of their good customers.  We bought a bottle of wine and finished it at the restaurant and was charged $5 for a corking fee.  please explain that ......................The owner and I'm guessing  his daughter who was behind the counter was real rude........... When we left I commented on a dish that someone was eating (it looked real good) the patron said you can get one to if you come here often........WOW -I guess I don't look ItalianFull review blogged:Crostini di Fegatini alla Fiorentina:  $5. Nothing complicated here, just rough ground chicken liver pate over homemade toasted bread with a bit of parsley.  Served chilled and ample in portion, no complaints.Maialino:  $18.  The most limited item on the menu this spit-roast baby piglet was gone by the time we left and although the skin could have been crispier the flavors were spot on - the pork supple and rife with notes of garlic, rosemary, coriander, and pepper while the skin was slightly sweet and plenty smoky.Panino con Porchetta: $8.95. Much like the Maialino this could have used a bit more crackle on the surface but all things being equal it would be pretty hard to complain about crusty Italian bread wrapped around warm pork roast with plenty of black pepper, fennel and light citrus notes.Baccala` in Umido con Polenta: $18. One of my primary reasons for wanting to visit Andreoli in the first place was this dish and thankfully it did not disappoint one bit.  Big in portion, huge in flavor, and in my opinion the most well executed dish of the afternoon I figured going into it that the cod would be excellent and as good as it was, the biggest shocker of the dish was perfect execution of the polenta - toothsome, dense, and a veritable sponge for both the tomatoes and the briny fish.Caponata Sicula: $5. Simple, savory, and perhaps the deal of the day this plate of tender eggplant, briny capers, pine nuts, tomatoes, balsamic, and olive oil with hints of basil and onion was plenty to share and would have only been better with some warm bread for dipping.Trippa alla Toscanaccia: $14. With almost half of our table having never eaten tripe and another not really a fan of the dish I figured I'd be doing most of the legwork on this dish and although everyone took a taste my suspicions fortuitously proved correct - an acquired taste for sure, this was really good.  Thin like soup and plenty fatty despite being loaded with meat with notes of onion, tomato, and vinegar at the fore while mint and garlic came through on the palate this was another place that some extra bread would have been welcomed as far too much broth remained at the end.Mille Feuille: $7. While I contest this should have been referred to as a Napoleon I guess it really doesn't matter because regardless of nationality what we received was flaky pastry wrapped around lightly sweetened pastry cream.  Clearly not as transcendent as some of the a la minute options being turned out elsewhere as this one had been stored in the chiller all day I have to say I was largely impressed by the separation of the layers and lack of sogginess.Rhum Baba: $2 each.  Also straight from the chilled case these traditional baba were everything one could hope from the classic dish - a buttery ball of pastry drown in rum; a sledgehammer of flavor up front with a buttery sweet finish; at one bite each I'm pretty sure I'd have been tipsy with a half dozen.Struffoli: $4.  Another very traditional selection you don't really see all that often at Italian markets or bakeries these marble sized pastry balls were crisp on the outside, soft on the inside, and absolutely dredged in honey.  A stark textural juxtaposition to the baba which was soft throughout I personally enjoyed these a lot, though having sat for a while the honey had begun to harden which made them a bit difficult to extract from the small dish.Cornetti: $2.50.  Golden crisp on the outside, buttery caverns within, and fortunately a brand new batch when I ran back in to make my purchase this warm nutella croissant was the highlight of the sweets for me - a strong contender for best croissant in town that remained fluffy despite the chocolate-hazenut filling while the exterior shattered to the tooth.Sfogliatelle: $3.  Lightly citrus thanks to the use of candied lemon peel, even crispier than the cornetti on the outside, and a pillow of ricotta smoothness within - if you go to Andreoli and don't order one of these you're missing out...as a matter of fact, I'd go so far as to suggest that this item alone is worth a visit to Andreoli as it was every bit as good as any I've ever tasted on either coast (admittedly having not yet been to Italy.) Schiacciata uva: $4.  I'd never tried this prior to Andreoli's and, as a matter of fact, I'd never even seen it.  Quite simply a focaccia base with fresh grapes placed at the center prior to baking thus allowing the juices to infuse the dough as it cooked this was sweet, light, and full of flavor - the sort of dish that would be easy to whip up for a party and equally easy to dress up in any number of variations.The Verdict:  Fresh, rustic, and very authentic this one definitely goes on the 'under the radar' list and while I'm unable to speak to Andreoli's quality during normal business hours I can only say that based on what I experienced at the Christmas festival I'm eager to return.I agree with the other reviewers.  The girl working at the counter was not friendly.  I ordered one of their sandwiches and I asked if they could please add prosciutto to it.  She replied with "no, we don't mix meats".  Really?  Pretty sure I'm the customer and if you're not willing to give me what I want, I won't be back.  Hence, I'm never going back.  The sandwich would have been much better if they made it the way I requested it.  An Italian sandwich with just one meat?!?  It was bland.  Bread was hard and flavorless.  My friend loves Italian food and he got the Rigatoni Bolognese, which he thought was OK but nothing special.  DeFalco's is better, especially for sandwiches.  Oh, and do not order the tripe, I think the reason is self explanatory.Mamma Mia! That's my best Italian impression... Take it for what it's worth. The only thing that matters is that I had the best sandwich I've ever had in my life at Andreoli's Italian Grocer. Yes... in my life (or at least as far back as last week, I have a horrible memory)Before I get to the sandwich, I have to touch on the environment. When I saw a sign next to the register saying "We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone," I knew this place was going to be a treat. That said, I've been here two days in a row and had two completely different customer service experiences. My first day, the atmosphere was tense. I went up to give my order to a young lady. She was pretty girl, but I'm not sure if she had teeth because she never smiled. Order was taken, then on to the next task she went.  The man at the register was cordial but obviously annoyed. It was Obvious because he outwardly made the irritated comment that he didn't know how he was supposed to run the register and also make, I think he said cake, but I'm not sure because I was looking around for the closest exit in case one of these two lost it. On the second day, there was a different young lady and a different gentleman. Both were welcoming and friendly. Completely different attitudes from these two. The service seems to be luck of the draw.You want to know who was pleasant both visits? The guy who runs the dining room with the burly mustache. He brightens my day. He's delightful and he has an unapologetic mustache. I can't say enough about that mustache. It's wonderful.The dining area is not very big and it's filled with a number of old world-antique looking furnishings. Cookware hangs from the ceiling, old photos on the walls among other random looking antiquey stuff. It's pretty sweet. Sitting at one of the old wooden tables for two made me feel like I was at on old time pub or eatery in a small Italian village. If the floor was made of cobblestone, it would be perfect.Both times, I ordered the Caio sandwich. Sliced beef with cheese and grilled onions on the greatest bread I've had in Phoenix. It's served with a simple salad and is so good. It's a great lunch. I may go get it again today. If you have some room left after your meal, they have a case of delicious looking dessert items. I tried the tiramisu, and I didn't hate it. This place is one of my new Phoenix favorites... even though it's in Scottsdale. I don't care what kind of service I get. As long as the food stays amazing, this will be my little Italy.My coworker and I stopped in here for a quick lunch recently and while part of me really enjoyed it, the the rest of me really didn't. The food was delicious, the atmosphere is pleasant and the workers were friendly.The issue I have is they don't allow any customization of any kind to their sandwiches. I was looking for an 'italian' kind of sandwich with a bunch of different meats and peppers but they didn't have anything like that on their list of sandwiches. When i asked if they could do that, the woman said no. They make their sandwiches a certain way because 'he' (the owner?) says they're best that way. Ok. I guess. There was also about a 15 minute wait for the two sandwiches to arrive. So the food was good, but don't expect to customize your sandwich.Super disappointed on a Saturday afternoon.We absolutely loved going to Andreoli's and sincerely hope that yesterday was just a off day for a favorite restaurant of ours.We literally drive 24 miles (one way) to get our Italian fix and we had planned for yesterday.We ordered the gnocchi as a primi, and secondi was to be bistecca fiorentina ala Sangue. We had to ask for our waters, our wine, and other things we just sloughed it off, as that is typical and italian. Nothing rushed. We certainly were not in a hurry but it seemed like our order was forgotten.Everything arrived at once which when we ordered we indicated pasta first, steak second.The Steak arrived medium well to well. We expressed that while we were not trying to be difficult, we ordered our steak specifically rare. That the steak presented was near well done. When you are paying $22 or more a pound, you kind of want it the way requested. So the server took it back. Rather than fix the issue, our order taker returned. Expressed that she looked at it, and found it to be lightly pink in the center. That it was only the edges that were well done. Now I don't know if she though we were youngsters or what, but trying to convince guests a nearly well steak is rare, and presenting it to us again and asking us to accept it twice really killed the whole meal. We stated that we were sorry, but we could not accept the steak the way it was cooked.No offer of a re-do.Our wine went to waste, and we left hungry.We were absolutely sad, wasted an afternoon and fuel. Though things happen at times where people forget, and we are forgiving, the fact that it was pushed upon us to feel bad about a cooking error should not be placed on guests ever.I'm a true believer that Andreoli has some of the most authentic Italian food in the Valley! Their food is SO fresh and delicious and I completely recommend sharing the dishes family style so that you can get a little taste of everything. And their bread, Oh-Em-Gee, their bread. I could eat it all day, every day and be a happy camper (Ask for some balsamic to go along with their fabulous EOO)! A few of my favorites are the maresciallo (meat and cheese board), fratelli d'italia (caprese-like salad) and their pasta options change frequently but they are all amazing!  Last but certainly not least, their sweet treats are off of the charts. I love their Nutella cookies and chocolate cake! Warning: The photos may make your mouth instantly start watering! :) Enjoy!! Can't wait to come back soon.
1130 The Restaurant=I can't believe I haven't written my review on 1130 yet! I had a very nice happy hour with my pal Heather C here. We met before going to watch a performance at the Herberger. The weather was really nice so I was glad that Heather chose a patio table. Our waiter was a kid. I mean, I know I'm getting older, but he was a clumsy kid who fumbled through the drink specials and needed some sharpness. With such a cool sleek spot, you would probably want a more professional waiter. Just my opinion. We decided on the lobster lettuce cups that were rather large and surprisingly full of lobster meat! I really liked the appetizer, I was wishing for more acid but it was still refreshing and tasty. We took our waiter's suggestion and ordered the calamari. What a surprise! I really liked the calamari! It came drizzled with a sweet chili sauce and had pepperocinis tossed into the mix.It was great! I loved how the sweetness of the calamari meat, and the chili sauce played well with the tanginess of the pepperocinis! I had some kind of peach martini that was WAY too sweet for my taste, but I guess for a girly drink it was ok. I hope that next time we'll have more time to linger and maybe even have dinner. I look forward to trying their other offerings.How is this place still open? Tried it numerous times simply for the geographical convenience. Every time the food is HORRIBLE. Last experience included gross Bloody Mary's not work the two bucks, an overcooked  and under seasoned salmon, soggy greasy fries and bad service. I will not come back here.For a couple of reasons, 1130 has become a regular after-work haunt for me. First off, it's conveniently located in the Arizona Center. And I always like an excuse to linger in downtown Phoenix and people-watch after the sun goes down and the trees in the AZ Center light up. Secondly, I've become somewhat addicted to their wings ever since being invited here a couple of times on somebody else's dollar. They're really perfectly seasoned with just enough peppery heat. Mind you, this is not my favorite place in Phoenix for hot wings when I am on that mission, but these are a very compelling appetizer.I was pleasantly surprised to discover they offer a 10%-off discount if you check in through Yelp on your mobile phone. They already had me at Happy Hour drink and appetizer discounts, but another break on the price is always welcome.Consider checking out 1130 if you're catching a movie at the cinemas in the Arizona Center. You could always go for a plate of wings instead of a movie theater hot dog, couldn't you? I know I could.
j-pop Lounge=Say what? $14.99 for a bento box lunch special? Ok.. I'll give it a try.Was it worth it? Meh, not so much. It took 5 days to get our food and the waitress just seemed to be in her own world. WTF?My friend ordered a $5 cucumber salad and it was the smallest salad I've ever seen. It was the size of half a rice bowl and we both looked at it like WTF.My bento box came with 4 pieces of california roll, 4 pieces of spicy tuna roll, 1 piece tuna sushi, 1 piece salmon sushi, 1 pice shrimp sushi, seaweed salad and edamame. It was alright. I was stuffed. But, really, the wait made it just ridiculous. And the $5 small ass cucumber salad was also insane. Blah.
Jody Maroni's Sausage Kingdom=I ordered a bratwurst here during a layover at the Phoenix International Airport and boy did the experience...how can I put it lightly...SUCKED!I don't know why on earth they were even calling this a brat. It was a hot dog with jalapenos and onions on top of a super stale and dry cornmeal-like bun. I think I ended up eating half of it like lasagna...and threw the rest away...up in the toilet, that is.If it is store policy to not speak to the customer, then the staff is doing their job very well. They said absolutely no words during the purchase of the meal...including when my order was ready. Instead they just stood there, staring at people like Neanderthals...and were very snooty. Snooty? Yes, snooty! I suppose the job is not so easy, they couldn't do it.I hope the HQ of Jodi Maroni's does a major overhaul of this location because it could be something cool. Until then...stay very far away!You were warned!Yours truly,Abe Froman, The Sausage King of Chicago.THE QUEEN IS DEAD. Well, she should be. If Jodi Maroni is the queen in question, that is. Terrible, terrible sausage sandwiches. Worse cheeseburgers. Barely edible fries. You can find something better in this airport.While the title might be better suited for a Manhattan Chelsea night club, the allure of Jody Maroni's is an easy one here at Sky Harbor - everyone hates the typical airport food options but most folks (even vegans) love hot dogs.But these hot dogs aren't even worthy of a Joey Chestnut or Kobayashi throw down. They often remind me of a layman's version of a Costco dog but cost nearly 4x as much. Sad to say I've eaten here more times than I'd like to admit, but there isn't a single dog I can recommend on the menu.I can however, digress somewhat on my experiences here, all of which included slow and lackadaisical service and were driven by the hope that each time would be better. I've had their chicken andouille dog, which was really just an overcooked hot dog served in a semi-toasted bun. Now substitute the chicken andouille with their bratwurst, polish dog, Louisiana boudin hot link, chicken apple, Chicago style dog, sweet Italian and you have the same result.The biggest offender was their priciest option, the kobe beef dog, supposedly made of wagyu, the red meat from heaven, a gift from carnivore gods. Yet, even at $9 (airport prices, yikes) it still tasted like ... just a Costco hot dog. Perhaps a tad juicier and an interesting snap to the casing but nothing mind blowing or back breaking but certainly wallet killing.In the end, I mean Jodi Maroni no harm. After all, I've had a much more decent version of his hot dogs in other cities, but a little airport kiosk in a space full of commuters who are willing to pay the extra buck for (as Bourdain would coin it) "meat in tube form" nourishment, is not going to be making anything revolutionary anytime soon.
Sweet Tomatoes=Oink! Oink!  While it isn't the largest selection of items I've seen - the presentation is really nice.  They have smaller stations set apart for the salads, desserts, breads/muffins, soups, and drinks -- so you don't have the big line-up going on.  If you are a little piggy like me with multiple trips, this is efficient!The server/attendent was hilarious (didn't catch his name, bad Yelper...whack on my hand).  He made lots of jokes as he drove a big cart on wheels "Mexican driver coming thru", a second cart a few mins later "Another cart coming thru, same mexican driver".  Had the whole section in stitches!  Later, when speaking to him at my table, I found him to be a very pleasant and kind man...with a super positive attitude (I mean, who is this happy?).Located in the lovely and central Desert Ridge shopping center, the food is really kept fresh.  This location has a slightly different design than others; a warehouse open-style, with glass and framing inside, and very tall ceilings.  I like it!  Good, especially, if you are claustrophobic...as well as "starvin' like Marvin".I'm really not a big fan of buffets, but my wife and son had a craving for salad and wanted to go to Sweet Tomatoes. So I guess I gave in. Anyways, I've been here quite few times and my family wanted something healthy tonight. There is so much to choose from at this place from the salad bar, soup bar with 8 different home-made soups, pasta bar, bakery, potato bar that includes both baked potatoes and sweet potatoes, and of course the desert bar. I really do think the salad bar is one of the best I've been too. So many choices. They have both lettuce and spinach with everything you can image to put on top of the salad. Also, they have a few pasta salads and other pre-made salads like Cesar's and the likes. Really good. With all these options, it has to make everyone happy except for one thing. Where's the meat? Where's the beef? Not much here. They have different Focaccia breads (something almost like pizza bread) that are pretty good. My wife and son really likes their soup especially the chicken noodle soup. They love it. I tried the chili soup and it had multiple kinds of beans, ground beef, tomatoes and other thing. It was pretty good but little sour from the tomatoes. The pasta bar is ok and probably my favorite would be the Mac and Cheese. The best part of the desert bar is the soft swirl ice cream. Seems like one of the most popular things at Sweet Tomatoes. One last thing, ask the people in the bakery for freshly baked chocolate chips cookies and they will give you some. If you don't ask they won't give you any. Usually, they just pass the cookies around on platters so if you want to make sure you get some cookies then just ask. So the workers are always available for you and they are picking up your finished plates and bowls. They always clean up the dirty tables pretty quickly so overall the place is really clean. So overall the place has pretty good food and if you looking for healthy food then this is the place. One warning, don't over eat cause it's so easy. So enjoy a healthy meal once in awhile.If you've never been to a Sweet Tomatoes in the past you already know what to expect because every city has a place like it.Grab a tray, grab a plate, walk down a line just like the one they had at my elementary school and load up with lettuce, spinach, cold pastas, tomatoes, cucumbers, etc. Have a seat and congratulate yourself for eating healthy (ignore the 3 cups of Thousand Island dressing you also got).Then, I guess as a reward for healthy eating, you grab a bowl of soup to up your sodium intake for the day. Then you grab a few slices (more like 3x2" pieces) of pizza, some muffins and devour your second course.Still feeling good about your healthy eating choices you grab a bowl, put a brownie on the bottom and cover it with ice cream, add some sprinkles and you're golden!Don't get me wrong. I'm OK with all of the above. My kids love this place and, since they both have hollow legs, it's an economical choice and it must be healthier than McDonalds.
San Felipe's Cantina=Have you ever had the Lean Cuisine chicken enchiladas? Have you ever been to a super obnoxious sorority party, where all the blonde bimbos are tanked and dancing on tables and such? Have you ever been totally ignored by wait and bar staff even though you've doused yourself in lighter fluid and set yourself on fire? Well. Then. You've been to San Felipe's. Lower than mediocore food. Except for the grilled fish tacos. Thus 2 stars. Not 1. When I lived at DCRanch, I thought this would be a less expensive, less formal place to hang out. Hmmm...other than grabbing a quick beer here I'd sooner stay at home, eat Doritos and watch a sorority slasher film. What do Kristin and Pierre say? Meh? Yea, that's it. Meh!
PINKAOW Thai Restaurant=Decided to have dinner here and catch up with a girlfriend of mine. Since it was conveniently located on Eastern between Silverado Ranch and Serene we both decided to eat here.Location is pretty good easy to spot it's in the same shopping center as Bjs restaurant.As we entered we were greeted with a happy smile with the staff in their authentic native thai clothing. The entire restaurant gave that Thai feel and the ambiance was amazing too as well. Not to loud and you can easily hold a conversation at your table without screaming.We ordered the Chinese broccoli with chicken which was delicious. Been loving the greens lately since i'm on a special diet.Next we also ordered the pineapple fried rice mixed with cashews, raisins , and pineapple literally served on a pineapple. Really awesome!.For another entree we ordered the Sea Bass which was to die for, it was incredible delicious, it better be it was pricey and from BangkokFor noddles we decided to have the Silver Noodle Salad, a bit too spicy for me but still really good.We were both kind of disappointed since the mango salad was not available. They only have it during mango season time,For drinks we had a lycee martini which was really good it did not even taste like alcohol and also Thai coffee.. bomb digidy also!For dessert we decided to have the fried banana with coconut ice cream! I really loved it! Specially the coconut ice cream, it tasted the same in Thailand.As far as authenticity of the food it tastes exactly the same in Thailand.I would love to go back to this place and suggest it to everyone. I also heard there is live entertainment on the weekends so I might go back and check it out.I just came back here after a rather long absence and felt the place deserved an upgrade. Still not my favorite Thai place in town, but they are solid and the service is great. Also, a little disappointed by their spice levels. I ordered a five and it felt more like a 2. I'll definitely kick up the heat on my next visit. Liberal with drink refills and cleared plates quickly as well.
Panda Express=The Panda Express at the Venetian served me the worst Panda Express food ever - and I LIKE Panda Express! The food was already ready, like all Pandas, but it tasted overly salty (I didn't even order anything bizarre), and everyone else with me agreed.Can't beat the convenience factor, of course. Maybe I caught them on a bad day?Picked up two entrees (~$6; credit cards accepted) to serve as a poor man's brunch. Can't beat this location's convenience, and service was good. If only they were open 24 hours...Before you judge me, Panda Express is my guilty pleasure, and like all guilty pleasures, you're not too choosy after an all-nighter. I know Panda isn't real Chinese food, but nor is it Americanized Chinese; it's Panda. And since they're inexplicably hard to find on the East Coast, I lust after their chow mein once in a blue moon[1].[1] Yes, it's sad, I know.Even though the same basic types of alcohol are served in different bars, not all bars are the same. Some bars have bartenders with heavy hands and some don't. It can make or break the experience.Well, the same idea applies to chain cheap eateries such as Subway, Chipotle, and of course, Panda Express. Some servers have heavy hands and some don't. It can make or break the experience.Luckily, the staff here has (very) heavy hands. It made my day and broke the button on my slacks.This location is the closest if you're staying at MGM and Excalibur. The employees are friendly and the food is good. The prices are a little high here, but then again, this is Vegas for you.Cheers!
SanTan Brewing Company=SanTan Brewery in downtown Chandler is a great place to enjoy fantastic beer at low prices. Opened in 2007 and located in historic downtown Chandler, SanTan occupies a former bank building where some artifacts were left intact. Stacks of safety deposit boxes have been re-purposed into seating and the old vault remains as an office for the pub.The open space is relaxed and comfortable, though with many hard surfaces it tends be on the noisy side. For a quieter experience, opt for one of the many seats on the patio, where there can be great people watching.Summer heat requires ice-cold beer. For me, beer is like enjoying a really good piece of bread. Grains and yeast that are mixed together to produce something that is so organic, hearty and satisfying.I tend to order dark beers, since I enjoy the deep robust flavors, and SanTan's Gordo Stout ($4.75) certainly fit the bill. With smooth notes of chocolate and coffee, this beer wasn't as heavy and belly filling as you might expect. The Gordo is one of the lowest alcohol content beer made here and, for me, one of the most flavorful.The menu at SanTan ranges from salads and pizzas to sandwiches and burgers, with most being $12 or less. There are so many tasty appetizers that it's easy to go a little crazy and order too many. The Downtown Sliders ($8), three juicy mini burgers topped with beer-braised onions and beer mustard, were way too easy to eat. The SanTan Stingers ($8.50) are wonton wrappers filled with Applewood-smoked bacon and spicy jack cheese, then deep friend for a light crispy crunch. Soft Pub Pretzels ($6.50) were were another good choice.As for entrees, the SanTan Ruben ($9) was piled high with juicy and flavorful corned beef, Swiss cheese, sauerkraut and Thousand Island dressing. The tender Rib-Eye Philly ($10.50) was wrapped in warm soft beer bread and packed with beef, peppers and onions, then slathered with house beer cheese. Each sandwich came with French fries that were worthy of their own plate.SanTan Brewery offers dessert, but you might want to learn from me and pace yourself.Going here reminded me of a How I Met Your Mother Episode...you know the one where Marshall scours all of New York City to find the restaurant where he had the best burger ever.Well, after I left San Tan Brewery, I hope I never forget this place like Marshall did, because it was here that I have had the best beef burger I have ever had. And this beats Joe's Farm Grill as well as all the other hole in the wall places I've prodded my way into. We ordered both the Stuffed Aegean Burger ($1!) and the Stuffed Mushroom Burger ($11). The Aaegean was the winner. It is a 1/2 pound of beef patty stuffed with cheese, basil, and kalamata olives. It is topped with feta cheese and pesto aioli. The second both my friend and I bit into it, we looked at each other and were like no way. It's that good. No, I can't describe it. Can you describe Da Vinci's Mona Lisa? No, you cannot. The best I can do is that it was like Katy Perry's song, "Firework" was coming to life in my oropharynx. The Stuffed Mushroom burger tempered my drive to give this place 5 stars. This is another 1/2 pound patty of beef stuffed with cheese & mushrooms topped that is topped with swiss and Gordo Stout braised mushrooms. Both burgers were ordered Medium Well, but it seemed like this one was well done. Definitely a good portion of melted cheese and mushrooms, but the burger overall seemed drier. The waitress was very helpful and attentive. The atmosphere was interesting. There was a group of 15 girls who had just got done with a dance recital that looked like clowns with all the makeup their moms had plastered over their faces....so definitely good entertainment value.Try the Aaegean burger. It's for your own good. P.S For your side, you can't go wrong with the house fries which are crispy and well seasoned or the jalepno cesar salad, which comes loaded with parm cheese, chopped tomatoes, croutons, and a hint of you guessed it - jalapenos.A shining beacon in downtown Chandler beckoning all drinkers and beer enthusiasts alike. My first trip here I experienced the winter warmer, the Thanksgiving seasonal weighing in at 9.5% ABV. Don't let the ginger snaps (served alongside the beer) fool you, this ginger-spiced ale will keep you warmed far into the night. Another beer worth trying all year-round is the Devil's Ale, one of their 'lighter' options. San Tan is a vibrant, energetic place. Recently, we sat on the patio admiring the lights adorning the shops and street. It was chilly out but the heaters were keeping us nice and toasty. Need something to go with your beer? The decent sized menu is sure offer something you'll like. For appetizers, try the hummus and pretzels, both big enough to share. Avoid the chips and dip. The Mac N Cheese burger was pretty incredible but they all sound really good.  After hearing about San Tan for years, I'm happy to call it one of my favorite bars in AZ.I have been to SanTan many times and have never penned a review, what the heck?? I have brought friends of from out of state here, been here for friends birthday celebrations, meeting up with friends for happy hour, well it doesn't take much of a reason for me to go, I just really like SanTan Brewing Company.Lets see for appetizer, you have to try the SanTan Slingers,  its smoked bacon, fresh jalapenos, pepper jack & cream cheese in a crisp eggroll with ranch & green onions for the dipping sauce, oh man it's the perfect blend of heat & creaminess. And the Soft Pub Pretzels, omg yum, yum, yum. Though most of the time I do wind up eating off the apps menu, I have enjoyed a burger or 2, I have to say my favorite is the Stuffed Green Chili Burger, burger stuffed with pepper jack cheese topped with roasted poblanos, grilled onions & melted pepper jack and added a side of their buttermilk onion rings, oh damn! SO GOOD!Throughout the year I bounce between the SunSpot Gold or Gordo Stout. The SunSpot is a beautiful blond ale that is just delish & crisp, perfect on a hot summer night here in the valley. When I want something more heaver I go with the Gordo Stout, hinted flavors of coffee & chocolate, it's the best of both worlds! Honestly you can't go wrong with any of the SanTan's beers. But during the winter season say hello to the Sex Panther Double Chocoalate Porter, a sexy smooth chocolate beer, oh man this is some good good stuff! Love it!SanTan is another great local brewery in the valley that has great food & great beer.I came here for lunch on a Thursday with co-workers for a team lunch. Nicely decorated brewery and very loud. What else would you expect. There were four parties of 10+ people so it was very busy which is a good sign that people like to come here. Even though there were so many people our server was all on top of us. Got our drinks out and took our orders in a timely fashion. I ordered one of their signature burgers. The Stuffed Bacon Cheese Burger with fries. Really good burger. Thick. Juicy. Just enough cheese oozing out with two thick pieces of bacon sticking out. Excellent burger. I also loved their beer battered fries. Really good. I got a side of ranch dressing to dip the fries. One of the best fries I've eaten. As for the service, I understand they had four huge parties and that's the reason it took a little longer to bring the food out. Everybody at the table enjoyed the food which was probably a first. The server also refilled out cups regularly. So service was really good, food was excellent, atmosphere was great (I didn't even want to go back to work). What else could you ask for. I'll probably be back. Enjoy.
Serrano's Mexican Restaurant=My favorite Mexican food in town. It looks like a hole in the wall from the outside in a sketchy part of town, but inside you are greeted by a courteous and friendly staff. Everything we have tried have been packed with flavor and was very reasonably priced. I have tried their al pastor burrito enchilada style, fresh chips and guacamole, and camarones ala diabla.I cannot decide which I liked best...oh yeah, I can... their FRIED ICE CREAM! It was perfect. On our most recent visit we sampled their flan which was also great. On our first visit we overheard a table near us raving about the food, and the woman who brought out the food simply said "We make it the way we would at home". I think that pretty much sums up the food.This is our go to place for Mexican food, and whoever it was that compared this to Roberto's ought to have their head checked. I mean, I guess you can't beat the complementary side of e-coli at Roberto's.
Jacquee's Espresso=Jacquee's Espresso is a delightful little deli hidden in the Two Renaissance Square Tower. Had it not been for a co-worker taking me on my first day of work, I doubt I'd have ever wandered in there on my own, but that's beside the point....The point is that Jacquee's rocks! Whatever you do, don't hate on Jacquee's. If you do and I'm around, I might just bust a ninja kick in your face. (But probably not...I rarely reveal my ninja skills outside my apartment.) I have been to Jacquee's at least once or twice a week for the last six months and I have zero complaints. They have scrumptious sandwiches, salads, soups, wraps, and cookies to die for, all big and soft like. I am a big fan of the sandwiches. Jacquee's makes the kind of sandwiches I would make for myself at home if I wasn't so lazy. Boar's head meats, hearty breads, and vegetables so fresh they make me wonder why I ever slum it at Subway/Blimpies/Quizno's.So basically, in essence, on the whole, the point I am trying to make, to get across, to fundamentally express is that if you work downtown and have not been to Jacquee's for lunch yet, you are going tomorrow (or today if you are reading this in the a.m.). I feel I have done my civic duty by writing this review! Then again, maybe I should have kept Jacquee's a secret so the lines aren't so long....
Amore Taste of Chicago=We were in the hood and decided to to pop in. I'm rarely in the mood for pizza, but it sounded great today. We were gravitating towards a white pizza, but the lady helping us sold us on how good the deep dish is that we decided we can wait the 45 minutes for one (if you know that's what you want- call it in and drive on over there so you're not sitting there forever) , talk and nosh on a app. She told us about different specials not on the menu so we took up the special large deepdish with 2 toppings at $15 and some change instead of it's normal price (I believe about $22). We got ours with spinach and beef....think of it like a pizza lasagna!  If your server doesn't tell you ask specials- ask because she named off a few. The BF was feeling the fried zucchini ($6.95) for our app and I like that it was thin slices so you get a lot of crumb crust. I normally dip in ranch, but that marinara was off the hook so fo'getta abou' ranch! Our server brought us hot bread and though I love me some balsamic and oil, I sopped the rest of the marinara up. Once it came, I was so hungry, yet I only ate 1 and 1/4 a slice. It hits like a brick! The crust is consistently crunchy throughout and the fillings are all quality. We heard our lady chatting with the table behind me and they were talking about Chicago and where they grew up to see if they were neighbors or something so you know that they're definitely legit people here too. She was very sweet, checked on us often and we never had to ask for a drink refill.I'm not much for a pizza person, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. Definitely I think if I have a hankering for pizza again, I'll keep this place on the short list!Decided to finally give this place a try.  It's been on my To Do List for a while now.  The menu is extensive and appetizing......I couldn't make up my mind.  Good thing our server, Rosemary, helped us out.  She pointed out that they had a $4.95 lunch menu and that I should try one of those items.  I looked at the lunch menu and decided for that price I'd order 2 items!I ordered the 1 Topping Thin Crust Personal Pizza w/Sausage ($4.95) and an Italian Beef Sandwich w/Fries ($4.95) with a side of Hot Giardiniera ($.50).The food came out after a short wait.  I went for the Beef Sandwich first.....dipped it in a little Au Jus and added some Giardiniera.....after one bite, I WAS HOOKED!  This is some seriously good Chicago style Beef!  I'm sooo glad I ordered it!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8olG8J91NG_QU92WHG5QfA?select=AxzEEvoOb0DEaYNr8YaiVgThe Fries were pretty good....they're Crinkle Cut Fries and had the perfect amount of Salt added to it.Next up was the Sausage Pizza.  I ordered it 'well done' because I prefer my Pizza that way.  They obliged and it came out perfectly!  The Crust was nice and crispy and the Sausage was AMAZING!  Another score!  It reminded me of Fox's Pizza in the Southside of Chicago when my friend took me there.  The size of the Pizza is pretty good too for $4.95!  I'd guess it's around a 10" Pizza.  I was expecting something smaller....it exceeded my expectations.Overall, it was an awesome lunch.....good food and good times!  Rosemary, our server, was amazing and friendly.  I love going to places like this where people actually care about their customers.I can't wait to go back and try their Stuffed Pizza, Deep Dish Pizza, Chicago Hot Dog, and many many more things I saw on the menu!Return Factor - 100%Dare I say that I like Amore's deep dish pizza even better than the pizza I had in Chicago? No need to hop on a plane to go all the way to Gino's when we have Amore Taste of Chicago here in Vegas. My favorite thing about it... It's hard to narrow it down to only one so here's a few. Their sauce is so flavorful and made from real crushed tomatoes. The ingredients are extremely fresh. Their thick crunchy cornmeal crust is never oily. Every time I have ordered from here, my pizza has been perfectly cooked. I love this pizza! I'm just mad that I tried it because now I'm hooked and I'm going to get fat. When I become too out of shape and have to give up modeling because of this guys, I blame Amore! It's all their fault! Don't say I didn't warn you. ;)I have never been to Chicago so I can't vouch for the authentic taste but I know good food when I taste it! I started off with the Bruschetta that had fresh tomato and garlic over toasty bread. I like that they didn't drench it with olive oil because I don't like when the bread gets soggy. It was perfectly delicious!  Lately I've been obsessed with artichokes so I was happy to find their White Pizza. I ended up ordering the small 10" pizza for $13.50. The tasty pizza also had artichokes, spinach, garlic, mozzarella with drizzled olive oil.  The cheese was gooey just how I like it! I ended the meal with the Fried Dough for dessert. The warm dough was sprinkled with powdered sugar and trickled with honey. When I thought I couldn't eat any more I found room for these little bits of sweetness. The atmosphere is nice and cozy. The tables have different scenes of Las Vegas on them and the walls are decorated with celebrity, sports and Chicago memorabilia. It's a nice place to meet with friends and family because the service was also very welcoming. My drink never went empty the whole time I was there!After reading Nelson and Sylvia Q.'s reviews of Amore TOC and seeing pics, I resolved to go here and sample authentic Chicago-style deep dish pizza pie.  And, after ordering a medium Pepperoni & Mushroom deep dish pie for myself, what I learned is that what is served here really is not just pizza--but extremely filling pizza PIE!  There's plenty of filling, and the cheesy and saucy gooeyness tasted great, but there is also a great deal of almost inch high and high-backed cornmeal crust to these pizzas.  After eating a large cup of homemade Minestrone Soup and an excellent House Salad with lettuce, tomato, white cucumber, pepperoncini, mozzarella, croutons, and a zesty Italian Dressing that also turned out to be large in size, plus 2 small pieces of Diane's thin-crust Canadian Bacon & Cashews Pizza with Extra Cheese, I could only finish 3 slices of my pie before calling it a night.  And after giving away 2 slices to friends who had to cancel going out with us to Amore the last minute because of a sudden air conditioning leak, the following evening after downing another salad I was again barely able to eat the remaining 3 slices at home for dinner.  The deep dish slices were formidable, but they were really good: cheesy, saucy in a sweet way, and with a buttery crust that was not charred in the least.  What I also found to be remarkable is the consistency of Amore's deep dish pies.  Every one I saw being transported through the dining room looked perfect--with a golden crust and a smoking, piping hot center.  Although not as remarkable, I liked the taste of the thin-crust pizza as well, which was very cheesy and flavorful, but its crust is more of a cracker consistency like one will be likely to find in Rome.  The Minestrone Soup deserves mention in its own right, for it was first class.  Very hot, it sported pieces of carrots, Italian beans, bits of tomato, cubes of potato, and Ditalini pasta in a hearty stew-like broth.  And, the mozzarella-laced House Salad was very good, too.            Rosemary and Joey were great, friendly hosts who, despite never seeing either of us before, made us feel welcome, and seated us right away in a crowded room.  Our server, too, was very attentive.  I came for deep dish pizza, and found it to be every bit as good as Chicago's Uno, Due, and Gino's, all of which I have previously enjoyed in the Windy City.  But the next time I come here--which I expect will be soon--I am going to try some of the other great-looking Italian dishes I saw pass by on their way to other diners, such as Shrimp Francaise and a Sausage & Pepper Platter.  This is clearly not a one note eatery!It pains me extremely to give Amore only 3 stars!!  We have been going to/ordering from here very often for over a year, even when I was diagnosed with Celiac and had to go gluten-free. I waited patiently only ordering Chicken Vesuvio, until they recently started carrying gluten-free products.  Now I realize when ordering in I take the risk of being contaminated, but thankfully not only am I very aware  but as well am a bit paranoid...  I have never had a problem ordering from there gluten or otherwise, until tonight!!  I ordered gluten-free pasta and received the complete opposite in WHEAT!!  I called questioning and it was treated nonchalantly as if a pizza arrived with wrong toppings rather than the fact I was almost poisoned, which would land me in the hospital immediately...  Not only were they completely flippant about what just happened,. I even needed to be the one to bring up about being refunded!  After a brief verbal brawl I finally just gave the phone back to the delivery guy, since he was yelling for it back, he gave us our refund and I handed him back the re-made meal, there was no way I was eating their food ever again!As I said before, I hate deducting stars from a place I love so much but if them giving me wheat pasta wasn't bad enough they showed little to no remorse to a VERY FREQUENT customer!!  Not cool!!  Not to mention even if  it didn't work out for me to eat there again and feel comfortable, I have a very hungry boyfriend whose always enjoyed the taste of their foodlll Until the truth of their personalities came out!UPDATE: This review has gone down to 1 star after being treated in such a POOR manner by the manager/owner.  He truly lost me as a customer when he said "I only ordered this stuff for YOU POEOPLE."  And continued on stating that he would take if off if he could.  I have never thought the bigotry I would endure in life would be because of an illness which limits what I can eat!  Shame on this place!  I could have become seriously ill from their mistake and his only response was a chuckle saying, "What, am I supposed to sign off on all Gluten-Free items that leave the kitchen?"  No Jackhole, you are supposed to educate your staff when you take on the responsibility of serving a very large community of people who are doing this not by choice but for survival!I am never going to be the same person again since Yelp came into my life! If you are a "Avid Yelper" it's like a religious revelation..Hallelujah! CAN I GET AMEN BROTHERS!  *AMEN!!* Lets Eat!!Having bookmarked ATC for six months prior to my trip,Amore Taste of Chicago is a place that I made a point to stop at!.Being deprived in Hawaii (Note: Chi-Town Deep Dish Pizza Co in Hawaii isn't even close to this)and not plan on visiting Chicago in the near future. We set out our journey to find ATC. The drive was not bad from downtown and willing to do anything or drive anywhere I didn't care...Arriving to ATC I was very very excited!  Finally my wait is over!..Walking in...I just LOVED the interior of this place,with all the pictures of Chicago Sports Greats and Celebrities that filled the walls.It just puts you in the mood for whats to come next.. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8olG8J91NG_QU92WHG5QfA#L6-nCU2crqXwISzmLaB0WQWe order:*Reg house salad which includes fresh mozzarella cheese. The salad could feed 4 people easily. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8olG8J91NG_QU92WHG5QfA#TfxXspSgSZ6bJ5xaD--raA*Chicago Style Deep Dish 14" with Sausage and Pepperoni pie http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8olG8J91NG_QU92WHG5QfA#TuP3Fgf3fxeEFut83VA3xwI was just in awe to seeing our server Rosemary scoop the first slice out of that thick beautiful pie. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8olG8J91NG_QU92WHG5QfA#5hE8XUhSbkfC52cWsjVHvQ  The thickness of the slice,fresh tomato sauce and melting cheese oozing out was just an awesome site to see.Funny how digging into a pizza with a fork and knife never felt so right. The first thing that hits you is the great the flavor of the fresh tomatoes bursting when it hits your palate,spiciness of the sausage and pepperoni,Oh My God How Buttery The Crust Is...OMG! I just had a Foodgasm!Our friend who had just returned from Chicago the previously week also was enjoying the pizza with us remarked it was like being in Chicago again!Our server Rosemary was so friendly and helpful with all my questions I asked.Rosemary: Where are you all from?Me: Hawaii !Rosemary: From Hawaii? *With a surprised look* How did you find us?Me: Yelp!  ATC has some great reviews and I had to try great deep dish pizza! (Thank You all my LV Yelp friends!)Just some helpful information:*The normal wait for a Deep Dish is 45minutes*You can call ahead for seating and pre-order your pie. It will cut down the waiting time. http://www.amoretasteofchicago.com/*Located in Parkview Plaza.Big Mahalos! To ATOC and Rosemary for the great Deep Dish Experience!I finally got the chance to try Amore's deep dish pizza. A little pre planning was involved because I knew that it would take about 40 minutes to prepare. I called in my order before we left just so we wouldn't have to wait so long. We came in and ordered some cheesey bacon fries while we waited for our order. We both ordered cokes but they were still cleaning their machine so they offered us some canned coke instead. It was nice that they didn't make us choose another soda flavor.Our pizza was ready once we finished the fries. The sauce had just the right amount of sweetness to it. The cheese was also nice and gooey. The slices are big! One piece would be sufficient for a meal. We were really satisfied with the pizza!Admittedly I was unable to actually eat here but my review might explain...We arrived about 7pm to a pretty full restaurant, good sign that a good meal is ahead.  Although there is no sign asking us to wait or seat ourselves, we wait up front to be be sure.  After about 5 minutes we decided it must be seat yourself as not one person from the staff, who eyed us several times, approaches us to help.  As I head for one of the three empty tables, a man appears out of the kitchen and says "Can I help you?"  Sure I reply, we'd like a seat.  He replies, "Well sit up front and wait, there are no tables", quickly followed by "did you call ahead? Everybody knows to call ahead, we're a busy place"It's at that point we decide to liberate ourselves from the rudeness and eat elsewhere.  I'm sorry I didn't know the Amore rules, perhaps they should post them somewhere.  I'm happy they are so successful but I do draw the line at treating your customers rudely because you're busy.I came here for dinner with some friends the other night to try out the much talked about stuffed pizza served here. Walking in we were greeted and taken to a table. The place was half full and had a good vibe. The walls are lined with memories of Chicago, celebrity pictures and yes, I even heard a songs by Chicago while eating LOL! There were several TVs playing various Chicago games as well.After ordering a "1/2 cheese & 1/2 Sausage Stuffed Pizza" (large) priced at $19.50 our server told us that it would take about 45 minutes to make so I ordered "Cheesy Garlic Bread" priced at $3.95 to grub on while the pizza was made. The cheesy garlic bread tasted good, but average. While waiting for the pizza I observed a couple different things going on. There was some sort of celebration with he staff because they all gathered to eat a ice cream cake (didn't look like spumoni to me!) and then there was the couple who got engaged. Yep, after they finished eating, he pulled out a ring and proposed. I don't know if this was where they had a first date or what, but it was interesting! Now let me get to the pizza. When our server (friendly and courteous) brought it to the table I was very excited. It looked so good! This was one cheesy, saucy, good kind of mess! The sauce is very sweet, I actually liked it, but if you aren't a fan of sweet sauces you might not like it. I used a fork to get every last tomato off my plate. The crust is supposed to have a buttery flavor however I didn't taste that. It was more doughy tasting, but certainly edible. I am usually just a cheese pizza kind of girl, but next time I would get a couple toppings to help balance the amount of cheese in the pizza. There was something about the crust that was just not right though. Windy City still puts out the best Deep Dish in my opinion. my husband thought the pizza here was very good, but he also thinks Pizza Hut is good. Enough said. Out front they have benches if you want to eat outside. Besides pizza you can choose from different pastas, salads, sandwiches and dessert. Catering is available.The pizza. That is all you need to come here for. My wife and I met some friends here for dinner and shared a stuffed pizza. Half was sausage and half was cheese. The amount of cheese that was in our pizza was insanely good. The sauce was real good and even with all the sauce and cheese the pizza still had a crisp crust. We also had some garlic cheese bread that was cheesy like the pizza but just okay. Our waitress was cool and checked on us enough. The stuffed pizza takes 45 minutes so call ahead or plan to hang.My family loves Italian food, loves it SO much that I rarely eat out at Italian spots because I've had a lifetime's fill of it (and the hips to prove it). So, when the family decided it was time to go out to eat, the majority voted for Italian and I let out a "BOO!" accompied with a pouty-face. When Olive Garden was suggested, I quickly re-routed the decision and we landed at ATC. It was a busy parking lot and my grandmother is O2 dependent and uses a walker. Since the place has huge windows, the manager saw this and opened a side door for us. This set the tone for the wonderful service we would receive throughout the night.We were seated right away, a waitress came over, took our drink order and handed us menus. The menu is extensive. Tons of pasta dishes, soups, salads, sandwiches, meats, pizzas, and house specialities. Pizzas take about 40 minutes to make so we passed. There is also a separate pizza counter for people placing to-go orders or who opted for pick up.Drinks came out with the quickness as well as the perfect crusty homemade italian bread. Freshly baked, crunchy on the outside, soft in the middle. We each ordered a cup of the soup (minestrone) and needed a bit longer to peruse the menu. Minestrone was great. A lot veggies, homemade, and it had a little, tiny kick to it. Bravo! Never tasted a soup like this before.I've recently broken up with gluten. So I was stoked to see gluten free pasta available. I ordered gluten-free pasta and asked for a spicy arrabiata. It was awesome garlicky, flavorful, and packed heat.Other dishes were sausage and peppers, with smacks of gardeny fresh peppers, mild Italian sausage and excellently balanced sauce. The baked rigatoni was also excellent and came with a massive amount mozzarella cheese. So heavenly sinful! (Did I just make an oxymoron, uh...) Our servers worked in a team effort, drinks were full, we never left wanting or waiting. The owner stopped by our table to see how everything was and told us about his establishment. I'm always way impressed when I see a hands on approach.I love that there is a quality, decently priced, casual Italian place in my next of the woods. When I am feeling some sort of self-hate, I'm going to get all up in that deep dish. I think we'll be instant besties (damn you, gluten).I'm totally in Amore with Amore and love is never wrong.Ive been wanting to check out Amore and finally came in for dinner and  tried the deep dish Chicago style pizza.  Parking was no hassle since its located in a large retail  center.  I took the suggestions from other yelpers and called in my order a head of time. The pizza wasn't ready after being seated so I ordered an appetizer of shrimp scampi - served with garlic bread. The shrimps were deveined, whole and yummy. When the pizza arrived I was taken back of the thickness and contained homemade sausage, mushrooms and the chunks of tomatoes that were sweet and delicious. The pizza was packed with quality ingredients and the dough was thick but not overly cooked. I ended picking off of three slices all the ingredients and passed on the ends of the crust. Overall a positive experience here with friendly waitresses who were service oriented! As for the pizza I'm torn between being fan of regular or deep dish. I guess if both were in front of me I would indulge in either or!Campy at BEST! Don't expect a comp or ANY discount here...WAS good...NOT good anymore...Changed ingredients...It appears the Owner is unappreciative that he's still in business. Maybe cutting corners now...???For all the pizza "Knowers" out there, if you spend your money on a pie from here....you'll have wished you searched yelp for other joints...you can take THAT to the BANK! Good luck WE DO NOT Recommend AMORES to anyone....anymore.My first time at Amore was far from a positive one. As suggested by several reviews, I called ahead to have a deep dish put in for us to dine in later. They told us it would take about 45 minutes to get done, which we expected, so we showed up about 30 minutes in to make sure we didn't get cold food. Well, we ended up getting a cold pizza anyway, and even worse, there was hair in it. When we told our waitress, she acted like there was no way it could have happened and made excuses. To be fair, they offered to make a new pizza, but I sure didn't want to wait there another 45 minutes, and I honestly don't know who would.Before I found the hair, I still can't say I agree that the deep dish is the best out there. I definitely wouldn't recommend sitting in the place for 45 minutes to wait for it to come out either. Maybe it's because mine was cold and I didn't get the full effect, but I just wasn't a huge fan. There was very little flavor to it, the cheese not being hot and melty wasn't ideal, and the dough felt undercooked. As a whole, it just wasn't right and was really disappointing after hearing how great it's supposed to be.About the only thing I enjoyed on my first visit were the appetizers we ordered. Both the Fried Ravioli and Bruschetta were simple but delicious, and I'd recommend trying either.Against my better judgement, we came back here for a second time...more because it's one of the wifeys favorite spots. This time around, almost everything was much better. Our waitress was extremely nice, had our drinks refilled quickly, and it was overall just a much better experience. I couldn't bring myself to order another deep dish, so this time around I tried something new with the Sausage and Peppers Platter...I'm actually really surprised to see this isn't talked about more in reviews. It's literally served on a platter with a pretty healthy portion of sausage, peppers, potatoes and onions. The sausage is a nice coarse ground Italian sausage that is cooked perfect, and has just the right amount of spice. Both the peppers and onions were nicely done with still a little bit of crispness and not soggy at all. But what really makes this dish even better is the white wine sauce it's made with. It's absolutely delicious, and everything really soaks in all the flavors from it. Even after I was stuffed from eating it all, I couldn't help but grabbing some of their basket bread and dipping it in the sauce...it really is that good!Had I reviewed Amore the first time around, it definitely would have been a 1 star review. There really isn't much that I hate more than finding stuff in my food, and usually I wouldn't even go back after I do, especially if it's hair. But I gotta give credit where credits due. The Sausage and Peppers Platter alone is worth coming here for. And if we were to come back with someone who wanted a deep dish, I'd probably give it another shot. I just wouldn't order it again on my own, and with it being one of their signature items, that says a lot.Overall though, Amore is "A-OK"!Items Selected:Thin Crust - Half Cheese, Half PepperoniDeep Dish - Sausage and MushroomCannoliSaid by some to be the best Chicago Style Pizzeria in Sin City, or perhaps just the one most decked-out in Windy City swag, it was for lunch on Saturday that a party of three stopped in to Amore Taste of Chicago and inhabiting a table in front of a mural of the 2013 Blackhawks a 'taste' of two pizzas plus a pair of Cannolis was fine, if not memorable - certainly not a spot worth going out of the way for unless one is completely inexperienced or overly curious to verify whether the rumors are true.More sizable than one would gather from the exterior and brighter than many places of its ilk as a result of large windows exposed to the strip-mall parking lot out front, it was to an empty dining room that we arrived as doors clicked open and remaining that way throughout the duration of our 60 minute stay the service was expectedly attentive, pies requested to be delivered as completed with thin crust presented after a mere ten minute wait.Admittedly benefited by a Midwestern upbringing, not to mention a sister who lives minutes from Wicker Park, suffice it to say that the circle cut into rectangles was far less novel to me than it may be to others while tomato sauce seemingly straight from a can did little to improve rather flavorless crust, the mozzarella not particularly impressive either while Pepperoni was the typical oily store-bought stuff.Not really expecting much from the deep-dish considering the overall quality of the traditional pie it was with a medium-thick version removed from the pan and served atop cardboard that the meal progressed, the same ingredient quality generally marring crust that would have been better off with more butter left to caramelize though the sausage and mushrooms were a touch more successful than pepperoni  as toppings, each cannoli perfectly serviceable with a shattering shell filled to order, though  far from the best available in town.**Generally not the sort to assume that Las Vegas should meet or exceed the quality of signature dishes from cities a thousand or so miles away, Amore Taste of Chicago simply is not as good as any of the classics offered within the confines of The Second City, a more substantial search necessary to see if it is even the best in the (702.)
Middle Eastern Bakery & Deli=I can't say enough about this place. I love to get lunch there, and leave with stuff to-go. They have some incredible home-made olives with different spices. I am an olive snob and can't say enough about them. You can also get hummus and baba ghanooj to go, as well as their freshly made (they are a bakery) pitas.  They also have some interesting mixes, canned beans, etc. They have a lot of Sadaf products which is cool because I used to actually mail order from them once in a while! On the lunch side, I love all their vegetarian food and often get a vegetarian platter or falafel sandwich or plate, etc. Their tabouli is out of this world good - lots of fresh mint and parsley, lemon juice, it's perfect if you are into the Lebanese taste. I've never ordered meat there but I've seen other people order it and it looked great. The food is delicious and home made tasting. Their baklava is superb. Split some with your lunch mate. If I were to succinctly describe their food it is fresh, healthy, authentic, and delicious. I gave it 5 stars. Not 5 stars like a fine dining type restaurant - 5 stars because they do their type of ethnic food with unfailing perfection and authenticity and consistency across multiple visits. Middle Eastern Bakery is keepin it REAL yo! ( blatant fishing for cool ratings!)Creeping senility: I thought I'd reviewed this place in 2005. The public area is probably about 600 square feet, but every inch is jammed with Fertile Crescent / Mediterranean goodness.This is a bakery, restaurant, and grocery. The restaurant part of the operation has a an extensive menu of flesh-based and vegetarian options. There are plates, salads, and sandwiches. The plates (kebabs, gyros, etc,.) usually come with a decadent rice pilaf, your choice of tabbouleh or Greek salad, and tsatsiki. There are a few grilled chicken dishes, and the chicken is always moist with a nice char.MEB&D also bottles its own spices. Not as diverse as Penzey's, but it's nice to have an option on 16th St. Hat tip to Adam M. on the olives -- they're delicious.Dessert? They serve different forms of baklava, turkish coffee, and homemade halvah (they'll slice off a piece with a scimitar-looking blade for a sample -- impress your friends!).Tips:- You can buy Greek tobacco soap.- The soup of the day is always avgolemono. It always will be until the mountains crumble and our love is through. Sometimes there's an excellent red lentil as a second option. - They have great par-cooked or reheatable stuff  -- it's in the frozen section.- MEB&D is an effective and affordable option to cater a party on short notice (I've done this).IMO the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. The components are all four-star, but the place gets the fifth for the "park-once, enjoy-many" experience.Had a great lunch here with my friends Sherry and Brandon. The two owners (I am guessing here, but father and son?) were very friendly and attentive. I had the baba ganouj pita with lettuce and tomato, and everyone else's food looked great (a chicken pita sandwhich and amazing looking lentil soup). I was throroughly entertained by a middle eastern television show (satellite I guess?), and the great mix of locals and business people. The market section is also great- you'll find loads of bottled cooking oils, spices, pickles and other pickled veggies, canned eggplant, cous cous and pastas, as well a fridge section with nice looking prepared foods. Will definitely return!The only thing that saved this from two stars was the baba ganoush and Gabi!  We shared a plate of the baba and hummus.  Covered with veggies and olive oil.  This was better than my actual lunch, which was a small Greek salad.  Uh...Greek????  It was romaine lettuce, a few chopped red peppers and purple onion slices with...Italian dressing.  Read: tasted just like WishBone.  Seriously.  I was disappointed, because I've read the reviews.  Maybe I just need to try other stuff.  It had a store inside, too, but I didn't have much time to check the shelves.Oh, and they pushed the lemonade BIG TIME!  Neither one of us wanted  it, but they did give us a free cup of it.  It was pretty good!I'll go again.I'm being on the generous side in giving MEBAD (as I've seen others refer to this place) 4 stars...It's kind of a unique gem that you don't see anymore with the owner at the register and a slamming lunch business in addition to the grocery items for sale that are rare foods, snacks, and ingredients from the Middle East.  I suggested this place for lunch with Amy D today after reading about it on Yelp awhile back... so happy I finally made it there myself!As Amy said in her review, we shared the baba ganoush and hummus plate and we each ordered a Greek Salad.  The salad was decent but nothing special, but the baba and hummus with the whole wheat pita was so damn tasty that we didn't even leave a bite.The free cup of homemade daily lemonade was a perk and the owner was really sweet... and I really did like the flavor of it.  I happen to love lemonade!I'll for sure return to MEBAD when I'm in the area to try more from their menu... this is the kind of place you want people to know about since you can tell how much work the owner and staff put into it each day.  If you haven't been, stop by... maybe I'll see you there - but please don't ask me to share my baba ganoush and hummus with you - I'm ordering my own next time!After living downtown a while now I had to come to think I'd never find a rebound for Haji Baba, I grew despondent and longed for their market and cheap delicious food, on the light rail rides that brought me to Haji Baba my mouth would water as I anticipated my falafel and hummus and favorite confections. I became resigned and assumed I'd just have to make the long trek down there every time the hunger struck.Then as fate would have it the "Middle Eastern Bakery & Deli" caught my eye, luring me in with the hint of what treasures I might find inside.Not only am I over you Haji Baba, I'm thriving, you see I've found a place that is probably better for me than you'd ever be. So with that in mind, and some appropriate mood music let me give a litany of reasons why i promise to love you complete Middle Eastern Bakery and Deli:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFIOu2sYxoc-your falafel is delicious, it is probably the best I've ever had, and for a few bucks you can buy a plate of them, appropriately tiny and crispy golden and crunchy on the outside and warm soft and flavourful on the inside. with tzatziki sauce or some warm hummus and soft pita they make a perfect meal.-your bakery and deli is so welcoming and comfortable and merely a short bike ride away from my place of residence-your prices are so reasonable i almost feel guilty..-your baked goods and confections and broad selection of middle eastern delicacies is heart warming to me.-and your lemonade! lordy. probably the best i've ever had, and i dont just say that about every piece of lemonade i've bagged.-your owners are so kind and welcoming, they make you feel right at home. ;^)i love middle eastern bakery and deli, and despite the generic name it is what it purports to be, and that's a quality that is becoming increasingly rare.Stop. Hummus time. That's right. This grocery story slash eatery is a perfect for for all your Mediterranean needs. If you're looking for items to purchase and take on the go, they have everything imaginable, hummus, pitas, meats, canned goods... Just about everything! However you can also dine in an order some of their delicious homemade food. I enjoyed the chicken kabobs accompanied with hummus and a greek salad. The meal was filling and fabulous. The hummus had a lot of flavor and the chicken was perfectly seasoned. I will definitely be returning to enjoy more and take some goodies for the road.
Market Grille Cafe=I think the best way to describe this place is consistent, fresh and clean eating. Nothing here is overly greasy, everything feels light enough that this isn't your guilty meal spot. If you have dietary restrictions or are gluten free, vegan, etc, they are very accommodating. There aren't many places up here I would say you could eat fresh, and this is a nice solitude. This used to be in the Centennial shopping in a small space, but they've upgraded to a sit down service restaurant just up the road. I much prefer it here since you're not bumping chairs with the table behind you. I didn't mind getting up to get my own drink and all before, but now they have servers here which makes sense for the space.I have tried a few things on the menu, but I normally get the same things. With entrees you can go a la carte with just rice or a combo has with salad, pita and tzatziki or hummus. Their rice is seasoned and soft, the hummus is more liquidy and plainer than I like but I do like their tzatziki. Pomegranate chicken is always cooked right and juicy. Greek Trio has moussaka, patstitsio, spanakopita. I think overall those are decent versions, but moussaka is my favorite of the 3.Gyro plate/Vasilios plate gyros are soft and never dried out, comes with rice, salad, pita, tzatziki and hummus already. Gyro pizza is different, but good! Think of it as like a open faced gyro sandwich with tomato sauce as a base.  Combination platter is a appetizer but makes for a good vegetarian meal too with hummus, babaganoush, salad, lots of pita, and some falafel. I think their falafel here is just okay, they are sort've dense when I prefer a fluffier and moist inside.Their cheesecake here is surprisingly good. They do a baklava crust instead of graham cracker so that little bit does it over the top. I get the pumpkin cheesecake usually. Baklava is decent, but not my favorite in town. People who work here are pretty friendly and generally attentive. It's a  family owned business and I like to support our locals.
Cien Agaves Tacos & Tequila=My lovely daughter Whitney wanted to take me to the movies today.It was delightful to get a chance to put on my Tuesday best and head out into the mean streets of Old Town Scottsdale for lunch and a matinee!It was Taco Tuesday so my thoughts naturally turned to Cien Agaves Tacos and Tequila.The name, Cien Agaves means "one hundred, green, spiny plants" but I suspect there is more to the name than that...they also sell tequila...lots and lots of tequila. In fact, they sell more the one hundred kinds of tequila...a wide selection of various types and quality of tequilas that range all the way from the stuff they siphon out of the gas tank of a 1978 Toyota pick-up truck in Nogales to tequila that was, evidently, made from platinum plated agaves (at least if the price of a shot is to be believed).They even have a "tequila club"...nice! I used to belong to a "tequila club" when I was young and bulletproof...I would drink "tequila" (or agaves, as they call it here) until they (whoever "they" are) needed a club to get me back under control...I could literally fly under the influence of crazy juice:)I decided not rejoin Cien Agaves tequila club...you should all be thanking your lucky stars:)I hadn't been to Cien Agaves for quite a while and I am glad my sweet daughter took me there for lunch today (a euphemism...dear old dad bought, but I like to think of that as my privilege:)No tequila today...no, it was taco Tuesday! $1.00 shredded beef tacos and $2.00 Tecate cerveza's all day long! That's what we were there to try!So we stocked up on $1.00 tacos for lunch, right? Of course not, don't be silly...dad was buying:)We had exactly 1 shredded beef taco (which was tasty, BTW). We had lobster tacos...(ok, but pretty salty...and if I think it was salty... baby, it was salty) we had veggie tacos, we had rice and beans. Most everything was OK to tasty and sent us off to the movies in fine style. The service was prompt and friendly, even though Cien Agaves was absolutely jam-packed during the lunch hour. I had no idea so many people wanted a full rack of $1.00 tacos!Next time, I am going to see if I can eat $5.00 worth of Taco Tuesday tacos...I could do it when I was in the tequila club:)I had a lunch with some friends over $1 tacos.  The scenery, the tacos, the grease...all good.  $1 fried tacos were well worth every penny.  Crispy fried tacos.  Not an every day indulgence but tasty nonetheless.The place has a bit of a funky atmosphere, the service was very good.  I would return for Tuesday $1 Tacos.I am betting Cien Agaves is pretty busy on Friday & Saturday nights.Did I mention the $1 tacos were fried?  Very filling.  That was the first time I've had fried tacos.  And I thought tacos were nearly a perfect food.I missed trying the ceviche that Cien Agaves served at Yelp in Bloom, so when I was invited to go to Cien Agaves for a friend's birthday dinner this past Friday night, I was excited to check it out!The birthday boy made a reservation for 8pm, and when we arrived fashionably late (thanks to my husband), the rest of our group (approximately 15 people) were already seated, eating chips and salsa, and drinking margaritas.  We caught up pretty quickly thanks to Lindsay, our waitress - I had a margarita made with Vodka and J went with a beer.  The food was decent.  I think the 3.5 star average is right on... I split shrimp fajitas with J and shared in the guacamole, nachos, and a few other apps that the table had.  The guys that ordered the special ahi tacos really enjoyed them.  I have yet to try the ceviche and I may even go for the tequila margarita next visit, but I'd for sure return to Cien Agaves in the future.  Two drinks was all I needed and I was done for the night.  Happy hour anyone?!I can appreciate a good happy hour, and Cien Agaves certainly has a muy bueno one.While I didn't come on Taco Tuesday (which I should have for their $1 tacos and $2 Tecates), I did come for Margarita Monday (ok, I made that up - margaritas here are a must every day of the week). We came in before their daily happy hour ended at 7pm and enjoyed some awesome house margies for half price - $3.50! And these suckers were pretty big too. Food was delicioso. I had a carnitas burrito and went with our server's rec to get it enchilada style and got the spicy red sauce. I'm glad I did, because it was so good wet (hmm, TWHS). Their signature chicken fajitas were really tasty as well. Entrees were so big that I couldn't imagine getting any appetizers or dessert - although an after dinner shot of tequila? Si, senor! Obviously, they had a list of cien tequilas on their menu. As much as I love Clase Azul, we decided to get shots of Milagro Anejo and saved ourselves $400.All in all, a fun spot in Old Town Scottsdale to get your Mex fix!I'm craving a Tinga taco just writing this review.  I love Cien Agaves' tacos!  You can order them individually, as part of a meal with beans and rice, or a platter of 10 for $35.  Pork, carne asada, chicken, potato, lobster..you name it, they have it.  Whether you like mild or spicy, are not a meat eater, whatever... You'll find the perfect taco for you.Their patio is basically a narrow walkway with wobbly tables.  That's the only negative here in my book.This place ROCKS! I've been here plenty of times before, but this experience from last Friday night was outstanding. We took my mom here for her birthday dinner. We called in for reservations & to see if we could reserve a booth 2 HOURS BEFORE we were going to go there- they said no problem! Upon arrival, we were seated at a reserved booth and our server, Diana N., spared no time to come and get our drink order! Let me just say, Diana N. made my mom's birthday extra awesome! She was a fantastic server and went above and beyond. She even gave us an amazing churro/icecream birthday dessert (I doubt they do that for everyone).  We definitely will be going back soon!
Alexis Grill=Old school Italian restaurant located on the first floor of a Central Ave. high rise, Alexi's delivers great food with great service. The room is nicely appointed (nicely appointed?...who says things like that?), comfortable and really reminds me of an upper westside NYC restaurant. Pasta pomodoro, shrimp parmigiana, minestrone soup, house salad all dee lish. It reminds of an NYC restaurant. Hostess in a tight dress. Waitresses all with big hair. Older waiters, follicly challenged and oddly all with moustaches. Naked Cowboy on the sidewalk. Ok, maybe not THE naked cowboy. But one day I did see a cowboy type with daisy dukes and a muscle shirt that read "My belt buckle's bigger than yours". Hmmm. Anyway, the clientele seems to be older Scottsdale type, women in furs and men with furry backs, who dare to venture into Central Phoenix. Me? I show up in my board shorts, Hello Kitty flip flops and a muscle shirt that says "My debt is bigger than yours". ENJOY yelpers!I used to travel to Phoenix for work, which was one of the benefits of that job.  This restaurant in downtown Phoenix came highly recommended by several of the secretaries I was working with and since it was in walking distance of the office, I decided to give it a try.  To be totally honest, it sucked.  Complimentary bread and soup was served for starters.  The bread was stale and I've had better soup out of a can.  The server was so busy flirting with the tall and very tanned ladies at the table next to me to pay much attention to the rest of his customers.  He spent a good deal of the time ignoring me; I was constantly having to ask him for things I shouldn't have to ask for--such as a fork or a drink.  The menu is pretty extensive; though low on the veggie options.  I chose the bowtie pasta with veggies.  It was carrots, zucchini and peppers in a light herb sauce which was bland and served just barely warm.  Very disappointing!  Due to the slow service of the flirty waiter, I was there far longer than an hour and got back to work late, out about $15 and still hungry.  Don't waste your time!
Square Café=Should I start with the negative or positive....okay, let's start on a positive note! Pro: the location makes it easy to get onto the Parkway East and the waitress was friendly. Yep, that was it for the positives.The cons: andouille sausage that was lukewarm with casing that was unchewable - not pleasant to have to dispose of that on the side of the plate...one taste was enough. Cheese grits devoid of any cheese flavor, but packed with hard lumps of uncooked grain - the largest of which was walnut-sized. The eggs were done well, but the entire dish was topped with a sweet jam that had no relationship to the dish whatsoever. My dining companion had high hopes for her goat cheese, leek and pancetta frittata topped with greens. Yet another fail. She proclaimed it dry with very few of the fillings to be found...but TONS of greens on top.  Odd.Maybe the regular cooks were off for the holiday. Maybe they were overwhelmed by the crowd...although truth be told, we didn't wait for a table even though it was packed. I wish I could have had the experience that all these four and five star reviews had,  but after my first try, it isn't worth going back again. Pittsburgh has far too many great breakfast and brunch spots to bother with less than mediocre.After seeing the Groupon available every time I open the app to check for deals, I finally caved and bought it! Not to mention that my fellow Yelper Meghan B. adores this place so I wanted to try it out. I'm so glad I did!We went on a Friday afternoon and I was surprised by how packed it was. We ended up sitting outside just so we didn't have to wait. We didn't mind, though. The outdoor seating is pretty cute! Our server was prompt and friendly and understood that we were going to order a lot due to having a $40 towards food (we only paid $20 for it!).I wanted to try something different, but after an awesome chest day at the gym, I wanted some meat and ordered a burger. It was awesome! Now, the patty did appear to be frozen, however the garlic toasted bun and beautifully positioned toppings totally made up for it. Nothing wrong with frozen patties, but I just expected it to be a little more gourmet. Not complaining. It was still very good considering the place isn't a burger joint. I had a side of fries that were crispy and delicious and cole slaw that wasn't too heavy. We also ordered a Nutella/Strawberry crepe. It was my first time ever trying a crepe and I fell in love! I'm not really one for super sweet meals, so I don't think I would order this as a breakfast entree, but it totally hit the spot after my burger. We also split a Chunky Monkey pancake. Wow! Not too sweet, but just sweet enough. You really didn't even to use much syrup. It had bananas, chocolate chips, whipped cream and topped with coconut. I have officially fallen in love with this place and can't wait to go back and introduce more people to this delicious goodness! It's a shame it's only open till three, but from the looks of it, they make enough during the morning and afternoons to close their cash registers comfortably.My friend and I have been trying to come to Square Cafe for a year.  Last year, she made a reservation for my birthday, and when we called to verify, they said they couldn't guarantee us a seat.  Uh... what is the point of a reservation then?  We finally tried Square Cafe for the first time a few weeks ago.I ordered a breakfast burrito, known as Uncle Charley's Hot Sausage Breakfast Burrito ($10.99), and my friend ordered the leek, asparagus, and cheese frittata ($9.29).  My breakfast burrito was good and tasted delicious, but the portion was very small for the price.  I ate the entire thing with no issues, and I weigh just over 100 pounds.  My friend's frittata wasn't very good, though, and the side of grits she ordered were just ok.  The food was good but not notable enough for me to be dying to come back.Our server was a nice guy who explained the menu really well.  When he brought over the bill, we found out there was a pay it forward chain going through the restaurant.  We paid it forward in the server's tip, but it's cool that this place is into that kind of thing.  The ambiance is good!A big problem:  It was really cold in the restaurant because despite having double doors, they propped the second set of doors open, which let all of the seventeen degree air into the space.  This was the difference between 3 and 4 stars for me.  I cannot enjoy a meal when I'm cold.I really wanted Square Cafe to be the trendy cafe where I could regularly enjoy brunch, but in the end, it's just ok.  I would come back if someone suggested it, but I don't think I would come back here on my own.I visited for brunch at 1pm today with a friend.  Although they don't accept reservations or use No Wait, they got us in surprisingly quickly (in 10 min., despite an estimate of 20-30 min.).  We were seated at the table closest to the door, but I found it quite warm, and didn't feel chilly at any point, despite the constant stream of customers.Between us, we ordered the following: Sun dried tomato scramble with goat cheese and spinach (me), brussels sprout hash (my friend), side of bacon (split), and two 16 oz specialty drinks (regular cinnamon bun latte for me, decaf gold star (?) latte for my friend).  The food came out quite quickly--less than 10 min. after ordering, I believe--and our waitress was quite efficient, despite being one of only two working with a large crowd.Generally, we were pleased with the quality of the food.  My one criticism was that the ingredients could have been more evenly distributed throughout the scramble--some pieces consisted only of egg, and all of the goat cheese was concentrated in one area.  Once I mixed up the ingredients, the flavors and textures combined, complementing one another nicely.  The addition of some hot sauce, salt, and pepper enhanced them even more.  The spring mix was served with my entree undressed, but I used the orange garnish to add some juice, which dressed it up nicely.  The bacon was cooked perfectly, with just the right amount of crunch and give.  Finally, my latte was just sweet enough (not overly so), with a good milk:coffee ratio, rounding out the savoriness of the scramble and bacon.  Although I didn't sample my friend's dish or latte, she enjoyed them, as well.As others have mentioned, I felt that the portions were on the smaller side, esp. given the price (our check came to $34).  Fortunately, I had a city dining card for this place ($10 discount), but even so, after tip, I paid close to $30.  For this reason, I'm tempted to knock off half a star.  However, because I liked the vibe, was pleased with the quality of the food and the service, and appreciate the fact that this place offers several healthy, vegetarian, and GF options, I'm awarding an even 4 stars.
Greenberg's Deli=I have been to many a deli my friend and this is not a very good deli. The kosher style corned beef they attempted was fatty, some of it was chewy and parts of it had been exposed to the air too long and gotten a bit hard. I also suggest more training on the deli equipment before someone is in need of stitches from the slicing wheel. The girl making my sandwich was having a hard time as a result of the previously mentioned hard portion and nearly pushed her finger into the wheel before deciding to shut it off while she fussed over the meat. I like to watch someone fussing over meat as much as the next guy but no one should lose a finger.The potato salad was very bland.Rather than leaving me with a fond memory of deli's I have been to in NYC, Boston, Cleveland, etc it left me wishing I had skipped it and wanting the real deal even more.OMG!  Greenberg's serves up some of the most delicious sandwiches I've ever had.  If you're in Las Vegas and you love a mountain of New York style hot, freshly shaved, thin sliced meat on fresh bread of your choice you owe yourself a visit to Greenberg's Deli on the casino level of the New York, New York Hotel and Casino.My friends are thoughtful.  On the day prior to running the half marathon I had a fairly late pasta lunch and decided to skip dinner in preparation for the morning's race.  My race morning ritual is pretty simple.  One hour before the race I eat a banana or a bagel and I drink a pint of Cytomax to prepare my body for the onslaught ahead.  Cytomax is a fluid replacement liquid that has added vitamins to fuel the body and prolong cramping.Both of my friends were running in their first half marathon, and neither had any set routine for nutrition on the day prior to the race nor on race morning.  They visited Greenberg's on the night prior to the race, and in thinking I was starving in my hotel room they brought back for me a huge deli sandwich with a side of potato salad and a pickle with a bottle of Gatorade.  The time was 10 PM and the race was just 9 hours away.  With no refrigeration in the hotel room, and two overstuffed roommates I was left with no choice but to eat the darn sandwich and the sides.Knowing my love for meat they brought back a Twin Bill consisting of a mountain of hot pastrami and corned beef with just a slight smear of mustard on wheat bread (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/I4Nr-MVc26qWr08-S3Q1ow?select=u6ig5pKlEqhgsmAvUNWrkA).  I swear the take out box weighed in at more than a pound with the thick pile of meat taking up most of that weight.  The sandwich was incredible.  The meats were nicely marbled, flavorful and moist and this was easily one of the best deli sandwiches I've had outside of New York City.  It was even better than Miller's East West Deli in San Francisco, and I love Miller's.  The big crunchy pickle was outstanding as well with just the right amount of sour to it.  The potato salad was basically big chunks of unpeeled potatoes, lots of mayo and just a touch of dill.  It took me nearly an hour to finish the sandwich, and I knew I was in trouble for the next morning.Sure enough, the big sandwich came back to haunt me at mile 10 during the half marathon the next morning.  Luckily I run for fun, and I didn't really care that I finished 12 minutes later thanks to 2 pit stops I was forced to make.I was so satisfied with the sandwich that I made my own visit to the deli the next night to order another.  This time I had the New York Skyhigh (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/I4Nr-MVc26qWr08-S3Q1ow?select=QtjcS6CWBgSaD01Zry3urg) which is corned beef, pastrami, turkey, cole slaw and thousand island dressing on bread of choice.  I even tried their authentic chocolate New York egg cream which is simply milk, Hershey's chocolate syrup and carbonated water hand mixed and machine whirled to create a thick layer of froth on top.  Here it was without the froth (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/I4Nr-MVc26qWr08-S3Q1ow?select=ekkd6tNYWjCU9Z-oXH3_4Q) as I had already sucked it up.  I loved this sandwich just as much as the Twin Bill and the drink?  Well, that was like drinking chocolate milk with fizz!Greenberg's is very reasonably priced too as their sandwiches are mostly under $10 including the sides!I was feeling like a sandwich for lunch and near NY NY so I ended up here. You stand in one line to order and another line to pay. When it came my turn to order I asked for the Vinnies Deluxe in a french roll. The guy carving the meat laughed and said he never had someone order that sandwich on a french roll before and he would never do that because that bread cannot hold all the meat. I let him know I wasn't a tourist and have eaten here several times before never ordering my sandwich on any other bread and never had a problem with it being messy. I then told him if he wanted to buy my $10 sandwich I would get it on the bread if his choice. He laughed and said to grab a fork and knife. For the record... No utensils were needed and no meat fell off my sandwich. The sandwich had beef brisket, turkey, and pastrami with deli mustard and mayo. The meats on the sandwich taste well together and the bread was good. I always leave satisfied but do wish the sandwich was a little bigger. It also came with a pickle. Tables are right outside or you can get your food to go and they are open until 3 am.Greenberg's Deli is a spot you should definitely hit while in Vegas specially after drinking nothing sounded better than big fat Pastrami Sandwich. :-)Located in New York, New York, Greenberg's is tucked in among the "city streets". You order at the counter, the meat is all sliced to order, thin and delicious. The sandwiches are huge.Hot and fresh made meats including pastrami, corned beef and turkey, made to order on a selection of freshly baked breads, with house made mustard and dill pickle on the side. I had the pastrami sandwich and potato salad. Fresh ingredients, the bread tastes amazing, and the pastrami so delicious and piled so high that it's hard to figure out how to eat it! So yummy, and the potato salad is perfect with the sandwich.For a quick and relatively inexpensive meal, definitely stop by this place and grab a bite to eat. You won't be disappointed.The seating area outside of Greenberg's Deli was packed on my last visit, so I asked for my food to-go. Depending on the time and day, inside can get crazy busy and I'm used to that, so it doesn't bother me if I end up getting my order to-go or not. The line can get long, but it  moves fairly quick. There are 3 different sandwiches on the menu I like, so I am glad that they have kept them over the years. Problem is the prices and consistency of the food has changed. I used to pay $8.95 for a sandwich that currently costs $12.95 and isn't as big as it was before. That or the amount of meats are off. For example when I get a sandwich that has 3 different types of meat on it, they put a thin layer of pastrami on the bottom and then a huge amount of turkey. I post pictures each visit and you can clearly see how they are not consistent with amount of meat they put on each sandwich. When I told the guy working this last visit what type of sandwich I wanted on a French roll, he said that he wouldn't recommend that type of bread with that sandwich. I explained that I had ordered it many times before on that type of bread and would prefer it please. He made it the way I ordered it and the sandwich came out tasting great! The meat had good flavor and it was tender and juicy and it's still carved in front of you. I still give 4 stars even with the meat portions being off because the meat here is excellent. I only wish that if they are going to raise the prices, that they not put less meat on the sandwiches as well coleslaw or at least when they do pile the sandwiches high they should put equal amounts of each meat. They do still have soup and for beverages hey have water, juice, beer and soda.I randomly stopped at Greenberg's Deli for a sandwich while walking through New York New York casino. The ordering process here is cafeteria style. Grab a tray and get in line at one end, order, pick up your sandwich and pay at the other end where you exit the line. I decided to get a simple Reuben ($10.95) with pastrami on rye with the standard fixings of swiss cheese, sauerkraut and thousand island dressing. Similar to what you can expect in deli's in NY the meat for the sandwich is sliced fresh right in front of you. Looking at this process I thought that I would be standing in line for a long time but the person behind the counter worked fast and kept the line moving at a steady pace.The sandwich itself is not very big but could be considered to be a decent lunch sized portion. It has a decent amount of meat but its not like its piled sky high. What it has going for itself is the taste which is really good. Definitely among the best that I've had. The rye bread is toasted perfectly. The pastrami is of high quality and its taste is not eclipsed by the sauerkraut and thousand island dressing but shines through in each bite. It's price is also right considering that it is on the strip in a Casino. Overall I liked what I ate so would not have a problem stopping by the next time I'm in town.Greenberg's Deli brings back that loving feeling that's been gone gone gone. Born and raised in the New York metropolitan area I grew up with the loving feeling of dining in delis that serve delicacies from kasha varnishes to Ruben sandwiches. After moving to Las Vegas there has been far less New York delis to enjoy the these delicacies that I love. I am surprised that it took my brother and I over 15 years to try Greenberg's Deli. Better late than never.    It is appropriate that Greenberg's Deli sits inside New York - New York within a Disneyfied Greenwich Village. Both casino and Deli execute such a commendable job with the theme and attention to detail, that a unique dining experience is guaranteed. The New York City motif is so realistic that you expect to hear a taxi careening down the faux Greenwich Village Street, and instead overhear a runaway Manhattan Rollercoaster taxi above with screaming riders.    When you step off the Greenwich Village Street into Greenberg's Deli, up above on the wall is  the menu. It advertises the New York City Deli icons including the Ruben, corn beef, and pastrami. Disappointedly yet totally expected Kashe varnishes and kinishes were missing. However, there on the board was an egg salad sandwich. I LOVE egg salad sandwiches. They are not the easiest sandwich to find in Las Vegas and especially on the Strip. A few years past, I really enjoyed the Johnny Rockets egg salad sandwich until they got rid of it. The egg salad sandwich is relatively inexpensive for the Las Vegas Strip where a Subway sandwich could cost over $8. I would never want to eat an egg salad sandwich by itself. I'd add a prepackaged potato salad for $1.50 and a fountain Pepsi for a couple of dollars more that came out to $13 and change.   Before I could enjoy the food I had to pay. This is a two line process. On line 1, I ordered and picked up the sandwich with the prepackaged potato salad and fountain Pepsi before bringing my tray to line 2 to pay. I carried the tray outside to the Greenwich Village Street where the tables are.   The egg salad sandwich brought back this loving feeling of enjoying delicious food in a New York deli. They served it on between two slices of rye bread (I could of had sourdough). Complimenting the overflowing egg salad that required a fork to savour every bite was onions, tomato, and lettuce. The potato salad was nothing extraordinary. Perhaps, the next time I visit I may enjoy the sandwich with hard to find Wise potato chips or go nearby upstairs to Coney Island to pick up Nathan's crinkley cut fries.    Sitting in the Greenwich Village Street amplified this New York state of mind that in reality is a New York - New York state of mind. The sights and sounds of the casino is exciting. Up above the runaway New York Express roller coaster taxi careened on the tracks, the Times Square Dueling Piano players rocked the classics across Greenwich Village. Greenberg's Deli with the New York - New York Greenwich Village is the marriage of a Las Vegas and New York deli dining experience that brings back a loving feeling that had been gone gone gone.
My Big Fat Greek Restaurant=It sang to us its beautiful lullaby before we spotted it- a lovely waterfall at the restaurant's entrance!  It was a little chilly that evening and I had a feeling that Mamang wouldn't be open to dining al fresco, but I asked for patio seating.  When I spotted a few heaters in place, I knew we'd be fine.  What a delightful surprise when we scored a table next to the babbling waterfall we encountered on our way in!  Nervous energy spent over Mamang feeling too chilled outside was wasted; Indeed, she even complained of feeling too warm!  No worries though, as cousin Melissa eagerly swapped places with grandma.We shared flaming saganaki, "award-winning" gyro dinner (consisting of lamb and beef, scrumptious rice, sauteed veggies, and just-perfect lemon-roasted potatoes), side Greek salad, and flaming galaktoboureka (custard baked in crusty phyllo, topped with vanilla ice cream, flamed, then drizzled with caramel sauce) for dessert!  We three over-ate, but no one grumbled.  Mamang had never experienced Greek cuisine before, so this beautiful evening (outdoor dining, ambience- lighted palm trees, waterfall- and tasty food) was a perfect send-off for our gorgeous grandmother, who was homesick living on US soil for the past six months.  She left for Manila yesterday (Monday).  I hope she's happier back home... Mamang, next time you're enjoying a fresh mango shake, I hope you'll think of me!  I'll be there in spirit sipping on another next to you :)1st con: Poor lighting.  Firstly, my eyes can't feast on the beauty that I'm about to savor.  Secondly, photos taken will most likely be ruined.  Thankfully, my cousin's digital cam had better flash.  Please refer to photos above!2nd con: Lackluster service.  Appetizer was served, yet we didn't have any utensils on our table.  Couldn't find our server, so I grabbed three sets from a nearby table.  Also, we almost missed the flame shows of both saganaki AND galaktoboureka.  Cousin and grandma thought something or someone caught on fire, haha (in the event of a body, not so funny); Presenter should've given us warning before setting the cheese on fire.  3rd con: Restroom was in an awful state of disarray.  Counter was wet all over, and the floor was littered with paper.  Total 180 degrees from the awesome ambience experienced on the patio (excluding the poor lighting, of course).
Yum Yum BBQ=I came here on a whim and I'm so glad I did. This place is off the chain (not a dog eating joke). It's about $20/person when you do the "all you can eat" option. I have never been to a place that served food in this manner, but wowsers... I like! The waiter comes and you order about 2-3 selections per person, you finish that, the waiter comes back, and you order again. This process is repeated until you are stuffed silly.Can you imagine ordering all the chicken katsu, spam musubi, and kalbi you want? CAN YOU?! Plus, all the food is made to order (I think), so it's steaming hot when it gets to your table.I didn't try too many of their sushi options, but the cream cheese roll tasted flavorful and fresh. Unlimited drinks are an additional fee and they have a fridge in the lobby where you can get up & grab as many drinks as you want, changing it up each time you go.To top it all off, customer service was awesome. Our waiter was super friendly and attentive. It was seriously so yum yum!
Salty Senorita North=I'm feeling bad about the reviews that came before mine, but my honest review is that this place is just 'meh.'I was there last night (which was a Tuesday) for a meeting - we had some drinks and I ordered dinner... service was decent; not great.  Food was the same - I had a bean burrito with a side of guac - it was fine.  Some of the others at the table took advantage of their 'dollar taco' menu.  I think it's part of happy hour that you can get your choice of chicken or steak tacos for 1 buck each - not bad!I didn't start with the chips and salsa because when I do that I can never stop, but from experience, i know their chips and salsa are pretty good.  Go for drinks, especially if you're craving Corona with some chips and salsa - the atmosphere is fine, and it works for small groups too.  It's a decent chain restaurant that is pretty consistent in giving you standard Mexican fare.  Go with just 'meh' expectations and you'll be fine.Woah, UBER FAIL.FULL DISCLOSURE:  I was contacted by Salty management in response to my less than favorable review of their Old Town location.  I was offered a gift card as an "I'm sorry, try us again" ploy in exchange for more detailed information on my shitty experience.  Ok, sure, I like free stuff, send it.  Plus, it sounded like they were making changes and attempting to improve things there, so I didn't mind giving it another shot.  FOUR months later, I receive the $50 gift card.  Right away I was disappointed that the gift card was supposedly only good at the North Scottsdale location, 32miles each way from my house.  Whatever, 3 gallons of gas round-trip (approx $6.00), why not.First things first (and I like to start on a good note before the bloodshed) their wait-staff is fairly attractive, nice sort of emo-slut look... easy on the eyes.  Our waitress was pretty cute, friendly, bra exposed... nice.  Their $8.50 "Monthly Special Margarita" was actually very tasty and poured very well.  Not too sweet and very strong.  If this was the only place in town to get a good margarita, that would be one thing.... but it's not.Now let it rain blood.The lighting in this place was the first fail of the night... we had to move from our first booth because we both felt we were sitting under a spotlight.  Our second booth (a round one) was a little better since we weren't under a spotlight, but the lighting cast a shadow on our table (shadow caused by my body) so that I had to move my body to the right and hold the menu to the left of me to read anything.  So annoying.  FAIL.We ordered their $1.95 Unlimited Chips and Salsa.  The chips were soaked in oil and the bottom 3/4 of the basket was un-edible because they were crumbs!  Wait, did a "Mexican" place just charge me $1.95 for shitty chips and "ok" salsa?  Yup, they did.  FAIL.I ordered the Fajitas, half steak half chicken with corn tortillas.  The Fajitas were made in this tomato sauce, which at first I wasn't too thrilled about, but in all honesty, I'm super glad they did because if it wasn't for the tomato sauce, the dish would have had 0 taste.  The meats had no seasoning on them and tasted completely bland.  I actually considered using salt (I NEVER use salt, even at home, unless it's popcorn) to give it some amount of taste.  Thank god for the tomato sauce.  The corn tortillas can only be described as disgusting.  I was only given three tiny corn tortillas but only ate two of them.  I can't really describe what's wrong with them, but they are foul.  The Fajitas came with a plate of cheese, rice, sour cream, and shredded romaine lettuce (yeah).  The only thing on the accompanied plate I ate was the rice and it was COLD!  Not warm, not luke warm, COLD!  My dining partner's rice was cold also.  WTF?  Needless to say, the cold rice was the best part of the meal, seriously.  F A I L.My dining partner ordered this Chipotle Chicken Burrito which, believe it or not, lacked taste and was bland.  Yes, BLAND!!!  How is it possible that a burrito covered in cheese, injected with a Chipotle sauce is bland?  No clue, but these clowns pulled it off.  Unbelievable.  F A I L.Our bill came, $45.32.. I figured, "great, $50 on the gift card, $5 out of pocket, she gets a $10 tip, and I never have to think about this place again".  Wrong.  They wouldn't let us put the tip on the gift card, so I ended up with $5 left on the card and had to pay $10 out of pocket.  So $10 out of pocket + $6 to get there, I paid $16 bucks and 2 hours of my life to eat an incredibly SHITTY meal.  In retrospect I wish they never sent me the gift card and I had stayed home and ate left overs instead, spending the $16 on a bottle of Vodka and a can of Soda Water.  I don't even really understand, their food got WORSE!!!  Why would you send gift cards, encourage people to try your place again and actually make your food worse?  Am I in bizzaro world here?  Aren't you supposed to IMPROVE the food?  "Mexican" food is the easiest food in the world to make "decent", hell even [fill in blank]-abertos is better, Macayo's, Serrano's, El Torrito, you name it, it's better (even the Clarendon's now defunct Mexican spot was better).  I have to figure the ONLY reason people come here is for the patio and to drink.  But still... there are plenty of places to drink, why support such a lousy place?  Perhaps they rely on their patrons to either be drunk when they eat so they don't notice, or so drunk afterward they forget.  U B E R   F A I L ! !
Pepe's Tacos=At the oddly shaped corner where Charleston and Fremont Street become Boulder Highway, in one of the older and more dangerous parts of east Vegas, you can find a great taco 24 hours a day at Pepe's!  For 7 or 8 dollars you'll get a huge pile of authentic Mexican food.  I'm partial to the Super Burrito with Carne Asada, or the Huevos Rancheros - yes they serve breakfast all day!  Que gusta!  Very authentic joint.  Makes a great contrast to the Strip casinos if you want to cruise down Charleston for a break from the contrived slot palaces of MGM and Harrahs.  You might even see a real live mugging - just be careful it isn't you!
Catch 22 Sports Grill=At the start of football season, I was a fan of Catch 22.  However, as the season is coming to an end, I find my enthusiasm is fading...There are plenty of TVs, and they are labeled according to the games that will be shown.  This is helpful when choosing a seat - I want to see my Texans play!  However, most of the TVs are a bit small for the large space and the two big screens are reserved for Cardinals games.  It would be nice to have the 'good' TVs showing the best matchup of the week, regardless of who is playing.On Sundays, lunch is served starting at 11:00 (there is a limited breakfast menu earlier) and the items I have tried were good.  Hey, it is a sports bar - burgers, fries, chicken tacos and wings go well with beer and football...During my first couple of visits, there were plenty of servers to handle the Sunday crowd.  And, they were very friendly and attentive as well.  However, recently the service has been hit or miss - it seems like there are fewer servers who are unsuccessfully working with the same sized crowd.  On my last visit the service was painfully slow, and very basic things like placing and order and receiving a check seemed next to impossible. While Catch 22 is an A-OK place to watch a few games, I am on the lookout for a North Phoenix alternative...I'm giving Catch 22 all of one star, mainly because who I think might be the new owner/manager decided that the group I was there to watch football with this morning wasn't all that important enough for their business and he decided to talk down to one lady in our group because she was setting up a wireless tower to get sound and he thought she was doing it wrong.  Turned out to be bad wifi from Catch 22, however he couldn't admit it.  Furthermore, when I asked if we could have our game on the big screen he replied "nope, that is not happening" and then gave me some BS excuse of how the wiring in the place is all connected and how certain tvs can't go to another channel without other tvs there going to the same channel.  Interesting how other sports bars can get it right, however they can't.  The tone of his answer to me couldn't have been more condescending.  And seriously, if we were told we get a separate place in the restaurant with our own tv then why should we have to bring our own sound to a sports bar???At the end of the day, we were pretty much treated like second class patrons.  The food is somewhat ok at best, last week our group had lousy service, and whomever was in-charge of the place this morning was a real (rhymes with "Rick") to us.  Never going back there again.This place is horrible. Rude wait staff and owner. Dirty tables..no ketchup. Definatley wont come back. This place needs to be on bar rescue lol.
Los Reyes De La Torta=Perfect example of a great restaurant that lives in a crappy place. From the outside one might be scared to go in... it's in Sunnyslope for cripes sake! The tortas, and aguas frescas are both incredible. They blow a lot of other "torta" restaurants I've been to out of the water. The atmosphere is pretty bare bones, but they have done a nice job of making it feel welcoming and festive. There are always lots of kids there and lots going on, so be ready for a non-relaxing meal, but a very delicious one at that. The portions are enormous, and most people would be able to split one sandwich. Just watch your back around the area.Thanks to David B. and a serendipitous coupon from lunchclub.com, I finally went to Los Reyes de la Torta. The description of the Huarache con hongos is what really did it... and it was perfectly described! It's like an extra thick soft corn tortilla topped with beans (navy or cannellini, not pinto) a LOT of queso fresco and... hongos (mushrooms). Don't like mushrooms? Pick a different topping... much like (as Dave B. describes) pizza!The waitress asked if I wanted red or green salsa and I asked for sides of each so I could try them both, but I only got the red... which was fine, because it added good flavor. The portion was huge! And, the price was fair (around $7 including a can of diet coke)So low carbin' is all Ive been talking about lately and Im working on creating a new list with my recommendations. It might seem like a taco/torta shop is the last place you can low carb but Los Reyes is exceptional, especially on the cheap! Order the Tacos Alambre de Res ($4.75) and have them hold the tortillas.. so what you get is a plate full of chopped beef, onions, bacon all covered in melted cheese served with shredded cabbage, sliced radishes, sliced cucumbers, grilled onion and a grilled jalapeno. Slather on some salsa and don't eat the grilled onion and you've got yourself some good eating right there!Phoenix royalty is in the 'slope! These guys, without question, are los reyes. They are not screwing around by making such a claim. People love the huaraches, which are gigantic corm tortillas covered with white cheese, red or green salsa, and mushrooms (hongos) or various meaty choices. I've had the huarache with mushrooms and the version with carne asada. I've also had the mouth-watering shrimp burrito. All are delicious, but...The tortas are where it's at. I mean, they strike some kind of poetic balance that resists duplication. The sandwiches have a variety of toppings and fillings, and are served on a beautiful bolillo roll. I'm partial to the milanesa (breaded chicken or beef). There's something about the mild crunch of the filling that combines with the smoothness of the avocado and the kick of the jalapeno. Fantastic.Los reyes also deliver on the beverage front. The make their own fresh juice, so there are quite a few options for aguas frescas, licuados, etc. One thing worth trying is the vampiro: orange, carrot, celery, beet, and pineapple juices. The vampiro will probably cure the most intractable ailment.The restaurant is also bustling and fun. Servers are friendly and multi-lingual. If you live in Sunnyslope, check the place out immediately. If not, it's worth a trip!Every time I drive by this place, I get a little thrill down my spine. MMMM! Where else can you go to experience a bit of heaven between two soft pieces of bread? I met Mr. Hottie and Foodie Bear for lunch one afternoon at Los Reyes. I will say that I'm not a HUGE fan of sandwiches, but when it's free, what the heck? I walked in to the strip mall establishment and was met by the aroma of grilled onions and meat! So far, so good! Once seated, I found my eyes wandering around the menu and wishing I could eat everything on it! After sipping on a delicious horchata, and pondering the menu, I decided on the Torta el Rey which means "torta that has everything but the kitchen sink in it" (loosely translated)! This AMAZING sammie came with breaded thin beef steak, ham, chorizo, fried egg, cheese, avocado, lettuce, tomato, and jalapeno! This is CERTAINLY not something you want to feed a family member who is at risk of kicking the bucket due to heart or kidney issues. Consider yourself warned. I will say that if you eat this sandwich, you are bound to fall in love with it. It's a dangerous, forbidden love, but a love you will cherish nonetheless. One of the issues I have with sandwiches is the bread. In previous experience, the tortas that I ate had terribly boring bread, or bread that was way too hard. Los Reyes' bread was yummy! It was grilled and and crusty, but not so crusty that you cut your mouth or it's too hard. The ingredients of the torta were all well made and delicious. Everything was HOT where it needed to be and cold and fresh where that needed to be! Perfecto! So why is that 5th star missing? I want to head back to try another torta to be sure of a 5 star rating! Looking forward to it!Yet another place I would never have found without Christina P and Yelp!  And it was good.  Really good!The menu has quite a few recognizable items like burros and tacos, but I opted to try a huarache, basically an over-sized tostada with a thicker, softer corn tortilla and you choose your toppings.  Let's just say it's 8:16 am and I wish I were eating one right now.  They don't serve alcohol, but they do have a great juice bar with many options to choose from.  Of course, that won't satisfy anyone who can't fathom the idea of a spicy meal without a beer or margarita.  But it worked for me.  I will definitely come back if I'm in the neighborhood.  I just need to find a reason to be in the neighborhood now."OK, that kicked ass!"This is the only sentence I could manage after leaving Los Reyes de la Torta.  The food coma was quickly rendering me incoherent...This place well, does kick ass.  ¡Muy auténtico!  Salsa music in the background and soccer on the TVs.  An extensive menu with portions that seem to only come in one size - ginormous.  We thought we were being so smart by sharing two items.  Yeah, right.  There was enough deliciousness to feed a small family.  Mango juice... served in a chalice with a big slice o' mango riding on the side.  Shrimp quesadilla... I had no idea that tortillas could be made in that size.  Torta Del Rey... Easily more than 5" tall and packed with just about everyting that their kitchen can prepare.  I would love to see someone try to bite into this.  We had to eat it with a fork.  Amusing that the torta is served with potato chips - who has the stomach real estate left to eat those!?The only thing you can do after a meal like that is crash on the nearest couch until you feel human again.I will be hungry again sometime late next week.¡Ay, lo me Encanta!I keep coming back! Latest obsession is the shredded shrimp quesadilla. Apparently, there's some sort of translation problem because "shredded" means "with onions and bell peppers." In addition to onions and bell peppers -- and shrimp, obviously -- the ginormous quesadilla is filled with cheese, guacamole and smokey, bacony beans! So good! P.S. When I was there yesterday I noticed a sign that Man Vs. Food was there to eat the torta. Episode airs next week, I think...Agua Frescas...the term always eluded me. I knew it was some sort of Mexican drink, but I never really took the time to give it a shot, I guess my disdain for Horchata scared me off from other ethnic drinks, well...Los Reyes de la Torta made me regret my shortsightedness. After trying the Agua Frescas here, I went home and all but prayed for forgiveness from the Agua Fresca God for doubting him...this is one seriously good drink...at least at Los Reyes de la Torta it is. This place was our back up plan for dinner last Saturday...and quickly became our first choice because our other front runner (Sonora Mesquite Grill) seemed to be inexplicably closed on Saturday evening. This ended up being a blessing though, because I can't imagine having a better Mexican meal than we did at Los Reyes de la Torta. Right when you walk in, you know this place means business. Open kitchen, great smelling food being cooked up, 'best of' signs posted everywhere, and a packed house with people smiling and enjoying themselves wherever you look. Upon first opening the menu, we noticed the prices...dirt cheap. Because of this we decided to get three menu items to try, along with a couple of agua frescas. Here's a breakdown of what we tried: -Pineapple Agua Fresca - Delicious...frothy and natural tasting with each sip filled with a mouth full of mini pineapple bits. -Lime Agua Fresca - Like a fresh squeezed lime...unbelievable refreshing. -Asada Quesadilla - We both liked this the most out of anything we got. Fresh and tasty cheese, awesome tortilla, great tasting carne asada, and a mixture tomatoes/beans/cilantro/avacodo...melt in your mouth good. -Cubana Torta - We are big torta fans, but had to try one here. It was good, but we weren't blown away...again, we aren't big torta fans...so take this with a grain of salt. -Carne Asada Tacos - Okay, I know we already got a carne asada quesadilla...but we really like carne asada...so we just had to do it. The tacos were pretty good, but I wouldn't say they were spectacular. Everything in the taco tasted great but the mini tortillas they use for the tacos wasn't quite as tasty as the flour tortilla they used for the quesadilla. ...we left stuffed and satisfied with our meal. The only possible negative thing about this place is that they don't serve chips and salsa, which is a shame. The hot sauce they bring out to your table to go with your meal would go great with some warm crunchy chips. All in all...this place is excellent. Authentic quality Mexican food for dirt cheap, anyone in the area should definitely check it out. I can't wait to go back and try more stuff. This is a possible 5 star place, just need to go a few more times before it gets 'bumped up'. 4.25/5.I'm in Los Reyes de la Torta!I'm in, Los Reyes de la Torta!No typos there my eagle eyed friends...I am happy to report that both are (in fact) correct!Differences without a distinction!I was reading a thread about over-hyped places the other day, on Yelp.I wrote something pleasant, but inane and in my haste (doing four things at the same time), I misplaced a comma!Other sharp-eyed correspondents pointed that out to me...and I'm as grateful for the unsolicited correction as I can be!After lamenting my typo (and the very fat fingers that I use to type these little stories), I thought to myself "Donald, why not go to one of these very hyperbolically reviewed establishments and see if you can find that comma"?After all, it has to be somewhere.So, after a busy morning, what with working, building, producing, running, meetings, making money, special "mommy/daddy time" with the Beautiful Carin and so much more (you know..."the usual"), it was off to LRDLT for a Tuesday Retox.I met a buddy (who has here been before and raves about this place) and I was hopeful (so very hopeful) that the place would live up to the hyperbole.I couldn't have taken that disappointment, along with losing my comma.I needn't have worried...the Del Rey Torta was everything I could have hoped for...and much more!The whole menu looked terrific and I noticed that the joint was completely packed (even well before the normal lunch hour got into full swing).Everyone in the place seemed to be happy and enjoying themselves...and why not, the food is cheap and tasty...the service is pleasant and efficient...what more could I ask of lunch?Furthermore, the aroma coming from the kitchen was heavenly (always the first indicator, for me), so I settled in and ordered the King Torta...with a diet coke.As my lunch friend says...Sofa King good!And Sofa King huge...certainly the portions are large enough for a small family to share (I saw multiple examples of people sharing lunches).But I do not share...if anybody tries to grab my victuals, they're going to hear angry growling and see bared teeth.Especially when the grits are this good!On a happy, sunny Tuesday morning, I found that some places really do live up to the hype.And while it isn't Keen's Chop house, or Boulevard, LRDLT is Five Stars for what it is!Oh, after lunch...I found my misplaced comma!" , "Insert it with care!After reading Rand's review about a month ago, I just I knew had to check this place out! I stopped by Monday after work with a list of items I'd like to try (I looked at their menu online before coming in). I ordered way too much for my husband & I, but it was my 1st time so I had to try a lil bit of everything. I got the following: shrimp ceviche tostada, carne asada burrito, carne asada tacos w/a side of rice & beans, cheese quesadilla (flour tortilla), carne asada quesadilla (corn tortilla, handmade!) "estilo del rey" style (meaning it's topped with cheese, sour cream & cilantro) & lastly a slice of chocoflan for dessert. I had the tostada, burrito & carne asada quesadilla (over the course of 3 meals, btw) & all were excellent! Although, instead of shrimp I received chicken. It was still delicious but I was excited to try the shrimp, next time. The burrito had a lil kick to it & the meat was seasoned perfectly. The quesadilla was beyond amazing, I don't think I can ever eat a quesadilla again w/out getting it "estilo del rey" style, freakin yum! My hubby had the tacos, cheese quesadilla & half of my burrito. He thoroughly enjoyed everything & made 2 meals out of it. The chocoflan was chocolate cake topped w/a thick layer of flan. I didn't really care for the flan topping but the cake was tasty, super moist! Total for all that food was about $33, which I find totally reasonable. I can say that this is one of the top places for Mexican in Phoenix. I can't wait to return & try all the other yummy things they have to offer!What an excellent lunch I had here! Rand H. organized a little UYE for this place with Mike C., Robyn N., Arlin B. and myself. The establishment is in a rather cramped commercial strip but the restaurant itself is quite roomy, although it doesn't look it at first when you enter. I ordered a ceviche appetizer; this was the best ceviche I've ever had -- I would come here just for this! For my entree, I had the bistecas y huevos with rice and beans; it came with sides of avocado and Mexican cheese. I also had a refreshing glass of mango agua fresca which accompanied the meal perfectly. Great food, great prices, and great service even when the place is busy - no wonder this place is so popular.EwwwwwAre people just giving this place good reviews bc they want to pretend like they're super cool and are totally down with hole in the wall places in the hood?? Bc this was seriously nast. We ordered the queso w chorizo and that was bomb, I'll give them that.Our food came out, I had one bite of my chilaquiles and was like ready to spit it out. The green sauce was creepy and the steak was very off in flavor and not seasoned at all. I asked for a to go box and boxed up the steak to feed my dogs. My friend ordered their torta. She was like 'I can't tell if I don't like this bc it's gross or bc I'm full' I tasted it and was like 'bc it's gross.' she called me today to tell me she tried eating it for breakfast but threw it out bc it was nasty. We'll be sticking to the torta from Gallo Blanco, bc even though their service sucks, at least their torta is amazeballs. Seriously some of the grossest food I've tasted. The staff was friendly and the place was clean and packed. I just personally find the food super nasty.If you've ever been an inebriated bachelor and piled whatever you found in your fridge in between two slices of bread or into a tortilla, or perhaps a struggling mother who feeds her family a hearty mash-up of Whatever once a week on Leftover Night, then you'll appreciate "The King of the Sandwiches".Don't be afraid of rubbing elbows with your fellow patrons, or of a little grease running down from your overstuffed-torta-compressing hand all the way to that elbow.Try somethign that sounds loco -- it won't be that hard.  A couple of the choices contain basically everything you could think of to put on a sandwich, and then some. Actually, you could get a single sandwich that contains the innards of about a half dozen sandwiches all at once.Epiphany~ LRDLT's Del Rey and Las Reynas sandwiches are essentially the Turduken of torta shop tortas.Enjoy your hotdoghamchickenfriedsteakchickenfriedchickenchorizocheeseavocadoonionporkchopeggjalopenoburgerburritosandwichThe Torta de Milanesa was good. Not the best, but decent. I also had a bite of my friends Torta Cubana and that was good, slightly better than my milanesa. My torta de milanesa had beans and no-where else have I ever had beans in a torta, atleast never in Mexico, place where the torta is king. But this might just be a filling replacing the standard avocado added to tortas de milanesa. Since I noticed that my torta lacked that and the avocado always gives it that extra creamy and tasty kick!!         Also, my standards are high for tortas. I've been lucky enough to enjoy tortas de Milanesa and Cubanas in Currnavaca and Mexico City by Tortas Che and others there!! Those are bomb!!! ANYWAYS!!         The tortas here are not bad, their simply good, but nothing that I would frequent nor crave. The service here was fantastic!!!! No complaints there, we were getting attention left and right, nothing overwhelming, just accommodating and super attentive.        The ONE THING I did love from this place was the Fresas con Crema!! Those were AMAZING!!! That is the reason why I came here in the first place. One of my friends had these exact Fresas con Crema at his place and he shared some with me to try and the Fresas con Crema and I fell in love ever since!!

I was really curious, but a bit hesitant especially after that whole Mexico Bakery (MB) debacle (http://www.yelp.com/biz/mexico-bakery-san-jose-2?hrid=D-vOUl2zj5fBOhbOBHRFjg) --but I sacked up; grabbed my brother-in-law (BIL); headed over there; and ordered two of their infamous Torta Del Rey to-go.Torta Del Ray- This thing is a beast and makes the massive Torta at MB look like a midget. They really should call it the "Regadero De La Cocina Torta" (aka Kitchen Sink) because it's got everything you could imagine--and then some! There's Ham, Pork Loin, Beef Milanese, Hot Dog, Chorizo, melted cheese, Queso Fresco, Chipotle Salsa, Omelet, Tomato, Onions, Avocado, and Chipotle sauce. *Whew!* Now that's a mouthful, both literally and figuratively--and to top it all off they give you a handful of Ruffles chips (in case the Torta isn't enough food for you). The Torta itself was pretty good; I think I'm finding out that I'm not a fan of too much stuff on my sandwiches. I think the taste of everything gets muddled up in there and you get some serious mouth confusion. On the plus side, I really liked their Red Salsa; it went great on the Torta and the Ruffles. If I ever go back I'm definitely ordering one of their simpler Tortas. 3.5*Horchata- I liked LRT's Horchata; it had a good flavor without the chalkiness that you can sometimes find. 4*Service & Ambiance- We ordered our Tortas to-go so we didn't experience the wait-staff, but the two people at the front where we placed our order were very nice and friendly. LRT is located in a pretty Ghetto-Fabulous section of Phoenix; upon our first arrival we were greeted by two borrachos chilling in the lot and a couple of other suspicious characters just "hanging out". I'm not sure if I'd pay LRT a visit at night, but during the daytime I think it just adds to the experience. 4*Value- While $9.75 is a hefty price to pay for a sandwich, realistically you can easily share this with at least one other person. 3* Admittedly, it was a little contrived to seek this place out because I had seen it on a TV show, it was definitely fun to do once. If I lived in the area I seriously doubt I'd make the Torta Del Ray a regular item in my rotation. However, I can almost guarantee that their other more reasonably-sized Tortas would be much better. I'm gonna try to stop in one more time before I head out of town, but until then LRT gets a thumbs up.What? I was so shocked by my experience here!! I feel like I was told that I won a new Audi R8 and went down to the dealership and was given a 1986 Club Car Golf Cart. Have my tastebuds died from all of my martini nights? Don't I know Mexican food? My foodie confidence has taken a massive hit. Do I start at Taco Bell and work my way back to the Big Leagues? Damn you Los Reyes!! I thought I should write down how I felt about my torta to start my process back. Dear Carne Asada, you were treated with such disrespect and were left without flavor and Mexican flare! I was so looking forward to meeting you and seeing why so many loved you. Carne Asada, you're like all those girls in SoCal with the fake boobs and lips. Such a disappointment to find out! The one saving grace you have is your roll, but that roll only hides what you lack inside. Empty and souless! Where do I go now? Where are the real Carne Asada's out there? Do I need to go south of the border? I know my perfect Carne Asada Torta is out there. Juicy, flavorful and every bit tasty! I'm going to keep looking, but I won't be fooled by Los Reyes again.
TGI Friday's=Yelp's 365 Review Challenge 2014 #156 - #365It was my last night at the Orleans and I wanted to have some cheap before going back to the room. Walking around the casino, I saw TGIF, figured it's just like any other Fridays.There was no wait so I just quickly walked in and sat in the bar area. Service was quick and I ordered a glass of beer and some chicken wings. Food was on par like with any other Friday's franchise and the wings were tasty with mild wings sauce. Lucky for me I was able to charge it to my room so I cab earn some points for my stay.One of the worst places I've ever been to. I actually walked out upset.We were seated immediately so the only good thing about this trip was there was no wait time, but FYI - Happy Hour only applies if you're sitting in the bar area.It took 15 minutes for someone to come over and get our drink order, and another 10 for anything to arrive. A different waitress brought our drinks out and when we told her which one of us ordered what drink, she still gave us the wrong ones. Truly, I think maybe she was high. Meanwhile there are nothing but drunk people surrounding us, yelling obscenities and being inappropriate, and I'm sorry but one of the waiters smelled SO bad that it was hard not to cringe every time he came around. The original waitress never came by and we didn't see her anymore for a while. It took us 15 minutes to get ANYONE'S attention and request the check, then another 10 for my card to be charged and brought back out to me. Easily the worst TGI Friday's I've ever been to and I will not be going back.
Burger King=1st to review? I guess thats really no surprise word gets around that this place is BAD!!It's been quite awhile since I've been to Burger King mostly because they microwave everything right in front of you ans then tell you it was charbroiled. I was lured in by a co-worker willing to pay and wanting to try the NEW Funnel Cake sticks.I stay away from the burgers since they are FROZEN patties semi-broiled then microwaved. Not my kind of burger. I do however enjoy an occassional chicken sandwich microwaved or not. I ordered it MY WAY-plain.The chicken sandwich was ok but the funnel cake sticks were terrible-like a vanilla flavored straw made of straw. I couldnt eat them, neither could my son:(A place I wont be back to for another long while and thats not even due to the terrible service we experienced taking more than 20 minutes for 3 chicken sandwiches + 2 funnel cake sticks.My daughter is a PICKY eater...AND she has food allergies (eggs, dairy)  Lately, the only surefire way to make her eat anything is to tell her it has bacon in it....seriously.So as we fly back from a week of rest and relaxation in Mexico I see this sign...shining like a bacon...errr...beacon of hope....http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DmyS9b7ykIOo7XwYt5I9wg?select=k8y8sNAXTl6XMzg5Qr61rgGod Bless America....and God Bless Bacon.
Del's Bar and Ristorante DelPizzo=It has been a few months since the last time I ate at Del's but the experience was so atrocious that I will never live it down or ever go back there.Also, seeing that they have a Groupon today finally compelled me to finally get this review out for everyone that is considering dining there (even with a discount)We went for a Sunday dinner and I remember we started with their homemade cheese sticks and marinara sauce. Had them plenty of times before and they're yummy if they are cooked long enough for coming out of the freezer. Ours were not. So we moved onto our salad course. I always loved their marinated carrots and homemade italian dressing. However, mid way through our salad, my boyfriend looked at me and said " There is a MOUSE running out from under that table" which was beside ours. I thought he was joking with me because he was reluctant to go there from the start. No sooner did I look down and see a little mouse dashing under the table legs and chairs. We set down our forks and decided that we would NOT be sitting through dinner. We discreetly told our server that there was a mouse in their dining room and then asked to speak with the manager. Moments later our server returned and apologized for the situation, that our meals were being taken care of but no, the manager would not be able to talk to us. So I insisted, if only to notify them that they had vermin running around in plain sight. (If you couldn't tell them, who else do you tell this to?)  Only to you, readers, and the Health Department. If out of shame that the management would not come up to speak with us or by thinking that 'taking care of a meal" could be substituted for their irreverence and unsanitary conditions; it is completely unacceptable. The management has a choice to disregard these issues, but you as a patron should never have to. If these are the conditions of the dining room, I would hate to think what the kitchen islike. Will NEVER go back!I went to Del's with my girlfriend on the night of the Restaurant Impossible relaunch, eager to see how the show transformed it. While hectic, the night was a lot of fun and the food was reasonably tasty. The menu was small (as is usual on relaunch night), but had plenty of good choices. There were some high points- the mozzarella sticks, garlic bread and biscotti. As for dinner, I had an average chicken cacciatore, while my girlfriend had chicken parmigiana that was crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. She was happy enough with it that she was looking forward to having it again.The servers were enthusiastic and accommodating, which was impressive considering everything they went through that day. As the night went on, we were both troubled when we overheard the owner complaining to regulars that the show had forced her to severely shrink her menu. She pledged to go back to the old menu once things were back to normal. I couldn't help but wonder why. After all, if you appear on Restaurant Impossible, isn't that a pretty glaring sign that something is wrong with your current menu?About three months later, we figured that it was time to go back with a couple of friends. As expected, the smaller menu was gone and the bloated original menu was back, plus a few of the Restaurant Impossible dishes. I was dumbfounded by the breadth of choices. In addition to the long list of entrees, Del's also offers pizza and 12 kinds of pasta that can be combined with 13 different sauces. I can't help but think that our meal would have been better if the menu was tightened up.We started with mozzarella sticks and garlic bread, the strongest parts of the meal. The mozzarella sticks were a tad overdone, but were still very tasty, especially with the accompanying tomato sauce. The strong garlic bread was a welcome change of pace from what often passes for garlic bread elsewhere. Unfortunately, my French onion soup was middling at best. In addition to being very sweet, it had an unappetizing layer of oil on top of the melted cheese. My girlfriend and buddies found their iceberg salads to be mediocre.The meal continued to go downhill with the entrees. I had gnocchi with butter and garlic sauce. The butter and garlic sauce was flavorful and strong, but the gnocchi were dense and slightly chewy. My girlfriend, pleased with her chicken parmigiana on our first visit, ordered it again and was severely disappointed. The chicken was buried in sauce. I tried it and agreed- the breading was a soggy mess, while the chicken was drier and tougher than on our first visit.The desserts that we saw floating around looked very good, but we were all far too stuffed from dinner to try anything. Del's portions are huge, which they charge accordingly for. As it is, I think the large portions are meant to counteract the middling quality of the food. Three out of the four of the people in our party had enough leftovers for another full meal.The restaurant itself is still bright and clean, just as it was on relaunch night. Service was well-paced, friendly, and honest. The food and menu need work, though. Cut out some of the dead weight on the menu and give the staff the opportunity to focus on creating better quality dishes. I'm sure Del's doesn't want to shake things up too much for fear of losing their regulars... but if they fail to change, they're never going to create any new regulars.My wife and I had a really, really subpar meal here. I was surprised how old ladyish  it was inside based on how well lit and inviting it looks from the outside. And now onto the food...Del's options are most of the classic Italian meals but the menu was surprisingly lacking in any salads. Just to be clear there were NO salads on the menu. We were a little bit surprised by that so we asked the waitress who could only come up with an antipasto salad that was not on the menu. Our waitress was kind of rude and standoffish from the start which set the tone for the rest of the meal. My wife ordered the antipasto salad and I ordered chicken parmigiana. My wife received a huge heaping pile of canned carrots, bell peppers, and wet beets poured over the top of lettuce so nutrient depleted that it was white. My chicken then showed up as one tiny cutlet sadly dwarfed and alone surrounded by a gigantic plate. They gave me a bowl of pasta in a small bowl on the side which I couldn't understand why it couldn't all be put together on one plate. The chicken turned out to be alright but the portion was so small that I was still hungry when I left. After we left we both swore off Dels as a destination for future dining.Well any evidence of the recent Restaurant Impossible remake is completely missing from the menu - the food we received was clearly microwaved and just overall lackluster.  One entree, veal parmesan,  was sent back along with the bitter tasting iced teas.  And the waitress confessed that all the fish entrees on the menu used frozen components.While on the subject of waitressing, ours was in an ill mood and practically invisible during the meal.  To cap things off, it was 30 minutes from the time she cleared our table until our check was finally signed and we could leave.This was my second, and final, visit to Del's.  With all the fine Italian choices in Pittsburgh, there's no need to waste opportunities here.I went there for lunch on a Saturday with my two children after seeing the RI episode.  The restauarant looked nice.  The inside was not busy.  There were people eating outside on this unusually warm March day.Our waitress acted like she was trained in a really bad diner.  No greeting, no manners, just came by and dropped off menus while she was on her way to somewhere else.  When she returned she said, "what are you having?"  No drink order.I ordered the eggplant parm. with a side of spaghetti marinara. One child got spaghetti, the other a sandwich.  My eggplant parm. came - whoops it was instead a chicken parm.  I did not send it back, thinking it might be real good, as I saw Chef Irvine teach them to make.  It wasn't.  It was obviously a microwave-reheated, soggy pattie with sauce and a little cheese.  The spaghetti was inedible.  The noodles were overcooked and had no taste.  They were probably pre-cooked and left soaking in the water.  They were not adequately drained.  The bowl that it came in had about 1/2 inch of water at the bottom, with the soggy noodles laying in the water and some bland red sauce on top.After a long time the waitress yelled from across the room, "are you having anything else?"  About ten minutes after I indicated "no," she dropped the check on the table and kept walking.I paid the check and left less than my customary 20%.I wonder if the owners read these reviews?  Would it even help if they did?Was not impressed with this place... 1): floors were dirty, the bus boy would just wipe the tables to the floor and wouldn't sweep up after.2): unused silverware from the previous diners was no cleared from the table and reused. 3): The Chicken Parm tasted like the chicken was cook and then reheated. The breading was mush and the red sauce had a metal after taste. I def would not recommend this join even to just cross it off the "Restaurant: Impossible" list.I am going to comment about their Catering Services but this applies to their food quality as well.We ordered 200$ of catering food to feed a household after a recent death.  The service there was first awful.  The order was called in advance and told us a time to pick it up.  I went there and half the dishes were still not ready.  I had to wait another 45 minutes just to pick it up.You would think they would assist you when picking up 12 trays of food, nope, no assistance there, carried it all myself.We ordered breaded chicken filets, mashed potatoes, house salad, and everything was awful.  Worse yet they forgot a whole tray of chicken and we had to call them and tell them about it because they were completely unaware this was part of my order, but don't worry they made sure to get my money for it, if you get my drift.  I'm not saying it was on purpose, but when I called do you think they gave me anything off for having to come back to the store?   Nope, not even a penny.  Did I get a good apology and an offer to come to our house and drop it off?  Nope on both accounts.  Just a bit of lip served apology and here's your chicken.To sum up my experience is the service is terrible, and the food is horrible.  If you call this high school cafeteria food Italian I've got the Brooklyn Bridge to sell you.Bully on the block.Del's is as many of you know located in Pittsburgh's Little Italy.  It's situated at the very beginning of the main drag on Liberty if you're coming up from the Strip or over on Baum Blvd.  For that and the nice exterior a lot of people not familiar from the area give it a try.  Though I really wonder how many people go back for a second visit.  I sadly can say I've been suckered into going 3x's and not once have had an experience worthy of a street packed with so many good options. Del's is a typical Italian place with prices inflated like their egos.  Their dishes are typical and they can't even pull off the simplest Italian fare.  I will say however though that the chicken diablo is a decent dish and what I get when forced to go.  Inflated egos, poor service, very average Italian food. Discover a new place in Bloomfield.I live around the corner from Del's. Their food is good, though I'd probably trade a little less quantity for a little better quality, but overall it gets the job done when you're craving Italian.The issue with Del's is the service, and I don't mean the waiters & bartenders. The hardworking servers at Del's go above and beyond to keep the clientele happy. Unfortunately, the owners (specifically, the daughter of the owner) are on such a power trip that they ruin the experience of customers in favor of  friends.In one incident, the bartender was unable to let us know when last call was, because the owners kept telling her to "close. no, stay open, we have people coming" for which the bartender was profusely apologetic and accommodating, closing and re-opening our tab.  In another instance, the daughter of the owner chewed out a group of servers in front of 20-30 customers for not holding an outdoor table for over an hour so friends could bring their dog to dinner while 1) there was a long line to eat outside and 2) I'm pretty sure dogs aren't allowed inside of patio areas that serve food. We have also, on numerous occasions, tried to order take-out, which has never been entered into the system when the owner's daughter takes our order, causing us an extra 20-45 min wait. Additionally, each time she asks to seat us, she wanders away and forgets us, requiring a waiter to stop serving to help out.Essentially, I believe Del's could be wildly successful, if only ownership would step adsde and let more competent management handle day-to-day operations.I am watching a re-run of the food network when they were at Del's.  We ate there last year after we watched the original airing and thought we'd go there.  It had been many years since we had dined there.  When I saw them make the chicken parmesan the way it SHOULD be made, I was enticed to go back and try it.  It looked wonderful. Much to my disappointment, it seemed as if they went back to the original recipe which was frozen microwaved chicken.  I swear when chef Irivne walked out of the door after trying to help this place, they must have thrown everything he showed them right into the trash, which is where our meals belonged.  The saving grace was the sweet young waitress that we had who really did a great job.  In spite of the fact the the food was so bad, we tipped her generously.  Just because this place is almost an institution in Bloomfield doesn't mean it's the place to dine.  Looking for really good food and unusual atmosphere and friendly service?  The Church Brew Works!I have a few things to report on this place.  Since this place appeared on Restaurant Impossible it is good to report that the decor and menu are still just about the same when on the show.  Sadly, the management and higher ups haven't really changed, same mentality.What drew us in here was a sign on the side of the street: "All You Can Eat Pasta Bar." Great we thought, let's go in and try it out.  Then everything seems to have gone down the toilet.  When we got inside and attempted to order the pasta bar we were told it wasn't available due to the street festival going on outside.  Hmm, funny, because there is still a sign, if not two, posted outside advertising this.  If you were not going to honor this special (which I believe runs Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday) then maybe you should have taken in the signs for that week.When we decided we weren't going to dine here and let our waitress know our intentions we got this great, drawn out excuse why we shouldn't go.  Instead of honoring the all you can eat portion of this, they would hand you a card with options on it to fill in for the pasta bar.  Mind you, it wasn't even all you can eat, just whatever you checked on the card (more like a slip of paper) was what you got.  After sitting there and made to feel guilty our waitress came back over and gave us the real reason for the guilt trip: Her manager (who just happened to be the hostess as well) would eventually yell at her that night and quite possibly fire her.  I felt bad, especially since she was about to cry, but don't guilt trip me into buying food at an establishment that was priced higher than should be and obviously didn't honor their specials.  (To our waitress, I am very sorry we didn't stay, even your tears couldn't get us to stay.  I hope you still have your job.  If the management fired you for us walking out, that is just bad practice, patrons walk out of establishments for far less than what we walked out for (This shows that the attitudes haven't changed from the show)).Will I ever go back here willingly, probably not.  I'd return if whomever I was with begged and pleaded to come here.  That would be the only way.Never wrote a review before, but this place was so bad, I had to comment. I personally ordered some pizza for my girlfriend and I, and she ordered some cheese sticks based on her co-workers who recommended them. I will list the things that were bad.- We sat at the bar figuring that it would be quicker, it was not.- The gentleman serving as the bartender seemed like he was more interested in BSing with the regulars than serving us. At one point, my girlfriend was out of water for over 10 minutes. - The sauce with the cheese sticks was inedible. We actually had to eat our cheese sticks with ketchup. We told the bartender/waiter the sauce was awful, he didn't care at all.- The pizza was undercooked and overall bad. I got ill about 3 hours after eating and my girlfriend complained about her stomach hurting, ending our evening early.Overall, my expectation was raised after Robert Irvine was there, but if that is Robert's sauce...he sucks as bad at this place does. The cheese sticks were good and seemed homemade. Other than that, I give our experience an F-.I had planned on delaying this review, but an article in the Post Gazette says that Del's will be closing on May 2, similar to other restaurants featured on Restaurant Impossible.  This makes me so sad because Del's is super super cheap and decent Italian.  My dad and I came in last Thursday, and contrary to other reviewers, most of the service was pleasant.  Our waitress was in a rush but totally competent, and the other employees were pleasant enough.  Maybe because they are closing?  Anyway, we got the $10 dinner buffet, which included unlimited soup, salad bar, bread, five entree choices, a drink, and dessert.  Does it get any better than that?The five entrees were delicious.  The Pasta Mafalda (Marinara and Alfredo sauce) was my favorite.  The chicken and eggplant Parmesan were delicious as well, and the scalloped potatoes were good.  I didn't try any soups, but the salad bar and bread were good too.  The brownie dessert hit the spot, as well.  I prefer the Italian at the Pleasure Bar up the street, but this was good and heavy Italian food on a graduate student budget!The owner has a valid point in the news article:  It's not that Del's food is bad, but a lot of people want to eat at only the most trendy restaurant.  Del's is old-fashioned.  I like it the way it is.I'm bummed Del's is on its way out, but I really enjoyed my meal here!
Evo Cafe=Even as a Chinese student, I never feel the staff have basic courtesy at all. Every day they serve you with their disgusting faces as if you never pay for your bill. When I see their faces I feel no appetite. This is the Chinese restaurant that I have WORST impression. When friends ask me to go eat Chinese, I must ask whether they are going to EVO. If they say Yes, I say No.
Fibber Magees=I've been 4 times. The first 2 the food was ok, the soda bread dry and tasteless and the service was no where to be found. The music has been decent the decor is what you want in a nice local pub but the last two visits made me realize this is only a place where you can go if you are white and know people behind the bar. I love Guiness and it's depressing to go to a bar and not get asked what you want to drink for nearly 20 minutes. I've many friends of varying ethinic  backgrounds express this same sentiment. Additionally, one trip resulted in us leaving because apparently we sat at a table that was reserved for "regular folks". Who knew that first come first seated and served doesn't apply - they should put up a sign.3.8 stars.Pretty good pub atmosphere, great chips and pretty good fish, especially for the desert.  My fish could best be described as a plank.  Three good size Cod fillets that were bonded together by the beer batter.  In the traditional English style, I prefer the Haddock fillets but you really only find that in England and New England.The batter was laid on a bit heavier than I care for but it was still good batter.  The chips were nice long slices...perfect.The tarter sauce was slightly sweet, I prefer it tangier.Portions were good, particularly for the fish.*fyi-Fibber McGee & Molly was an early and long running radio show and is considered by many to be a precursor to the modern sitcom.5/12/10Came in to try some happy hour eats (Fibber Magee's offers 50% off all apps and flatbreads between 4p and 7p).  To begin my dining experience, I found the darkness in the pub to be overwhelming (a word I'd rather use in this context is "oppressing," but I'm trying to lighten up!).  I wouldn't have minded so much (as I could've sat closer to the door left ajar, which allowed light to come in), but then the music blaring out of the speakers overhead was just too much!  To compound the situation, the song selections were either U2 (which I liked) or jarring Irish punk rock (which I don't), most of which were of the latter.  :(  Perhaps I should've walked away after making these observations, but I've had FM bookmarked for at least six years now, and I wanted to get it over with.After many inquiries about food preparation, the bread used (which company?  specific ingredients used?), etc., I decided I'd go w/ the crabcakes and the braised rib sliders.  The crabcakes (topped w/ roasted red peppers and garnished w/ wasabi and mustard mayo, the latter I opted out) also came w/ a side mixed greens salad and a citrus vinaigrette. While this dish wasn't the best-looking of all the dishes I had that afternoon- don't let the pic of the bread pudding fool you, it was the best-tasting, but this isn't saying much.  I didn't care for the watered-down flavor of the citrus vinaigrette, and frankly, the crabcakes had enough flavor, so the lack of dressing wasn't a big deal.  I don't know if I'd order them again, though...  What was a big let-down was the braised shortrib sliders' dish.  Now these sliders looked fantastic, but the shortrib pieces were so sinewy and/or fatty, that, as much as I tried, I couldn't chew through any!  I really wanted to like these, bec. of those gorgeous-looking fried onion strings that sat on top of each slider.  Thankfully, my server offered to swap them for something else, and it was w/ a little sadness that I said goodbye to those onion strings :'(Lately, mussels haven't appealed to me, so my server's suggestion to try FM's wasn't giving me much hope.   Surprisingly, these mussels tasted OK, and the price is right (for happy hour), and if I weren't already not disappointed in the darkness of the pub; the loudness of the music's volume; and the sub-par quality of the shortribs, I may have enjoyed them more.  With the hope of finding something good to write about, I ordered the bread pudding.  (At this point, I should've just given up.)The bread pudding dish, which you'd think, looking at the pics I took, would taste good,  was a disaster!  It was dark in the pub, yes, but the dish looked like they just placed slices of bread down, showered them w/ dried cranberries, and poured some white chocolate sauce.  Something was amiss- was it even baked?  How was it prepared?  There wasn't enough cream sauce to cover most of the bread.  I was told that the bread was indeed soaked in the cream, and then baked, but this bread pudding had to be the worst I've ever tried.  The pics looked great, but don't be fooled...  The server was friendly, and most of the stars reflect her attempts to appease me, but I didn't enjoy my experience there, and would never recommend this place to anyone.I live a mile from here and trust me when I say I've been here a lot. It used to be our go to place for a quick dinner when we didn't want to cook. It also used to be the place we'd go for group get togethers in the back room. The bartenders and servers were always awesome and friendly, even remembering our names and favorite beverages. The food was pretty good, too. Now let's jump ahead to now. Over the last year new management has taken over. This was an Irish Pub and pretty authentic feeling, but the new owner has a family member who plays for the Seahawks (American) football team so it's quickly becoming an NFL sports bar. Happy Hour used to be from 4-7 which is great for those who work 8-4 and 9-5. Now they changed it to 3-6, which means by the time we start thinking of going out for appetizers and drinks, everything is full price again. Used to have great half price appetizers, but you can forget that now!My friend wanted a burger the other day and brought the 8year old with her. Was going to give the kid some of her burger, but the server said it was $2 to split a meal now. She's a little girl and barely eats anything, but the server was practically scared that her manager would find out. She said if her manager came out and discovered it, then he'd charge the lady for two meals. That's ridiculous!As I said, we used to come here all the time but this last year the changes have been terrible. I will be going elsewhere in the future.
Mastro's Steakhouse=Our Cow, who art in cow Heaven, Meat be thy Name. Thy Kingdom come. Thy will be done, on earth as it is in cow Heaven.  Give us this steak our daily Meat, and forgive us our slaughter, as we forgive those who slaughter us.  And lead us not into vegetarianism, but deliver us from hippies. For thine is the fields, and the Meat, and the glory, forever and ever.  Amen!The Meat Gods had really shined upon me this time. An all expense paid trip to Arizona with Mastro's as my first dinner. Sweet!! The hotel had called ahead to get us a table for 7 in the bar area, oops, they called the wrong Mastro's. Not a problem, as the staff here quickly made us a table. Once seated our CEO ordered bottle of wine #1 and I got a Grey Goose tonic as well. That's when I notice the lounge singer! There was this guy in the corner of the bar just butchering every top 40 song from 1970-1990. Total American Idol first round reject, but mildly entertaining with his wretchedness. Our server was also a fun kooky guy, I wish I could remember his name to give a shout out, oh well.We then got down to the nitty-gritty, the food. I smelled a few sizzling plates as they passed by and new anything I ordered would be top notch. I opted for the ever fatty and best cut of meat in my opinion, bone in ribeye. 22ozs of wonderfully marbled meaty goodness. Along with that our table ordered a half dozen oysters, giant shrimp cocktail, I got my own Caesar salad with anchovies, and there were some veggies that never made it to my end of the table. -  The oysters were spot on. Just a dash of horseradish, lemon and hot sauce perked them right up.-  The shrimp cocktail contained some of the largest shrimp I've ever seen! Just eating three of them would have filled up any mere mortal. -  My ONLY complaint with Mastro's was my salad. I love anchovies in my Caesar and they were happy to add them, but they gave me whole, oily fillets. The little guys needed a quick rinse and then should have been shredded in my salad. Oh well.Next came the meats. Behold the power and the glory that are lumps of flesh sizzling on a 400 degree plate!http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bdCByYMU8ZZhvhqfGo_UVQ?select=ORYu-cLe0SxineXThaNuYAOur server saw me trying to take a picture and he was gracious enough to shine a light on my prize so I could better document the momentous occasion. The ribeye was as good as steak can get. The fat had rendered into the meat and made it extra tender and delicious. The edges had nice little crusty bits and just the right amount of seasoning. Oh lord it was good. Along with the meats, CEO man had ordered bottle of wine #2, I ordered vodka tonic #2 and servers were heaping portions of spinach, asparagus and mushrooms onto our meat plates. As I neared the end of my hunk of sizzling love, I felt massive meat induced coma coming on. Thinking I would have no room for dessert, I ordered a white Russian to top off my meal and to send me into a tipsy meat sleep. But oh no! CEO man ordered 5 desserts for our table! And damn they were good! The chocolate cake was so good that we ordered a second slice as we finished the first one. Along with dessert, Italian CEO man felt that we should all have some Tuaca to top off dinner. I ended up having two since someone did not like theirs. I left happier and slightly drunker than I've been at dinner in a long time. An absolutely spectacular dinner!I can't believe I haven't reviewed Mastro's! This is hands down my favorite steakhouse in Phoenix and one of the restauranst I pick for a special occasion. Mastro's is the triple threat with excellent service, ambiance and food. Be warned that reading this might put you into a food coma. The food here is delectable and delicious. I don't think you can go wrong with anything on the menu but just be warned that it's very easy to fill up on the pretzel bread and salads before your entree event comes out! My favorite salad is the Mastro's House Salad and Wedge Salad. Both are tasty and both are very filling so be prepared that you might be stuffed! As for entrees, of course the steak is the best way to go but only if you are ok with getting it cooked medium well or less. It practically melts in you mouth! Other musts on this menu are the Gorgonzola Mac N Cheese, Lobster Mashed Potatoes and Warm Buttery Cake. If you only come here and order the sides and dessert, you will leave a happy person!Service here is always excellent and it's always a lively, yet romantic atmosphere. The bill will add up, so be prepared to pay for this experience but if you are looking for a dinner to celebrate a special occasion, make a reservation here!Yelpers gave Mastro's Steakhouse some rave reviews.  So, of course, my boyfriend and I had to try it.WOW!  The food, ambiance, and service were excellent!My boyfriend had the ribeye steak with creamed spinach, and we shared the lobster mashed potatoes.  I had the clear lobster roll and the New York pepper steak.Everything was wonderful, and Mastro's high ranking is well deserved.It's pricey, but you get value for your dollar here.We shall return!
Yummy Grill & Sushi=Sometimes you eat at the three star restaurant and other times the three star place eats you. I like to try restaurants with a 3 star or 3 1/2 star average. It does two things, reminds me of why I eat at four and five star spots and that sometimes the masses are wrong. In this case, the masses were right. Stopped at Yummy Sushi out of convenience. The first sign of inferior food should be the name, "Yummy". I went in and fully intended to try sushi, but instead ordered the spicy ramen with added pork for an extra $2. I also ordered the steamed beef dumplings. The Ramen broth was actually very good. A nice amount of spice and a decent depth of flavor. A few off putting things, chopped red bell peppers (I have never seen this type of pepper used in an Asian styled soup before), and the ramen noodles tasted like they were from a $.25 dorm room favorite. Beyond that, the pork was tender and the other veggies in the ramen were decent. Nothing to recommend so far.The steamed dumplings were a little chewy and flavorless, but when drowned in the provided sauce, they were meh.HIGHLIGHT: The service was crazy fast and super attentive. If it wasn't for this, you would be reading a two star review right now. If I could, I would give a two and a half stars, but I'm nice and always round up.
Kobe Japanese Steak House=Kobe (Koe-Bay).We haven't been to one of these places for a teppan performance/meal in quite awhile.  We last went to one about 3 years ago in Boston.  Prior to that was about 5 years ago in Denver.  Before that was Cleveland about 9 years ago.  Based on that, look for another teppan review late in 2012 from either Chicago or Seattle - I haven't decided yet but the fares are good that far out.Our chef Gabriel did a nice job on both the food and the performance.  There was plenty of throwing things in the air, spinning various implements around, flashes of fire, smoldering onion volcano's and tidbits tossed to the folks around the table who tried mostly successfully to catch as well as our dog.  Gabriel also rewarded folks with a nice shot of sake from his squirt bottle.  I actually had enough of these to have a nice sake buzz going.  That's right - I catch food like a dog better than the other folks at the table.  A fact I'm not sure I should be proud of.I ordered the filet & shrimp.  It came with miso soup which was fair and lacking very much tofu, a small and plain salad with a pretty mild ginger dressing, grilled shrimp appetizer and white rice.  This is the only teppan meal I have had that does not include fried rice - it is a couple bucks extra.  I opted for the fried rice which was pretty good.  The shrimp (both the appetizer and those that came with the main course) were tender and tasty.  The filet was not as tender but still tasty.Overall, not a bad deal for the meal & show.  I frankly have grown a bit weary of these but it is fun to go with kids or teppan virgins.I had gift certificates to this place and wanted to eat healthier so it was decided that my wife, Kathy R., my grandson and I would head here for lunch. My wife got the Kobe steak & lobster, Kathy R. got the kobe steak, my grandson got the kobe steak and lobster and I had the kobe steak.  All the meals come with: Miso soup, salad, choice of white or chicken fried rice and grilled veggies. When you go to a teppenyaki restaurant, you don't really go for the food, you kind of go for the entertainment. but this place served Kobe beef. Kobe beef is known for being lean, lower in cholesterol than chicken or turkey. it is known as  Healthy beef? In fact all of us  commented that the steak was so succulent it melted in your mouth.Kobe has community seating...(The tables are designed to fit 8 people) You are seated next to other parties around the chef and the chef comes by after all orders are taken. Then in addition the chef brings all fresh ingredients to the table and cooks it for you on the spot with various tricks! The show is very impressive.  The "show" is the checf who cooks in front of you.  In this case he also pulled tricks with knives and fire to keep us all entertained.My steak was cooked perfectly and melted in my mouth. There is nothing like Kobe Steak. The Miso soup was excellent, the salad was so so,  the grilled veggies were ok. It also came with white rice which I did not eat. I only had a few bites of everything and took a lot home with me for later.  One last thing about the meal sevral people at our table ordered fried rice so  we were given the opportunity to try some since the chef made extra. I must say even though I only had a bite OMG it was good. It had to be the best fried rice I've had in many years. FOOD:  If you rate the place strictly on food, then it's not that spectacular. But you're not here solely for food. You come here for an experience. PRICE: The prices are reasonable. SERVICE: After we got seated the waitress immediately gave us menus and asked us for our drinks/orders. She was welcoming, and  was always right there when we needed her to be. She was simply excellent,  efficient, and friendly.  AMBIENCE:  Overall I enjoyed the restaurants environment and vibe! Perfect for families and group celebrations! It's pricey but you gotta keep in mind you're also paying for the entertainment and its unique service. CONCLUSION: This restaurant is fun for birthdays, Anniversaries, special occassions, group outings, couples, and kids. It's entertaining and the food tastes great.   RETURN FACTOR: 100% will definitely be back here but only for a special occassion..
Jollibee=Is the food good?  Unless you're Filipino, the answer is a resounding no!  For some reason, this place is like catnip for my Fiancee and her Filipino family.  The clear standouts that make this place worth the trip are:1. Cheesiness.  No more cheesy than your average fast food place, but this is Pinoy cheese!2. Chicken Joy.  This is some damn fine fried chicken.  I'll give them that.3.  It will make your Filipino in-laws happy!4.  It is a quick and easy way to get some halfway authentic Filipino food somewhat easily.  Give it a shot, I would even suggest driving across town for it, but you probably won't need to go twice.ps.  I plan on copying and pasting this review into every Jollibee I've ever had the pleasure of being forced in to, just so you can see what I am subjected to on every vacation.  *sigh* the things we do for love.Another Chicken & Burger joint that has popped up over by Boulevard Mall...so I decided to give it a go.Located inside the Seafood Supermarket I had NO IDEA it was a filipino fast food franchise..It simply READ Chicken & Burgers...I don't really have much to say on this one....I barely got past the smell of the burger to take the one bite I tried before spitting it out. Definitely an acquired taste because the place was packed and everyone else seemed to be enjoying the chicken meals not too many eating burgers:(I watched Anthony Bourdain's new show "Parts Unknown" on CNN, and in this week's episode it was on Koreatown in LA. After watching this, I was starting to plan my foodie road trip to Los Angeles. I saw that he visited a Jollibee on that episode, and I remembered that there was one in Vegas. I went to the one here, so that it would help save some time when I get to LA (also to help save my stomach). I stopped by before going into work to get some food, to go.This Jollibee is located in the Seafood City supermarket between Flamingo and Twain on Maryland. You can't miss it because it has a huge sign, and it is right next to the Best Buy. Parking here can be tricky, sometimes the lot is packed, and other times there is plenty of parking near the store. After you walk in, there is Chow King on the left, and Jollibee is on the right.Jollibee is actually a chain of fast food stores. It is considered to be the "McDonald's" of the Philippines. There is a menu full of items: sandwiches, fried chicken, entree's, breakfast items and desserts. I wanted to try the same item's from the show, so I picked out an Amazing Aloha Burger, a little big bite Spam sandwich, and a Halo-Halo. There is a counter similar to fast food places where they take your order, and after ordering, the'll give you a number and you pick up your food when they call your number out. My order was done pretty quickly, and the employee's were nice.Amazing Aloha Burger - A large burger that comes with Aloha sauce, patty, lettuce, cheese, bacon, and pineapple. The advertisement picture is misleading, you only really get a quarter of a slice instead of a round slice, of pineapple. The burger itself was very good. The meat was tender, and the lettuce was fresh. The Aloha sauce was more on the sweeter side, and it complimented the sweet-sour taste of the pineapple pretty well. The bacon was the key, it tied all the flavors together, without it, it would be a boring burger. The only complaint would be that I wished the pineapple slice would have been the same size as the one in the advertisement. But other than that, it was a good burger for a fast food joint.Spam little big bite - A slider made from a sweet roll, with mayonnaise. This one was OK. The bun tasted very similar to a Hawaiian roll, but just bigger, and was coated with a light sprinkle of cornmeal. It was toasted as well. The spam was a little bit more salty than what I am used too, but it was OK. For 1$ each, it was a pretty good deal.Halo-Halo - I think that almost every culture in the world has a version of a sweetened icy dessert. This one came with shaved ice, sliced fruits, red beans, fruit jelly, and flan. This version at Jollibee has a predominant coconut flavor, and is very refreshing. It was good.For all 3 items I spent about 10.50. It was a good deal for the amount of food I received. The food was good, and so was the service.So you wanna eat at Jollibee huh?Coming from a Filipino, here's all you need to know. These guys are known mainly for their Fried Chicken, Sweet Spaghetti, Burgers, Hot Dogs and desserts. They have other items as well but these mentioned are what you will mainly see people eating when you go there. They also have all sorts of breakfast items as well but is only served during breakfast hours. Here is a link to their complete menu just in case you were wondering. http://www.jollibeeusa.com/menu.htmlWhenever you see a Jollibee, in most cases you will see a Chow King and a Red Ribbon as well because all three are basically the same company. Now Chow King and Red Ribbon are completely separate reviews so lets talk about Jollibee.Now why is it that most chains that originate from other countries just don't have the same appeal when they open locations abroad? I have always asked that myself. Could it be that something was "Lost in translation?" LOL. Anyways, the most common reason people come here is for the crispy fried chicken that comes in either mild or spicy aptly named "Chickenjoy". Now to many non Filipinos, when they get their order for the first time, they are surprised that it comes with gravy. Ironically, they are even more surprised that it tastes good with it! I for one think of biscuits, ham, or turkey with gravy. But chicken? Hay, don't knock it til you try it.As for their Spaghetti, its definitely not what you are used to. Filipino style Spaghetti is kind of a sweet style of ketchup with sliced American hot dog slices and ground beef. Again that seems like a weird combination but in most cases you will be pleasantly surprised.As for the prices, well the last time I ordered it was two 8 piece buckets. One was spicy and the other was mild. Total came out to about 23 bucks and change. So it was 11 dollars a bucket. Why is it so expensive you ask? Beats me. The only thing I can think of is that there aren't too many Jollibees around and the fact that each piece of spicy chicken has to have a little "spicy" flag on it tells me they have one specific person that does that and only that all day. So that person needs to get paid. LOL.Service? Well it's pretty much the same as whatever other fast food chains you would patronize. Obviously the more packed the place is, the longer you gotta wait for your food. I recommend to just call ahead and order to go so by the time you get there, wait times will be at a minimum.Last but not least. Desserts. For these guys, its simple. You have one of three choices. Halo Halo, Pearl Coolers, and Crispy Deep Fried Pies.Halo Halo (translated in English as "Mix Mix") - Shaved ice with evaporated milk, mixed with certain fruits, jelly, and flan, topped with a scoop of either Ube or Vanilla ice cream. Pearl Coolers - These are basically smoothies with boba or tapioca pearls. They usually have several different flavors ranging from Ube to Avocado.Pies - The best way I can describe these guys is remember when McDonalds used have their apple pies deep fried to a golden crisp? Well same set up here but different flavors. You got Peach Mango or Banana LangkaSo overall an ok 3 star rating is my pick because the food is decent but a bit pricey. The fact that its a chain can significantly drop it to a 2 but these guys do a decent job of trying to serve the same authenticity as its original base in the Philippines.Everyone should know (at least my fellow Filipinos should, anyway) that fast food restaurant with the red-and-yellow bumblebee as a mascot. Jollibee is a must if you're craving Filipino-style fried chicken, which I admit is better than all the fast food chains serving fried chicken.I ordered the C1 combo (two pieces of fried chicken, your choice of a side, and a drink). I decided to get one spicy and one mild to taste the difference. Everything was at the perfect temperature. The chicken was what I was expecting from Jollibee, tender and juicy. The skin (the best part) was crunchy and flavorful. The spicy chicken was actually spicy; it tasted more on the sweet side which went well with the heat of the spices. The mild chicken was the same, juicy and full of flavor. Honestly, I'll just stick to ordering the mild chicken because the spiciness can be a bit overbearing (it lingers on your tongue a lot longer than usual).This place will probably be packed when you visit, so if you're dining in you better grab a seat fast! Employees weren't really the nicest and there were flies in the dining room (which we had to shoo away periodically), but I think if you're craving some good chicken then you should venture on inside the Seafood City market and order some Jollibee.
Johnnie's Chicago Red Hots=Nothing wurst than a bad weenie. No bun intendend. But every so often I get a hankering for a hot dog. A Chicago hot dog at that. In the windy city at Milwaukee and Devon sits SuperDawg and it is a site to behold. But I ain't in the Windy City. I'm in the Hot Blistering Sweltering City. And I didn't know where to go. And then I drove down Thomas and saw the Vienna Beef sign! That was it. That's what I needed. The universe had answered my calling. You ever enter a restaurant and immediately have the instinct that you should turn your ass around and leave quickly. Yea. Well I didn't listent to my gut. Cuz it was rumbling with hunger and I could smell the hot dogs steaming. The place wasn't clean. Ok, it was dirty. Stained floors, rec room style paneling with splintering chunks of wood and vinyl chairs with duct tape. Hmmm...still not enough for me. So I get home with my Chicago style dog, with pepperoncini, neon relish, celery salt, tomatoes in a soft poppy seed bun with krinkle fries. Ate it in 90 seconds. Spent the next 40 minutes in my bathroom. You get the picture. Thank God for that Reader's Digest I found under the sink cuz I would have been real bored."Oh Johnnie's you're so fine, you're so fine you blow my ....weenie?" OK so it doesn't rhyme, but Mr. Chang, owner of Johnnie's is a force to be reckoned with. He smiles. He greets. Takes your order. Makes the food. And is obviously passionate about what he does. He even has homemade chocolate cake for less than $2 a slice! But it's about the Chicago dog for me. Neon green relish. Pickle. Tomato. Celery salt. Mustard. Onions. On a steamed poppy seed bun...which I'm sure will cause me to test poz for opiates. For less than $4 you get your weenie and some delish fries! I'm so glad I went back and can't wait to have a Chicago dog made by an Asian man in the desert!
Tipp's 88 Thai Restaurant=I'm all about venturing out and trying new places in Tempe lately, and my latest find did not disappoint!  I remember that the location where Tipp's 88 Thai Restaurant now lives used to be Ichiban.  I never dined there, but Tipp's seemed to settle right in... the atmosphere was clean, warm, and welcoming.We were there at prime lunchtime on a Monday (today) and they seemed to be doing pretty consistent business.  We sat down right away and were given a visually appealing menu (as my companion pointed out and I agreed).  There was plenty to choose from including the traditional thai dishes and many more.  I noticed that there were many vegetarian options and 20 lunch specials.  I finally decided on the 'kang-ped' veggie with tofu, which is eggplant and veggies cooked in a red curry, coconut milk.  It was served with my choice of soup or salad (i went with salad), steamed white  rice, and an eggroll.  My friend had the pad thai which he said was really good.  I especially liked the salad... it came out first and was served with yummy peanut dressing.  The dressing seemed lighter than others I've had in town, and it was really tasty.  My entree was delicious as well.  Our waitress wasn't the most attentive (my water could've been refilled a few times more than it was), but we had a very good meal!  I'll be back for sure - maybe next time for dinner!***Please note - Tipp's 88 Thai Restaurant is closed on Sunday!  (I hate when you are craving something and go there only to find they are closed... maybe this will save you a trip!)
Greek Patio=Their rendition of taboule ($6.49) is mostly parsley and a little light on the wheat and mint. Still, a refreshing starter and definitely enough for two or three people.I come here for the souvlaki sandwich, a generous portion of cubed, marinated pork bundled in a pita topped with onions, tomatoes and tzaziki. The sandwich ($7.99) is served with fries, which I like to dip in the tzaziki too!The baklava ($2.99) is OUT OF THIS WORLD! Soaking in a delicious rose water syrup... yummmmmmm!!!Summary: stingy on the feta cheese and too much use of dried spices.We started off our meal with a hummus app and 2 glasses of house wine (only $1.99/glass during happy hour, M-F, 4-7PM). No complaints about the wine and the hummus was decent.Next up we received our Greek salads. Not much feta in the salad, not much cucumber, not much green pepper (I think there was one in mine).For the main course, I ordered up the Greek spaghetti, which is one of my favorite Greco dishes. Again I was subjected to the attack of the missing feta, as they sparsely graced my plate with a few blocks of the good stuff. The pasta also had a good amount of dry spice mixed in with it, which wasn't very pleasing to eat.I really wanted to like the Greek Patio, especially since it's close by to my house, but due to the issues above, I'll be sticking with the Golden Greek and My Big Fat Greek Restaurant. It's worth the drive for me.
P&G's Pamela's Diner=I know, I know.  Everyone in Pittsburgh is all into Pamela's breakfast.  But I just don't get it.  I don't like my pancakes crepe thin and extra greasy.  And I really don't like the crispy, crunchy edges.  That's pretty nasty to me.  And the lyonnaise potatoes, while good, are just potatoes.  My friend had an omelet that looked pretty good.  And I'll admit, I stole half a slice of his toast.  I'll probably go back, because it's a good location and the service and decor were both good.  But I'm not going to lose any sleep waiting to go back or craving this stuff.....Honestly, it's hard to say anything that hasn't already been said about this place. After all, Pamela's is widely known for serving the best breakfast in Pittsburgh, and for good reason. (Even President Obama approves.)Believe it or not, until this past weekend, it had been at least a couple years since I last ate here. Not that I had a bad experience or anything. I'm just an impatient person and get intimidated by the line, which sometimes on weekends gets wrapped all the way around the block.Decor inside has a nice, 50's diner throwback. Love checking out all the old black and white photos hanging on the walls.My all-time favorites on the menu? Any of the hotcakes, but particularly the banana and chocolate chip. And lyonnaise potatoes, which comes as a side for most of the protein-based menu items.However, this past weekend, while scanning the menu, I saw something new: Pittsburgh hash. Their lyonnaise potatoes mixed with kielbasa, sauerkraut and topped with Swiss cheese. It was a dream, and possibly the best meal I've eaten there. And that's saying a lot.I think this breakfast is best after a hard workout. Makes the calories more justified. I've eaten here after a night out once or twice, but the meal's decadence was too much while nursing a hangover. Haha.Everytime I visit Pittsburgh I must go here for their hot cakes. Love this place. They accept only cash and the wait is long during peak time on weekend.
Sushi Brokers=I love sushi and I'm not the toughest critic when it comes to sushi, but I consider Sushi Brokers just average... The food is fine; I've never been overwhelmed by how fresh and delicious it tastes. but I've never been sick from it either...I go to Sushi Brokers for the convenience factor (they are located on Scottsdale Rd very close to the 101) and the atmosphere.  The service is just OK as well... but they must be doing something right, because the place was packed when I went in for dinner on Monday night.I took my boyfriend's sister; She is 16 and I figured the music they play would be right up her alley.  I was right!  She knew the words to every song that blasted through the restaurant.  We both had miso soup and we shared seaweed salad and some rolls including spicy yellowtail, eel and cucumber. scallops, and salmon skin.  We didn't order the lollipop roll. but that is my favorite 'specialty roll' on the menu.  Everything was fine... consistently fine.  We missed happy hour, but I've been in the past and I like happy hour prices much better than the $60 I dropped there without alcohol on Monday.  I'll continue going to Sushi Brokers for the fun atmosphere and convenient location.  People watching is fun too, and with big screens all around, I guess you could go to watch a big game on TV as well.  Just set your expectations accordingly and you'll be fine!It's been over a year since my last Sushi Brokers review and I've likely been in a few times since then... the food is always decent, the prices are not bad, and the atmosphere is fun, especially if you like loud music and people-watching.  However, I have to take off a star for the horrible service!I went in for dinner tonight with two girlfriends.  We arrived right after happy hour which likely explains why the place was packed, but luckily, we did get seated in a booth inside shortly after we arrived.  The hostess was nice enough but the wait staff? Not so much!  (I had to use the expression "not so much" since that is Jared's latest expression of choice when he is not satisfied with something).The wait staff was almost nonexistent... our menus were left on the table after we ordered, our dirty dishes were left on the table after we ate, we waited a very long time to get the check, and the bathrooms were pretty filthy too.So I know I don't give 2 star reviews very often, but I can't help myself on this one.  I hope that Sushi Brokers will read this and take my feedback with a grain of salt (or in this case, with a drop of soy sauce).What happened to this place???  Sushi Brokers used to (when I say used to, I mean a few years ago) be our go-to sushi spot and has now gone downhill to the point that the sushi is not even edible anymore.  We stopped going there regularly but would stop in on occasion to see if there had been any improvement only to find even poorer quality sushi.   Our last experience there will definitely be the last time that we ever set foot into this place.  We ordered some yellowtail sushi and the lollipop, cowboy, and summer rolls, although we received a surfer roll instead of the summer.  None of the sushi was the slightest bit fresh and the shrimp dynamite that came on top of the surfer roll was filled with crunchy bits of tail and shells.  The lollipop roll, which used to be our favorite, tasted so fishy and disgusting that we couldn't even eat it and we left afraid that we would end up with food poisoning from the rotten fish.I would rather eat sushi from a grocery store than Sushi Brokers (and I can't stand grocery store sushi!).  It really is a shame to see what used to be a good place turn into such an all around disaster. If you're looking to try a new sushi restaurant, you'd be better off at just about anywhere else than here.I had so many ppl tell me Sushi Brokers would be a gr8 place to eat sushi at, especially having lived in Japan in for so long.  I believe Hiro Sushi, & have yet to find a find another place that can match them.  When we walked in, the loud, hellish music reminded me of RA - I hate RA & their wanna ambience.  Strike 1 against Sushi Brokers.The waitress was more intent on making a good impression with my boyfriend, who was wearing his "Retired from the Air Force" polo than she was in addressing me.  DEFINITELY STRIKE 2.  I was happy to sign the check AND leave her a $.01 tip in her hand.  Yes, I walked up to her and personally delivered it.The fish was SPOILED. To the owners - if you don't know how to keep your fish at the right temperature, learn, and quickly.  Your fish tastes horrible.Happy Hour here is an actual joke. There should be rules about fair happy hour prices because anybody can say it's happy hour, but do you really mean it you sleazy restaurant owners. Yeah the Long Island ice tea is $4, but after I mention that the thing has no alcohol in it, waitress admits that they use a pre-made mix. Very expensive drinks and beers only garner a $2 discount and the worst items on the food menu seem to be discounted most, like Tempura crap and endamme. I don't even eat Sushi, but my very "scottsdaleish" date did and she ate a $15 roll for Happy Hour!  Yes, she is a golddigger, but even that roll should be discounted. I suppose I could write it off as Scottsdale pricing, but not for Happy Hour. No 2nd date and no return to this establishment. Oh, our waitress was nice, would have must rather been on a date with her.I love this place. The sushi is always fresh which initially surprised me being in the desert. Definitely recommended.Tonight was one of the insulting, pathetic displays of customer service we have had.  My wifeis Gluten Free, and after clearly stating this to the server, and ordering a supposedly "gluten free" item (grilled mahi mahi on corn tortillas), they served the tacos on flour tortillas, and continued to insist they were corn tortillas.  The manager finally got involved and admitted they were flour tortillas, and the menu has a mistake.  For a Celiac, this is a pretty big mistake and can cause severe problems.  At this point, there was really nothing left to order except sashimi.  She also added on a salad, at which point the server asked if cucumbers are okay for gluten free!Clearly this restaurant needs to better train the staff on what this means.  The manager was also very unaccommodating and unapologetic.Unfortunately this is a place with decent sushi that we will never be in again due to their complete incompetence regarding accommodating special dietary requirements.Sushi brokers was my go to sushi restaurant  for the past 4 years. The service has always been terrible but I have been able too look past that as I favor all of their speciality rolls. This Sunday we went for Mother's Day and once again the service was terrible. Truthfully there are quite a few good servers out there I have no idea why sushi brokers consistently hires bad waitresses. I'm not a very difficult person but after 10 minutes with empty water and ice tea glasses, I finally had to ask the bus boy to please get us refills. This happened 3 times that night as our server was no where to be found. Anyway the worst part of the night and the reason for the review, was the food poisoning that I got within 30 minutes of eating. I have never been so sick in my life. We ordered the sushi pizza, the spicy tuna and the cowboy roll. All which contain raw tuna. We noticed for the first time that the sushi didn't have the usual fresh taste it normally does but ate it anyway. Big mistake. When dealing with raw fish you should be held to a different standard. I feel sick just thinking about how violently ill we got from eating here. Suffice to say we will not be returning and advising our friends to avoid sushi brokers as well.First time here and not too sure what to expect. Walked in and the place is packed. Booths and bar tables. The place is loud with some good music playing. Let me clarify. Place was loud with everyone eating, drinking and having a good time. Very upbeat environment. We started out by ordering the eel cucumber roll, Shrimp Tempura roll, and Rainbow roll. I know my bad, I forgot to order the Surfer. Next time. The sushi was really good. Fresh and good. My wife really like the shrimp tempura but I'm not picky. Liked them all. I ordered the fish tacos. The soft tortillas were a little hard and the salsa was a little overpowering. Didn't taste the fish as much as the salsa. So the tacos were okay. Not great. My wife had the Yakisoba chicken. It had mushrooms, carrots, Broccoli, onions, and zucchini with thinly cut chicken. Loved the noodles and the sauce. Very tasty but the chicken was a little dry. Seemed like it was a little overcooked. My son had the teriyaki chicken dinner. He said the chicken was good and moist and he gobbled it all up. It came with rice and vegetables. I think it had zucchini, mushrooms and a ton of onions. Service was very good. Our server greeted us right away and got us our drinks. Our food came fairly quickly and he was constantly refilling our water glasses and checking up on us. So overall, really good sushi, okay dinner entrees and great service with a vibrant atmosphere. We enjoyed ourselves and will probably come back so I can order this famous Surfer roll (thanks Bonnie E)
Johnny's Italian Steakhouse=I would give this place much less stars if not for the food.We came here for my dad's birthday and after reading some of the reviews for this place I wasn't really expecting much. To my surprise, the food was pretty good. But the service was terrible. I'll start with the good.We started with Zucchini fries which were delicious. They were perfectly fried and seasoned and the sauce really complimented them well. Between all of us we ordered a filet with vegetables, the crusted goat cheese salad, the lasagna, chicken parmesan and tortellini portabella with grilled salmon. Everyone really enjoyed their dinner, no complaints on any of the food! Then for dessert we shared a crème brulee and a chocolate chip cookie dough arancini with cinnamon ice cream. Again, everything was really yummy. My brother complained that the dough on the arancini was a bit too chewy but that was the only downfall.Now for the kicker. Our service was terrible. Not terrible in the "our server was rude and didn't care about us" sort of way but terrible in the it took us two and a half hours to get through dinner sort of way. We waited at least 20 minutes between each course. It was absolutely ridiculous. The place was pretty empty too. I can't imagine coming here on a busy night!So, like I said. The food was actually really tasty. But when I go out to dinner I don't expect to sit there wondering if our server forgot about us after each course. I won't be rushing back anytime soon.
Jalapeno Inferno=We usually have gone to Jalapeno Inferno for lunch on Saturdays and one night a few weeks ago decided to go back and try it for dinner.  I asked for my Margarita like I always do there - Top Shelf on the rocks and - strained.  I don't like the pulp in their home made margarita mix.  I got the first one with all this icky pulp and just asked to have it sent back and just to strain it.  The owner came back and was so rude to my -- in front of our 2 kids no less - saying that he gave us the regular margarita since we didn't appreciate the fact that their mix is homemade.  I told him they strained it for me all the time on Saturdays - bless Patrick's heart.  The owner then told me he did not know how that was done.  I said "Well there's a little thing most bars have called a "STRAINER".  He said he didn't have one.  What???So forget the better tequila and the Gran Marnier that would normally be in my Top Shelf margarita.  I'm just some low life that didn't deserve that I guess.  So I find out -- this guy is the OWNER that treated us this way.  We have been there every Saturday at lunch with the 4 of us spending easily $100 a week -- through the slow summer when no one was there and everything.  Yes, good tamales and food in general.  But I'd rather eat in a barn than pay for rude service and line that owners pockets with my money.  We've never been back...I'm no sissy, but Jalapeño Inferno Bistro's Inferno salsa had me in tears!JIBM is located in a strip mall in the middle of no wear in Scottsdale, Arizona. Since it was such a warm, beautiful night, my fiancé and I decided to eat dinner on their outdoor patio. Since we ate outside, I'm not too sure how big the inside of this place is or what it looks like. Right when we were seated we were given a big bowl of complementarity chips and salsa. The great thing about JIBM's chips is that they give you both corn and flour tortilla chips. I love flour tortilla chips and since not many Mexican joints offer them, I ended up going through at least three bowls. Their salsa was really chunky and loaded with veggies, which is the way I prefer my salsa. I also got a side of their famous inferno salsa. This salsa was dark green in color and looked really watered down but to my surprise that watered down green salsa tasted like it was made in the fiery pits of hell. One bite set my mouth a blaze. Sadly, this salsa was all heat and no flavor, so I didn't touch it for the rest of the evening, which kind of bummed me out because I love hot stuff.  Since it was happy hour when we arrived, we decided to take advantage of their half off any appetizer special and order their South of the Border Platter, which usually cost $12.99 but we got it for 6.99. This is what this appetizer consisted of:Cheese QuesadillaGreen Corn TamaleMini Red and Green Chile BurritosChicken Mini Chimichangas Espinaca Con Queso and Beans (Cheese Dip)Besides the quesadilla, which was just OK, all of these items were really tasty, especially the tamale. This tamale is made with sweet white corn masa and filled with Mexican cheeses and green chiles. It was really, really good. In fact, their green corn tamale's have won the Best of Phoenix award for best tamale's.For dinner I ordered their signature Fundido and my fiancé got their Verde Valley Spinach Enchiladas. My fundido was made with a huge flour tortilla that was filled with delicious marinated steak, grilled onions and peppers and then deep fried and covered with an amazing jalapeño cream cheese sauce. My Fundido was wonderful, especially the jalapeño cream cheese sauce, which had an amazing flavor. My girl's enchiladas were stuffed with spinach and a slightly spicy cream sauce and topped with red enchilada sauce, espinaca con queso sauce and toasted almonds. Oddly, I did not try her meal but she said it was really good. Their rice and beans were good too.Besides the disappointing inferno salsa, my only other problem with this place is that all they have to drink is Pepsi products. They do not offer any aguas frescas like horchata or jamaica, which made me sad.  The service here was great. Our waitress, although very busy, always made sure we had everything we needed. She was also extremely friendly and even had a great sense of humor. The prices here were also really good. If your ever find yourself driving down Scottsdale road and happen to pass by JIBM, do yourself a favor and stop your car and grab a bite to eat. This place is definitely worth checking out if your in the area.AMAZING! We tried this restaurant because of a Groupon and will keep coming back because of the amazing food. The chili relleno was the best I have ever had and I lived in New Mexico for a year and never found one that came close to this place! Warm monterey jack cheese oozed from my chili with shrip and just a light batter. The fundido dish was very good as well. Just a kick of jalapeno and lots of cream cheese. The atmosphere was great. Service was fantastic. Several people checked on our table to make sure we were good. The complimentary chips and salsa were yummy, they don't just put regular chips, there were a different variety that were more like a crisp and they were yummy! They also gave us a card for $5 off our next visit which will be soon! This was probably the best mexican food I have had ever!I hate to be the Bad Guy. But, I have to tell it like it is.We were out in North Scottsdale and turned to Yelp for some Ideas for Mexican Food.Seeing 3 people that I know had visited this place and given them great reviews, we thought we would give it a try.Located in the middle of a shopping center, it looked nice,with a big outdoor patio. We went inside and were greeted by a male host who said we could help ourselves  to any table we liked on the Patio.I went to use the restroom to wash my hands before we ate. The ladies was nice and clean and very nicely decorated, I noticed some interesting art work on the walls on the way back to my table. This is where the good times end.Our Waitress ( I think it was Cyvannah) or something close to that, came right away and asked if we were ready to order. We said no,it was our first time there. We had not read the menu, but we ordered an Ice Tea and hot coffee. We got chips and salsa and our drinks. My coffee was old ,the bottom of the pot. It tasted it and there were grounds all in the bottom of the cup. My water glass had a big lip print on it. (NOT MY COLOR). So I never touched that. The Coffee mug was filthy as well. You can see from the photo I took of both of them. Because, later I asked if I could have a 2nd cup of coffee and our server said she would have to make another pot. Since that was the last of it she had given me. Well, there you go, I knew it.Yes, I would love another cup,thank you. I was thinking ,this will be great I will get a real cup of coffee this time. Almost 20 min later she brought it. The cup was just as dirty. Does this place not have a dish washer(machine) because, nothing seemed cleaned.Our food came no later than 5 min.after we ordered it. It took longer to get our to go boxes than the food that was to go in it. When she brought it ,she said,"Careful it is really hot". Well the dishes were hot not the food on them. Meaning they had all been microwaved.I ordered Chicken Soup. It was supposed to be spicy. when she put it down in front of me there were multi colored bubbles all over the top of it. I said, "wait, what are all these bubbles"? She said that happened while she was walking with it , it made Bubbles. Plus it is hot, that is the Bubbles.I took and spoon and scraped the bubbles off. They were soap bubbles.I did taste the soup, it was barley warm, and was not spicy. So either there was soap in the soup or the bowl when the soup was placed in it.My Dining Partner ordered and enchilada with rice and beans. The rice was old and dried out as you will see in the photo as well. We also ordered a sampler platter so we could try a little of every thing. Which everything on that as well seemed as if it was made before and reheated in a microwave.Nothing was good and nothing was hot. even the Cheese Crisp all the tortilla broke apart like it was days old. Fresh tortillas do not do that.The chips and salsa are good , but if you are gluten intolerant, don't eat the Flour chips, they are mixed in with corn ones. Our waitress never came back to check on us till the end. I had wanted Corn tortillas with my meal. I had been given flour. She brought those along with our check. Knowing that we were done with the meal. Looking back that day. I wish we would of asked to speak to the Manager. Maybe he or she was not there that day. Maybe that is why everything was so bad. We paid $50.00 for this mess including tip.Our waitress seemed very pre occupied with something else , somewhere else. There was another girl working the patio with long dark red hair. She was very on top of her tables and taking really good care of her people. So it was just us that had Cyvanaah on the patio.Anyway, it was a horrible experience and one that we paid a lot for as well. Check out the photos , I think you will be horrified. We both felt sick that night. I know it was from the food and I only ate a little.I am guessing that most people like it here for the Drinking ,the Happy hour. Because, I do not know how they could stay in business with dirty dishes and bad food.I used to come here a lot because they are so close to my home, however, this is not a destination for me anymore.  Last time we came here it was for my parenting group's moms night out.  The food is not very good, the service is mediocre.  Some of the margaritas are still good, but not enough for me to want to come here.  So sad!
Aureole=i'll break it down loosely and to the point.party of 16, good atmosphere, attentive for the most part during the orders. we obviously had a prefix 3 course menu since it was so many of us. had the spiced ahi tuna  which was really great, my main entree was the halibut and if i'd known it was going to be bland i'm sure i would not have ordered it, i ate about 1/3rd of it only and wasn't taken back by it at all, sadly. being a fan of cream spinach i ordered it as my side dish, it was ok but i've had better, no dis to the chefs. everyone just has different likings. the dessert creme brulee was great. service could have been better without a doubt. i had a blast because we were all there as friends, its not like we sit around and point out flaws. work it out aureole, work it out.Let's face it - when you go to Vegas, it's all over the top. It's not enough to be a great restaurant. You need a gimmik to make it noteworthy and to stand apart from the competition. Chef Charlie Palme's Aureole has chosen wine as their over the top signature statement.I could talk about the food, but I would have to say it's about par with the rest of the Vegas scene. Good juicy steaks, etc. I was dining on a prix fixe menu, as I was with a large group. My options were typical (an ahi appetizer, a filet, and a nice dessert). So my knowledge of the menu is limited, but I was very happy with what they offered, and my meal.Now, let's jump to the fun part - their take on wine.Aureole decided not to bury their 10,000 + bottles of wine selections in a basement or cellar. Instead, they opted to encase it in an acrylic tower that spans four stories (42 feet) through the center of the restaurant. When you enter the restaurant, you pass by this absolutely amazing tower of wine, displayed for all to see - from all four sides. Yes, it's cool to look at. But even MORE COOL? How they retrieve the wine. A beautiful woman, dressed in a sleek black leotard is hoisted up like a trapeze artist for every bottle. She is referred to as the "Wine Angel" and she's absolutely delightful to watch. Every time a bottle of wine is ordered, it's retrieved by the Wine Angel. She's a mesmerizing acrobat as she flies up within the encased tower, plucking your order out of her acrylic Heavens.You can also ask for the "wine tablet" which is an electronic wine menu. It sounds cooler than it is - as it had a bad user interface. I'd prefer to tip the wine angel $20.00 & tell her to reach for something tasty!Overall - review? Do go to Aureole once - or at least walk in to see it. The wine angel is something we've all dreamed about!!I'm not gonna lie, I'm pretty horrified by the experience I just had at Aureole.  I've been there for happy hour and it is fantastic.  Two for one small plates, wine and cocktails are pretty amazing.  And those sirloin sliders are unbelievable (the two stars are for those...and the happy hour).  But I have to say, the dinner experience was just weird and offensive.To start, I walked in and spoke to the host stand to let them know that our party would have one more for dinner.  It was then told that they did not have my reservation.  That was strange, I'd booked with Open Table and had mysteriously already received the points.  Turns out they found my reservation and told me that my party was already seated.  I guess I looked at them funny and they pointed at the table.  Turns out "I" was sitting with four people I had never seen before.  So they gave my table away.  No big deal, they weren't that busy, but it was weird that they argued with me that I'd already been seated when I was standing in front of them.So they said they'd prepare another table while we waited patiently in the bar.  After 30 minutes, no one came to get us so we checked in again...and finally got our table.  You know it's a bad sign when the first thing out of your server's mouth is a giant sigh.  Then he said, "cocktails, wine?"  No greeting, no smile, no nothing.  We asked for the wine list and he stared blankly at us.  We replied that we had no menus but that didn't seem to matter either.  So much for that Wine Spectator award.  They have a lot of great wines but you wouldn't know it, the servers have no clue about them or no desire to talk about them.  After being pressured into ordering beverages, we finally got menus.The menus are pretty simple and don't go into a lot of detail.  When the server came back he asked if we would like for him to talk about the menu.  We said yes and he proceeded to explain that they had a tasting menu and an a la carte.  And that was it.  When we asked for suggestions, he muttered something about being really busy.  Then he asked where we were from in a condescending tone.  Ummm...really?  WTF difference does it make?!  You'd think we'd walked in with fanny packs covered in condoms and suckers from a bachelorette party.  After answering no questions, another server came by and asked if we were ready.  When we asked him to talk about the menu, he went into the same spiel about there being a tasting menu and an a la carte.  Yes, we can read, but what about the things ON the menu???  They kept asking if we were ready but wouldn't answer any questions.  At that point, the bread guy was looking like he'd be a more promising server.  It was seriously like pulling teeth.  One even made a snide remark while walking away.  Most places love to talk about the menu, not this place.I'd reached a point where I really wanted to walk out.  I'm in Vegas for business quite a bit more than I'd like and I know that almost anywhere else would provide better service.  My friends ultimately decided we would stay and we placed our orders.Long story short-er, my octopus and hearts of palm salad had two slivers of hearts of palm and fishy, chewy octopus (I actually asked my friends what was supposed to come with the octopus because I could not remember and the only other main ingredients on the plate were cherry tomatoes & fingerling potatoes.  What is with this place and fingerling potatoes anyway?  They're in everything, but anyway).  My veal loin was overcooked despite my ordering it prepared as the chef saw fit and it was lukewarm.  The only good part of the meal is that this place seems to always send over comp desserts.I know everyone's so amazed by the wine angels, but I would have had a better experience watching the rock climbing wall at the gym.I now hate this place.  We were treated like an inconvenience rather than valued guests.  I miss Fleur de Lys, I really hope they reopen it.  If they don't and you absolutely must go to this place, only go for happy hour, otherwise you will end up leaving pissed and sorry you wasted your time.Impressive and innovative, a 5 star review on Yelp easily.Forget the buffets, forget the meal coupons- If you're looking to really class up your Las Vegas experience then look no further. This is 5 star dining at it's best- a beautiful, one of a kind restaurant. Know for their famous 'Wine Tower', Aureole has AAA Four Diamond awards and Michelin Stars all over the place.This was my first time at a Charlie Palmer restaurant, and it lived up to the expectations. The flavor in the food was as delicate and unique as you would expect. Flavors that open your palette to new things, tastes you've never experienced before. My tip- go before the Lion King show. They have a 'happy hour' with half off small plates until 7pm. I recommend the Lobster Corn Dog- the only way to describe it; droolworthy.I'll get the good part out of the way first. The food, overall, was pretty good. I had the parallel tasting menu, which included shrimp two ways (ceviche with avocado, crispy with chili sauce), roasted sea bass, rabbit with truffles and fettuccine, beef loin, sweetbreads, and macaron and creme brulee for dessert. The rabbit and the desserts were the main standouts for me. My friend had the wine pairing along with it, but he said the pairings were not all that great.The other highlights food-wise were the onion soup served in puff pastry, and the dessert sampler. Okay. Now for the rest. I hope you're not going anywhere.The service here was ATROCIOUS. Call me crazy, but if I'm dining at a one Michelin star restaurant with a group of people whose tab is over $1100 bucks, am I wrong to expect service that's better than my local Chili's? I guess so.We were seated by one waiter/captain and ordered drinks. My friend's wife ordered a glass of wine, and another person ordered a cocktail (amaretto sour). We then proceeded to order dinner. About half the table wanted the tasting menu, while the other half wanted to go ala carte. The waiter said that would be just fine. We also indicated that we were going to be paying separately...also told that would be fine.Food service began. Those that ordered the tasting menu got their food first. The head waiter/captain (different guy now) failed to describe all of the courses after they were served. He totally flubbed the dessert course...basically seemed like he had no idea what they were serving. The half of the table that ordered the tasting menu got almost all of their food before the other half got theirs, so half of our party just sat there twiddling their thumbs while the others ate.Finally the other food came out. Several people ordered steaks. None of them were asked if their steak was cooked to their preference. My friend's wife that ordered one glass of wine? She was brought two, for some reason. She also ordered a side dish that was never served. Throughout the meal, no water glasses were refilled. I had to ask each time for more water. Empty cocktail glasses sat unbussed. Breadcrumbs were never swept away. Empty sweetener packets were left on the table. After everyone had eaten, they brought out dessert menus. We looked but opted not to order anything. For some reason, two desserts were brought to our table. We thought that since no one ordered anything, these must have been given to us gratis. Nope! They showed up on our bill.Speaking of the bill. Like I said earlier, we had indicated that we were going to be paying separately. The waiter told us that he couldn't split it for us, but if we wanted to personally divide up the check he could put it on multiple cards. We gave in and did it. As we're tallying up the tab for everyone, head waiter dude comes back and basically chastises us, saying "you know, if you would have told me at the beginning of the meal that you wanted the check separated, I could have done it then. But now it's too late." Really dude? Fuck you.The last straw was when we finally had our bill sorted, everyone paid and signed. As we're leaving, dipshit waiter guy runs up to us claiming that one of us (me) hasn't paid. Bullshit. I said my bill is on the table. He says no, I never saw it. So I walk back to the table, and it's under a fucking napkin. Good job Einstein. Never thought to look there?The service at this restaurant is honestly one of the worst service experiences I've ever had. I almost feel like because we were a party of nine, and gratuity was automatically included, that they just said "fuck you we're getting tipped no matter what." If I'm dropping that much coin I expect things to run much more smoothly. It's a shame, because the food here isn't bad. But then again I've had much better for much cheaper. I can't imagine any reason I would ever come back here, especially with the multitude of other fine dining options available in Las Vegas.And if I ever see that worthless waiter again I'm gonna punch him in the balls.I've been told before that I'm "emotionally sterile". What does that even mean? Maybe, I'm not overly emotional, unreasonably dramatic, or fail to exhibit the cliched passion that comes with the warm fuzzies. Possibly, it's because I'm not googley eyed and in love and have yet to demonstrate the depths of true love. That may have all changed after my exceptional experience at Aureole. I'm in love with Aureole. I can now rant and rave and become emotionally obsessed with the rich and decadent life that I could lead with Aureole. Ever had a meal so good you think that you're going to faint from the deliciousness? Ever tasted something so good you literally had that elusive foodgasm? Not an easy feat, but damn you Aureole, I'm seriously sprung off of what you have serving up!First, let me just set the scene here. Mom, Susan 1 and I met at Mandalay for dinner. I had just come off my high of beating the house and I was ready to celebrate. We went to Strip Steak first and seeing that they had an hour wait, I remembered that incredible wine tower and boom! Dinner at Aureole was coming to fruition. We walked down the steps that curve along the wine tower-a pretty cool sight-down to the check-in stand. I wasn't in any condition for fancy dining-but it's Vegas-if you got the money, they got the goods. We were seated at a lovely table by the window. The sommelier came by and we ended up with a great bottle of Pinot Noir. Let's jump into our tasty meal.Cavier-Russian Golden Ostera served with toast, finely chopped onions, egg white and yolk and cream. Delicious-salty, briney and heaven with every bite! Let me just say that when I ordered the cavier, our server told us that they were out. Seeing the slight disappointment in my face, he excused himself only to come back a few minutes later and said he was SENDING someone to get my cavier from another restaurant on the property. WHAT?!? Roasted Butternut Squash with Succotash-Smooth, nutty and just spectacular! The succotash with arugula was so good!Roasted Chicken-served with black truffle jus-need I say more? The skin was crispy without sacrificing the moistness and flavor!Roasted Pork Chop with roasted tomatoes-Large portion, filling and well flavored!Duo beef filet with skirt steak-I like my steak medium rare-it came out the peerrrfect temprature and practically melted, and I mean melted in my mouth!Creamy Spinach Au Gratin-Susan's favorite! A great side-definitely very rich!Parmesan Fries-and dare I say I tasted some truffle oil in there? Dessert Sampler-Strusel Baked Apple-Yummy. Who doesn't love baked apple? It's the ultimate comfort food. Salted Caramel Bombe-Wow! Salt and sweet definitely go together here! Warm Molten Cake-I'm no chocolate lover, but I was giddy about this! Macaroon Tea Creme Brulee-a very different taste but surprisingly good!Tasting of Pumpkin-Spiced pumpkin cake, chocolate ginger pot de creme, honey caramel lollipop. All amazing!As if that wasn't enough-our lovely waiter, Jose brought us a large sampler of their sorbets to wrap up the night. The food was heavenly but it doesn't stop there. I don't hand out 5 star reviews just for anyone....The great food is just like great sex. Really satisfying and fun but probably won't keep me coming back unless there is some depth....And, like I said, I'm in love with Aureole...now let me tell you why....Our waiter, Jose was outstanding! Knowledgeable, warm and inviting! He not only brought us the sorbets but after drinking our bottle of wine-he brought me another glass of Pinot on the house! I told him how amazing our night was and thanked him for the experience. He then offered to give me, Susan and my mom a tour of the kitchen and to meet the chef!What? I didn't even know that things like this happened! My mom is currently in culinary school and the very thought of seeing the inside workings of one of Charlie Palmer's gems was something we could not pass up! Charlie Palmer of course wasn't there but we did get to meet Chef Vincent who was not only very accommodating but welcomed us in his kitchen! He even posed for a few pictures with us. He allowed us to take pictures of his kitchen and we sat and chatted for a bit. He even signed the menu and wrote  a small note for my mom. My mom's excitement was priceless-she is extremely passionate about her culinary studies and the look on her face was worth every single penny I spent at Aureole. To sum it up:Food-5 starsWine selection and the"angels" that grab the bottles-5 starsService-10 stars (it's my review, I can give 10 stars)Ambiance and experience-100 starsThank you to Aureole! I love you! Thanks to Jose and Chef Vincent as well!***The food at Charlie Palmer's Aureole varied from okay to below average; I think you could have a decent meal here but probably not a great one***Aureole definitely feels like a restaurant that might have been great when it first opened (though the standards and food quality are not there now).  The restaurant itself is nice.  The space goes beyond high ceilings with a massive glass wine tower.  The dining area is nice--it is contemporary and elegant (with white tablecloth) and there are big windows that provide a view of the outside greens.In terms of the menu, there are two tasting menus (a seasonal tasting menu and a parallel tasting menu, which presents a primary ingredient in two separate preparations on the same plate).  There is also an a la carte menu (with some nice sounding dishes).I had the parallel tasting menu because it sounded like an intriguing concept.  There were definitely bright spots, but there were also some average to below average courses (from the concept not being great to begin with or poor cooking of the ingredients and thus not yielding the appropriate flavor/texture).  Here is the rundown on the tasting menu:(Roasted baby beets, tangerines, herb cheese, bourbon maple syrup) This dish was good.  I really liked the flavorful and juicy beets as well as the creamy and lightly tangy cheese.  The tangerines were just okay (not as vibrant as they could have been).(Golden beet panna cotta, cured salmon, tangerine lace) The golden beet panna cotta was creamy and did have a mild beet flavor.  The cured salmon was okay in terms of flavor, but I would have preferred more freshness and moistness.(Diver scallop, white asparagus and scallop terrine, wild mushrooms, asparagus, yuzu froth, trout roe) I thought the scallop was good.  It was very fresh and moist and had a good outside sear (though it was a tad salty).  A lot of times, froths/foams taste of nothing, but the yuzu froth here was surprisingly strong.  With the slight saltiness of the scallop and the strong yuzu flavor, this dish was not as light as it should have been.The asparagus terrine was okay--I was not a fan of the gelatin-like texture and I thought it kind of tasted of nothing.  The garnishes of wild mushrooms, roe and asparagus were fine.(White asparagus, crispy Serrano ham, black peppercorn gastrique) I like how white asparagus pulls apart like green onions and these were a good representation of that (nicely cooked).  The Serrano ham was crispy and salty.  Like the scallops, I felt this dish should have been lighter in flavor.(Roasted Niman Ranch pork tenderloin, wrinkle potatoes, grilled baby leek, romesco sauce) This was a very below average dish.  The pork tenderloin was visibly overcooked and it was quite dry.  The sides and romesco sauce were not bad (the wrinkle purple potatoes were nice and tender), but they were not great either.(Pork sausage, crispy rock shrimp, steamed bun, cucumber salad) This dish seemed way too close to its Asian/Vietnamese basis.  The flavors and fragrances were okay, but I think you could get a much more flavorful and fragrant dish at a good Vietnamese restaurant.The only element that really stood out was the crispy rock shrimp--very moist but also a light and crispy outside.(Ginger beignets, poached strawberries, lychee sorbet, lime rind) The ginger beignets were very disappointing.  They were filled with a ginger custard.  And because of this, the kitchen had to probably chill the beignets.  Unfortunately, the beignets were not evenly warm.  They were half cold, which was disappointing (especially when you think beignet, you think something hot, light and fluffy).The lychee sorbet was cool and refreshing and I really liked the lime rind (small but very strong in flavor).(Coconut ginger vacherin, braised pineapple, vanilla Chantilly, meringue) This dessert was okay.  The vacherin was creamy and cool.  It was filled with pineapple and there was more of a pineapple flavor than a ginger flavor.  While I thought the dessert was kind of a standard dessert, I really liked the braised pineapple (sweet and not too tart), which looked like ginger.There was also an assortment of below average complimentary bread.In terms of service, the food came out at a good pace and the staff was attentive.  I thought the female servers were more personable and pleasant than my main male server (who was still polite).For a fine dining place with a notable chef backing it, the price for their parallel tasting menu was not as high as other similar Vegas spots.  The food was disappointing though and given the lack of quality, it felt overpriced.Aureole may have once been a good fine dining spot, but I am not sure if you can get a great meal here now.  If there was more attention to detail (and better cooking/preparation of the ingredients), you might be able to get at the very least a decent meal here.Aureole is located in Mandalay Bay (free parking structure).
Almaza Hookah Cafe=I used to live down the block from this place and never stopped by. I mean, it seemed like a nice spot but I just never got to going. But I frequent Vegas regularly and decided to give this place a shot. Much to my demise.The hookah was mediocre at best (I've been to alot better in Vegas for half the cost). I ordered some food for myself and my date. I can honestly say the food was decent. The server was very accommodating. But looking back, I realize that they were TOO accommodating (you'll see why later). Then things went from good to horrible in a matter of a few minutes.After my meal, things started to change. The server kept urging my date and I to move from the "dining" section to the hookah section. His concern was maybe that we were taking up valuable space. And for this I understand, but it seems like a rather slow night so I didn't understand the rush. They had a dj playing house music. I didn't mind since I enjoy house music and it a place like this it really seemed appropriate. But in all honesty the sound system was absolutely horrid. I can go into detail about it, being somebody who works in pro audio. But let's just say that had they hired somebody decent to set this up, they'd been alot better off.But I guess it wasn't their fault because at around 10pm, the pull the dj from booth (literally mind you) and they go to the back (but not completely out of sight) where I'm assuming an argument ensues. I turn around and mind my business smoking sub-par hookah. But since the music was apparently done, so was my date here.So I ask to close my tab only to find over $300 charged to my account! I'm told by the manager of the place (who is now flustered by the incident with the dj) that this was only an "authorization". I was appalled, a $300 authorization?!?! This is a meal and some drinks, not a hotel room or rental car!!! I write the amount of the official bill (after asking to see an itemized one) on the slip and signed.Well, guess who had to perform a chargeback request? That's right, me. This "authorization" never got changed at the end of the night and I found myself trying to make the next couple days away from home on the cash I had on hand. Overall, this place is trying to be some posh lounge in a desert full of posh lounges. But seriously, how "posh" can you be when you're situated next door to a Cici's Pizza?One star for the overall suck of this place. Had the food been worse, this place would get a big goose-egg from me. Do yourself a favor, don't go to this wolf in sheep's clothing.
Big Sur Oyster Bar=My birthday is long past, it is October 4th, and a friend at work had told me he was taking me to get some king crab on my birthday, well 5 months and 19 days later we finally made it. We sat at the bar and ordered the King Crab Special in case you are not familiar with this it is 1 1/2 pounds of king crab legs with butter and lemon for 16.99. I had actually never had King Crab up to this point... The lady working the bar let us try the clam chowder which for some reason I have always just come to the predetermined decision that i did not like clam chowder, until now.. It was "AMAZING" now my grade of amazing may be different then yours when it comes to clam chowder since i had never really attempted eating it until now, so please refrain from the Clam Chowder Critic Hate Mail.. Thanks. So back to my Crab. The cook set the mound of freshly steamed crab in front of me and said enjoy, and that is exactly what I did. The meat was delicious and very plentiful. I don't think 16.99 was a bad price for the amount of crab that we got. I was very pleased with the food " a few new found favorites " and the only reason why I took a star away was really due to the casino not the restaurant. All the smoke is not very pleasant when you are eating. After eating here I think everyone needs a little crab in there life from time to time.
Taco Time=Growing up in Seattle, Taco Time was a normal stop for me and my family. Since moving to LA, and now living in Vegas, I was only too happy to discover this childhood favorite right here in sin city. Now whether you are a first timer or a regular here, there are things that you need to know. First of all, there are two different versions of Taco Time. This one here in this review and the original that is abundant in Washington (also known as Taco Time Pacific Northwest). I call any Taco Time outside of the Pacific Northwest an "Express Taco Time" because they don't have the complete menu and most importantly, the hot sauce is in packets! In Washington, they make the hot sauce made fresh from scratch!The good thing is that the main items that they are known for are readily available. My most favorite item is their crisp burritos which come in chicken, pinto bean, and the best of them all, beef. Allow me to describe it. Seasoned ground beef rolled up in a flower tortilla and deep fried to a golden brown. Kinda looks like a large taquito only way better! Damn, my mouth is watering right now just typing this! Get that in a combo with mexi-fries (basically tater tots) and a drink, you're all set! Dipping these items in their hot salsa is the cherry on top! Occasionally I have one of their tacos, soft burritos and taco salads, which is not bad either. Those choices are up to you. To me, the crisp beef burritos have no equal.I gave them 3 stars because of their location and not so good service. It's in a food court in between Burger King and Subway. The food court itself is smack dab in the middle of a truck stop, which doesn't make it any more appealing. The service is below mediocre because you have one employee that handles everything from taking your order, to cooking, to calling you when it's done. So if you ever go to Seattle, make Taco Time as a part of your itinerary. For more info, go to their website: www.tacotime.comIt's Taco Time. Yeah, right!.  Just letting you know right now, not my idea to come here.  But it was a co-workers time to pick lunch and he swears by this place. Why you ask? I even wanted to know.  Well, this is the only Taco Time in Las Vegas and he grew up on this stuff back in Utah. Big deal...now let me eat.  Nothing on the menu was appealing to me, both taste wise and calorie wise. I ended up pulling up the myfitnesspal app and found something decent.  I ended up getting their Crisp Chicken Burrito.  I know, their known for their burritos. I just didn't want to indulge knowing that a big dinner was within a few hours.  Their Crisp Chicken Burrito is basically a large deep fried taquito in my opinion.  Tasted okay, but that's about it. As for the ambiance...yeah right.  This Taco Time is located at a truck stop off Blue Diamond across from from the Silverton Casino/Hotel.  When you're in here, you almost forget you're in Las Vegas.  For a minute, I thought I was in Barstow or even Baker.  Service wasn't the best and they didn't even have forks.  Good gravy...I doubt I will stumble back in here.
China Chan Restaurant=I don't usually try dim sum places when I'm traveling unless I'm in a city with a big chinatown (LA, SF, NY). But it just so happened that China Chan is really close to my hotel. I decided to give it a try because of the reviews on Yelp! and I gotta hand it to you guys for being spot on.I was pretty worried when I pulled up to see that the building looked like something that used to be a fast food joint. I decided to go through with it anyways and when I walked in, I was greeted by a hostess in Cantonese. When you hear Cantonese at a dim sum restaurant that you're unsure about, it sounds a little bit like music in your ears. After we settled down and ordered our drinks, we started looking through the dim sum menu (this is one of those places that the carts don't come around... you order off a piece of paper and then everything is made to order...) and was SHOCKED to find that most of the items were priced at $1.80 per order. In my neck of the woods (Austin, Texas) most of these items are easily priced at $2.80-$3.00. So my buddy and I pretty much went nuts ordering. We ordered about 10 dishes (which is enough to feed 4 people) and our total bill was $23.00!!!Growing up in HK, I've had my fair share of amazing dim sum. Even though China Chan's dim sum was not the same caliber to be compared to those of HK, I thought that overall most of the food was pretty solid (especially taking the price into consideration). There were some stuff (like the curry puff) that I thought could have been a little more warm when served. For the most part all of the dim sums that we ordered were spot on.The service was great, but I couldn't give China Chan 5 stars because there were some misses here and there. Taking the price into consideration though, I'm not sure if Phoenix natives just don't know about this place or there're not a lot of dim sum fans here because we were the only table there the whole time we were there. I would highly recommend this place. In fact, I'm pretty serious about going back there tomorrow to get my dim sum fixing before I head back home.5 stars for fresh inexpensive dimsum, minus one star for decor.It's been a while since we've been back but since it's Chinese New Year, it's worth the trip.  I was excited to see an expanded menu, especially the Pineapple Bun with Char Siu, which I had asked them repeatedly to add, since it was all the rage in HK and Vancouver.  As far as I know, no other restaurant in the Valley offers it.  There is actually no pineapple - just looks a bit like the outside of one on the top, which is sweet and crunchy, providing great contrast to the savory roasted pork filling.Everything's as good as I remember with the same ridiculously low prices. Only the Chiu Chow dumpling was disappointing - soggy wrapper with dried out meat filling.  Can't believe this place is not packed to the rafters.  I say ditch the old-fashioned push carts and choose dimsum steamed to order!  Plus they now have picture menus!Dim Sum, Chapter IIAbsent were the bustling carts, leaving a trail of steam and aromas of delicately balanced Asian delights. In its place, a photo-accompanied menu a la sushi style made its way around the table. It was a method that fit China Chan remarkably well.We were a band of a dozen foodies, converging on China Chan on a Sunday morning. We ordered en masse and our food came out in wave after delicious wave. Everything was delightful.As the second instalment of UYE: Dim Sum drew to a close, we were satisfied.
Flat Top Grill=Flat top has changed their "self service" system to a "we stand behind a glass and you tell us you want system."  So basically they're now the "Subway" of "Asian Fusion"  restaurants.    They claim it's for sanitary reasons.  However, it doesn't really feel like that.  The waitress told us we could ask for more toppings when we were up there.   However, when we went up to get our food, we were hastily rushed through the line, and basically given a feeling that they didn't want us asking for more.   I also noticed they gave one girl (who happened to be quite attractive) in line more service and time to choose, while rushing every one behind her to pick and move on.  If this means I am quite ugly, so be it.  I'm not into men either.  When we came back to our table, we found two people sitting right next to our two chair table.  This may sound like a petty complaint, but the place place was very empty.  They could have seated them a table or so away.  It felt like we couldn't enjoy a real conversation with out listening out there's too.   I also noted a lot of unhappy faces from the waitstaff.  The servers morale seemed pretty low from all of this changes, and it shows in the service.  I also noticed the costumers across the room seemed pretty disappointed in the changes, and overall atmosphere.  DATE of visit:  9/5/2014.
Barro's Pizza=Looking for an A-MAZING vegan pizza (sans cheese)? Follow our formula at Barro's:Order a veggie special pizza with no sauce and no cheeseAsk them to use the white pizza mix as the sauce (oil, herbs and garlic)Add a side of marinara sauce for crust dippin if desiredResult = Stupidly awesome vegan pizza. We loved it.WARNING: It seems the "white pizza mix" may have Parmesan cheese in it. Not sure if it varies by location or not, but we've been given different answers at different locations. I suggest speaking with a Manager at the location you are ordering from to confirm this. We've had to ask for just olive oil, garlic and herbs as the base on a few occasions (rather than the "white pizza mix").
Elephant Bar Restaurant=What do you call an elephant with glass slippers?  Cinderelephant.This elephant walks into a bar...Had enough?Me to.  I probably won't be back to Elephant Bar.  My food wasn't bad.  It was just mediocre and overcooked.  For the money I could go so many other places.The atmosphere tries to be interesting and jungley-wungley with animal patterns all over the place.  It struck me as a buffet in Vegas.  I'm not quite sure why but that was the overall impression and it hit me quick.  Not one of the good buffets either.  A buffet overcrowed with blue hairs and sweaty tourists, a loud and bustling buffet with high prices and mediocre food.To their credit (I think) the desserts we split were huge.  I would call them family style.  1 dessert could easily have served 4 people.I used to love the elephant bar. We used to go about twice a month at least and now I find myself looking for other places. The food has been much more inconsistent and I keep trying to find something new to love and only find like. The jambalaya sauce has been different twice and neither time was the same as the other. The Thai salad dressing no longer has that great ginger flavor. I do like their burgers and the honey shrimp is good but not as yummy as my jambalaya used to be. They do have great email specials and coupons and I will keep trying hoping that it goes back to the way it was. The service is always great and we usually ask for the same two or three servers whenever we go. I love the atmosphere as well. Just after a couple eh meals I am sad!
Payard Pâtisserie & Bistro=Let them eat cake! During my stay at Caesar's Palace this past weekend I discovered the most amazing patisserie. My sister and I were heading to the Forum Shops and found Payard Patisserie and Bistro. Chocolates, pastries and ice cream oh my! I seriously wanted just about everything in this shop. The pastries were so beautiful...almost too beautiful to consume! Almost. ;) I purchased a box of chocolates as a gift for someone I know who adores chocolates. Word is they are some of the best chocolates ever. I also selected a package of Madelines which were so plump and fluffy. I even saw little flecks of vanilla bean. So yummy! One night after dinner we decided we could all go for a sweet treat. I ordered the coconut sorbet which was the most coconutty, creamy sweetest cold treat I have ever had. I also sampled a bite of my other sister's Raspberry-Rhubarb Napoleon. I'm not a rhubarb fan, but I couldn't even taste it. The pastry was so light and flaky! If you have a sweet tooth like me, you'll definitely want to pay a visit to Payard! Bon Appetite!3.5-4 Stars for Pastry2 Stars for ServiceBefore my trip to Vegas, I made sure to bookmark Payard Patisserie.  Francois Payard, famous pastry and chocolate Chef from France.  His only West Coast Patisserie and Bistro is here at Caesars Palace. Set right in the Casino near the restaurants and the Apian Way shops, I was so excited when I finally saw the big glowing "Payard" sign! I had died and gone to pastry heaven! Upon entering you notice the beautifully arranged and fully stocked truffle and chocolate counter.  Further walking in, my eyes finally laid on the pastry counter.  Just as the chocolate was fully stocked, so were the pastries.  Now this is exactly how to sell a product. No matter what time of day, even in late afternoon to evening when pastires are usually sold out, Payard continously restocked sweets to entice folks like me. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw?select=ePEZJsHZKfJKax4YMRQ_hwI didn't know where to start.  But here's the damage:http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw?select=3Lizm46K61CJAm4AREr_1Q* Banana Creme Tart:  The custard on the was flavorful and fluffy. There was a nice subtle banana flavor throughout, but minimal sliced banana's in the tart.  Overall, you get banana flavored custard. * Fruit Tart:  I'm a fruit tart lover.  A must for me when I go to a bakery.  The fruit tarts here at Payard were prepared beautifically with a good variety of fruits on top...but the crust on the top was too soft, and broke apart very easily.  I like to eat my tarts with my hands, so it was quite diffcult to do so with this kind of crust.  * Apple Tatin:  Refreshing dessert with whole apple slices in the middle.  Texture was a bit too jellow-y in my opinion but caramelized perfectly on the exterior. * Lemon Tart:  Skip.  Way too lemon-y to where the sour flavor over powered everything else in each bite.  Also way too sweet to where one bite ruined my palate, you can even feel some of the sugar crystals left over in the glaze. *yuck* Payard Patisserie also has a crepe counter and a delicious display of Gelato's as well.  Holy moly!  I also ordered myself a cup of the Mango flavor.  I like my gelato icy and they did an awesome job here.  The mango flavor was powerful and refreshing.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw?select=fQu-0yoC5jj0Hw7RTcVq3gWhile the desserts weren't bad here, it's the prices that were a bit painful.  Each pastry was $7.00 each, and a regular cup of the gelato was $5.00.  The staff here at the bakery are also very incompetent and unfriendly.  It wasn't even busy when I visited, and yet they still don't have the energy to ask if I needed help.  Apparently there is only one line to order for all three different counters.  They neglect to inform you of this one line, so I'm left standing the other counters waiting for service like an idiot.  Overall, Payard Patisserie does a great job in terms of presentation, nothing particularily stood out for me, as certain items had too much overbearing flavor, or not enough.  They failed to balance sweet and savory in my opinion.  Will I be back?  Maybe...but please hire more informative and helpful staff.One of my new obsessions are Macarons. They are NOT called Macaroons, those are the English coconut version but "Macaron" the French version. They come in different colors and flavors like pistachio, strawberry and lemon. The little cookies are light and fluffy like little pillows with a burst of flavor and chewy in the center. Payard's Macarons come in a little variety pack of about 6; pistachio, strawberry, lemon, orange and chocolate. My favorite flavors were strawberry and pistachio. I practically ate the entire bag in one sitting. Thank God, we got a second bag for breakfast! ;) Definitely worth trying these little pieces of heaven.***Wolfgang Puck highlighted Payard's macarons on the Food Network, but they were bagged and not that fresh; their other sweet options here might be better***Payard is a patisserie and cafe in Casesars Palace (near the gaming floor).  In addition to the food on site, Payard offers many attractive food gifts (like gourmet chocolates).  The shop has a nice high-end look to it and some of their individual desserts are impressive looking (they look similar to the individual desserts at Jean Philippe at Aria).I recently watched Wolfgang Puck talk about how much he loves the macarons at Payard on the Food Network so I decided to give them a try.  The macarons were not available individually.  They were sold in a bag of 6 for $10.The package indicated that the macarons were assorted flavors, but all the macarons were the same flavor, which was like a mix of hazelnut and almond.  The nutty flavor was strong and good (sweet, rich taste to the macarons). Unfortunately, the texture was not right.  I am not sure if it was because they might not have been fresh, but the macarons did not have that contrast between the slightly crispy pastry top and bottom with the soft and chewy center.  Instead, it was just soft and chewy all around.Service was quick and okay.Despite Wolfgang Puck's love of these macarons, the macarons did not appear to be the signature item here (they were hard to find and were not as lovingly displayed as some of the other desserts).  For a better macaron experience (both in flavor and texture), you should check out Bouchon Bakery at The Venetian.  If you do come here, you may want to try one of their attractive individual cakes or chocolates instead.Caesars Palace has complimentary parking.I think Payard sings a siren song that beckons all who love sweet treats.  Seriously.  Every time I stay at Caesar's Palace, I make it a point to stop by Payard multiple times.  I just love looking at all of the sweet little pastries and yummy candies.On my most recent excursion, I selected a box of the bourbon truffles as a gift.  I was informed that they were absolutely divine, melt in your mouth perfection.  Noted!I could not leave Payard without picking up a little something for myself.  I decided on the French Macarons.  OH MY GOODNESS!  I was officially a French Macaron fan after taking that first bite.  My favorite flavor was the Passion Fruit.  Delish!I also had the opportunity to partake in a little breakfast at the restaurant before we left for the airport.  I ordered the French Toast with fresh berries and whipped cream.  Decadent!  The toast was much crisper than any French Toast I've ever tasted, but it was quite good.  Of course, using brioche certainly helps matters.Oh, and I also got to see Francois Payard himself at his restaurant!  If I would have had a copy of his cookbook, I would have marched right over there and asked ever so sweetly for an autograph.  Oh well.  That will have to wait until my next visit.  ;)Is this the trail to Payard's Place, was all I saidThis concierge has heard that question lots beforeWe strolled through Caesar's Casino and marched straight aheadIt was on a corner curveFrom an inside counter serveIt was there where we saw the macarons.The waitress poured our water into tiny cupsShe got the caprese sandwich from the fridgeShe took crepe batter from a tin and whipped it upAdded mushrooms, chicken, creamIt was a Paris cafe dreamExpensive, but ended too soonThose summer nights, when we were freeFour-day vacation for wifey and meTravel eaters, travel eatersAnd in our quest for macaronsWe stumbled on these DESERT MOONsVegas dreamers, Vegas dreamersOf DESERT MOONsOf macaronsOf DESERT MOONsOf macaronsCaprese sandwich mozzarella fresh and lightBasil and tomato so mixed wellThe chicken crepe needed something to make it rightWe got mojito mint cheesecakeToo rich for me to takeAnd then we got to our macaronsI've never had a macaron I've liked beforeEuropane has the closest to me heartBut when I tried this Payard disk, I wanted moreThe fillings not too sweetA flaky cookie treatThese desserts made my tongue and heart swoonThose summer nights, when we were freeFour-day vacation for wifey and meTravel eaters, travel eatersAnd in our quest for macaronsWe stumbled on these DESERT MOONsVegas dreamers, Vegas dreamersOf DESERT MOONsOf macaronsOf DESERT MOONsOf macaronsLike my last trip to Vegas before, I made another impromtu visit to Payard Bistro.  This time it was for breakfast.Because I was impressed by what my friend had ordered last time, I decided on trying out their Croque Monsieur.http://bit.ly/114h4rUI've had Croque Madame sandwiches but never had a Croque Monieur before.  Even without the egg, it really is a completely different sandwich.  I do love the torched melted cheese on top.  That is a winner!  Good stuff!Unfortunately, I didn't stop for dessert this time since it was still early in the day.That's pretty much all I had.  I still think you're better off coming here for lunch as it's still the best "bang for your buck" lunch deal on the Strip.  Still a solid place to eat if you're around Caesars Palace.Looking for a breakfast meal that isn't fast food or $20 a plate can be a challenge when staying on the strip in Vegas.Two days we found ourselves grabbing a bite here to go. The first day we had coffee with  a muffin and a pastry. I had a blueberry muffin which I found on the dry side. One companion agreed that the muffin was dry, the other felt it went well with the coffee. The cheese pastry tasted like any other cheese pastry. Nothing special except the $4+ price.The second meal here we had actual breakfast. I had the veggie crepe. While ordering, I was quickly reminded by the cashier that these items were premade and could not be customized in any way. Ok. No problem. I liked that there was a menu item with no meat, cheese or sauce. The crepe was made with a buckwheat crepe, which was also appreciated. I don't remember the name of the other crepe ordered, but it was creamy with chicken. I hear it was good, but the person who ordered this felt nauseous after the meal. I'm not saying it was due to the crepe, but it might have been. The last item was the croque monsieur. I didn't did dare take a bit because it looked gooey and cheesy. It was reportedly good, yummy with the cheese. Coffee went well with the meal.How have I not reviewed this place yet!?  I first heard about this place from Food Network's "The Best Thing I Ever Ate."  Wolfgang Puck stated that the best macarons isn't found in Paris but at Payard Patisserie in Las Vegas.  What!?  After hearing such a statement, Mr. W. and I made it our mission to try their macarons and boy were we not disappointed.  Their coffee macarons are amazing!  I can pack those away like none other.  It's perfectly crisp on the outside, chewy on the inside, and never overbearingly sweet.  I hate it when people overload their desserts and pastries with sugar to compensate on lack of flavor.  It's never the case here.  Everything is delicious!  The raspberry lychee macarons and the pistachio are also amongst my favorite.  I haven't tried their savory dishes and dinner but some of my other favorite desserts are the opera gateau and the louvre.  You get what you pay for here and $30-something for a box of macarons is well worth every penny.  There's nothing I love more than receiving a box of macarons from Payard whenever Mr. W. heads to Vegas with his boys.   :)Spelled P-a-y-a-r-d, but pronounced "Pieyard", I think?Pricey? Yes, but it's in a major hotel on the Las Vegas Strip, so price shouldn't even be a point of contention. That being said, I walked out feeling full and not like I was taken for a tasty ride, I'll pay for decent food and good coffee. If it's your first time here definitely go with their croque sandwich, "The Classic Monsieur". This is prepared like a Dutch crunch sandwich, but with cheese baked on the actual bread for that salty crispy crunch! This sammie is stacked with béchamel, Swiss cheese, and boiled breakfast ham. I tried eating this with my hands, but it was just too big, so I ended up using a fork and knife to finish this off. If you're in a hurry, there's also a Payard Express located in front of the venue that's fully equipped with espressos, lattes, and some chocolaty snacks.  Breakfast and sweets, what an amazing conversation.
Town Talk II=The outside a 3*The inside a 4*The service 5*The food a 6* Oh wait it only goes to 5. I had the pulled pork and a side of dirty rice. TT2 does what the other BBQ joints have not. He uses a really good bun instead of a hamburger bun. The pork was great with goof flavor and the sauce was good. The rice might have been my favorite part of the meal. Wish they had Mt Dew!
Palm Court Restaurant=Okay, so it's not filled with the youngest, hippest crowd in town, but you can't get more elegant and romantic than this place. My husband and I were given a gift certificate to the Palm Court as a wedding present. So we decided to use it last Sunday evening for a combo birthday/anniversary dinner. Things could not have been better. It was one of those meals that takes over 2-1/2 hours but not once ever leaving you wondering where your server went off to or when your food would arrive. Each course of food was better than the last, and many of their dishes are prepared table-side. Kwan, our waiter, told my husband that he's been in the restaurant business 35 years, and it really shows. He personally prepared many or our dishes flawlessly (while waiting on and doing the same for many other tables). So here's a run down of what we ate... We shared the prawn appetizer (prepared table-side) recommended by Kwan. It was in a butter/cream sauce and served with risotto. It was very tasty, and I found the two shrimps apiece were the perfect beginning to our dinner. Next, my husband had the lobster bisque and I opted for a wilted spinach salad (again done table-side). The bisque was really delicious, but sooo rich, I don't think I could have handled more than my one taste. The spinach was a wonderful memory of what spinach salads used to be like before we all cared so much about fat and calories. For our entrees, the hubby had the Dover sole (one of their (again table-side prepared) signature dishes), and I had the rack of lamb, as it's one of my all-time favorite dishes but often not done very well and always too fattening for everyday consumption. Simply put-- both were magnificent!! Even the accompanying sides were yummy. By this point in the evening, we were both about ready to burst, even after saving half our entrees for lunch on Monday, but we couldn't pass up the banana's foster, as it evokes a personal, happy memory for us. Before we could order it, Kwan and staff brought us a lovely cake for our special day. None of that corny chain "happy birthday" singing, just the cake, a candle and a some privacy. After a few moments, Kwan returned and asked if we'd like them to cut and serve our cake or if we'd prefer to take it home with us. Since we had another dessert choice in mind, we took it home. Last night, we had it for dessert; yum! A few additional notes... I agree with the other reviewer, the Spanish guitarist in the lobby just outside the restaurant was wonderful. They really go the extra mile in customer service... we had match books on our table that had been printed with our name on them (and ones that said Happy Birthday and Happy Anniversary). And it goes without mentioning at a place like this, but your water (and everything else you need) never goes without refilling without you even being aware of it). Keep in mind this is not a place to go if you're watching your diet. I told my husband that we did the dairy industry proud; we consumed enough butter, cream, etc. to keep many cows busy for years to come! But you can really taste the difference when real ingredients are used. The meal wasn't cheap-- over $250 after tax and tip (for the food plus a moderately priced bottle of California sparkling wine)-- but we both decided that it was money, calories and time well spent! So, in closing, you want an elegant, romantic dinner and don't care about seeing and being seen at only the hippest places in town, give Palm Court a try. It's been around forever and hopefully always will be.
Ice Tango=So my craving and curiosity finally over rode my laziness to truck to the north but let's say it was SO worth it!!This place is not only like Pinkberry but in my humble opinion surpasses it! The Twangy fro-yo has the familiar tang but with a more creamy mouth feel and tangier intensity. They also offer WAY more toppings including cereal, fruit and jimmie's... while they have my beloved Fruity Pebbles and Mochi they also have loads of other items. Included cotton candy (looks like the candy Nerds but tastes like cotton candy).. very unique. Other fro-yo flavors include Pomegranate, Mango, Blueberry and of course the PB like Twangy.We also tried the frozen custard.. oh yeah, good stuff as well though, I was loving my Twangy to much to even think about ordering it. We met the owner very handsome Dave Cha, super nice guy,  and knowledgeable about all things fro-yo. It was a treat to meet someone with such enthusiasm and genuine sincerity.. especially in that neck of the woods (North Scottsdale). If you have a craving for the good stuff.. do yourself a favor and head to Ice Tango.. I really don't think you'll be disappointed. Hurry before the word gets out and there are lines out the door!!After reading all of the reviews that came before mine, I had pretty high expectations for Ice Tango... I love tart flavors and I love frozen yogurt - I was pretty damn excited to finally make my way to NoSco to check this place out.I went with my friend DeDe at around 11am on a Sunday... We worked up an appetite at yoga, and when I told her that I'd read amazing reviews about this place, and that it was supposedly similar to Pinkberry, she just had to try it too.We walked in and were impressed to see such a clean, colorful little store.  I had no idea that they would offer cereal and crepes in addition to their special yogurt with a ton of toppings to choose from.  David was working that day and DeDe drilled him on the nutrition information.  It's all fat free and only 22 calories per ounce.  A small yogurt has approximately 130 calories before the toppings.  We tried the plain and pomegranate flavors and we both went with plain and added fresh fruit as a topper - YUM!Ice Tango is my new favorite place in the valley.  If it were closer to me, I'd be there every day!  I almost drove 30 minutes out of my way to return to Ice Tango the next day... I thought that was a bit crazy, so I am drooling sitting here thinking about my next visit.  If you like tart tasting yogurt, go pay David a visit at Ice Tango - you will not be disappointed!I drove 50 miles to check this place out and had a hard time finding it!It's definitely not your typical frozen yogurt bar.I tried a few of the flavors as well as the vanilla custard.The best (and only reason I would come here) is the Twangy Tart!It's sour just like plain yogurt but with a hint of sweetness to cut the bite and a refreshing icy texture. It's insanely Delicious on it's own or paired with some fresh fruit.They have a beautiful assortment of Fresh Fruit toppings but I felt their other toppings were lacking.I decided on the Twangy Tart with strawberries (see picture)I'm giving 5 stars  based on the unique plain yogurt flavor "Twangy Tart" and their Beautiful "Fresh Fruit" selection, I wish they were closer to me.ETA: My SloganOnce you try the Twang you'll be like Daaaaaang! And Nothing else will ever be the same!Ummm. . .I. . .don't. . .get. . .it. . .? Can someone please explain to me how this place is any different from TCBY from the early 90's?  Besides the ridiculous trying-to-be-trendy-but-just-looking-cheap decor?  I went in Saturday afternoon and it was packed.  I got samples of their flavors, which are pretty limited to start with.  The custards were good.  The yogurts were ok.  I don't get the hype over the twangy tart, it tasted like plain yogurt to me, which in and of itself tastes like spoiled milk.  No thanks.  I wound up getting a Pinalada smoothie and quite frankly I make way better smoothies in my blender at home.  The pineapple tasted canned and there was hardly coconut or mango in it at all as listed on the menu. Admittedly I didn't have a crepe, which I am a sucker for especially with Nutella, so I might be back in here for one. So. . .what is it that sets this place apart?  They offer a few flavors of frozen yogurt. . .and. . .toppings. . .and. . .?  Is it just that I'm spoiled by all the incredible local ice cream parlors in Boston like JP Licks and Emack and Bolio's to even care about this place?  I just don't understand the draw, why anyone would drive so far for frozen yogurt.  Are there really no other options out here?  Sad.
Dan Marino's Fine Food & Spirits=The cheap eat adventure continues onto 25cent Hooter Wings!!! The special is from midnight to 6am, which is perfect after a night of clubbing and gambling.4 people. 60 wings. Muahahaha. We're such fatties, but whatever. $15 baby! Got the original, barbeque and spicy. Dang, those spicy wings were hecka good! =D
Over Easy=With the addition of Over Easy last week, 40th Street in Arcadia is becoming more and more of a hip restaurant row. Retro chairs [see photo] and space-age stools dot the interior of the cozy joint owned by Sol y Sombra chef Aaron May.The place, which is next door to The Vig, recalls a Matt's Big Breakfast feel (and was so alluded in Java magazine) for this side of town and manages to do so in an old 1970s mission style Taco Bell. I wouldn't have been able to tell if I didn't know. Regardless, the food here is delicious and compared to other places I did not feel like I ingested a tub of butter. I ordered the hearty Wolf Pack with a pancake on the side and I was in heaven. Two (count them, TWO!)  layers of hash browns [see photo] with two scrambled eggs, cheddar cheese and strips of bacon in the middle. The eggs were just the right consistency and hash browns were browned just right and tasted terrific with garlic salt and pepper. A fluffy griddled pancake with syrup on the side, fresh squeezed orange juice and a complimentary New York Times at the counter also greeted my morning grumpiness and I was quickly satiated.  Altogether the meal came out to $12 + tax.  A bit pricey, but worth it knowing you get what you pay for.I briefly talked with the chef's managing partner who went into detail about the tater tots with tomato jam (that I missed on the menu) and the bacon reduction sauce that comes with the brioche.My only complaints would be minor.Small quarters: With about half of the seats outside on the patio, it's probably a few seats more than MBB.  There was brisk business yesterday on a weekday morning, but on the weekend I can see how the crowds would grow.A la carte-like menu: This is a trend I'm not particularly fond of, especially for breakfast. Several of the entrees don't come with either eggs or potatoes. The Loretta breakfast sandwich are examples of entrees that don't come with eggs. The Over Easy brioche and omelettes don't come with potatoes. The wait staff just shrugged it off as, "Oh you can just order [blank] on the side."  I disagree, especially when you're paying nearly $10 for an entre or omelette.Semi-scattered staff:  Everyone was friendly and engaged in small talk with people at the counter.  But after asking twice for my check, I figured it was a small blip in the overall experience.Delicious breakfast food with a cool hip feel? This neighborhood will be all over it.  I'm looking forward to the next visit.EDIT: 1/19/08 -- OK, I'm upping this to 4.5 stars.  Service was excellent today.  And the country fries (and tater tots with tomato jam)  were outstanding.  They were deep fried with seasoned salt, parsley...yum!Oh Over Easy, you taco bell looking motherfucker. I had such high hopes for this place, I mean the only thing better than breakfast in my book is MAGIC and well there wasn't a whole lot of that coming from my meal. I ordered steak and eggs (a classic) which was like 7 or 8 bucks (in the back of my mind I knew there was a hitch), but instincts aside I was still hyped, sadly like most things in my life disappointment:)  The "Steak" basically was badly seasoned deli roast beef stacked over my horribly cooked eggs, my plate was over flowing with watery steak juice it really should have been served in a bowl it was gross I mean gross, the coffee drink was good (kinda girly) and the decor was aiight. So if you find yourself waking up sunday morning smelling like crown royal and cigarettes with someone you barely know and never want to know again take them here.Oh yeah"Matt's makes this place look like a cracked out denny's or taco bell (ha because it used to be one I know I'm lame) zing."The perfect place for hangover food!I cannot believe it took me so long to make my way to Over Easy... but it was worth the wait for sure!  Today I went to brunch at Over Easy with a party of 4 (that's the way to go by the way, so that you can taste  a bit of everything!)Needless to say, we'd all had a few too many drinks last night, and we needed a good greasy spoon, fill your tummy, type of meal.  We arrived around 10:15 on a Saturday and had about a 20 minute wait, but it went by fast and was so worth it!  Brian hooked us up with a table inside and our server brought us ice waters and coffee immediately.  There were so many menu items that sounded amazing, so we decided to start with the waffle for the table as an appetizer.  Yum!  (It's got a vanilla malt flavor that is out of this world good!)  We also ordered a side of crispy bacon for the table - such a treat!I went with the egg white asparagus omelet and added mushrooms to it plus a side of hash browns.  The asparagus was seriously some of the best I've had and I cleaned my plate!  Jared went with steak and eggs over sleazy - it looked so good I had to taste it and that too was fantastic!  The other couple we were with enjoyed their entrees too.  Although I didn't try them, the 'tots' looked good and I would suggest hash browns or tots before the breakfast potatoes.As you can imagine, this was a ton of food for the four of us, but since we were all hungover and hungry, we did pretty well with it... With tip, I think the total for all of us was just under $60 - it may seem expensive, but it was worth every penny!I usually like some fruit, tomato, yogurt, or cottage cheese options.  That's the only reason for 4 stars instead of 5.  I think they keep it simple because of their limited space in this location.  With that said, Chef Aaron May and his team are on a roll with great restaurant concepts and I'm definitely a loyal fan.  I'll be back to Over Easy again soon as well as continue to frequent Sol Y Sombra and the up and coming new restaurants when they open as well!9/8First thing I noticed, as I walked through the vestibule and headed to a counter seat is that it is LOUD indoors, and it wasn't even half-full in there!  I hesitated to move outdoors as it was already past 10a and very hot, but I just couldn't relax at the counter.  Thank goodness I'd already checked out the menu online and pretty much decided what I wanted to try- the chicken-fried steak on a waffle. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8R_oemw4rNjJL6sd40O_oQ?select=MhktxOxPp_sKrzK6tJoR_Q#MhktxOxPp_sKrzK6tJoR_Q  I'd misread that the actual dishes were a $9 plate of fried chicken on a waffle and an $8 plate of chicken-fried steak, country gravy, egg, and choice of potato, but no worries as my server allowed the substitution and charged me $9 for a fried steak on a waffle.  I decided to brave the hellish heat over the hurtful deafening noise indoors and moved outside.  I must've looked pityful wilting out there that a kind young man asked if I'd like him to turn the misters on.  Patio-area is actually quite homely and invting, and I was pleasantly surprised that there were misters installed- for some reason I didn't think many people would welcome cooling condensation on their eggs.... My OE experience was starting to improve...While I enjoyed the flavors and textures of the steak and delicious waffle, I didn't think that the small amount warranted a high price tag. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8R_oemw4rNjJL6sd40O_oQ?select=L4kyavImBPIfIAdVmi1D_g#L4kyavImBPIfIAdVmi1D_g  I had to ask the server if the waffle was indeed that small.  I could see paying that price for two waffles and a steak...  After eating all the crumbs of my dish, I went ahead and ordered a chocolate waffle w/out the powdered sugar from the kids' menu.  I expected to see a chocolate-colored waffle, as I assumed that the homemade sauce was mixed into the batter, but no, it was the same malted waffle w/ homemade sauce drizzled with a heavy hand.  If you're like me who prefers the crunch, you might want to ask for the sauce on the side.  (A nice addition to the menu would be a chocolate waffle topped w/ vanilla bean ice cream and homemade sauce on top!)  Can't for the life of me think why I didn't take a photo of the chocolate waffle, so forgive me for its exclusion in the photo set.  Oh yes, the sauce is OK.What a great place to catch up with good friends.  Loved the atmosphere, and the food was good too.  Better if you have friends who will show up earlier than you do to get a table.  Best if you have friends who will pick up the whole tab.I recommend the Chilaquiles and the 3 Eggs Steak/Chilli.  My wife doesn't recommend the Corned Beef Hash Plate.  Yeowch!Merry Christmas everyone!Guy, I love you on 'Diners, Drive-ins and Dives' and all. But you rave about every place you go to. And you go to a lot of places. That makes you not very credible in my book.Since I already had breakfast at the hotel, I wanted something small to nibble on while the other girls ate. But then the PB&J french toast on the menu caught my eye. Mental image of thick toast with swirls of peanut butter and syrup-like jam with powdered sugar. I couldn't resist ordering!The server later informed me that they only have half an order of the french toast and asked whether I wanted a half order of something else. Since I wasn't hungry, I told her that the half order is fine. But at the same time I was wondering how on earth do they only have half an order. Did they run out of bread??One by one my friends' orders arrived. Big plates of hearty looking food. Then mine arrived, on a dinky plate. Sitting there in loneliness and despair. PB&J French Toast (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8R_oemw4rNjJL6sd40O_oQ?select=FTpZP-NSq5VuEXC_S73C6w): Are you friggin kidding me?! This is like a Smuckers Uncrustable! Not french toast! (http://uncrustableforschools.com/showimage.asp?fileid=2178) Angry! Was not tasty and didn't finish it. I made sure that I did not have to pay full price for this. Luckily, they took the whole item off the bill.Smoked Salmon & Mushroom Omelet (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8R_oemw4rNjJL6sd40O_oQ?select=7IF34zeAOIegxtukbZle-A): Huge! The tatertots were good. But unfortunately, the omelet itself was dry. The smoked salmon was overly salty.The Over Easy (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8R_oemw4rNjJL6sd40O_oQ?select=mngAq_ySH-uFP-GVVQdS_g): Their version of eggs florentine. Didn't try it, but looked good.Brioche French Toast (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8R_oemw4rNjJL6sd40O_oQ?select=gXPle1ZaQQgd8xSRZaFsew): If my french toast looked anything like that I would've been less pissed.Cool place. Nice staff. Mediocre food.
88 China Bistro=And the skies opened and I could hear "Hallllllllllllllllelujah!" Tasty Chinese food in Charlotte! I was practically convinced that after almost 4 years in Charlotte I was never going to find solid, convenient and fresh Chinese food. Therefore, stating that I was impressed with 88 China Bistro is putting it mildly. The take out menu is traditional (Americanized Chinese) with far fewer fried dishes (thank God). Many, if not all, of the items are freshly made in house and it shows. Hubs picked up a myriad of take out and brought it home so we could feast. Here's what I tried...Sesame Cold Noodle Appetizer: 4/5: For $4.50, this dish is a steal. Plenty of perfectly cooked noodles with a generous helping of peanut-y, sesame dunked sauce on top. The sauce is thicker, so be sure to spread the love around before you dive in. Simple yet de-freakin'-licious. Beef & Broccoli: 4/5: I'll completely agree with Lindsay H - their beer & broccoli is pretty fab. It's freshly made and the sauce isn't that coagulated, syrupy crap. The broccoli is tender and still has a bit of a crunch. Fried rice: 3/5: I appreciate that it's fresh, it just could have used a bit more flavor and a bit less soy. I'm looking forward to my lunch today, as it will be chock full of leftovers from last night's 88 China Bistro meal. One of these days I want to head over there and ask for this elusive Cantonese menu.My review is strictly based on delivery and take-out. I like to eat my Chinese food at home so no one can judge me on the amount of food I order. Hi, I like #allthefood. This isn't the closest Chinese restaurant to my house, but it's the one I choose to consistently order from in the Elizabeth area. To me, it seems like the food isn't as greasy and oily as the others and it tastes like better quality. I have to order egg drop soup every time I get Chinese. I really like the version they do here. I typically also get Singapore noodles, an egg roll, and a spring roll. I'll mix it up from time to time with some sort of spicy chicken or shrimp dish and steamed dumplings. Everything I've had from here has been good, I can't think of a single thing I haven't liked. Delivery is typically quick. Getting take out is a breeze. During my latest trip here this week, the guy in front of me asked how long it would take, 15 minutes? He needed to go outside and make a call. I told him don't stay outside too long, it'll take no time. Sure enough, his order came out with mine quickly and all I had ordered was soup. They do have a website, basically the only thing on it is the menu. You can find a clickable link here on 88's Yelp page.
Fin=***Fin (an upscale Chinese restaurant) at The Mirage is like a lot of other Las Vegas fine dining restaurants--overpriced, mediocre food***Most Las Vegas (The Strip) restaurants are overpriced.  So if you are planning to eat at a nice restaurant in Vegas, you are probably not going to get your money's worth.  Still, the quality varies quite a bit.  Mesa Grill and Carnevino are both overpriced, but at least their food is good (at least on my visits).  There are other Vegas restaurants where you spend a lot and the food is bad (or mostly bad).  Fin is one of those restaurants.Fin sits in The Mirage and has a contemporary decor that is nice though it does not really stand out.  The restaurant is very close to the casino, but it is still pretty quiet.Fin is a Chinese restaurant, but it is probably a more Americanized interpretation (based on what we had here).  They were doing a $40 3-course special.  There was a good variety of starters to choose from while there was not much selection among the entrees or the desserts.  We all opted for the 3-course.  We added some a la carte dishes to share as well.I started with the barbecued spare ribs.  They were sweet but not overly sweet.  The ribs could have used something else to give them a little more kick.  The meat did not have a fall-off-the-bone texture.  The meat was not exactly tough, but it could have been more tender.I did not try the shrimp and scallop wraps, but they looked bland.  I tried the crispy shrimp toast that was served on a sweet and sour sauce.  That starter was decent.For my entree, I opted for the Chilean Sea Bass that was served over a sweet garlic sauce.  The sea bass came with a side of steamed white rice.  The sea bass was fried (the menu said wok fried, but it seemed to be more deep fried).  The sea bass was quite greasy.  It was also incredibly fishy, which was a little odd because sea bass typically does not have one of the stronger fish tastes.  It could have been because it was not that fresh or simply that the fish flavor became more pronounced in how they fried it.I really did not like the fish.  The greasiness and the taste made me feel a little queasy and I can eat pretty much anything.From the a la carte menu, we had the General Tsao's Chicken, which was served with broccoli.  This dish was pretty good.  The chicken was juicy and tasty while the sauce was both sweet and with some good heat.We also had Shrimp Lo Mein noodles, which were okay.  The noodles were fine and seasoned properly.  The shrimp was plump; however, they were not cooked long enough.For dessert, I opted for the assorted sorbet, which had 3 flavors.  There was lychee and blood orange.  I cannot remember the other flavor.  Only the blood orange had a good flavor.  The other two flavors were bland.The sorbet here was all ice.  It was like eating a really frozen slushie.The other dessert option was a vanilla creme brulee and it was much better.  The vanilla custard was smooth, creamy and had a good vanilla flavor.  There was a nice caramelized shell.  The creme brulee was garnished with fresh berries.They finished us off with a complimentary Baileys shot, which was good, and a fortune cookie.  The fortune cookie was pretty good.  It was a little thicker and more buttery than most fortune cookies I've had.  The messages seemed homemade especially since the paper appeared to be cut with scissors.Service was not that good.  I have heard that strong customer service is not a high priority at Chinese restaurants (more emphasis is placed on flavors and value).  Maybe this place was trying to emulate that even though it seemed to be an Americanized Chinese restaurant.  The waiter seemed confused and he left the table when we were ordering to check up on another table.  Other servers seemed a little bit abrupt.Still, once we put the order in, the food did come out at a good and organized pace.Of the "nice" Las Vegas restaurants I have tried, Fin may be the worst one.  The General Tsao's Chicken and creme brulee were both good.  For the other dishes we had though, I think you would be able to get just as good food (if not better food) at one of the P.F. Chang's nearby (and at a much lower price).  There are many Vegas restaurants to avoid and Fin would definitely be among them.The Mirage has complimentary parking (both valet and a parking structure).
The Lodge at Shelbourne=Another lodge in Vegas usually means the same menu and the same experience.  At least you know what you're getting in, in this case we got a little more though.We stopped by to catch part of the World Series, which meant it was dinner time!   Dinner entrees are available from 4 pm to 11 pm daily and served with dinner salad.  (I always appreciate that their dinner salads are generous, not like those itty bitty side salads you get from fast food restaurants.)  I chose the Cajun Penne Pasta "Cajun seasoned chicken, andouille sausage, bell peppers tossed in a creamy white sauce with penne pasta.  Topped with fresh grated parmesan and sliced green onions.  Served with garlic bread." ($11.95) - When that giant platter arrived, I was shocked!  It was beyond a generous portion!  And it was a tasty pasta dish with chunks of sausage and chicken mixed in.  Definitely something that you need to share.  It's a lot of food!The Husband got the Beer Batter Fish-N-Chips "Alaskan Cod Filet, beer battered and fried to a golden crispy.  Served with fries and cole slaw."  ($11.95) - As we started into the fish, he noticed that it was previously frozen.  But what we didn't realize was that the two pieces of cod were stuck together.  When we separated them, we realized they were still frozen!  Yikes!  I waved the waitress down and showed her the fish.  She apologized and took it away immediately.  A new order came out later on, with a new piece of fish and the previous one refried.  When the bill arrived, the fish and chips were automatically taken off without us saying anything.  Although there is a separate dining area from the bar, there's not much that keeps the smoke from entering the eating area.  Something to consider if this bothers you.They also offer 39 cent wings on Tuesdays and Wednesdays form noon to midnight!This was a rare occasion where I have had to walk out of an establishment I was seated to have dinner at without eating. This was on St. Patrick's day night in which as tradition I took my Mom out for corned beef and cabbage. We decided to visit this location as they were serving a corned beef and cabbage dinner.Long story shorty our corned beef and cabbage dinners come out and the beef is tough and overcooked as can be. We both took a bite of our meal and it was impossible to attempt to eat it was so bad.So we inform the server and showed her that not even the knife would cut through it.She says oh no but we have been serving it all night! I am thinking in my head, really lady well I am looking at two shoe insoles on my plate right now. The server then states well why don't I have the Chef come out and explain the meal to you?WTF, what is to explain, what is in front of me is inedible. I don't care what kind of story he tells me about it I am not eating it! Final Answer and I find it hard to believe that others had not complained about it or sent it back. So she finally takes the plates away and we left as agreed without paying. We drove over here from across town special for this meal and I resent being put in that position to have to leave over something like this. Not Cool!Never again, crossing The Lodge off of my list which is too bad because the location we ate at seven years ago on Ft. Apache had an Amazing corned beef and cabbage dinner. We called them this year and were informed they were not participating so that is how we ended up at this location.
Pasta Shop Ristorante=First of all, if you decide to go here because of the other good reviews (which is why I came here) DO NOT buy a $10 for $20 deal because they automatically charge you 18% gratuity without informing you. The bill that we received tonight only had our entrees written down, the bottle of wine that we ordered was not written on the bill.... My boyfriend noticed a $16 charge and I'm so thankful he pointed it out because I overlooked it thinking it was just the tax.... The 18% was written very small, and looked like 8%... I would have ended up tipping these people TWICE....  I asked the waitress what the 18% was and she played dumb and said "oh I think that's gratuity" ... so when she returned a few minutes later after she ran my credit card I asked again if that was normal since we were only a party of 2.... She finally told me that 18% gratuity is included if you use any deals/coupons which I doubt she should have told me BEFORE she ran my credit card when I asked her..... !!!!!!!!IT DOES NOT SAY THAT ON THE DISCLAIMER FOR THE $10 FOR $20 DEAL!!!!!!!! It states 'gratuity not included, please tip on full amount' ---- shady shady shady shady!!!! You would have received a 20% tip if you didn't automatically and fraudulently charge me a tip already....I HATE SHADY-NESS..... SHAME ON YOU PASTA SHOP!! I WILL DEFINITELY NOT BE BACK! At first I really liked this place because I thought it was a mom and pop shop, I thought it was fun and different, but I can't believe the lack of disclaimer and the "playing dumb" that I just experienced. And you can only use either the $10 for $20 deal that you purchased or get the 1 lb. homemade pasta (which WAS part of the disclaimer but I still think that's stupid...)
Dino's Greek and Italian Grill=Unfortunately because of an issue with the service and the owner i will not return to this place.What happened? Well, we decided to go to dinner here and sit out on the patio because it was a beautiful night.  When we sat I noticed they had the kitchen door propped open, which is a huge pet peeve for me, not only is it against regulation, it is gross. Anything can make it's way into the kitchen and into the food that is being prepared. I wanted to mention this to my server to see if it could be corrected. In the meantime 2 employees decided to grab a smoke right outside the kitchen door, one of which was the owner's wife. This really agitated me and thought it was disgusting.When the server returned I voiced my opinion and she apologized and said she would tell the owner. About 10 minutes later one of the employees that I saw smoking came out on the patio to steal a few drags off a friend's cigarette while the whole time just staring at me...as she walked past our table she blew the smoke right over to our table and smiled. At this point I was furious and just wanted to pay and leave. When the server returned I explained what happened and that I wondered if she had mentioned the situation yet to the owner. She said she would let him know. A few moments later the owner came to our table and said.." do we have a problem"? and it was not said in a nice way at all....I even doubted what I heard him say and asked what he said. Again he looked at my husband and said..."do you have a problem" and then turned to me and said the same thing. He was soooo rude I was speechless. I just said....nope ...we do not have a problem, we just will not come back. He just turned around and walked away.I am not sure why he responded this way, but I will not come back to a place where the manager has such disregard to one of their customers "problems".  Too bad Dino's...I liked most of your food, but you let me down.Saw a guy holding a sign on the corner of Dysart and McDowell advertising a Gyro deal and realized I had never seen the place before. Went in the next day and was seated quickly with a menu. Looked it over casually, knowing I already wanted to get a gyro since it seems difficult to find a good one in this part of town. Noticed they had calamari as an appetizer and ordered that with a gyro. The calamari was very good. A lot of places fry it to death and you end up with a chewy wad of batter. Theirs was excellent. The gyro was the 2nd best I've had in the valley, which is saying something considering how many I've tried and immediately forgotten. I will definitely be going back here again and it will likely be my go-to spot for gyros.
Chicken Latino=Diamonds are not this girls best friend chicken is.   Another slam dunk,  home run out of the park meal.  It should also be noted that the restaurant was way more crowded then I had ever seen before. Good job Chicken Latino.  I am cheering for your success.  On this occasion my hubby of course got the shrimp and Tilapia  ceviche . Which is only served during the weekend as a lunch special.  The shrimp were plump and there was a massive amount of lime juice coating the fish and shrimp very nicely.  I had the half rotisserie chicken , no sides.  I didn't need any starches or legumes standing between me and that bird.  To the embarrassment of my boyfriend I ate the chicken with my bare hands tearing into it like a lion into a gazelle.  I was playing no games devouring my chicken.  Treat -yo-self to Chicken Latino you'll be happy you did.
Margaritaville=I'm not down with restaurants that are decorated as if someone took a ride on Disneyland's Jungle Boat Cruise and thought they were hit with interior design brilliance, i.e. Rain Forest Cafe, Islands....ya feel me?  To me, these restaurants have more of an appeal to kids and I'm supposed to be getting tanked there so I can tolerate the screaming rugrats? Ha.Well, this place wasn't overrun with kids watching their parents throw back shots of tequila and that was a plus.  So after the nice hostesses told us that we could seat ourselves at the bar, my friend and I planted ourselves at the one downstairs.  Our bartender was a friendly gal.  I asked for a drink menu which didn't have the most exciting concoctions, but I chose to order the Uptown Top Shelf margarita from her.My drink was pretty good, but what surprised me about this one was that I had expected the drink to come out of a gun.  Hot damn, she free-poured it right in front of my face!  Now, with a restaurant named Margaritaville, one, or at least I, would expect that there would be an impressive selection of tequila.  Not here.  I spied about 5 different brands and that was it.  That was really disappointing so much so that instead of doing shots of Patron, my friend & I opted to try something off of the shot menu called an Overseas High made with blue curacao.  Not bad for something fruity.My experience there was ok for a little pre-gaming to see the Coyotes.  Two of these stars go to the bartender's service and attitude.  The other star is for the drink prices.  Someone from L.A. can double their BAC level here.If you like Pina Coladas, and getting caught in the rain ... if you're not into yoga, and you have half a brain ....  DO NOT COME TO THIS PLACEIf you are a middle aged individual who wants to hit the dance floor and show off your tired dance moves to Beyonce and Chris Brown on a Saturday night while paying $11.50 for a vodka redbull, then this is the place for you!I love Jimmy Buffet and I love the Margaritaville in Vegas, but this place somehow derailed miserably.Blech. Had to work at U of Phoenix Stadium today and Mom came down from Payson to meet me for lunch after.  I don't know Westgate at ALL except for the hockey arena.  It's in an outdoor mall, like everything else.  We were starving and the entire mall was DEAD.  It looked like places were closed, so we went to Margaritaville for lunch.Main entrance isn't clearly marked and we went in through the patio area.  Walked in and didn't see a reception area.  So, we asked the nearest waitress if we were to seat ourselves.  She said in her best airline stewardess voice "Ovah they-ah is where you check-in."  It was fake and annoying.  So, we go check in.  15 minute-wait for 2 people.  The place was crowded, but we had passed a few empty tables along the way.  My mom even pointed it out.  "Our kitchen is pretty backed-up, so we can't seat all tables right now."  Keep in mind this was at 12:30 on a Saturday afternoon.  Wouldn't this be the time to make sure you know to have enough kitchen staff on hand???We meandered to the bar, which was empty except for 2 people.  We sat at the corner and, luckily, found out we could eat there.  The bartender was the first friendly person we came across, and I'm glad SHE got a tip from us.  Service was quick.  Our food came out within 10 minutes.  Mom got the chicken quesadilla, I got the taco salad.  I couldn't believe how FEW items were on the menu.  I was expecting a bit more.  Food was average.  Nothing I'd ever go back for.They kept showing videos of Jimmy Buffet and the people at his concert.  They were having WAY more fun than we were.  NOBODY shouted out "Where's the salt?  Where's the goddamn salt?"  I would have, but my Mom's been suffering from almost 40 years of embarrassment from me already.Blech.Came to this hot mess last weekend, and was NOT impressed.  Waited way too long before we received any service. Drinks took forever, ordered a Mai tai and received a glass full of sweet & sour. Not a great crowd, and very rude, disrespectful bouncers. Luckily there is a Saddle Ranch right across the way that ended up saving the night.
Capriotti's Sandwich Shop=I'm not a regular at Capriotti's, but I was less than impressed with this particular location. It seemed a little on the grimy / dirty side and the guys working there seemed confused by the who pick up process for an order I placed online. The sandwich was overly salted when I got it home and I can't say I'd come back to this location.This is a simple sandwich shop chain I'd wish to see all over Northern California!  The Bobbie, their most popular sandwich, is not your average turkey sandwich.  With slow roasted turkey, fresh cranberry sauce, a layer of homemade stuffing, and mayo....it's like experiencing Thanksgiving anytime of the year!  One of my favorite cold sandwiches on earth.   The Capastrami, their 2nd most popular sandwich, is packed with flavor!  I'm a huge fan of hot pastrami and this pastrami was damn good!  But I wish they had less coleslaw in the sandwich to accomodate more meat.  Their enormous subs and quick and friendly service will expedite my return!  Gotta try the others I've heard so much about...the Capacolla and the Cheese Steak.
Pho Da Lat=I am not going to say much about this place because the only thing I really liked about it were the light fixtures.I tried the Crystal Chicken. Bland.I tried the Crispy Sring rolls. Overcooked.The only thing that was yummy was the #51.. and I have no idea what it was called but my friend got it and I tried it and it was pretty alright.They have a koi pond inside right when you walk in, but I was disturbed at the size of the fish in that little pool.. Definitely not enough room, and I'm thinking this might be a violation, and i'm looking into it. I may eat fish, but I don't believe the living ones should be confined like that.. I certainly don't like elevators, do you?Let me preface by saying I was born in Saigon.  I understand Pho like a redneck understands buckshot.  That's to say, both can be a total miss or to die for.  But, on average they both tend to hit the target.  People who get all worked up over whether the broth was too cloudy, or too sweet, or they got one lime instead of 2 limes need to loosen up a little about this treasured Vietnamese dish.  Pho Da Lat's pho is pretty average in a city where all pho is pretty average.  So I'm saying it's a good showing for pho in Phoenix.  So why 4 stars?  Two reasons: 1) The roast game hen is simply perfect.  It's not a typical dish in any Vietnamese restaurant and transports one to idyllic Provence.  Evidence of the French colonial influence.  It's charred and crispy on the edges and succulent in the meaty areas.  It's served over white rice and accompanied by cucumbers, cilantro and lettuce.  A small dish with salt/pepper & lime is for dipping.  2) These guys have a selection of wine.  Wine with Pho unheard of you say?  Don't pair with red wines, instead pick a dry white wine.  I chose the 2009 Farrier Alexander Valley Andiron (Semillon/Sauv Blanc) $6.  The hints of lime and bright finish go perfectly with spicy Pho broth.  It's also excellent with the roast bird.  The Pho and the Andiron are good by themselves but together they transcend.
