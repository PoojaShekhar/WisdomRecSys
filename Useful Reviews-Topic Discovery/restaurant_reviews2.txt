We magically landed at this sushi place about two weeks ago, so happy we did!! We loved the location ( Corner of Shea Blvd and Scottsdale) and the amazing Blue lighted fish tanks!! Great entertainment while eating!! We came in close to closing time and they still treated us like royalty!! Much appreciated!! We then decided for the Eel Roll as well as their Cali roll, Teriyaki Bento Box and some Chicken Yakisoba noodles!! It was all delicious, especially the eel roll and chicken yakisoba!!! Yum :) We honestly had an amazing time and satisfying conquer from this place. The reason for the four stars is their early closing time!! Oh well :)

so everyone was talking about these carvel cakes and asking about locations. I always drive by this schlotzkys and see the little carvel sign. I had a bad experience with the beyond disgusting carvel cakes from the grocery store and pretty much decided that it was just a nasty, poor quality product. well, i got over myself and decided to try it, and oh man it was good!!! it was thicker than frozen yogurt but not as solid as ice cream and the flavors were rich. I had the small swirl in the waffle cone and it was huge! the waffle cone was not as good as cold stone but it was sweet and crunchy and still totally delicious. i am totally a fan. i will just have to stay away from the gross grocery store cakes. try it!and as far as schlotzkys? i like the original w no mustard and their pizzas.

Well my last visit here to get the Iowa Pork tenderloin Sandwich was a total disaster so I planned ahead and brought the phone number with me so when I was in the area I could call in a takeout order.I ordered the Pork Tenderloin Sandwich with onion,pickles and mustard $8.99+taxThey said 10 minutes I was there in 5 it was hot & ready.Just like I remember- years ago in Iowa when I last had one.Crispy and juicy, larger than life. I hardly had 2 bites and my son was so enticed he had to "have a go" at it and he couldnt stop himself he wanted his own so we sat in the parking lot eating one while waiting on another for the road.Cool fun atmosphere but the service is suspect, even with my takeout it was 6pm on a Saturday night -NFL playoffs -the bar was dead and only 1 small group in the diner.Open 24 hours a day.Great hard to find sandwich, a little pricy but HHAGG wants $14 for a pork tenderloin sandwich. Next on the list.

Charleston's... Where to begin. We happened upon this place mostly by accident. It shares a parking lot with Texas Roadhouse which is a great steakhouse but because of that fact, at any given time it's extremely crowded. We had planned on hitting Texas Roadhouse for dinner before catching a movie at the nearby Mesa Grand AMC Theater. However, as is always the case it was packed, and we were told it was a 45 minute wait. Seeing Charleston's across the way, we said why not? Upon entering the place we were surprised to see how well done the interior was. Classy, with dark wood and stone accents and lit just well enough to maintain an intimate atmosphere. Each table is lit by candles and soft overhead lighting. Up until recently it had some real smooth Jazz playing in the background (which has regrettably been replaced with easy listening/pop fare in an effort to attract a younger crowd).All of the wait staff male or female is dressed in black slacks and black shirts which may sound pretentious but only adds to the ambiance in practice. They are, in general, extraordinarily attentive and quick to serve. On most weekends, the management helps bring out food, refill drinks and make sure everything is satisfactory. Nice touch. Now on to the food... oh the food! I have yet to eat a meal that was less than excellent no matter what I order but my favorite is the Baby Back Ribs and Herb Chicken combo. It's a huge plate of food, and it comes complete with garlic mashed potatoes and I opt out on the bbq beans in exchange for the glazed carrots. You MUST eat the glazed carrots if nothing else... I do not like carrots at all mind you, but these I could eat all day until my skin turned orange.Aside from the carrots, the herb chicken is actually a half a chicken seasoned perfectly and very succulent. I've scoured the internets trying to find the recipe for this bird and it's nowhere to be found. I'm considering a part time stint at this place just long enough to poach the recipe or at least watch the chef do it. Delicious. Sub out the potatoes for the fries (they're crispy, and salt & peppered) and you won't be disappointed either. It's never as crowded as the neighboring Roadhouse, but to me that's a good reason to check it out. It's great.Tip: Check out their menu on the web before you go. It'll give you an idea of the kind of food they have in store for you.We had been wanting to come to this location and try it for quite awhile.Too bad we came the night we did, because, we were not impressed at all. Food was not hot when it came out, our Server did not know any thing about the Tea that they carried. ,She had to be asked to refill our drinks more than once.It just was not a pleasant experience. We so like the one in Chandler so much better.I do not think that we will return to this location. Maybe it was not a good day for them. But, now that I have tried it ,I cannot ever see a reason to return.Had a late lunch in Mesa, AZ at Charleston's. It was about 3:15 pm when we walked in. There was only two other occupied  tables in the dinning room. The decor is much like Hillstone / Houstons / Bandera. The menu and food is much like them too. Our table ordered the Baby Back Ribs and the Prime Rib. The food was excellent. The 10 oz Prime Rib ordered medium rare was so good and for only $23. The two orders of Baby Back Ribs were gone in no time. Plenty of parking in the shopping center. Service was excellent.

Review Text :
Absolutely the most authentic, delicious Japanese food in the valley. Having lived in Japan and grown to love their cuisine, this is the only restaurant I have tried in the valley to duplicate the flavors and presentation I experienced while over there. The place itself isn't much to look at, as it used to be a Dunkin Donuts back in the day, but don't let that turn you off as you would be missing out. Unlike many "Japanese" food establishments it is actually owned and operated by a Japanese couple who make and prepare all of the food themselves right when you order it. From the mouthwatering Sukiyaki and Tanin, to my girl's favorite, the Oyako Domburi, you can't go wrong with Nagasaki Grill. I can't recommend this place enough.If you want the real thing, there is no other place even close.The BEST Japanese food in Arizona... I've been coming here when it was Happy Bowl Samurai back in the 80's! These guys have been around for over 20 years...Same owners, Yoshi and Yuko... plus, they do catering for the Japanese baseball teams that come each year for sping training!!! and it's hard to find authentic, Kyushu-style food out here! My favorite is the Nagasaki chanpon and fuotmaki the owner's wife makes on the weekends! Plus, they make awesome donburi dishes that cannot be beat out here.I was born in Japan and know quality Japanese food and this place is it!Let me tell ya...I have been going to this area of the valley over the past 5 years hundreds of times, and everytime I do, for some reason I don't have the time to stop in...or when I do, it looks like they are closed.  But I finally made it in this past week and boy am I glad I did!!!I am really picky when it comes to asian food, some might even call me a food snob:)  I have tried so many different kinds and different restaurants that there is a lot  to compare to.This Japanese restaurant is by far one of my very favorites...Just looking at the little stand alone building this restaurant sits in reminds you of little tokyo in downtown LA.  Walking in you realize IT IS very authentic.  Its owned by a older japanese couple that do all the cooking and servicing themselves!  Its soooo cute!!Looking at the menu, its no none sense.  It is simple and to the point.  There are some items that are catered to the american crowd but the execution on the dishes I ordered is strictly Japanese.Miso Soup was piping hot- love it!The Japanese curry with chicken katsu was probably the best I have tasted here in AZ.I also had the Cold Somen noodles and perfection it was.  The  tsuyu, dipping sauce was flavorful..umami style!This is homestyle japanse cooking at its best!  I will make time for this place everytime I am in the area from now on....I can not believe I almost missed out on this place:)

Review Text :
A three hour walking exploration of Las Vegas' Chinatown culminated with a large and delicious lunch here.  Relying once again on the ratings of Las Vegas Yelpers I decided to check out this spacious restaurant along Spring Mountain Road.It was like stepping into a restaurant back home again as a lady greeted me in Cantonese and asked me how many.  A single index finger answered that question as I was escorted to my table.  Judging by their conversation two gentlemen seated beside me on their lunch break seemed to really like this place.  Honestly I don't eavesdrop but sometimes when you're sitting there reading your cell phone you hear things.The menu being clumsy and tattered was definitely a symbol as to the popularity of the place.  The prices on the other hand were about double what I would pay in San Francisco, but I usually keep an open mind on that being that things are rarely as good as they are at home.Noodles or Chinese barbecue?  Not having steamed rice for nearly a week the Chinese in me went with the latter in selecting the rice plate with two BBQ meats.  Roast Duck was definitely going to be my first choice, but it was the recent review of a San Francisco Yelp friend who wrote about a San Francisco deli with very good Soy Sauce Chicken that influenced me into trying my second choice.  I hadn't had soy sauce chicken all year so that's what I picked to go beside my duck.Not sure about portion size I selected the Crispy Fried Tofu appetizer as well.The tofu (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/L6qd3x0bHymyxub9dF7lIA?select=2qOeThevkuoRKc9Enk6mSQ) arrived first.  The eight squares of crispy, golden fried silken tofu on a bed of shredded lettuce served with a simple soy sauce infused with chopped, fresh jalapeno was simple and fabulous.  The taste was very clean and very fresh without a hint of frying oil.When I saw my rice plate (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/L6qd3x0bHymyxub9dF7lIA?select=8UiNNR3cVaxzUVHi3UoCDw) I knew right away I couldn't finish it.  Not only was the steamed rice piled high, but so were the meats.  I knew I'd end up concentrating on the meat since I wasn't about to carry leftovers back to my hotel room.  The drippings from the roast duck mixed into the rice was so good though it was hard not to eat all the rice.  Both of the meats were cooked well.  The chicken had good flavor but the meat was a bit thin and a bit chewy.  The duck was actually meatier than the chicken, and I definitely enjoyed the flavor more.My sensitivity to MSG didn't come into play.  It's hard to imagine Chinese style BBQ without MSG, but since I couldn't detect any I'd have to say this place did it right.  The health score of "A" was quite reassuring too.  That's something I don't see that often in San Francisco!It's so sad when you discover that long time favorites suck now... Cafe noodle's duck, won ton, egg noodle soup was always an old fav on cold nights, but I haven't done it in a while due to all the great ramen places that keep popping up. Today was the first time in 10 years of coming here that everything about it was pretty crappy. Salty, but otherwise flavorless duck, won ton is missing the chunks of shrimp that have always been there. Add to that some pretty bland broth, and you have a good sized bowl of sadness and disappointment. Quality of our other usuals have also gone down in the past year or so - beef chow fun, Singapore noodles, salt & pepper pork chops and the whole friend chicken. Hate to say it, but I'm almost ready to give up on this placeLunch (11am-5pm) & Late Night Specials (for $4.95, and the portions are generous, definitely the right spot to hit up for decent hot meal on a glacial global economic recovery budget.  That was how I felt about the economy back in 2011. Vegas has definitely recovered a lot from the dismal lows, but not really back to what it was before the crash.  So I continue to seek out decent restaurants that is budget friendly, and Café Noodle & Chinese Barbeque continues to be near the top of my list for curing hunger on a tight budget.Like many other Yelpers have mentioned, the restaurant is not the cleanest.  Even after clearing a recently vacated table and sanitizing it, it still feels not quite clean. Maybe it is that lingering thin film of grease or they simply needed to use a cleaner rag to clean the tables.  Well, at least the utensils and tea cups are clean.Anyway, I ended up here at Cafe Noodle and Chinese Barbeque, a restaurant that I have walked past numerous times to other businesses in this super busy plaza with the ridiculously inadequate parking spaces. However, the American name is completely foreign to me, and to locate it I had to look up the driving direction.  The place was relatively crowded at 11pm on a Tuesday night, and pretty much every patron was Asians.  I immediately sensed a good vibe that this place must be at least decent.After looking over the menu, I opted for the Salt & Pepper Chicken Wings appetizer (tasty but on the greasy side, occasionally not very flavorful due to insufficient amount of "salt & pepper") and the Pan Fried Noodles with Beef and Vegetable (very large portion and pretty flavorful).  The food is not high end, but for the prices they are charging you, it is well worth it.  That was from my very first visit back in 2011, and the incomplete review draft sat and sat and sat some more until now.So two years have gone by and several visits later (both dine-in and take-out), my impression remained roughly the same.  Service for the most part is their weak point.  Not the friendliest or most attentive, but occasionally you will get a waiter that stepped up his game (a refreshing change). Then there are times when you end up standing there for 5 minutes wanting to place an order and be completely ignored by the lady behind the counter and ultimately walk out and head across the street to another near 24/7 Chinese restaurant that is just as good, if not better.The food at great value is what keeps me coming back once I get over their latest service mishaps. What I do recommend here:* 2 BBQ Items Combo on Rice (I usually get their BBQ Duck and Soya Chicken) - it will set up back $8.75* Spicy Eggplant Hot Pot - one of my favorites* Salted Fish & Chicken Fried Rice - I usually get this to go plus something else. Slightly adventurous due to the salted fish.* Any of their Pan Fried Flat Rice Noodle dishes - but sometimes it is a little greasy, so drink plenty of hot tea!* Crispy Fried Chicken (all day special dine-in only offer for $5.95 each) - that is a very sweet and filling deal!From 3PM to 5PM, they have a limited "High Tea" menu, customers get a free HK style milk tea or coffee (hot or cold) along with your order. Not an awesome promo, but if you have to pay for said complimentary beverage it will cost you $2.50.  NOTE: In their recent Chinese newspaper ads, they have all day specials from $4.95 to $7.95, but I have never tested that during normal dinner time.Minimum for credit card use is $15, so order enough or bring cash.Review #1 of 2014. Checked!What I thought would be a nice lunch with a few of my friends, actually turned out to be a nightmare of an experience. The staff is blatantly rude and did not give a warm welcome when my party and I first entered. It continued to go downhill from there because our waitress was curt, and she didn't even seem to care about our table. When she came to take our order, she approached us with a harsh tone. It sounded like she was annoyed, but our party just got there and the restaurant wasn't filled up with people... She then proceeded to cut me and my friends off a few times while we were trying to say what we wanted from the menu. She also kept stopping in the middle of taking our order to have conversations with people in her language, which is okay, but I didn't see it appropriate to have full-on conversations while writing our order down... There was another employee who was refilling our drinks and also brought the food out to our table. He wasn't friendly either, and whenever he'd pick up our glasses to refill with water, he would smack it back down so water droplets came out of the cups. Same thing happened with the food. Even with us saying "thank you" with a smile and a happy tone, there was no response from him. Way to make your customers feel even more unwelcome...We ordered the salt and pepper pork chop, BBQ pork with soft noodles, the crispy noodle dish, beef chow fun, and the garlic and onion pork. The salt and pepper pork chops were small bits of pan-fried pork ribs. They were a bit salty, but nothing too harsh. They actually were quite good.The BBQ Pork with soft noodles is just your average "lo-mein" type of dish. It wasn't anything amazing, but it was good enough for us to chow down on.The crispy noodle dish was alright as well; it's crispy until the sauce makes the noodles soggy. The veggies they put in it were green and tasted fresh. The chow fun and the crispy noodle dish both looked slimy from the sauce, and the meat in it looked like unidentifiable protein. Anyway, it was good for what we came in for (to eat a bunch of Chinese dishes), but definitely not worth the sit-down experience. The presentation of the food wasn't too appealing, either. It looked like they just slapped it on the plate and expedited it to our table.Overall, they have a wide selection of different dishes on their menu, but the horrible service was unforgivable. Honestly, I've never been to a restaurant where the workers were this rude to their patrons. A good business should cater to customers to build customer loyalty, but I guess giving out acceptable customer service is just not one of their priorities. Sigh... I don't mean to sound like I'm ranting (and typically I'm easy to please), but save yourself from giving your money to a place that doesn't care about your business. If you do decide to try their fare, heed my warning -- you'll get subpar quality food paired with awful service.

I followed his advice and it paid off.  The Sandwich is stuffed full of the ingredients and is quite messy to handle.  If it wasn't cut in half, it would've been even messier.The Sandwich tasted pretty good and the Bread was also above average.  Their house brand Chips were also above average and had a unique taste to them...to me they were almost like Sour Cream & Onion more than Jalapeno.Overall, a good lunch experience.Return Factor - 80%

Review Text :
ROLF ~ I hate to give any business a 1 star rating especially when it's a locally owned but after two different visits to Hot Bagels & Deli in Surprise, I view them as a potential health hazard.  Our last visited started off on the wrong foot with the owners having a conversation between themselves and ignoring their customers.  We ordered two bagel sandwiches for lunch ~ asiago cheese bagel with ham & cheese and a side of chips and drink.  They only offered two choices of cheese, Swiss and American which I don't like either... My friend ordered a turkey & swiss (only choice) on a jalapeno bagel.  Half way through our bagel sandwiches I noticed little blue dots on bottom of his bagel and they were not jalapeno's, ROLF!  The bagels were old, chewy and came with a bit if penicillin apparently.This was my second bad visit and don't plan to go back.  I tried to tell the owners about our experience and she turned away and walked off! wowsers!

Review Text :
i really did not enjoy my short time in this awful restaurant. The only reason i came here is because a friend of mine keeps kosher and we couldnt really find anywhere else to eat, so we came here. The service was crap. The waiter acted like a freaking diva, and the food was terrible. We were a party of 5 people, so we pushed 2 tables together. The retard waiter came up to our group and said we cant push tables together, so 5 people were stuffed on a table that was meant for 2 people ( un-freaking-believable).There were no prices on the menu nor on the large overhead lighted up menu next to the register, so we ordered an XL pizza assuming it would be $13-17ish. We then helped ourselves to some snapples which we later found out were $3.50...!!! wtf! who charges $3.50 for a little bottles of snapple?!After we finish eating our nasty pizza ( even microwave pizza is better then their pizza) on our tiny table with a party of 5 we ask for the bill.The waiter comes to our table, throws the bill on the table as if hes doing us a favor and walks away...The bill came out to $45!!!! FOR ONE XL PIZZA?!!!!!! ARE YOU FREAKING KIDDING ME?! IM NOT AT SOME FANCY RESTAURANT!This restaurant is seriously this little ugly 550 square foot room with a tiny kitchen in an ugly area off the strip. Who on earth do you think you are charging us $45 for a pizza. Freaking retards.We left $1 for tip. I even considered that too much.You give us jews a bad name, shame on you idiots.

2.5 stars, but I'll round it up for our first visit.Mom's choice after seeing it featured on Check, Please! Arizona.  We were looking forward to trying the Tres Amigos, for it looked so good on TV.  I thought I heard one of the guests say it was made with flour tortillas, and since I'm allergic to corn, I was happy to hear this.  I didn't even bother to confirm with the server, since I'm tired of asking so many questions.  Well, at least two of the enchiladas were made with corn, so I left that entree for Mom to enjoy.  She favored the chicken tomatillo most.  It was also the only one she found cooked perfectly.  The other two (spinach and shredded beef) had tortillas that were partially-cooked.  We both tried the side of refried beans and liked it.  She thought the rice was terrible and didn't even bother to include it in the leftovers. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/manuels-mexican-food-scottsdale?select=Ra5FvYBankc_ub_K1HrytQ#Ra5FvYBankc_ub_K1HrytQI ordered a spinach enchilada in a flour tortilla a la carte. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/manuels-mexican-food-scottsdale?select=aoxX8QUR6l3n4HuOL4dFYw#aoxX8QUR6l3n4HuOL4dFYw  I enjoyed it, even though it's just a tortilla filled with sautéed spinach and onions, with chopped lettuce and tomatoes on the side.  Would I order it again?  Probably not.  We may return for Mom to try a seafood entree, and I will have to try the beef and chicken enchiladas, but not anytime soon.The flan was good.  Not the best, as Mom makes the best flan, but we both appreciated this flan's texture.  I actually prefer its flavors the day after. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/manuels-mexican-food-scottsdale?select=LFppwbhhjs4-oTzkyYNesA#LFppwbhhjs4-oTzkyYNesA

My 1st memory of Whataburger was in the early 80's in Southern California sometime before I was 10 yrs old.  We had one on the main drag of the city I grew up in.  It was gone by the time I was a teenager.....however, I remember the distinct orange & white striped building and the Burgers.I was excited to finally give it a try as an adult.  I ordered a Whataburger ($2.64) w/Bacon ($1.17) & Cheese ($.49)....and the cashier suggested I add Jalapenos ($.49)....http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/93E1eOQ2bQG0OyIMqdcTvg?select=YKkzLz967qEgfA5eqyqLdAyes, it's really a la carte pricing, LOL!http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/93E1eOQ2bQG0OyIMqdcTvg?select=Wb0gZDFFQxcuphBQ9eHCsQI was really hungry, so I also ordered a Honey BBQ Chicken Strip Sandwich ($4.64) & Sm Fries ($1.39).http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/93E1eOQ2bQG0OyIMqdcTvg?select=MJOS72B9ZlfsPbsNsznntghttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/93E1eOQ2bQG0OyIMqdcTvg?select=rjwgNh2n7fSapWGco38MoQThe Burger was OK, nothing special.....it did taste just how I remember it.  The distinct flavor of the Onions & Mustard in the Burger brought back memories.  The Chicken Strip Sandwich was above average, which surprised me.  The Chicken is real, White Meat Chicken Breast, and the BBQ Sauce was decent.  The Fries were just OK.Overall, it was an OK meal for a fast food joint.Return Factor - 71%

I was out and about running errands in Chandler. I really needed to eat something. So driving along to my next appt. I just thought I would stop at the next place I saw. This was it. Italian food is always good right!When I first walked in, it smelled wonderful. I decided on a Slice , Cheese with mushrooms. I need to  wash my hands so into the bathroom. It was very clean and nicely stocked. Which was good considering the lunch rush had just ended.I had brought lemon water with me and I do not drink soda so I just got the slice.I got a side of sauce which was free. Can I just say wow!!! I have now found the best Pizza in the Valley!I have never really found too many places here in Phoenix and surrounding area that have good Pizza, so I am very happy.I also noticed they Ariancini Balls( something you do not find very often). I asked the girl if they were for Dinner or a special order. No you can get them any time!! I told Mario that night and we are going to go there for dinner the next night. I do not know how they taste, but, the Pizza and sauce were really good.I looked up the website and they are a family owned and operated business from New York. Real Italians!! Real Food. Just shows how you can stumble on something really good without expecting it.I did notice that they had free WIFI also, lots of parking in the lot.They do have delivery during certain hours and some great lunch specials for pick up and dine in. The lunch specials are from 11-2 Monday thru Friday.

Looking for a laid back place to go enjoy a brewski with friends, family, on a date, or even solo?  Four Peaks Brewery is your place.  Not only is the staff extremely attentive, but the atmosphere is awesome, and the food is pretty impressive as well!I've been to this Scottsdale location a couple of times and had really great experiences.  The spinach salad with salmon is delicious - made with fresh spinach, goat cheese, veggies, and perfectly cooked salmon... get it with the raspberry dressing - it rocks!  The spinach artichoke dip and the beer bread sandwiches are tasty also - and guess what?  Their entire menu goes well with beer.  Imagine that?!I've enjoyed their Peach Ale and Sun Brew, but I imagine you can't go wrong with whatever beer you're in the mood for... An extra bonus is that this location is walking distance to the Regal Sonoran 10 movie theater, so you can go enjoy a beer and/or a meal before or after a movie no problem - it makes for my favorite kind of night!Joined up with some folks here for happy hour before a movie on Thursday.  The spinach/artichoke dip appetizer was great and really could suffice for two of me for a dinner.  The was my first taste of Kiltlifter and I am a fan!The address shows Pima Rd and I spent 15 minutes cruising the parking lot before I figured out it faces Hayden.Four Peaks Brewery never fails to bring back fond memories of many many things.. Old friends, early 20's, scandalous bathroom "breaks", the "patio of illegal behavior", exes, birthday celebrations, drunken debauchery, peeing my pants.... among many other things. It's always the same too, so for a place that brings pleasant reminiscent thoughts and consistency, who can complain? Great menu options, I'd say its your typical above average bar type cuisine, but none of it has ever been crap. I would be the first to list a list of crap if needed. On top of that they have Kiltlifer, so seriously, what is better? To put the whipped cream on top of all of these wonderful things, I swear the only other person in Phoenix who has ever lived in (or even visited) Cape Cod works here.. makes for good conversation about things Phoenicians could give a shit less about. Like sailboats, sea glass and lobstahs. Perfection comes in all shapes and sizes, and luckily, Four Peaks is one of them for me. No complaints here, I have and always will love Four Peaks.I've passed this place several times and it's always jam packed and difficult to find parking, so I when I saw that it wasn't too busy one night, I stopped by.  After browsing the menu, I decided to get a Popper Burger (Sauteed Jalapenos, Onion Straws, Cream Cheese, $9.50) and to wash it down a Four Peaks IPA.The Burger didn't disappoint, it was very good!  The combination of Jalapenos & Cream Cheese made this Burger unique and tasty.....with a little *kick*, just how I like it.  The Four Peaks IPA was a perfect match for it as well....yum!I sat at the bar and the bartender/server was very friendly and helpful.  Can't wait to come back.Return Factor - 97%7/15/12Wow, this location is SMALL!  My first taste of Four Peaks was at the cavernous Tempe location, which I found to be too large, too loud, and too busy for my taste (plus there's not enough parking spaces!).  This one in Scottsdale is more to my liking.  Intimate and not too dark inside (outside, however, I couldn't tell if there was patio seating since it was so dark), open sight lines from most points in the restaurant, the women's restroom looked and smelled clean, AND parking isn't a problem.Came in to order a pint of peach ale, knowing that I can't buy it at stores.*  I inquired about the possibility of taking some home and was told that I may purchase a growler.**  A pint costs around $4, but during happy hours costs $3.25 (pitchers $14/$12).  Reverse happy hour starts at 10p.  Please note that their register's clock runs slow, so you may have to wait a few minutes longer before you can start getting happy.***FYI, if you've misplaced your driver license, you may use a passport to get past the I.D. checker at the door.*Whole Foods sells growlers now, and most keep peach ale on stock.**Growlers are pressurized receptacles that hold 64 oz. of whatever beverage you want to take with you.  A new growler costs $14 and can be refilled for $10.  It is recommended that people finish the 64 oz. within 24 hours of opening, but I was told that the beverage will stay fresh for longer than that.  BTW, peach ale is offered for takeout AND isn't a seasonal variety like I thought it was.  FYI, I didn't enjoy the ale here as much, since it wasn't ice-cold, like the one I had at Tempe's Lucky Break.  I'll have to remember to ask for a frosted glass, if it's available.***Drink because you are happy, but never because you are miserable.- G.K. Chesterton, Heretics.Ya know how people say "I really wanted to like this place" or "I want to like this place more than I do"? It's such a stupid thing to say, because obviously you want to like a place, you don't go somewhere and say "I really want to hate spending my money here and eating their food." Well anyway, rant aside. I do actually want to like this place and I come here pretty regularly, but the service is so annoying. My work buddies and I like to come in after work for a few beers and some food. The food is pretty good, I love their spicy Thai hummus, and the beers are obviously great, the patio is comfortable with heaters in the winter as well. But the service just irks the crap out of me. The girls usually are swamped no matter how many people are there. Most of the time, we don't even know who our server actually is because two or three people come over and take our orders. Sometimes the first girl leaves and trades us off to someone new, or the girl just flat out disappears.Most of the time, our drinks sit empty until someone finally sees us and takes another order, other times our drinks aren't even halfway empty and theyre trying to get us another round. They're friendly and nice, but being nice isn't really the only way to do things. Meh, maybe I'm too critical, but I shouldn't have to ask the food runner for plates, napkins and silverware. Or glasses of water like three or four times. I'll keep coming here because the alternative options suck even more :ahem Twin Peaks ahem Skeptical Chymist ahem:04/30/13Love the burgers and sandwiches (sometimes the kitchen forgets to add one or two key ingredients, say the anaheim chili I ask for instead of jalapeno pepper, or the onion strings) and the dinner specials I've tried at the restaurant hardly disappoint (!), but I really must stop ordering the pasta dinner specials to go.  I've enjoyed the fettucine alfredo that arrived with garlic bread (terrific bread!), but other pasta varieties have left me shaking my head and wanting for more.  Take into consideration the latest special I ordered, the Green Chile penne with grilled chicken.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/four-peaks-brewery-scottsdale-2?select=6gAA2123ljhlmZl2SqKgOA#6gAA2123ljhlmZl2SqKgOA  Photo was taken before I had a bite.  At $15 plus tax, I felt gypped.  What do you think?  The flavors weren't bad, though.  Rich and cheesy, and the green chiles added a lot of heat (!)-- more so than other cheesy green chile pasta dishes I've had elsewhere.  The grilled chicken was pretty good, too-- I don't eat a lot of chicken anymore, so when I do order it, I appreciate when it's done right.  I will keep an eye out for this special to appear on the dinner specials' rotation again, but I will order it for dining-in.  As I've said, I've rarely been disappointed with the dinner specials when dining on, so maybe that's the secret?  We shall see.I have a lot of love for this Four Peaks location.  It all started when I moved to Arizona 7 years ago and lived right down the street from Four Peaks and a few years after that it was the first place that I met Paul V. (my fiance).  This was a usual place for my friends and I to come for some food and drinks.  Some of my favorite foods here include the 5 Layer Nacho Dip with Chicken, Spinach Artichoke Dip (spicy), Grilled Chicken Beer Bread with french fries (my favorite item), Portabella Veggie Beer Bread, and the Reuben.  I really like the atmosphere and the service is usually pretty good.  Once in awhile the service can get slow, but overall it's OK.  My favorite beer here is the 8th Street Ale, but the Hefeweizen comes in pretty close too.  If you are coming here to watch a game, come early because it gets packed.If you're looking for a chill place to have some beer or even food, I'd check it out!

Restaurant name  Las Pupusas Restaurant
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Good pupusas are always found in seedy-looking areas, but the interior here is surprisingly well-appointed. Pricing is super-low, $2/ea is a bargain for the size of the 'pusas here- they're filling, cheesy, and served with the perfect coleslaw and tomato sauce.Added on an order of yucca frita, not realizing it was an entrée plate including chicharrones but the order was good- I prefer my yucca super salty and garlicky, and this wasn't quite that, but it was still a good portion size and very crispy.Service is friendly- don't be afraid to make a phone in order, even if they answer in spanish the phone is quickly passed to someone who can take your order and fill it correctly.

Restaurant name  Popeye's Chicken & Biscuits
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Popeye's has always been one of my favorite chicken places in general. The lieutenant colonel and the one with the church name are somewhat on the bland side and are not my first choices for tasty chicken. This location has a few things to complain about. The neighborhood is not the best and it shares the same building with the Circle jerk guys next door. Usually find myself trying to get in and out rather quickly. The customers are always pretty loud and obnoxious and the place is not very clean. You might even be asked for money in the parking lot.Service is basically poor and trying to communicate is difficult and a bit tricky. Normally have to repeat myself a few times to get the order correct. On my last visit experienced a triple sneeze by the cook right on my meal. Gesundheit!Usually order the Spicy Chicken with a side of Beans and Rice. Can't resist getting several jalapenos to give the meal some additional kick. Sometimes I'll even go crazy and order one of the specials. Tried the Catfish on my last visit and was surprised how small it looked. Maybe they should just call it kitten fish?Definitely recommend going to one of their full service restaurants that do not commingle with one of those fast trip places. Once had the occasion to eat in a really industrial part of Baton Rouge and enjoyed the meal so much more than this place. WHAT THE CLUCK?2.25 STARS

Restaurant name  Del Taco

Review Text :
What can one say about a single location of a chain restaurant like Del Taco besides:a. They always get my order right (which they do)b. The employees have a great grasp of the English language (which they do)Well, I can testify that this particular Del Taco made one of my wildest pubescent dreams come true.It's like this... what teenage boy hasn't mused that if he had a pair of ta-tas, he'd keep himself amused for hours.  I was no different.Then somewhere in my twenties, Del Taco came strolling into my life, with their thick and creamy strawberry shakes, made with a generous helping of real fruit!  The key to my youthful desire lied within this sweet polar potion... it was called lipids... aka milk fat.Let me tell you friends, the grass isn't always greener.  I'm not amused... not at all.  There's nothing alluring about a tufted teat.  They bounce; they sag; and they can percolate perspiration like Michael Vick at a PETA rally in Death Valley... on a really hot day.And no one seems to care.  Seinfeld conceptualized the 'manzier', but I've yet to see one for sale.I'd have to say my lowest point came while at a water park with friends, one of which brought their new baby.  While relaxing in a lounge chair under the awning by the wave pool, they asked if I wanted to hold little Abigail.  Sure, I love kids.As I was sitting there with this little cutie, I noticed other people were gawking at me.  When I looked down to check on Abby, I noticed that her mouth was firmly latched on to my right mammary.That's right children, come suckle daddy's sugarball.My nonchalant extrication efforts didn't pan out, and the worst part was that I thought I felt seepage.  With pretty much nothing left to lose, I wedged my left index finger between my swollen nip and lil-miss-hoover's mouth until I heard decompression.Baby-go-back-to-Mama.In conclusion, I'd like to think there's a lesson here we can all learn from.  Yeah.~SwoopDel Taco is a fast food chain that serves American style Mexican cuisine. It has been serving delicious American style Mexican cuisine since Ed Hackbarth opened the first Del Taco in Yermo, California just east of Barstow on September 16, 1964. Fifty years later, if you were to drive approximately 140 miles from the first Del Taco up I-15, then east on I-215, and north on Pecos Road there is a Del Taco that keeps the name going strong. I will share my experiences at this location.    This Del Taco is located at the busy Green Valley crossroads of Pecos Road and Windmill Parkway. I often drive by it. However, it was hiking that led me inside the building. This very Del Taco is also a hop and a skip from the Pittman Wash Trail. As a matter of fact, the large parking lot it shares with other businesses is where I separated from my car for a couple of hours. After hiking the Pittman Wash Trail I thanked Del Taco for the complimentary trailhead parking by making it my choice for the post-hike dinner.    Del Taco is more than just tacos. They serve a fantastic cheeseburger that is severely underrated. I walked inside the building expecting to order their mutant cheeseburger, take a picture then spread the word about it in my Yelp review. That didn't happen. If I had visited on any day but Taco Tuesday this would be a different review. There on the door was the advertisement announcing three tacos for $1.29 on Tuesday from 3 to 11 P.M. I'd celebrate Taco Tuesday and add a small Coke and medium fries that added up to less than a $5 bill.    The man working at the counter was friendly. He greeted me and was the first impression of this location. My second impression was the cleanliness of the large restaurant. This is the first Del Taco where I saw the Taco sauces and ketchup packets stored on little plates on every table.   Immediately after ordering I took my small soda cup to the Coke fountain. The deal with Del Taco drink sizes is they are Big. Here small means medium and large means super sized. This isn't one of the fast food restaurants where a small cup is a step above a water cup. The fountains where you fill the cups are Coke products including Coke Zero.   Around five minutes later, I'd pick up the food. The three hard shell tacos were tasty and filling. I topped them off with the Del Inferno sauce. As far as spiciness 2  stars. With the three tacos, I'd enjoy the crinkle cut fries. The fries were good, however, in my opinion Nathan's Famous is the King of crinkle cut fries.   I enjoyed Taco Tuesday so much that I returned to this location a couple of Tuesdays later. It's that good that I just might return here at a later Taco Tuesday.

Review Text :
After a night of bowling, my friends and I decided we needed food in our systems! Thank goodness we came during happy hour!HAPPY HOUR: Half off all drinks and pizza from 4-7pm & 12-3am!WHAT: Since our favorite pizza wasn't on the menu (The Gilroy), we all came to a consensus on what we wanted on our pizza! The pizza was definitely half off, but since we added several toppings, each topping was 75cents additional- SO WORTH IT!! We created a monster pizza (all meats minus ground beef, and topped it off with jalapenos to create that neede ZING).  The only missing ingredients were tomatoes & mushrooms! BOOOHOOO!!We also had a bucket of sliders, which were pretty legit!! Also, garlic parmesan twister fries, which I always get at the local PT pubs!! Gotta love me some curly fries!!& lastly, had to top it off with the Pear Cider!! This has become my new found favorite drink!! I know, it's girly, but I LOVE IT!!*NOTE: The service was great!! The bartender made it so easy for us to order, and had a great sense of humor! I love people with a good sense of humor. It just brightens my day! =D

Restaurant name  Ichiza
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
this is by far one of my most favorite restaurants in las vegas.  Ever since discovering this place about 3-4 years ago, i have always been coming back.  this isn't your high end japanese restaurant.   the decor is simple, the prices are very reasonable, the food is extensive and excellent, and the place is great place to be merry.  right when you walk in you are greeted in japanese and when you leave your thanked in japanese.  the workers there all seem to be young students.  there are so many dishes to choose from.  the only thing i can do is tell you about what i always order: 1) menu items:  kushi-katsu - crunchy breaded pork w/lemony teriyaki dip; ika yaki - broiled squid;  ichiza ramen noodles - yummy; seaweed salad; beef tataki - rare beef slice to dip in a ponzu-dailkon radish mixture (sublime); kim chee fried rice; and a sashimi plate w/ tuna, albacore, mackerel, yellow tail, salmon, octopus, and squid. 2) non-menu items (sheets of paper that have daily/common specials are posted over the walls)  monk fish liver, fried smelt (my most favorite b/c the eggs are cooked in the belly), and beef cubes in ponzu sauce.  yeah, there are a lot of dishes that i like, but im so impressed that ichiza's has not disappointed me for the many times i've been there.  They have large group seating areas, which i've enjoyed many times with friends and family eating and drinking up cold sake, sake bombs, and japanese beer.  i really recommend their house cold sake, so much better and smoother than drinking it warm.  i've been there a many nights till closing leaving with my belly full and ridiculously buzzed from all the sake we drank.   i always have to put this on the itinerary of any of my visiting friends and family that come to las vegas.  that's how much i love and trust this place.  anybody who knows me, can back me up for whatever say about this restaurant b/c most likely i've taken them there....additional note...don't think that this restaurant is one of those upscale dress up places b/c of the amount of stars i gave it.  it gets five stars b/c all around it's hella awesome!!!My Vegas go to man brought me here - it's on the top of his list, so he has to always bring us out-of-towners there! I've been there a couple of times already and can definitely tell you this is one of those joints for only the locals.  No tourists would be venturing out over here.  All that much better!  When looking at the bar and all the special menu items posted on the wall, it can be quite difficult when deciding what to order.  So, when in doubt, let the expert go at it.I fondly remember the fried smelt (less than $3 for three fish).  These plump babies are loaded up 'cuz their eggs are still sitting inside of them.  And with a little bit of salt and some fresh lemon juice, yum yum!  And who doesn't love ankimo?!  Monkfish liver that melts in your mouth...ahhhh...I love ankimo!  I've tried a bunch of other things there like the red snapper carpaccio with ikura, ramen noodles, the beef tataki w/ lemon juice, fresh oysters on the half shell w/ ponzu sauce (2 for $4.25), seaweed salad, and the beef cubes.  I don't remember anything bad about the place, but just good food with good company.The first time I went, they had those fancy Japanese toilets with all those buttons to try out.  I attempted to use it but had no luck.  On my last visit, their special toilet was no longer there!  =(  I guess too many people were having way too much fun with it and it went into retirement.  If possible, go with a large group and sit in the back where you have to take your shoes off to swing your feet under the table.  And this way, you can also order a lot more random things and share them with everyone.  It makes it all that much merrier.  Overall, pretty extensive menu...I think I want some of that fried smelt roe just about now!  Bring it!Updated: 10/10/06 - They also offer a FREE membership card.  You get 5% off whenever you dine there when you bring this card and it eventually adds up to 10-15% off your bill for next time.I also like getting the Agedashi Tofu soup.  It's light and delicate without being overly infused with the bonito flakes.  Yum yum!The salmon skin salad was okay.  The dressing overpowers the salmon skin, so you can't taste a whole lot.  I wouldn't bother getting it again.  The deep fried crabs are a plate of baby crabs with an aioli type dipping sauce.  An interesting taste and a nice crunch! Side note: They give you a wet towelette thing and that will be your napkin for the entire meal.  Don't bother looking around for regular paper napkins here!Updated: 11/27/06 - I recently tried the okra with natto (less than $3).  First off, the idea of natto grosses me out.  The texture alone is nasty, and the smell...geez, that's a whole other subject.  Since it was my dining partner's first time w/ the stuff, I suggested he give it a go at some a cheap price.  It comes with thin slices of fresh okra, seaweed slivers, and hot mustard on the side.  Overall, I would not recommend it unless you're a fan of this stuff.  I definitely am not one. Blah.  Also, the last two times I went, they were out of the lovely ankimo!  Argh!Updated: 01/24/07 - I changed my ratings from four stars to five because I find myself craving the fried smelt roe more often than not.  And Ichiza has apparently become my comfort restaurant to turn to when I can't decide where else to go.  I have only been to one other izakaya, and that was Musha in Torrance, CA.  How can this place not be special?Updated: 06/12/07 - Went back the past weekend after a few month hiatus.  They were out of uni and ankimo!  Argh!  But we had the beef tongue - tasty, and gotta eat it when it's hot; minced spanish mackerel on cucumber - fresh, lots of flavors on your palatte, fried garlic - put salt on it instead of the miso, and oh-so good!, tartar yellowtail - with avocado, crisp things, and salsa - refreshing flavors and light, and honey toast - they need more bread chunks, but yummy!  (They had a few new dishes that were listed in Japanese.  If you ask the waitresses or owner to translate, they'll try their best!  Be daring and give it a go!)Update! 08/06/07 - Out of ankimo again!  Argh!  But they do have a soft shell crab appetizer that comes with a ponzu dipping sauce and Japanese mayonnaise.  It's a fatty crab with lots of meat!  Yum!  Their red snapper carpaccio is a bit different, it comes with olive oil, tomatoes, and mozzarella!  Update! 10/09/07 - Where the heck is all the ankimo?!  Argh!  Brought some out-of-town guests to Ichiza to experience where the locals eat.  Ate all the standard stuff, of course.  New thing tried here - live scallop.  I warn you now, don't sniff the squiggly things...it may turn you off!  But the scallop slices dipped in ponzu sauce is oh so tasty.  Also shared a ramen bowl.  I'm personally not a big fan of ramen (it's a filler), so I'll pass on it.  Everyone else seemed to swallow it down without any problems! =)(I added some photos of my eats above!)OK guys! This is a solid Yelp-recommended kappo place. I really loved the overall experience, up until the very end, when suddenly I got one unexpected & unfortunate issue with it. When we finished dinner (we had ordered a huge load of food and paid about $57 per person, for 2 people, incl. a good 18% tip) we exited the restaurant and the predominantly Japanese staff didn't say a simple thank you. The Japanese host (manager?) saw us leaving, turned a blind eye and continued chatting with the waitress as if we didn't exist.I regret giving you a lower rating (I initially intended a 5) but I am an emotional and spoiled client- I got upset... I'm half Japanese... I know it is not written on my (Caucasian) face, but I am. My appearance is not an excuse for anyone to forget to say a simple "thank you" especially when it's part of the Japanese cultural code. As we all know. Even a Korean-owned Japanese restaurant in LA area is trying to always say "Arigato Gozaimasu" (with a heavy accent, but still, polite and respectful). I never had an experience where Japanese nationals operating a restaurant- in the US or in Japan- disregarded this centuries-old cultural rule.OK... the tantrum is over now, guys- sorry. Yelp is all about being subjective and emotional about our experiences- and it is exactly what I am doing. I wish that I had the desire to write more about the food rather than freaking out regarding a cultural issue...In spite of the "shitsurei"- hopefully an isolated incident without any mean attitude or intentions behind it- I DO RECOMMEND this restaurant as one of the good Nihon-ryori restaurants in Las Vegas. Also, conveniently, it is open quite late. Maybe other Yelpers who are less spoiled or less familiar with Japanese customs (not expecting as much from their experience) will really have a blast.UPDATED 12-27-07: Came here again and this time it wasn't as good as before. I don't know what it is. This time, even though it was good, it just didn't blow me away like last time. So one star off.---------------------------------THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU to all the yelpers who rated this place highly. That was the main reason why we bookmarked it and decided to check it out. I wasn't sure how late they were open but we arrived pretty late, around 10pm and crossed our fingers as we entered. Man, it was bustling! Turns out they were open until 3am Mon-Sat, until 2.30am on Sundays. However, last call is 45 mins before closing so make sure you arrive on time.So there were 2 guys waiting for a table and the hostess asked if we wanted to sit at the counter. Lil guy was all for it. So, counter it was. I was just fascinated by the atmosphere in here. There were 2 tatami tables with very drunk people singing and carrying on. They were obviously having a good time.We were given menus but it was the posted items above our heads which interested me. Hubby left the ordering to me. I ordered an udon ($6.35) for little guy with his usual edamame ($3) and agedashi tofu ($4.35). Then, I proceeded to order a bunch of items for us adults.Uni pon ($5.50) arrived first. It was 4 plump pieces of uni sitting on thinly sliced cucumbers nestled on daikon spaghetti wading in a pool of ponzu sauce. OMG it was fantastic. The uni was soooooo fresh and flavorful. I could've eaten 3 of these.Then came the salmon skin salad ($5). This was no ordinary salmon skin salad. This was the emperor of all salmon skin salads I've ever had. Crunchy slivers of carrot, shreds of lettuce, grape tomatoes, daikon sprouts, perfectly cooked salmon skin, grated daikon, topped with a dollop of roe. Hubby and I shared this but were fighting over who got the last morsel. Taramiso, otherwise known as miso butterfish ($5.50) is something I've been craving since leaving Hawaii. I used to eat it at least once a week. After a year of missing it and seeing it on the menu here was enough for me to kiss the ground of this izakaya. The taramiso did not disappoint. In fact, it was so perfect hubby and I again commented on how much we've missed this dish.All the while, lil guy was enjoying his udon, edamame and agedashi tofu while watching his portable DVD player oblivious of all the ongoings around him. Tofu salad with tuna sashimi ($7.50) was interesting yet refreshingly delicious. Romaine lettuce, followed by mashed tofu, topped with diced avocado and cubed tuna sashimi, toss in a few daikon sprouts and a pinch of bonito flakes and voila, a masterpiece. The grape tomatoes complete this both in color and texture.Of course an izakaya meal isn't complete without some sort of alcohol. We had 2 large bottles of Asahi draft ($5.50/bottle) and then we finished by sharing a bowl of miso chasu ramen with extra chasu ($10). I'm sorry, but Santouka Ramen does not measure up to the ramen here and it was the last item we ate. The broth was perfect, not too salty and not under flavored. The chasu had just the right amount of fat interspersed with the lean bits. It looked like pancetta. Hubby was a bit skeptical but I assured him he would like it, and guess what? He did.This is definitely bookmarked for our next visit to Vegas, and let me tell you this, I'm reliving my meal right now just by writing this review and the bad part is, I'm not eating the food as I'm writing this. BUMMER!400th review... I think we'll turn the corner with Ichiza.  After reading the reviews for this place, I bookmarked it for a must stop.  After the first time, I had to go again on the weekend as well.  Killer eats to be had here.First time in, it was Halloween Eve so everyone was decked out in funky costumes.  Oddly, even if it wasn't Halloween, it wouldn't have seemed out of place.  There were only two of us so we sat at the counter and ordered up a pitcher of Kirin, Beef Tongue, Buta Kim (stirfried pork with kimchee), Chicken Gizzard, Shishamo (smelt fish), fried chicken, spicy tuna roll, ramen, bacon wrapped mochi, ume chazuke (green tea over rice with pickled plum), and probably a few other things that aren't coming to mind.  Everything was excellent, and it was fun tricking my cousin into eating some "weird" stuff.  =)Second time in was saturday night, this time with Emily and my mom-in-law joining us as well.  Pretty much ordered all the above plus shishito (twist pepper), sushi chazuke (it was basically a shishamo roll with a dip sauce), the chicken wings, chawanmushi, gyudon (beef bowl), oyakodonburi (chicken omelet rice bowl), natto okra (delicious!), kushi katsu (bite sized pork cutlet on a skewer with onion), and I'm sure I'm missing a few again.  Had a great time both times, and I'm sure to be back again next time I'm in town.  Pics are posted.  =)I enjoyed my meal here. The atmosphere was fun and everyone seemed to be genuinely having a good time. The service was decent considering how late and busy it was. Salmon Skin Salad- tangy, crunchy, and tasty. I'd order this again.Buta Kimchi- The kimchi wasn't fermented at all and the pork was sweet. I think I was expecting something more along the lines of the Korean version of this dish so I was disappointed. But even if I hadn't had some sort of idea of what I thought the dish was supposed to taste like, I don't think I would've liked it because it was too sweet for me.Udon- They were out of Ramen and it being a cold night, I wanted something soupy and hot. I opted for the Udon and was pleased that the noodles were soft without being too soggy and the broth was hot and soothing. Yum.I rarely get off the strip to eat when I go to Vegas so this was a nice change. Definitely good eats.Heard about Ichiza from my roommate on her last trip to Vegas, and decided to check it out with the family on our annual Vegas trip. I have to give this place extra props because my parents actually liked it. What was I doing bringing my totally unhip Vietnamese parents to a pretty hipster izakaya in Vegas? Well, they don't like sushi, and wanted to taste other Japanese food. And because I'm such an accomodating daughter, I figured this would be a good opportunity. But it didn't occur to me that the place had pretty much all bar food and young patrons. So when we stepped in, I felt so uncool at first, but with my mom being so cute and my dad being so genteel to the waitresses, I was reminded that they have been in this country long enough to know how to deal with non-viet-traditional people. My mom ordered a TOFU STEAK (I guess that sounded appetizing to her), and out came a huge square of lightly marinated tofu on a bed of boiled bean sprouts. My parents pretty much devoured that whole dish, bean sprouts and all. Dad ordered the ika-yaki (grilled squid) and loved how it was seasoned. I was happy he ordered it because I got to eat it, too. I got the soft shell crab and sis got the soba noodles. We had a few more dishes (chicken gizzard, more tofu, etc.) and all them were pretty tasty. All the food came out fresh and light. We all felt full enough with our 10 or so dishes and no one had indigestion or that gross feeling of super grease afterward. My parents, being so polite, thanked the manager and the waitresses in their accented English and said that they hope to see them again. And for a moment I felt that my parents were pretty hip...Way to live up to the hype.  After reading all the Yelp reviews and remembering my last attempt to try great ethnic cuisine in Vegas (see Lotus of Siam review), I was a bit apprehensive about hailing a taxi to Ichiza.  But after a 1 hour wait, I left, both very full and very satisfied.1) Location - Ichiza is located on the second floor of a strip mall in the area of Las Vegas that most call "Chinatown."  For those familiar with the area, it's the next strip mall adjacent to the large Sam Woo/Ranch 99 mall.2) Decor - typical of izakaya, the place is tiny and crowded.  Signs are everywhere about all the available dishes and alcohol is plentiful.  The one thing I did notice, amazingly given it's Vegas, is that this place is smoke-free.  All patrons go outside to smoke.  Good riddance.3) Food - the food is greasy, delicious, and prepared fast.  Whether you choose skewered chicken wings and gizzards or bonito sashimi with ponzu sauce, the key is to order a lot of items to go with your sake.  I'm sad I didn't feel well enough to eat the mochi bacon skewer, but I did partake in the Honey Toast.  4) Service - for a crowded and small place, service is amazingly good.  The patrons tend to stay forever, but the staff does it's best to keep you up to date on how long you have to wait.  Beyond that, they did a great job in calling a cab and even going downstairs and waiting with the cab so that someone wouldn't take it.  Thumbs up.I'm starting to hate yelp.70ish reviews on how awesome this place is.There was a cockroach on my table.  We hung out.  It crept onto my plate for a ponzu sauce nightcap.  I honestly was grossed out but not completely.  I know good places are often dirty places.  I understand.  But when I pointed it out to the waitress, she just made a feeble attempt to kill my new little friend, after some manic missed squashings all over my table.Shortly after Mr. Roach was laid to rest, we were offered free mochi ice cream.  Wow.  A fricking roach just joined me for dinner and you're offering me a 20 cent consolation dessert?  Fuck you.To be fair, the food was mediocre.  2 stars for that and minus 5 stars for the roach and minus 1000 stars for their generous compensation and apology for the mackerel that worked its way back into my mouth as vomit.Are... you.... kidding?   Folks, this is why I started Yelping.  To bring truth to the masses - to expose restaurants for what they really are.  I'm in Las Vegas for Halloween and I wanted some good sushi.  So I searched on Yelp.com for "sushi" in Las Vegas.  I filtered the results by "Highest Rated" and guess what showed up?   Ichiza.   Sighhhhhhh  This is proof that you can't always trust what 123 reviewers think about a place.  For those of you familiar with my reviews, you should know how big of a sushi snob I am.  You should also know how much I appreciate stumbling across "hole in the wall" sushi joints.  I love finding a diamond in the rough.  Ichiza, however, is not one.   Not even close.  For starters, let's talk about the menu.  Why do they have a menu?  I looked over this menu and there were THREE sushi rolls.  ONLY THREE?  How can you only have three sushi rolls???  One of them was a California Roll, which doesn't count.  The other was a tempura roll, which also is not real sushi.   The third was the Spider Roll, fried soft shell crab in a roll.   I asked the waitress if they had another menu for sushi - surely, this can't be it.  She explained, the rest of the menu is on the walls.  What?  You mean all those random pieces of paper taped to the walls of the restaurant?  That's the full menu?  So... do you want me to get up and walk around the entire restaurant and try to find and memorize what i want to eat?  This is EFFING RIDICULOUS!  So after I browsed the "menu wall", I found two other rolls.  One was called the Natto Roll, which was soybean and okra in a roll that's deep fried and topped with tuna.   The other was called the Eel-Kara-age Roll, which has baked eel and fried chicken in a roll.   God help me, this was the worst crap I've eaten in so long.  The Natto Roll was FUNKY.  I love okra and I love soybeans, but mix the two together and add spongy rice and deep-fry it and suddenly it's disgusting.   The Eel-Kara-age didn't taste as bad, but was poorly created.  It's just rice stacked with a piece of fried chicken and a piece of eel on top.  That's it.  Sigh.   The Spider Roll, the only roll that I recognized from other sushi places, was not made like any Spider Roll I've ever had.  Yeah, they deep-fried the soft shell crab, but what's up with rolling it up with lettuce, carrots and cucumber?  LETTUCE, CARROTS and CUCUMBER???  In a sushi roll???? WHAT THE HELL IS HAPPENING?  IS THIS A SICK AND TWISTED HALLOWEEN PRANK??  My friends were wiser than I was and decided to order the ramen instead.  They thought it was awful.  Noodles were not cooked enough and were hard. The broth was not good, either.  I've posted a picture of them - check it out.Ok, enough about the baffling menu and utterly worthless food.  Lets talk service.  The waitress was quick enough coming over to take our order, but it took awhile because I had to run around the restaurant and tell her what I wanted.  Once she gave me my food though, she was hard to find.  I had to track another waitress down twice to get refills on my Diet Coke.  Btw, they don't have soft drinks on tap - only by the can and they charge you $5 per can.  Be warned.  If you're staying on the Strip, like most people are, then this place is a little hard to get to unless you take a cab.  I would definitely not recommend walking to it.  It's also in a pretty ghetto part of town - be careful walking back at night.  Just take a cab both ways.   The only REAL positive about this place?  I'm not sure how the waitresses dress during every other day of the year, but on Halloween they went all out.   There was a slutty bee, a slutty nurse, a slutty angel, and a slutty cabaret girl.  They were HOT.  If you're into hot asian chicks (I married one. Hot asian chicks ftw), then you'll find them working here.  Is it worth eating here though?  Sadly...... no.  Maybe you can come in right before closing and ask them if they wanna have a drink somewhere else.. far away.Our table for 8 quickly morphed to 9 on a Saturday night but the good folks at Ichiza didn't bat an eye. Our party (read: my family) included multiple picky eaters including a person who doesn't eat seafood and two people who have never eaten Japanese food. Unfathomable, I know. . .Still, with Ichiza's extensive menu I managed to get an array of plates to please every palette. Even the seafood hater seemed genuinely pleased with his sizzling steak while the rest of us sampled the sushi. This visit to Ichiza was much like a reunion, where the food took a bit of a backseat to catching up with everyone. But one thing I'll never forget about the meal was the honey toast: a half loaf of bread toasted and hollowed out to accommodate vanilla ice cream with honey on the bottom. Do not leave Ichiza without ordering it!I was thinking about how much I've missed real Izakaya food. And then i realized I haven't reviewed Ichiza. Let me tell you how much we loved this place when we live in Sin City...we'd come here at least once a week...sometimes two for a few months straight. We'd filled up the frequent diner card so quickly that we were getting the max. discount within 2 months. Since we've moved back to So Cal, I have yet to find another Izakaya that is as good and inexpensive as Ichiza. Yes...inexpensive is the keyword in this economy!! So...in a nutshell this is the main reason I miss Vegas...sad huh?What a hidden gem off the strip :) Great authentic Japanese tapas restaurant offering all sorts of Japanese dishes you wouldn't be able to find ANYWHERE else.Off thier regular menu, we ordered the spicy tuna roll ($5.75). You get 8 solid pieces of spicy tuna! What a freaking deal!!! Fish was really fresh too!After seeing so many pictures of the "Tar Tar Yellow Tail" ($6.95) we had to get this. And this was definitely one of our favorite dishes. Rice, avocado, tomato, lettuce, and chopped yellow tail layered between fried  biscuits. SO unique!!! Nice summer dish!Another item off thier special menu, we got the "Eel, Kakiage, Tempura Roll" ($6.95). This was a california roll (avocado, crab, cucumber) topped with tempura, sashimi, and eel. There was NO way you can get this all in one bite so we ended up taking it apart to eat. Very good! The sweet sauce on the eel went nicely with the creamy avocado of the california roll.Next we 1/2 an order of the "Tom Yum Roll" ($6.95). This had tempura shrimp, avocado inside and another piece of cooked shrimp and cilantro was placed on top of the roll. Then this combination was wrapped in a spring roll wrap. Honestly? Nothing special. and not really worth $7 for 4 pieces. But a nice light taste especially after squeezing the lime juice on top.Again, after seeing so many yelpers post a picture of this Honey Toast ($7.95) dessert, I had to have it! The thing is HUGE. It is literally half a loaf of bread. NO JOKE. Topped with a scoop and vanilla ice cream and drizzled with honey. I would say 80% of the people here got the dessert. And to my surprise the bread is so light and fluffy that we almost killed this thing between the2 of us! crazy!!! The toast is REALLY soft in the inside and toasted on the outside. A simple and light dessert! A must try here!Warning - food comes out really slow and it would be wise to make a reservation. There were tons of people waiting outside even when we left at 8pm. They did take reservations for us on a Sunday night and we were seated right away :)What a unique experience and truly a hidden gem away from the strip!Las Vegas is a city filled to the brim with addictions of every kind, so why not an addiction to one of the very best places you can find in Vegas? Ichiza would gladly satiate my thirst for off-the-strip, reasonably priced dining. It is located on the second floor of a strip mall in Chinatown, which is a small drive from the strip. Completely unassuming and unpretentious, Ichiza is an izakaya - complete with different types of seating - at the Japanese bar/counter, normal tables, and on tatami mats on raised ground.I'm not going to name the 12+ dishes that my fellow diners and I ordered. That would be a little ridiculous. I will leave you with this piece of advice: order off the walls and off the menu. Get the waitress' or hostess' suggestions and go with them (unless you're a rather unadventurous eater). They have all the standard izakaya-type food here including one of my favorites - octopus balls.And most importantly: order the Honey Toast for dessert. Do not forgo this step! This honey toast had all of my dining group a-flutter, and you can guarantee that it is one of their most popular dishes. A block of bread is hollowed out, toasted, slathered in honey (but not too much honey), and placed on a plate. Then a huge scoop of ice cream nestles itself inside of that sweet piece of toast. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/j5nPiTwWEFr-VsePew7Sjg?select=5MBjtf85537l3Q44V97BYA) It tasted like pure heaven. If you do everything else wrong - order from the menu, actually order soda, etc. - at least do this one thing correctly. Order the honey toast. You'll thank me later.remember Angelina Jolie when she was married to Billy Bob?  It's been a long time because the now refined philanthropist/mother-of-Jolie Pitt-clan/paparazzi-shy-actress does not at all resemble the Angelina of those times: controversial, grungy, and FUN.  Ichiza is like that old Angelina, plus delicious!Atmosphere is not for the timid eater, you are likely to share tables with strangers, you may even have to share tables with strangers as well as be shoes-less with them.  But if you like making friends over sake and exotic meats & fish, then come on in, order a drink and start staring... not at other people - at the strips of paper glued to the walls on which much of the menu is written (most of them are far away, so you will end up seeming like you're staring at other patrons anyways)!  Did I mention this restaurant was not for the shy?  The current Angelina does not seem to eat, but the old one did, and she probably devoured things like chicken gizzards (skewered and stir-fried), beef liver, & beef tongue, all of which are tasty at Ichiza.  My personal favorites are the buttery beef tongue and the chewy skewered gizzards.  If the present Ms. Jolie did eat, she'd probably enjoy the tofu and sashimi salad: refreshing cold tofu and top quality fish over fresh romaine and avocado, with zesty sesame vinagrette, it's approved for anorexic starlets.Okay, all Angelina talk aside, I love Ichiza the most because of the grain epiphany that happened to me at this hole-in-the-wall Japanese treasure: the broiled rice balls - the best thing to have happened to anyone that's a fan of slightly-burned crispy rice.  It was these balls (not the Angelina fantasy - sorry to disappoint some of you) that made me an Ichiza convert.I love this place! It is so great to find a true Japanese Izakaya anywhere outside Japan, and to find it in the "Chinatown" (really, Asiantown) part of Las Vegas was a real treat! I was smiling the whole time eating here! Izakayas serve a lot of little dishes and comfort foods like in a Japanese home. They are not Sushiyas, so don't expect that, although they may serve some sushi items. Originally, they were drinking places, where salarymen in Japan would go and unwind, drinking a lot of booze, bond with co-workers, and even complain about or insult their bosses to their faces (to let off steam; and then they could always blame it on being drunk, because if they talked-back or disrespected at work, they would be fired or severely reprimanded). So it was sort of a social safety valve place to relax in a strict culture of respect, protocol and obligation to the group and superiors. The little food items were snacks to help the drinking.But then, many places became very popular for their tasty snacks. And now, it is a whole category of dining. It is starting to become more popular in major cities in the US. Los Angeles has some good ones, like Musha in Santa Monica and Torrance, or Raku in LA. An Izakaya is different than a "Snack" or "Hostess" bar, which in many Asian countries, involves little in the way of food, but a lot in booze and pretty girls to make you feel like a big shot. Izakaya in the US are usually family run, and down home, good for families and even kids.(Pronunciation tip: do not accent any syllable, they are all even in intonation and emphasis: I-Za-Ka-Ya! NOT iza KAYa!) This one has a million little dishes to choose from, listed on the menu, and many of the same selections taped all along the walls, mostly in Japanese! The youthful waitresses and hostess here are all Japanese, so it is a delight, especially if you know a little of the language, because they will scurry around and respond promptly to your requests, as in Japan, with enthusiasm and energy. If they were lazy or lackadaisical in their service in Japan, they would be severely reprimanded or fired. Too bad that doesn't translate to Denny's here! So this place serves what I like to call, Japa Tapas. The two of us had Agedashi Tofu, Ikkayaki (whole broiled squid, chopped up), grilled Black Cod (like butter!) , Sake Ochazuke (Salmon over rice mixed with green tea and flavorings) and for dessert, green tea ice cream and 2 flavors of Mochi ice cream, and finally their signature dessert, which is 1/3 a loaf of bread crust filled with honey and vanilla ice cream that we shared with our tablemates. We also had a small cold Kurosawa Junmai Sake.  All delish! We sat at a community table and met another nice young Filipino couple enjoying their Izakaya experience, and shared stories and dessert with them.  I am coming back here every time I go to Las Vegas! You should, too!Forget those fancy faux Asian places on the strip! OIshikatta! Tanoshikatta!DON'T BE SCURRED TO WALK AROUND TO LOOK AT THE SPECIALS POSTED ON THE WALLSMy sister brought me here a few years ago and I've been a fan ever since. She was in town this week and we stopped by here after I picked her up from the airport. She was already tipsy from drinks at SFO cause her flight was delayed so we didn't order bottles of Nigori like usual. This is what we ordered: Asahi - large bottleMackerel w/miso sauceIka-yaki Stir fried garlic chicken gizzardsWagyu beef carpaccioTako wasabi - they forgot to give this to usKimchi fried riceSalmon w/mozzarella tempuraThey were out Black Cod w/miso sause so we tried the Mackerel. The Markerel is a little salty. The Ika-yaki is another dish that we always get. Tako wasabi is also another dish we always order, but they forgot to give it to us this time. Stir fried garlic chicken gizzards are a must. We tried to order the Butter Clams, but they ran out.OPEN LATE AND 10% DISCOUNT CARDHONEY TOAST!!!  Its plain and delish!  It had been 3 yrs since I last had one here and was eager to stuff my face with some yummy goodness.But first we decided to get a little bit of good in the tummy.  It was 11pm when we got here so we tried to keep it light.Wasabi Ika (squid) ~ it was fresh squid in a wasabi sauce garnished with pickled daikon.  It was very refreshing!Agedashi tofu ~ I luv this dish and luv making it at home!Ika butter ~ Sauteed squid in butter and onions.Asparagus bacon and Gizzards (sunagimo) ~ Two yakitori that I often get when its available.Okra Natto ~ 2 of my fave slimy food hell yeah!!!Sake flight ~ From Ginjo, Junmai, Daiginjo all were pretty good tasting. Honey Toast ~ Hmm what can I say...... Its damn good so you have to try it.  Toast, Honey and Ice Cream!  Yum Yum!This place is way off the strip but worth going to to.  Its open late so you can get some good grub here!  I still like the izakaya in my hood but this place is a good spot in sin city!Eyes ~ My eyes are on the Honey toast!Nose ~ I smell yummyness!Ear ~ Its a late night but still pretty busy and lively!Mouth ~ Everything is tasty but I want some honey!Tummy ~ Ahhh finally some honey toast!Late night is not my best time. I'm not sure how I wrangled myself a job that requires me to work until the wee hours of the morning (12:15 is wee hours for me--quit judging my Golden Girl sensibilities). But late night is okay when it means amazing ramen at Ichiza after work.They only had one ramen left, but luckily my friend and I wanted each a half order. Yummmmm. I'm not sure what they do to their pork belly, but it is full of deliciousness. I think fairies sprinkle it with happy dust before they plop it in your bowl. It melts in your mouth with fairy dust deliciousness.It's really tiny in here, only seating about 50-60 people, but it's well worth it...especially after you get done working and just want to unwind with a bowl of broth and noodles and bean sprouts. Late night happens for me so infrequently, but Ichiza makes staying up past 10 p.m. worth it.Went here for the first time tonight, and I love it!I actually hate fried rice, or thought I did, since the only kind I've ever had is the shitty Panda Express crap. I know, I'm a deprived child. Anyway, I figured out that it doesn't taste like that at all and now I am officially in love with this shinanigans!I forgot the name of the type I had, someone else ordered it for me, but I believe it was the seafood one. A little spice to it and was perfect in every way. Now if only I could figure out the use of chopsticks without looking like an idiot!Also had some tofu, which was super soft, so it was also a little hard for me to manage to eat, but I liked it all the same.The great grand finale, was the honey bread. OH MER GERD! It's not even like, a slice of bread, its this huge square loaf that is drizzled in honey and icecream, and was sooooo good. It hurt to eat cause I was so full but I couldn't stop. If you come here, get the honey bread, and your life will be complete and all voids in your soul will be filled. That is all.Honey toast the size of your head!! Need I say more? Oh and it tastes really good too :) This is a pretty darn good izakaya and one of my go-to places to eat when I'm in town. I wish that they could stay open later than 3, but I would totally ditch the club early to eat here.A couple of my favs include beef tataki (a must), beef bowl (when they don't run out for the day), karaage, spicy tuna rolls, and sometimes ramen. I'm even a sucker for that peach sparkling sake thing that I can't seem to find anywhere else! Service is always attentive even when we come during the busy times. Don't forget to end your meal with an order of the honey toast!!The clubs weren't that hot that night, and my friends and I were hungry for some grub.  "ICHIZA!" we proclaimed.  Of course, there could be no other choice.This place always ends up being one of our go-to spots in Vegas after the clubs.  They're not open 24 hours, but they're still open pretty late.  If we know we can make it in time, this is what we crave.There's really only one thing we want.  The hamburger steak.  It's not even on the menu, but it's so delicious.  The patty is moist and seasoned very well.  Then just a little bit of gravy to top it.  We can't resist.Add some fried rice to order to complete this meal, and at 2am in the morning, we are happy campers.ICHIZA!  My happy after clubbing place in Vegas.Ah, Ichiza. I gotta give it up, yo. It's most certainly always a good time when I roll through and I have no problem bringing friends to enjoy in your delectable delights. As some of my good friends know, I have this love-love relationship with  Japanese food and anytime the option presents itself to get my grub on, I am sure to follow through. Ichiza is one of those spots that I usually don't frequent too often like I do other Japanese establishments but if I have a pretty good sized group gathered willing to drink some beer or sake and have some small plates to accompany, this is usually my go to.  As far as food goes, I usually hit up the specials menu to start off the night.  Last time I stopped in, they had shigoku oysters, chu-toro, and kohada (as you can tell, I love me some SEAFOOD!.. or if you don't, google it heehee) on the special menu for the day and I delightfully ordered it up. The special menu rotates daily (?) so be sure to check it out whenever you stop in as it changes and presents some new stuff upon each visit.  From the regular menu, I am always happy to suggest the oyako don chicken bowl, ikayaki whole grilled squid, and the uni in ponzu sauce (if they still have any in stock).  I always round it out with some sunomono cucumber or wakame seaweed salad to make my meal somewhat complete and to my definite satisfaction.  Not a big dessert guy but gotta give a shoutout to the honey toast here; definitely a fan favorite.Tip: look at the menu posted on the wall as some of it is not mentioned in the menu; if you have a big group, go early to get a table in before your patrons fully arrive to grub; and be sure to check out some of the bottled stuff aside from the house sake and beer as they have some tasty items chillin' in the backEnjoy!!BEWARE!Ichiza was shut down by the South Nevada Health Department on June 30, 2014, for the fourth time in four years.  That is unacceptable.  They were tagged with 38 demerits from 10 different violations ranging from handwashing issues to proper temperature for stored foods.  Beware, especially since they are serving uncooked food.  As far as the food and service goes, the okra-natto was interesting, albeit slimy (but it's supposed to be), the sushi was good and the service was good.  But if I had read about their sanitary issues, I wouldn't have gone.  You can Google it, if you want to read for yourself.We resorted here 'cause Raku was way too packed and we didn't have reservations there. We only had a couple hours to eat before rushing off to EDC! It was super busy at night here, but luckily the wait wasn't too bad.The interior reminds me a lot of Kappo Honda back home in OC. We sat at a table and had to take our shoes off, which was nice in a way. My group ordered a bunch of food and all shared, but I can't remember each dish so I'll write about the most memorableKobe beef tataki - A MUST, good fresh meat flavorSashimi - I can't remember which fishes we got, but they were all pretty damn fresh for being in Vegas. It's also pretty damn cheap! I believe it was hamachi, yellowtail, and salmonI also got some grilled stuff, the tongue was pretty good as well as gizzard. The chicken meatballs weren't as good as Torihei in Torrance so you can skip on that.Service was fast and drinks were always refilled. Food came out fast as well so if you're on a time crunch, come here!

It's a Wednesday night and I didn't feel like cooking. What's a hungry guy suppose to do? You guessed it... Go out! I check around to see who's available for some good cheap  eats. A friend of mine gets back to me saying she received a free birthday burger email from Red Robin's. Why not I say. I don't mind being the buy one (thats me) get one free (thats her) person in this deal.We get there around 7:30. The place is huge. Busy? It was normal I guess for a Wednesday night. Workers? Tons. "Table for two please" I tell the young male host. "Just a moment" he replies. He then goes around the half empty restaurant talking to the different servers. He comes back and says "Please have a seat in the waiting area. I will seat you when the next table is available."I might of been a little tipsy from drinking before hand... But seriously... "When the next table is available?" I might not have the powers like Haley Joel Osment, from Sixth Sense, to see people in the empty tables, but what I can see is about 30 tables which I could be sitting at. So we do what we can do... Wait.About 5 minutes later, we ask the host if we can sit in that empty table next to the nice people who seem to be enjoying their meal. "I'll have to check with the server of that area" says the host.About 8 minutes later... The manager comes out and asks us if we have been helped... Since we're the only people waiting for a table, I assume he's talking to us. "Yes sir. We're waiting for a table. Apparently its standing room only in here tonight." I smirked. "Come with me", he says. We walk across the restaurant and he seats us in a booth. Sweet. We go to the only table in the restaurant where the lamp over the table is out. "I dont mind the mood lighting... But can we sit someplace where I can see my friends face?" I requested. I know... I know... I'm just asking for something to "happen" to my food but i'm pretty much past that point.The nice waitress moves us over a few tables and everything seems to be at peace in the universe now. We crack open the menu's and decided on two good looking burgers. Our order goes in... And we wait.... And wait... And wait...The family next to us, who appeared to be waiting for a long long time, finally tires of the wait and gets up to leave. The manager quickly catches them and asks if he could do anything for them. The father explains that they have been waiting for like 30 mins for their food and their kids are hungry and they are leaving to get food. The manager offers to pick up their tab if they agree to sit and eat. The family leaves. Great... I'm stoked.Eventually... Our food comes out. After a careful inspection, we eat. We pay. We leave. Oh and my burger was alright. I got the A1 Peppercorn burger. The description says "Sizzling, hickory-smoked bacon, melted Pepper-Jack cheese, A.1.® peppercorn spread, crispy onion straws, onions and tomatoes on an onion bun. It's a taste explosion!"I was upset that I couldnt give this place ZERO stars but I guess the burger was good enough for me to give them one star. I also thought it was cool that if you sign up on their website they send you a free burger coupon on your birthday. FYI, I read somewhere that the Peppercorn burger is one of the unhealthiest ones you can order there. Great. It just keeps getting better!To see the yummy burger, check out the pics!IF  you read my last review you know I love this place.I havent been to any of those high-end burger joints like Burger Bar,BLT Burger ,LBS or any of those, I am of meager means.So I remembered I get a FREE Burger from Red Robin just by signing up for the Bday Club online, they email me a coupon for a FREE burger. So I did it. And you can do it under different names & email addresses for more FREE burgers as well.http://apps.fishbowl.com/a/redrobin/eclub/agegate.aspxI decided to order takeout since I also Had 2 coupons my son received from school for FREE shakes-we decided on Raspberry & Strawberry.Then I ordered the NEW Blackened Bayou Burger.Blackened burger topped with roasted red peppers, Angry Onions,® Pepper-Jack cheese, Creole mustard sauce and cabbage-carrot mix on a jalapeño-cornmeal Kaiser roll. Add a splash of Tabasco® for even more spice. $9.59-Not today-FREEAs always the burger was delicious great burger,very spicy and left me wanting another.The  steak fries were crispy and hot with just a tad too much salt just the way I like em.The shakes were fantastic as well with fresh fruit used and super cold ice cream. Raspberry was better than Strawberry.I will eventually try the "other" burger places trying to imitate but as far as I am concerned the bar has been set pretty high here at Red Robin

blah... it was just blaah... ugh - our server was tired and wasn't that attentative... she tried to apologize but she kinda just trailed off... lol. But I guess its okay, but THEN... there came in a white couple and all of a sudden our waitress sprang to life!!Uhhh... okaaaay??At first I thought, great now she'll be attentative... ummmm... no. no she wasn't. I know that the East side of town is racist... ugh, I don't wanna talk about the ASU Bookstore Incident... Good grief!! This chick, I WISH I caught her name... was all smiles and giggles and then came to our table (which was only about 6 feet away) and was all frowns and excuses. It was sickening.She failed to bring us our drinks, she only refiled them once and ignored us twice when we tried to ask for more water... okay the Iced Tea was too much for you... how impossible is water?? We had enough and were ready to walk out on the check when; I guessed she sensed our frustration and brought it to the table early! *harsh sigh* We paid in cash and got about $8 in change... which she brought to us in all ones!! omg, is she for real?? lol, I just laughed when I saw it... and I chose to leave a yelp card instead of any cash!

Review Text :
Looking for a late night sushi place that offers happy hour specials, we were referred to Osaka's in Henderson.Walking into this pretty big and established restaurant, we're given three menus to peruse!  There's seating available at the sushi bar, the tables, and even tatami rooms!  The menus are quite extensive and you have to spend a great deal of time doing the matching game.  One menu offers the happy hour specials, but in order to find out what's in each roll, you have to read through their regular menu.  It takes a good while!  A large selection of rolls and thank goodness for pictures.  They all start to sound the same though and many of them overlap.  They also offer this Buy 10 Get One Free from their special roll menu.    You can also do Shabu Shabu, Sukiyaki, or Yosenabe here if you'd like!  We finally decided on a few things from their happy hour menu, and surprisingly, we didn't end up with much sushi!  777 Roll ($9.95 HH price, $12.95 reg.) - "Shrimp, scallop, miki, tobiko, cream cheese; topped with avocado, albacore and served with garlic and yumyum sauce."  It's a pretty good roll, but fatty as hell because that yumyum sauce is a mayonnaise-based sauce.  You can tell how bad it is for you once you take the first bite!  Deep Fried Tofu ($3.50 HH price, $4.95 reg.) - Also known as Agedashi tofu.  It was a bit tough, not easy to break apart.  I prefer my agedashi a little softer so my spoon can gently cut into it.Tonkatsu ($3.50 HH price) - I'm not a particular big fan of the pork cutlet, but the BF is.  He thought it was pretty good and such a great value that he ordered another!Shishamo ($2.80 HH price, $3.80 reg.) - Grilled smelt fish with smelt eggs - it was okay here.  I've had better.  A bit tough and on the smaller end.Osaka Rice ($4.95 HH price, $6.95 reg.) - "Mixture of sushi rice, crab, masago, yum yum sauce, sesame oil and siracha sauce."  My friend was eating this as she's ordered it before.  It was okay, there wasn't enough taste going on for my preference.  Seafood Salad ($6.95 HH price, $14.95 reg.) - Lots more sunomono in it than I would have preferred.  I usually like my seafood salad to have a more seafood than anything else.If you sit facing the sushi bar, they have a slide show on the computer screens with their different rolls and dishes presented.    Overall, the food here is a bit more expensive than other Japanese restaurants. They are obviously doing okay since this is their second location Late night happy hour is good until 1:45 am!  You can find a 10% coupon on their website too!(Food pics can be found in the business profile!)

Review Text :
I am a fan of pizza. However, I am a bigger fan of eggplant parmesan. When I visit a pizzeria, and an eggplant parmesan hero or eggplant parmesan special is on the menu, forget about the pizza. This has always been the case with Metro Pizza.   A few Sundays ago, after living in Henderson for like ten years, I finally caught Napoli's act. It just so happened that I was up to something different for lunch when quite a few restaurants were closed on Sunday. I thought this is Las Vegas, a City that never sleeps. Anyways, recently I wanted to try Napoli's despite some negative reviews by reputable Yelper's. I was in an adventurous mood. What's the worst that could of happened?    The negative reviews wouldn't pertain to my experience. The majority of those reviews pertain to the pizza and wait time. As soon as I looked at the menu and read eggplant parmesan hero, I was ecstatic. I have been looking for restaurants nearby that make the eggplant parmesan hero, a sandwich that I have fond memories of in New York. I had my choice of over 100 Coke beverages to compliment the eggplant parmesan. Napoli's has the Coke Freestyle machine. I love these machines because they feature my favorite soft drink in the World: strawberry soda. How can I not appreciate a marriage of my favorite soft drink and one of my dearest foods? I paid at the counter, consequently the woman I paid the money to would serve the food and drink on the red and white patterned tablecloth. The eggplant parmesan on toasted bread was out of this World delicious. The French fries weren't bad either. The wait between order and the food was around 15 minutes. I'd wait a far longer amount of time for this.   What is better than an eggplant parmesan hero is eggplant parmesan with spaghetti and garlic bread. What is best is when it only costs $8.99 with a Coke beverage in a large glass. Napoli's is far more than pizza. Up til 3 p.m., on weekdays the lunch specials menu are fantastic. There are so many choices. I have been decided on the eggplant parmesan with spaghetti. The three times that I have delighted in this dish, I have left satisfied and wanting to return. The eggplant parmesan with the mouth watering mozzarella cheese is hot. It's served with the eggplant parmesan on the top of spaghetti. The portion is generous. The wait times ranged between 20 to 25 minutes on the last three visits. While I waited, I enjoyed the uptempo music and Fanta strawberry soda. Most of all I really enjoyed eating the eggplant parmesan with spaghetti and drinking the Strawberry Fanta.   Owing to the fact that I am a lover of eggplant parmesan and can never ever get enough of it, I am a fan of Napoli's. The fact that right now I'm getting hungry thinking about their eggplant parmesan means I  will be returning.If I could give 0 stars I would. Me and coworkers split the same meal today around 3. By 8 we have all been sick. Throwing up, stomachs pains and sweating profusely. I called and spoke with the not so polite manager "Harry" whom stated that there is no way we are sick from his food. Harry said "I know the food I put out, getting sick from food takes at least 24 hours to happen." We did not argue at first just asked for a refund as we obviously did not enjoy our food and felt ill. He said he would not refund us as he knows his food is good and then disconnected the call.Worst food and service I have had at a family owned business. I work in an office near this location and we order food often I will be sure to send a company email advising the over 100 on staff to not eat here, that the food was less than satisfactory and the customer service is horrendous.

Ra. Is BlahAnd the peeps. Give me the creeps. Service? Makes me nervous. The vibe. Just don't jibe. Just not my scene. I'm a picky queen. Don't like the snotties. Acting all haughty.Sake bombers cheap and good. Only reason I would.Go to Ra.Blah Blah Blah.So, after the assplosion, I think I'd better write my review!Sucked as soon as we walked in.  Party of 5.  Approximately 1pm.  Not busy.  2 four-top and one 2-top tables empty, plus the sushi bar.  They said it would be a 20-minute wait for us to get a bigger table.  We suggested just taking a 4-top.  Ended up that the co-owner of my company pushed two tables together and Voila!  We were seated.  Drink order got taken quickly.  Our waitress, Sarah, hated us from moment one.  Got our drinks, placed our orders.  I've never waited so long for sushi!I had the tempura box lunch special, and everyone got a bunch of sushi dishes to taste.  One girl is allergic to gluten, so ordered hers wrapped in soy paper.  It came wrapped in rice.  The waitress also claimed that they don't wrap their sushi in cucumber.  Huh?  I've never been anywhere that DOESN'T wrap in cucumber instead of rice.  Luckily, we took the plate to the sushi chef and he re-did it with the soy paper.  It was a WAY smaller serving than the original.She was great about refilling our drinks, but just wasn't as friendly (meaning not at ALL) as any other server I've ever had.This place sucks ball and I won't be back.Now, Back to the assplosion...Their Viva Las Vegas Roll is always good, but the service always leaves you with a bittersweet taste. We don't plan on going back!!

I called in a phone order for the 2 foot ($11.99 plus tax) cold sub special and was told it would be ready in 10 minutes or less. When I arrived there were no customers inside and no employees in sight. Finally a guy came from the back and said he'd be right with me. Inside was clean, but the veggies and other selections to choose from weren't looking so fresh. Had I walked in and placed the order in person instead of over the phone, I wouldn't have ordered honestly after seeing that. I let the guy know I placed a phone order and gave him my name. He rung me up and gave me the order. They don't have the stamp card here anymore and wouldn't accept the one I had, so keep that in mind of you have a one. The guy was though nice and friendly.Classic Sub #1 - I chose white bread and this sandwich comes with ham, salami, capicolla, pepperoni and provolone cheese. Sounds great right? Well my sandwich looked skimpy for the description of the sandwich. I remember POS tasting much better and getting a bigger portion back in the day. The bread seemed like it might have been from the day before and wasn't so fresh. The lettuce had a nasty "bag mix" taste and the meat and cheese tasted just so-so. I've definitely had better from other sandwich spots.What the hell happened to POS? Hmmm maybe those initials mean something other that Port of Subs these days or at least that's how I feel. I remember when I first moved to Vegas and the sandwich scene was really lacking. POS was a place where you could get a sandwich on bread that was freshly baked and held the sandwich together and the fillings inside the sandwich were plentiful . Subway was a joke compared to POS but for the last few years Subway has nothing to worry about. Very sad for a Nevada based sandwich shop that and such a following and lines out the door at one time. Not the case anymore this POS was dead inside and is hardly noticeable tucked away in the corner of a shopping center that used to thrive at one time and has since changed a lot. I had the 2 foot sub deal and the bread tasted like it was old and not fresh. The veggies looked sad. I had the number 1 sub and it has 4 types of meat and 1 type of cheese on it. This sandwich looked so skinny and where was the 4 types of meat? More like 4 paper thin slices of who knows what meat and stake bread. I'll stick with Jersey Mike's from now on.

This place has really gone down hill in the last year. I cannot say I know why either.They used to be very good.They are not open for lunch which is a bummer in my mind. We like to go out to a big meal at lunch at times reather than dinner. Because, then you have time to let it digest.Anyway, this place is very busy. But, it seems so corprate. The food is getting like Red Lobster where everything tastes the same.I think they really try, but it is just not there.They really want to push alcohol on you, and starters. I know they have to  but, it just seems that they are forced.Steaks were just OK not fantastic! The Potaoes were rock hard. I mean the baked potatoes so hard,even when we took them home and re cooked they were hard.Very strange. Bathrooms are clean, our server seemed very over whelmed as if she could not handle it all.It is not horrible, just not wonderful. They keep putting out coupns and they are good ones as well. I just do not want to go there when there are so many good other places. Sorry, it is off my list of good places to go now days.No shrimp on this Barbie. Strictly Soup & Salad Barbie at Outback in this house. The best part is I can order it online and then bump to Tupac, tweeze stray eyebrows and wait for them to bring it out to my car. Now that's VIP service playa!They have a soup and salad combo deal for $9.99. Plus tax and tip I'm back on the road for just under $15. It also comes with a loaf of that unhealthy, but super fucking good honey wheat bread. The portion of the soup has gotten smaller over the years, but still seems to be the perfect portion to satisfy me. My favorite is the Creamy Onion, but will settle for the Potato if I have to. The salad is my favorite simple dinner salad around. Cherry tomatoes, cucumbers, onions, cheddar cheese, olives and garlicky soft, buttery amazing croutons. Top it all off with their homemade Ranch dressing which I'm convinced drizzled on bubble wrap or a hairy elbow it would still rock my universe. This meal is by no means healthy, but it is my comfort meal that doesn't leave me bloated for days. Especially enjoy it during hoodie season. Beautiful salad porn take one:http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zEOfVGv6DeprEzmFYMFhXA?userid=Sv48jgljDP-CRfXmU8uSgA#yHDt1iDFgHvGdrfwhFYQ6QOnline Ordering.  Only problem is they don't always have the soup you want even though the online system lets you order it. I don't like this. They need to fix this shit. The guys and girls that bring it out to your car are always cool and make sure you have your full order. In return I am nice to them.Yes, 15 bucks is a little steep for a freakin' salad and cup of soup, but it's good for the soul and I don't have to do tons of social interaction to get it thanks to the online ordering and curbside pickup. I can go home and eat it in my Underoos and legwarmers and get my Honey Boo Boo on. #fuckingwinning.What is a veg' doing reviewing Outback, you wonder? well. . .I like to give cred where I see fit. It wasn't my choice of restaurant of course, but my friend Angie gave me that doe-eyed look when I suggested that our dinner spot could be her choice. I will admit that upon arriving I assumed I'd be stuck with an option of salad and....salad. Much to my delight I had some options to choose from and this is what I indulged in:Complimentary bread-Comp bread is just that... you're stuck w/ what you get, but surprisingly it was fluffy and not rock solid when taking a bite and the waitress didn't mind bringing multiple refills to enjoy w/ our entrees. Caesar Salad- Salad was fresh and made perfectly as requested with NO dressing and blue cheese crumbles added on top. No Rules parmesan pasta-I loved this. They have an actual pasta listing where I can ADD meat if I want to or just get the pasta independently. Also, the waitress was good about asking me how "spicy" I want my noodles and made sure I was aware that they use cayenne pepper to add spice which I appreciated knowing.Strawberry Peach Sangria-Light floral notes w/ floating strawberries on top. Delicious to say the least and something refreshing I could sip throughout dinner.Not my first, second, or third choice to eat as a vegetarian, but as far as being accomodating to my diet, I'd say above average.I am an Outback lover.  I hit up an Outback at least once a month, usually for lunch.  Those darn Bloomin' Onions have me addicted!  Even with my love of Outback, it can't save this particular location for me.  This location just stinks!  I went here with a girlfriend to celebrate her birthday.  This location is near her work and where she picked to go.  We went in for lunch during the week.  We walked in and it was almost empty, even though it was 12pm.  The host stand was staffed with a guy that resembled a robot.  He was just on auto-pilot and was there to do his job and nothing more.  He wasn't rude, but he wasn't friendly either. He was just there to collect a paycheck and nothing more.  A smile or a hello would have been nice, that's all I'm saying.We were then seated at a table and waited several minutes before our server acknowledged us, even though there were only 2 other tables in the whole section.  Our server was friendly but ditzy.  He did bring out drinks out shortly after and then took our order.  We didn't see him again until we were half way though the meal. He did bring us out refills at this point, which was nice since we had been out of drinks for almost the whole meal by then.  Again he was super friendly, just an awful server.Now for the food.  We order the new Barrier Reef Trio with the coconut shrimp, crab avocado stack, and ahi tuna and a steak.  The seafood trio is definitely an appetizer, unless you have a small appetite.  Luckily we had also ordered soup and salad as well, otherwise my friend would have starved.  The seafood was pretty good though except the coconut shrimp were about 5 seconds away from being burnt.  The steak I ordered medium rare came out medium well.  Ugh, who even eats medium well steak?  Anyway, the steak was overcooked but my friend had to get back to work and we didn't have the time to send it back.  Since I was just going to eat it, I asked the other server (since I couldn't find ours) and the food runner if they could grab some blue cheese dressing (sounds weird but it goes so well with steak!).  They kept telling me ok, but no blue cheese ever came out.  I gave up and just ate the steak because of the lack of time.  I had also ordered the garlic mashed potatoes.  Even these were wrong.  They were so full of lumpy, half cooked potatoes.  I love potatoes, but not undercooked ones.I am really not a complainer, but this whole experience was just bad.  I still love Outback, but I won't come back to this location, unless I absolutely have too.  So you can see the food was ugh, the service was blah, and the overall experience was just mediocre at best.  You have been warned about this location!There are a lot of negative reviews for this location. I personally didn't expect anything above average eating here, but the experience was actually pleasant. Inside there was a lot of customers. We only waited maybe 2 minutes for a table which was nice considering how busy it was. Our server came over and took our drink order right away. She soon returned with our drinks and some of that delicious free bread. There's something about that bread that's just so good! Priced at $7.29 hubby and I shared a "Bloomin' Onion" because it's not a visit to Outback without getting one. The bloomin' onion tasted great, I just hoped between the onion and bread that we had room for our meal!I ordered a 6 ounce Filet priced at $20.49 after the addition of a blue cheese crown to the steak. I also for another $1 added a "Wedge Salad" to complete my meal. The wedge salad was awesome and almost a meal itself. The steak came with mashed potatoes that tasted alright, but might have been sitting on the plate for a bit because they weren't very warm. It also came with "Baked Potato Soup" that was pretty good. The steak really surprised me. I didn't expect much, but the steak was cooked to my liking, was tender and had good flavor. The blue cheese crown was too much. I little goes a long way in that department and while I usually like it on my steak, this time they could have scaled back and maybe even used actual chunks of cheese instead of a mixture. I don't know how often I'll visit, but after this surprisingly good experience, I will not hesitate to rule out Outback Steakhouse in the future.

Marc's can be one star or 5 depending on the night.  It is one of my go-to bars so I decided to give it the benefit of 4 stars. Don't get me wrong I love this place. How can you go wrong with Karaoke 7 days a week? There is also a seperate side for hip hop music and dancing. They have a stage so that you can have the full rockstar experience though most people don't use it so it is by no means necessary. Drinks are strong and cheap. The seats are comfortable and loungy. The singing....depends on the crowd. The crowd changes a lot night to night despite the high doses of regulars. This tends to really be the downside...some night you get the hard rock cut up metallica t shirt crowd. metallica is ok but not much of a karaoke choice...then again if you are into it all power to you.The restoom on the Karaoke side is Ally McBealled, meaning unisex which is always a fun way to make friends. You can generally mix your crowd with another. Quite the social anamole. Based on friends reactions this place is not for everyone..but if it isn't you are uppity. ahem.If you want to enter the ghetto version of hell on earth then come to this place!  IF you are into (or yourself) ghetto, ratchet, and classless then this is the place for you. If you are into at least a halfway decent crowd then avoid this place like AIDS! The visit to the restrooms will make you feel like you might catch AIDS just from contact with anything in them Nastiest restrooms I have ever seen & I accept the lower standards of bar and club restrooms usually!This place is filled with hot messes, overweight nasty women dressing like they have the bodies of fit models in skirts way too short showing off their unfortunate meat "packages". I'm confident 70% of the patrons have criminal records and 25% have warrants for their arrest. I'm fairly certain that a few dudes were gone on something other than alcohol and/or even a little weed.IF you want crazy men stepping up to you like they would easily snatch you up to rape you if you were alone then here's the place for you.  At times throughout the night I was uncomfortable with my own safety given the men walking around. Guess I'm not use to the ghetto...this place immediately gave me flashbacks of the gutters of Memphis, TN that I had to escape from.The ONLY thing I could give this place is that the DJ played hot songs BUT unfortunately he had a thing for being stuck in the 80's as he scratched the songs way too much which at times disrupted the song and dancing altogether.  The women were messes except for a few and the men could've easily been mistaken for ex-cons or gangstas. I didn't try the food and one other thing, without any forewarning I had to find out that the place had a $15 minimum when using your card....outstanding! This place is definitely the conference hall for the ghetto, crazy, hood, and ex-cons!

I am not one to complain about my food but my clam pasta dish was so salty when the waitress asked me how everything was I had to say something. She was very nice and offered me another dish but I declined. Then the owner came over and seemed pissed I complained about the food and then when she asked my wife why she did not want to take her calamari home she told her it was kinda bland but not to worry about it she got  even more pissed. Then the owner said "well I brought you a cannolli I hope it is not to salty or bland for you" and walked away. My wife and I where open mouthed, I will never return after being treated like that. If you do NOT want to hear how the food was from the customer then don't ask. I also think the owner was drinking and maybe that's why she was so mean. I run a business of my own and if I ever heard of one of my employees talking to a customer like that I would fire them on the spot.The food is good.The wine is great.The service is meh.The ambiance is thumbs up for being in a shopping center.

Restaurant name  Tofu Hut

Review Text :
In the Bay Area, I noticed a surge of Korean Tofu restaurants popping up.  And those that had been around for awhile, it appeared that they were getting a new surge of customers.  I was damn curious to see what the hype was all about and with a restaurant named "Tofu Hut", I figure it would satisfy my curiosity.  We actually passed another Korean restaurant first, a new one complete with the "Grand Opening" sign up.  I figure we'd try out "Tofu Hut" since it had been in Vegas for awhile and has lasted.  Usually, it's a sign that the business must be doing alright, right?  Wrong.So, my first mistake was assuming that because it had been in Vegas for awhile, it would be decent.  The second mistake I made was not checking Yelp first to see if anyone had anything about this restaurant.  If I had done this first, I would have seen TWO 1 star reviews with no other good reviews to counteract the two.  If I had done this research first, you would not have seen me eating here.Walking in for an early Sunday evening dinner, our party of four chose the cooking table with the plan to cook some serious meat.  Instead, we ordered the Kimchee Beef Tofu Soup ($8.36), two orders of Short Ribs BBQ ($12.59 each), and a Kimchee Pot Stew ($8.95).  If you do want to do the table barbecue, it's a minimum two orders to do that.They brought out a side salad for each person to start and then five banchan (side dishes) to share.  And yes, I said five.  I thought this was a joke - April Fools' Day, haha kind of joke.  No.  I know at some Korean restaurants they give out more banchan to the Koreans, so we even asked for more and they said that's all they had. I thought we were being gypped and looked over at the neighboring table of six Koreans to see if they got more than we did.  No, they did not.  Tofu Hut only gives out five banchan!  Blah!  They were this coleslaw concoction that I have never seen before, cabbage kimchee, fishcake, bean sprouts, and cucumbers.  I'm used to getting 5-10 banchans, you can imagine my shock and disappointment!When the tofu soup and pot stew arrived, the waitress asked if she wanted her to crack a fresh egg in there.  Sure!  As she passed over my hot tofu soup, she knocked over the BF's water glass.  No big deal, she apologized and cleaned it up.  (I was just glad she didn't drop the hot soup too!)  I had my tofu "spicy" and it was more mild.  There wasn't much taste going on here and I was less than impressed.  I did like the hot stone burnt rice that comes out with my tofu soup though.  My friend's pot stew was more soup-like than she cared for as well.  The only thing really good was the Short Ribs.  We ended up ordering another plate because it was pretty good.  Everything else fell below par.  To close out our meal, the check came.  We asked if they had shikhye, which is a this cold beverage that is usually served at the end of the meal.  It's refreshing after a greasy meal and I'm used to getting this automatically after our meal concludes at Korean restaurants.  They told us they did not have this.  Oh my goodness.  Five banchans and no shikhye?!  Final bill: $70 including tip and tax.This restaurant is sparse.  Lots of Koreans eating here, but perhaps I just have higher expectations and Tofu Hut doesn't cut it.My GOAL here, is to have you start drooling all-the-way to the front door entrance to this Korean BBQ joint.  You'll be crazy not to just go for it all & do the all-you-can-eat menu!All-you-can-eat @ $13.99 11pm-5am & $16.99 10am-11pmThis place is located near China Town on Spring Mountain. From the outside it looked dull and unattractive for customers just to walk in for the first time. So this place seems like it's making it by word of mouth (yelp!)Hmm.., sit down, get your glass of water, order the type of meats you want to cook on the built-in grill on counter top table, then....-Get a bowl of some bomb *** Asian salad (simply just shredded lettuce and flavorful Asian infused dressing)-Kimchee (just for kicks)-Olive oil w/salt & pepper dipping sauce (fancy huh?)-Pickled radish mini slices of cucumbers "daikon" (sweet taste)-Fish bread roti like mini pieces (I don't think it was fish bread, but that's what I remember hearing)-Ask for peanut sauce & special hot sauce they can provide... (we asked the server what the peanut sauce was called, & she just handed it to us, smiled, & nod her head yes, lol)For 4 people, we ordered:1 plate of brisket thin slices, 1 plate of ribeye thick slices, 2 slices of thick cut bacon (belly fat), & 1 plate of short ribs, (we order a bit more after thehehe)I also recommend the steam eggs, just cause you can mix it up w/ your bowl of rice like the taste of fried rice ;DNow that's a mouth full!!!On the other hand, service needs to improve please... Otherwise I would have given this place a 5 star rating...Because many known yelpers liked Mr. Tofu, we try to go there tonight. Sadly, it wad closed. We decided to try out Tofu Hut since we have never had their food before.  Seeing that it has 3.5 stars, I thought it should be ok. The furniture was old and raggety looking, especially the torn up cushion on the chairs, but nevertheless, I should try the food.The menu needed some wiping done since it was covered with sauce.  Ewww.Anyways, we decided on the beef seafood sundubu and a plate of kalbi.  When the older lady waitress came back to take our order, she was so impatient and short.  We wanted to understand their spicy level so we asked if the spicy level is Korean spicy, she said it's not that spicy.  So we continue to ask her at what level she would order it and she said she don't know since she doesn't eat spicy.  WTF!?!  Her ill-mannerism and major bad attitude continued and I wanted to leave right there and then but my friend wanted to try out the food at least.  Ahhhhh!!!When we paid the bill, she walked by and hurriedly grab the receipt.  I was pissed that my friend tipped her because truthfully, she did not deserve a penny for the crappy service she gave.Food was sub-par, nothing special.  I will never ever come back to this crappy place with this crappy ajumma waitress.I'm at tofu hut on a weekly basis and i'm surprised i havent gotten sick of this place!!! My BF & I mostly go during happy hour (after 10pm) and our orders usually consist of : brisket, regular pork belly, ribeye and marinated pork belly. My top fave is not included during happy hr and u have to pay extra (Short ribs). I noticed a decline in their marinated pork belly. I noticed during the last several visits, most of the meat is fat. Brisket comes in different thickness/length with each order, but still tastes the same. (Pls keep it long & thick!...."that's what she said....")..When we first started coming here, we didnt know if what they gave us was brisket or tongue coz it ALWAYS looked so different every time they brought it out....I am a HUGE fan of their salad...so flavorful! i'm not a big salad girl and this is a definite must have every time i eat here..My bf loves their korean pancakes and i am a fan of the japchae. Overall, good banchan.  Our servers are usually the same 2 guys at night and they are both so friendly, attentive and hard workers! This and Sura are my faves for Korean bbq...Honey Pig wasnt bad either!Yeah, I would say "Hut" is a good word to describe this place. It is kind of small for being a Korean Barbeque joint. Here's the deal. When you first come in, the left half of the restaurant is designated for AYCE while the right half is for a la carte. Make sure to sign in so you can have your place in line. Don't forget to include the time you signed in along with the number in your party.I would say you got room for about 48 people total in the whole restaurant. So on really busy days, you just might be waiting a while to sit down.The day I went, we had total of 16 for our party. Surprisingly, we were seated after waiting about 30 minutes. Not bad for a party of our size.So here's the low down if AYCE is your option.- You need a minimum of two people to pick this option so if you are going solo, then a la carte is your only option.- $16.99 per person any time. $13.99 from 10 pm to 2 am.- No to go or take home. (Duh!)- Don't be afraid to ask for refills on any of your sides because there is no extra charge.- You must eat all the meat that you order or you will be charged extra.As for the meats, I was pleasantly surprised, especially the marinated items like brisket, ribeye, and pork. The sides were good as well from the kimchi all the way to the salad, which is very solid. The salad itself I can eat all day.Service was fast and furious, which would of made Paul Walker proud (may he Rest In Peace) for our party was eating like there was no tomorrow. I was impressed because not only did they keep up with our demands, but all our waters were constantly refilled. So TH, I will definitely mention you if anybody asks about ACYE Korean Barbeque.Yelp 2014 365 Review Challenge #5If you are look for a good place to eat at Vegas and it is after 10:00PM this is the place to go. You would want to come with an empty stomach since this place is a All You Can Eat Korean BBQ. I dare you to come out of this place not smelling like Korean BBQ. So if you plan to go to a party after you might wanna bring a change of clothes. If this is your first time trying Korean BBQ let me tell you that the smell will linger on your clothes and hair. This is an AYCE location starting at 10:00pm-2:00am and it only cost $18-20 depending on the tipping amount. This is a great deal since NYC prices are outrageous of this type of food. Along with the Korean BBQ meat that you order it comes with Banchan. Banchan are small tradition Korean side dishes such as kimchee, bean sprout, fish cake, pancake etc. If these dishes run out you can always ask for more. I am used to my basket of fresh lettuce but instead they served chop lettuce with some dressing. This is a complete shock to me, maybe the basket of fresh lettuce is a NYC thing. The basket of fresh lettuce here is served like a salad with a fresh sesame dressing. I will recommend  this brisket, marinated pork belly and sliced sliced rib-eye. I will stay away from the squid because it comes really elastic when it is cooked. The marinated pork belly was my favorite because it comes with so much favor. Keep in mind that this place does not change the Korean BBQ grill. Since the pork belly is marinated the grill turns black quicker and they will not replace it until you finish the dinner. The restaurant is split into two parts. When you walk in the left side is for Korean BBQ quest. They have 6 tables that can seat 4 people each and 3 long table that can hold at least 8 individuals. The right side are for guest who do not want to eat Korean BBQ but just want Korean food. The only reason this place lost a star is because of service and the wait. I came at 10:03pm and had to wait for an hour to get seated. The service is slow and they seem like zombies. When the table before us finish eating it took 10 minutes to clean the table and when the table was clean the waitress did not call us until another 10 minutes has passed. So the turn around rate for the table is around 20 minutes because they lack the help. Since only two people are working it takes a lot longer for wait and the meat to come out. If they hired more help this place would have earn five stars. Hint: When you walk in place your name, time you came in and number in your party on that sheet of paper near the door. This place get pack after 10:15pm!Since my last review, I've been here a couple times. I'm going to knock them down a star. This is mainly due to the quality of the food.Many people like to come here because the all you can eat barbecue is the cheapest in town. It's 15.99 and it includes short rib and steamed egg. But recently, the food quality has gone down drastically.First, let's talk about the kalbi, or marinated short ribs. The beef was average quality. And, it was way too soft. It lacked any sort of chew, which means it was marinated too long. The spicy pork bbq was really disappointing as well. It had been overly marinated as well and we had been cooking it for a while, but it seemed like it was never done.The ribeye was acceptable, and so were the pork belly slices, but really, is it that hard to mess it up? All your doing is slicing. What seems to be the issue is the marinades here.The banchan is very disappointing here. The only highlight is the stir fried fish cakes, but it was average. The pancake and japchae are so bland here. The kimchi does not taste good. The only highlight was the salad.. just what I wanted to eat at an AYCE bbq (sarcasm).The bean paste soup is so bland and flavorless, and the once good steamed egg tasted like an overly salted, watery mess.The food, I'll give it 2 stars, but the price, I'll give it 4. The service here is good and fast. I would go here if my friends wanted to go, but on my own accord, I probably wouldn't be taking any out of towners here, no matter what the price was.I really hate to do this, because this once was my "Go-to" spot for KBBQ.. it has the best late night price in Vegas for $13.99, and even there regular all day price for $16.99.. I mean really you cannot beat that price!! But why 1 star?! Why am I updating my raving review about them?! Why am I probably never going to return to my once favorite KBBQ spot?! why you ask.. lemme tell you, it's because a little critter called a COCKROACH crawled its way across our chair we were seated at, and made it's way up against the glass window.. while we were still eating!!Had to get the attention of the servers that we had an unwelcome guest trying to join us.. and he quickly grabbed two menus to scoop up the critter to have it removed, and tossed it outside.. but I'm sorry my friend, where there is one seen.. there are always more to be found. There is NEVER just ONE COCKROACH.. and this one that was trying to join us was not full grown.. so somewhere are its mommy and daddy COCKROACH and siblings roaming around. The server apologized.. and we could see the rest of the servers quietly talking about it among themselves at the register. To EXTREME disappointment, no management came to approach us to apologize for the incident that totally ruined our meal and appetite.. I was even about to order another round of brisket, but after that.. I could barely swallow what I was already chewing.. My bf's dad, who works in hand with the health department and the USDA, was NOT HAPPY.. he asked to speak to the manager after they gave us the check.. which nothing was compensated for the horrific experience, and the server he was speaking to was playing dumb like she didn't understand what he was asking.. so he calmly said, "Well, when you do speak to your manager, please let him know everything was really good. The food all tasted great and was good up until the COCKROACH." To make this story even better.. is that this was my first time having dinner with my boyfriend's parents, it was their first time eating here at Tofu Hut, and it was their first time having KBBQ grill style, oh and it was me that recommended the place :/ I was SOOOOOO embarrassed because I had explained the concept of the restaurant and raved about how good it was, and the parents were even saying on the car ride there that they were excited to have AYCE meats.. My boyfriend's dad was really upset and super disappointed that no type of management came out to apologize and talk to us, there was no sense of urgency, sincerity in the apology, or showing that there would be some kind of action taken. I originally gave this place 4 stars because I really did love eating here.. DID is key word. I had taken off 1 star for the decor being run down and old and menus being sticky, and the bathroom being nasty.. but after this experience yesterday on 10/07/15... that's something you never forget, and it really does make you sick to see COCKROACH running around while you're eating. And something needs to be done. And to physically see a cockroach run around with my own eyes, while I'm eating in a restaurant is something I would never wish on anyone to experience. I literally almost threw up right there. So to end this review.. I'm sadden.. and disgusted to say that I will never be returning to Tofu Hut, no matter how good the meat is. It honestly saddens me to give this review and rating, but it's one thing to bitch and complain about terrible tasting food, or shitty service while dining.. but to be accompanied by a COCKROACH while eating raw meat that is being brought out to you is one a whole other kinda level. Oh, and my boyfriend's dad today did make a call to the Health Department.

We came here for the first time last night. We like Mimi's but, had never been to this location. Nice parking lot and clean restrooms.We were seated by a very fun girl who was speaking French with my girlfriend. Don't get her started,hehee.Anyway we got a nice booth in the back. Our server was very attentive.The funny thing was he told us his name was Chance and when the Manager was checking on everyone to see if they were good ,he called him Zach. Plus the check said Zach. Oh well everyone should have fun at work I think.Anyway, our food was good, we got the Fried Zuchcinni. Which is always good at all the locations we have ever tried.  It is very lightly Breaded and comes with really good Marinara sause.I got the Pot Roast, my Gilrfriend the Salmon. Both were very good, just wxtremly saltly. We were so thristy even into the next day. Food was good, just too much salt for seasoning. Service was good. We will go back for sure.a lot of tacky decora lot of average wait helpa lot of messiness in the bathrooma lot a lot of very average foodand...a lot of old peopleThis did not start out well.  I showed up for breakfast only to find I had to cool my heels in the parking lot until they opened at 7.  And they actually opened at 7:04.  And even then they really were not ready to serve customers.  I got my coffee fairly quick, then my orange juice, then my bread (muffin) and finally about 7:30 my breakfast entree.  The waitress even apologized for the excessive wait time.The food itself was ok.  I had chicken fried steak, scrambled eggs, fruit and a muffin.  The muffin was applesauce something and was really good and huge.  The gravy was sort of thin.  None of the flavors stood out.  Being a little more expensive than some other breakfast spots I expected more taste.  That and being late/slow cost it a half star and in this case I chose to round down.

Review Text :
"CRAWFISH" is a new addition to Pho Kim Long, and that's what brought me here in the first place.  They only started offering this shellfish in June, weekends only.My luck that the Sunday I choose to come in, they weren't offering it. We still sat down for dinner and this is what we got: * Hu Tieu Hoac Mi Bo Kho (Beef Stew Egg Noodle) - $7.95: The Big F enjoyed his noodle soup.  I was too busy with my plate to eat much of his.* Dau Dua Xao XO Sauce (Stir fried String Beans with XO Sauce) - $9.95: Tasty string beans, a bit on the pricey side though.  A nice spice kick as well.* Com Ga Hai Nam (Hai Nam Style Chicken with Seasoned Rice) $8.50: I've always liked Hainamese chicken since my friend's mom made it for me, along with the seasoned rice.  It's good here, but definitely not as good as my friend's mom's version.Pho Kim Long II is a huge restaurant with lots of big tables for large parties.  A great place for families to eat and friends to gather after a late night.  Their menu is pretty extensive so there's plenty of choices for everyone.  And portions seem pretty decent-sized too.  (I wish they would get a bigger fish tank though because there are way too many fish in that tiny thing up front!)From this experience, I give it a FOUR stars.I love Hot N Juicy Crawfish up the road, and I definitely believe in some healthy competition.  So, last Friday we decided to finally check out their crawfish and see if it's worthy.We decided to start off with two pounds and see where we went for there.     We noticed a neighboring table with their order of crawfish and was definitely excited.  It came in a large bowl with red potatoes, corn on the cob and sausage.  They also brought extra bowls for the shells and a plate for us to eat on.  The Big F requested limes, salt and pepper to make a dipping concoction.I dove right in and noticed the big difference...the crawfish was not fresh.  It was old or way overcooked.  The tail meat didn't come off the shell easily and was broken up.  I thought it was just the first one and continued eating.  Unfortunately, this wasn't the case.  There was little to no head juice either, which was very disappointing to me.  The Big F was easily disgusted with the crawfish and we were glad that we only ordered two pounds to start.  (We usually go for two pounds each!)  The corn, potatoes, and sausage were good though, but it didn't make up for the bad crawfish.  Since it comes in a bowl, there's no sauce on the bottom for you to dip your crawfish in after you shell it.  No bibs were provided, which explains all the stains on my shirt.When I'm craving crawfish, I'll drive up the road and spring the extra cash over at Hot N Juicy.For this experience, I give it a TWO stars.Overall, a four stars for their Vietnamese food, and a two stars for their bad crawfish.  I'm giving Pho Kim Long II a THREE star.(Pics are posted!)This being Vegas, and if you've had too much to drink, you might think this place is equivalent to one of those post cards they hand out on the strip with a sexy girl on it wearing a skimpy outfit, with her phone number (696-9696) ready for you to call her for a "date". After all, with a name like Pho Kim Long, you might think this is the Las Vegas Chinatown equivalent to the Chicken Ranch. You might also forget that you have already slurped on the savory dishes here. Pho Kim Long is a popular Vietnamese restaurant in the heart of Chinatown. It is very large, and at lunch there are at least 10 people working here, doing a brisk business. The food is solid but not spectacular. The menu is very extensive, the ambiance clean, upscale and modern, and the service is very good. Prices are a little more than you are used to in California's Viet hot spots. They do have a lounge adjacent to it now, which I haven't tried yet. Maybe it is a Viet Cafe or classic Viet men's lounge? It might be closer to the sound of the name sake, Pho Kim Long, at least in some parton's minds.I've always heard from numerous people say that this place was the best place for pho. On a Friday night me and a group of girls decided to come after clubbin at TAO, after dropping the drunkies back off at the hotel we headed to Pho Kim Long! We didn't get here till around 4:30am and to my surprise this place was pretty packed, but they still had a couple of tables open. Parking around this place looked pretty decent.The pho was pretty good and is always good when you're still drunk or if you have a hangover! The rice plates here are also pretty good! Prices are comparable to that of the prices we have in SF for pho. The service was good, all the waiters were super nice! Overall the pho was good, but I've had better before.Note: Ask one of the waiters to call a cab for you if you didn't drive here, because you cannot flag down taxis on the street. They will not stop because they can't pick people up off the streets, or you can wait for a taxi to enter the parking lot.Just saying the name brings a smile to my face.Eating the food makes me just as happy. So before the fucking long (see what I did there) road trip home, we wanted something different.  So we decided on a meal off the strip.  Heading over to the Chinatown area of Vegas will give you a whole different Vegas experience, especially if you go during the day. If you've never ventured off the strip for any reason, Pho Kim Long would be just as good a reason as let's say a strip club.You'll get just about the same level of satisfaction.You want authentic vietnamese food and friendly service at a reasonable price.  Pho tai, spring rolls, fried egg rolls, strong iced coffee ... they got it all.You know you wanna come here just so you can say ... Pho Kim LongPHO!?...... FoSho!What an amazing basin of goodness! Yes! That was my first impression of their Pho Dac Biet (#13 in the menu) a delicious bowl of thinly sliced rare beef, green onions, basil, bean sprouts, fresh basil, jalapeno slices and rice noodles swimming in this AMAZING broth! A dash of Sriracha, Hoisin sauce and a squeeze of lime slivers and you got yourself a bowl of Pho that is simply hard to forget! In an armada of buffets and pretentious eateries in "Viva Las Vegas" it is refreshing to find places like this! The best part is...They are open "almost" all the time! ( please see hours of operation )The place is nice, roomy and clean, the servers are attentive and does their job well. There is plenty of parking as it is located in some sort of a strip mall but don't let the location fool you as this place serves some really well prepared dishes. Try their freshly made spring rolls while waiting for your order, it makes my mouth water just writing this review about it!All in all, I have no complaints, I highly recommend Pho Kim Long especially after a hard night of partying in the city that never sleep! Enjoy!Okay... Vegas may not be San Jose or LA's Little Saigon when it comes to Vietnamese food. However, with that being said, this joint really isn't too shabby either.Pho Kim Long (that name will never cease to get a chuckle out of me) is the go-to late night spot to get your drunk grub on. I've been here way too many times for my own good, as my state of sobriety while eating here is usually (although not always!) questionable. Regardless, the food is solid and the locals seem to love it.When I came to Vegas this past June for EDC (yep, as in the Electronic Daisy Carnival 2012 ---- suuuuch a crazy experience, btw), company preferred ordering family style dishes like shaking beef, ong choy, pork spare ribs etc. Everything was quite tasty and portions were ample, but I got the impression that this place catered more to American tastes. The dishes, while yummy in my tummy, were more like something you might find in a mainstream Chinese restaurant than authentic Viet food. Still, no real complaints as it was delicious nevertheless.During my last trip over Halloween weekend, though, I ordered more "true" Viet fare like seafood noodle soup and Bun Bo Hue. I was surprised that the taste and quality were above average. Definitely better than Tung Kee Noodlehouse and probably better than a good portion of pho spots back home! I can see why the locals took me here so often because if *I* was local, I'd probably become a regular too.However, here's the issue:NOT being a local, I'm on vacation. And should be eating Vegas-y thangs. Elsewhere. Thangs that are NOT pho. Since I can get plenty of it. Authentic, at that. At home.So...... basically......Eat it if you're a local, eat if you're drunk and broke, eat it if you want Viet food while in Vegas. Heck, I'd do the same. If none of these things apply, though? And you have a choice to eat something else? I would. Because dammit, it's called a vacation. Feed me fancy things. Because that's what I want. Hence.... 3 stars.Out of all the pho places in Vegas, I actually really like the rare steak and the brisket in the pho.  Doesn't have much fat, the pieces are very clean.  I gotta give them credit.  Some other restaurants serve really bad pieces of meat that are almost inedible or have too much fat on them.  Why 2 stars?  Restaurants owners, please don't ask your staff to ask customers to leave once they get their check so other people can have the table.  This has happened a couple of times to me on Spring Mountain, I think it's pretty insane and pretty darn disrespectful.I'm from LA and have been thoroughly spoiled by tasty cheap Asian food, especially Vietnamese food. Pho Kim Long is okay but definitely not worth making a visit during my trip.The wait was pretty long since early in the morning. We were seated after almost 20 minutes and ordered a bowl of pho and a bo loc lac. The portions were pretty small for the price on both.The pho was too salty and there was a lot of broth with a small amount of noodle. I have had a lot of better pho elsewhere. The bo loc lac actually tasted really good but it was pretty expensive for the small portion.The service was actually pretty good for a Vietnamese restaurant.This used to be the go-to spot every time after an eventful night of clubbing and drinking. They're open 24/7 which is why they're popular. They are on the snooty side because they know they get more business than the surrounding Pho restaurants. That means the customer service sucks and they don't really care if they get your business or not. Plus, they stopped serving tripe. Enough said.Wooooooweee.. Pho Kim Long has quickly become one of my most frequently visited places during a Vegas trip.Why is that?Convenience? CheckAsian food? CheckGood Asian food? Check24-hour good Asian food? DING WE HAVE A WINNER!That's right folks. 24 hours of Vietnamese goodness. What better way to ease that hang over or cure that headache with a hearty bowl of food and a side of crispy spring rolls. I usually order my Pho Tai (rare beef Pho) or the beef or pork vermicelli/rice plates.Reasonable prices paired with good and quick service, you've had me at Pho!Lots of parking in the plaza lot, just make sure you drive into the correct one. Everything starts blending together if you are still feeling the night before.I guess after the rapid growth of business, Pho Kim Long starts having some issue on their QC and customer service. Last time me and my girl went there, we found a cock roach in the soup and told the server about it. And guess what? He came check out the bug body and then took it away. Then he claimed that it was just some pepper they used to make soup and left a check then walked away. I can't believe this is how they treat their customer.Unbelievable. This place is a joke! The employees and manager are beyond ridiculous. Here is the story. My mother and I had gone right now and had ordered some food and one of the many foods we ordered was Chicken Pad Thai. When our dish came out and we ate couple chopstick full & looked at this so called "chicken" that was thinly sliced, chewy and what seemed and look like fat attached was simply "pork". Like any customers would, we called over our waiter, he took it back unsure as well than ANOTHER waiter aggressively came back with the dish and claimed it was chicken. We argued about this for several mins & because we didn't want to make a bigger scene we told him to take the dish back. NOW, this next part gets better. As we continue to eat our rest of the food, the waiter and his other employees gather around near by we were sitting and have the nerves to talk about our situation and laugh about it. So, as a customer I was furious. Asked for the manager to let him be aware of his employees behavior. Of course -_- manager isn't any better with his behavior so possibly that's why his employees aren't any better either -_- so anyways, manager comes to our table, not making any eye contact with me and fights for his employees (which is understandable defending his employees). Finally got an apology and ended the conversation. This gets even better, once the check arrives, we were charged for Chicken Pad Thai (in most case in other restaurants, the dish is taken off the check) so we only paid for what we only ate and with that kind of a crappy service, we didn't leave tip. As we were leaving, the manager came out to our car and told us we didn't pay enough. This is how the conversation went:Manager: "you didn't pay enough!"Me: "no, we paid for what we ate."Manager: "shut up!"So at this point, I was beyond furious and got out of our car and went up to him and he had the nerve to say he didn't tell me to shut up. So now I'm apparently gone crazy and hearing things -_- then he aggressively argues with me that I didn't pay enough, so I had to RE-EXPLAIN to him that we ONLY paid for what we actually ate and not what was taken back (since we didn't eat it!). This is where he failed miserably as a manager...not only did he verbally fight back, tell me to shut up, but he had his biggest nerves to tell me my service was unwanted there and for me to "go to hell". Uhm, are you serious right now?! How in the world can a restaurant manager say all that to a customer?????!!!!!! My mind was so blown away. Un-freaking-believe-able! For sure NEVER going back there and it is such a disappointment cause I been going there for many years now. I seriously think they are so full of it!     This doesn't even deserve a (1) star but I have to give something to leave a review...FML -_-Pho Kim Long is the perfect last meal before you endure that five-hour ride back to Arizona.  And why not?  Food is always light and fresh!After indulging yourself for days in The Entertainment Capital of the World, give your kidney  and wallet a rest and come here for some cheap good eats.  I like their egg roll bun with a side of spring rolls.  Nothing like a light vermicelli dish with all my favorite vegetables and some fried fatty egg rolls to soak up all the boozing and food from Sin City.  The prices are reasonable and service is fast.  I don't normally want something hot for the car ride home since it makes me sleepy so bun is the way to go for me.  Maybe one day I'll try their pho.Anyways, Pho Kim Long is 24/7 so it's a perfect for all the clubrats and the hungover boozers.  Chances are, if it's after midnight and you're there, you're probably a clubrat or a barfly yourself.  We're all just one big family here.I don't like being negative, but I don't mind telling the truth. The most mediocre Pho I've ever had. And some of the crappiest service around...unless you're asian. I absolutely dislike saying this, but it was so clearly apparent. Our waiter was a jerk! In the entire restaurant, there was only our table and one other table that wasn't asian. Both tables were neglected and weren't even given chopsticks. Come on!!! White people can't use chopsticks? Our waiter also forgot my sister in laws noodles and two beverages. How do you just forget an order that you wrote down? And my Beef Pho wasn't very flavorful and the beef was nearly inedible. It was so fatty and chewy. But, it was inexpensive. $7-something and came with add-ins. Like jalapeños, basil and mung beans. There's also house made sauces and spicy pepper sauces like Sriracha. And I guess you need to go stupid early, because A) Parking is a Nightmare and B) there's a 6 p.m. dinner rush which means you will be smushed in the doorway with a bunch of grumpy people for an hour. It's also open 24 hours and located within Las Vegas's China Town. All in all...I'm not recommending this place if you want good Pho or if you're not asian? I totally don't understand the reviews. Because apparently the clueless white folks are getting the crappy scraps or something.You would think that a place like this would be the Mecca of late night grubbing in Chinatown, but sadly this place really isn't that good. The food quality isn't really the best, and the whole experience was just subpar.The people working there, from the hostess to the waiter, were surly and gave attitude when seating us and taking our order. It wasn't really that busy inside because I think everything is a little slower in Vegas during this time of the year (people going back home from their vacations, the school year starting, etc.). I feel like at any dining establishment, the staff should at least try and be a little friendly... That's not the case here.Anyway, onto the food. My friend and I ordered their crab rangoons, shrimp udon dish, and their shrimp fried rice.When the crab rangoons came to our table, my initial thought was "WHAT ARE THOSE?!" because they didn't look like the conventional flower-shaped rangoons we are all (mostly) familiar with. They looked like they were made in a rush, but at least they retained the cheesy crab flavored filling. Fried to a golden-brown, these are a good appetizer to start off with.The shrimp udon dish was basically filler (loads of green onions and bean sprouts) and a few sizeable shrimp. The noodles, which should be the main part of the dish, were lacking. The presentation wasn't too appealing, either. It literally looked like it was stirred and thrown onto the plate to go out to our table...The shrimp fried rice was probably the only thing we really enjoyed out of everything we ordered. The shrimp seemed to be smaller in this dish compared to the shrimp in the udon, and even with the smaller sized shrimp, it was still sparing. The Sriracha sauce is the perfect thing to drizzle on top of the fried rice, I can't get enough of the unique spiciness it offers!Anyway, if we're talking about food quality and presentation, then Pho Kim Long is in the same league as any average Asian take-out place... which isn't saying much. Pho Kim Long misses the mark on so many things: friendly staff, decent food, presentation of said food, cleanliness, etc. Overall, I did not have an enjoyable experience. I think that maybe it's alright if you're on the hot mess express at 3 AM and want something to eat in the late hours of the night/early morning, but even that is a BIG maybe for me... Save your appetite for something better.24 hours? Check. Fast service? Check. Delicious? Check.When I'm looking for pho in Vegas, there aren't too many requirements that I have. There is plenty of seating so you will get seated right away. The food literally comes out within minutes of your order. If you're not in the mood for pho, their menu is pretty diverse so you can pretty much order any Vietnamese dish. I got the pho dac biet (special combination tender beef noodle soup) and it did not disappoint. The portion size is pretty good and there's plenty of meat in the bowl. The broth is on point and you cannot go wrong ordering a bowl of pho here.

I don't want to share, I'm selfish by nature. Not proud of the fact but a character flaw that has been working out for me so far. So, why do I share? I can't help myself and it is so good, I do believe I could be meddling with my karma by not mentioning this little know fact....The Farm House is serving dinner. Yep, you got it. Dinner. One night a week, Friday to be exact from 5pm-8pm and yes, you can order beer or wine. Mother of God, it is nirvana and this is not due to the fact that I live in Chandler and have eaten everywhere else! Dinner items are meatloaf with mashed potatoes, ham steak w/scalloped potatoes, chicken and biscuits...OUTRAGEOUS! There is more, I just couldn't memorize the whole menu. Now, I'm not a down home cookin' kinda girl. In fact, I would tell you that down home cookin' is just an excuse for not trying hard enough. Well, take me behind the wood shed and beat me silly, this down home cookin' is amazing. I have never ordered anything with biscuits as part of a main entree and again, after the severe beating with a fence post I deserve, the chicken and biscuits is luscious, buttery, chickeny gravy goodness that curls up on your fork and and caresses your tongue till you can love it no more and are forced to chew! The wait staff is courteous, swift to keep your water glass filled, helpful with the menu, have tried all the entrees and to kick things off will offer you a dinner roll before your entree. Yes, its a single roll and dumbo (me) rolled her eyes, I'm a slow learner and said no. Well, the rocket scientists I went to dinner with had the sense to say. "Hell Yes" and the dinner roll from heaven with wings arrived on its own cake plate with a pat of butter. Don't be an idiot, get the roll. Learn from my stupidity. Enjoy your Friday in Gilbert, do not take my table and tell no one, it will be our secret.I have wanted to try The Farmhouse for months now, and finally that day came. My oldest daughter said lets go get breakfast I'm hungry, so I took that and ran with it and off to Farmhouse we went!  It was about 9am on Sunday and we got right in, lucky us!Right off the bat I ordered some coffee and it arrived at the table quickly.  And that's about all that did. Yes it was busy for a Sunday, but we sat for a good ten minutes before anyone took our order, but I had seen a couple that was seated well before us who hadn't order yet either. By then my coffee was gone and I saw a server walk by with a pot and I asked for some more.  But never did anyone come by to see if I needed more.  When it was time to place our order I went with the #10, bacon, potato, green onion, sour cream & cheese omelet that came with home fries & whole grain wheat French bread toast (fancy words for wheat toast). But I do have to say, the toast was delish, the bread was so good! I love fresh baked bread.  When the omelet came I was looking for the sour cream, I didn't realize it was inside the thing haha.  I know this might shock some of you on what I'm about to say, but with the omelet having potatoes inside & it coming with home fries; it just was too much potatoes.   The restaurant was steady, service was very slow to nonexistent, gave up on having my water cup refilled or even my coffee. I wanted to love Farmhouse, I waited so long to try them out, but I left unwowed.Another place so overrated that I wonder what kind of taste people must have to rate these so highly. I understand that food is generally subjective, but not so much that you can't differentiate between bad and horrible. I'll help you, this place is bad. The service is so poor I don't know how I didn't eat my paper napkin. It was so slow that I almost walked out. The food is what you'd cook at home if you weren't lazy, but you are so you come here. And pay a hefty price for your laziness. Guilty as charged. Except your food is better because you get it when you want it, not when they remember to put your order in. The waitress didn't write my order down (next time I'm insisting!) and it came out crazy late and without something I'd added. Grrr.By the time I'd finished eating I knew that I'd never be back. And I won't.

RUN AWAY!  The food is disgustingly un-fresh. Their pizza tastes like it was removed from a can and baked in an oven spattered with old vomit.  Upon further inspection beneath the cheese of my tomato covered pancake I noticed all the ingredients were in fact canned water-logged pieces of grossness from the 1960'sdominoes is better, save a Buck an get a red Barron from the grocery store. Do not eat here!!!You have been warned.I love this place. My first time here. I will be back. What a nice experience it was. I came in to get a to go order. I have always heard such good things about the food here. So I wanted to try it. But, being short on time I wanted to get it to go.I was greeted right away by a nice guy, who showed me the menu and told me a little about the Pizzas.I ordered a Meat Pizza, I think it was called the Skinny, as well as a half a spinach Salad and a Tiramasu Cake. (Just a Slice) HeeheI sat and waited ,he said about 20min. He and another girl asked me if I would like something to drink while I waited. I declined ,but very nice of them to ask.I was working on some paperwork,and the time flew by.Everything was packaged up nicely. The Pizza was piping hot when I home. The Salad was nice and cold ,and the cake even had a side of fresh whipped cream!This place is a winner in my book and we will be coming back for sure.When we did have dinner at home ,it was all excellent. We even had leftovers for the next night.  Everything I ever heard about the Pizza is so true. EXCELLENT!The dining room was clean and there was a nice warm atmosphere here as well.

Review Text :
I don't get it. Yes it is a chain and not a "mom and pop" eatery, and no it is not a 5 star restaurant, but holy hell some of the reviews here are brutal and incredibly unjustified. Yet, some of the highly rated trendy breakfast spots I've found to be complete garbage. More is not necessarily better. The "huevos rancheros" I received at one of the highly rated local breakfast spots was reminiscent of large amount of vomit on a plate. But, I digress. I will limit my review to their breakfast service and food. The wait is never insanely long, and there are plenty of seats available inside of the restaurant while you wait. The entire staff is always very friendly and accommodating. We have tried their pancake breakfast and various omelets. The portions and quality are more than fair for the price that you pay. Our server has always been extremely attentive and friendly. I also enjoy their Pomosa, which is a spin off of traditional Mimosas. Instead of Orange Juice you get, you guessed it, Pomegranate Juice and champagne. Mimi's is a great choice for a reasonably priced, quality breakfast.When I think if Mimi's, I think of muffins. Mimi's Cafe is another one of our national chain restaurants.  I've been to several locations since its a known place.  They bake some amazing fresh muffins that are offered with breakfasts or separately.  Usually my visits are during the morning hours so a muffin is always accompanied.  Yes I rave about them but the main breakfast is just average.  Their omelette isn't anything over the top or memorable.  The filling inside is usually dim.  The breakfast potatoes are few and over salted.  I would suggest only getting coffee and a muffin for your morning meal here. Service here has been pretty good.  They have been attentive and friendly.  My coffee was always refilled without me asking.   It's not the best of places but it will do.

Restaurant name  Chompie's Deli
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
With limited Jewish Deli options to choose from in the Valley, Chompie's  is at the top of my list when I'm craving matzah ball soup, potato latkes, bagels, black and white cookies, or quality sandwiches served with plenty of pickles!  I've ordered bagels in bulk from Chompie's before but until this past weekend, I'd never taken advantage of their catering options.I'm typically a planner, but this year, the Jewish holidays came around way too quickly, and I found myself scrambling at the last minute to feed approximately 20 guests at a break-fast on Saturday evening.  I went to  the Chompie's website and found their catering menus for the holidays...  I called and ordered a sampler platter for ten (this came with egg salad, tuna salad, white fish salad, tomatoes, onions, cucumbers, cream cheese (veggie and regular), a small fruit plate, and a  chocolate babka...  All of this was conveniently ready for me to pick up Saturday at 1pm per my request.  I added to the order last minute , just to make sure I had enough food,  and the folks at Chompie's were fine with that.  They even helped me carry everything out to my car.  Turns out, we had way too much food; portions are huge!  But everyone left our house with full bellies and many with leftovers for the week.  I'm actually kind of bummed that I'm traveling this week as Jared will get to enjoy the leftovers without me...  Needless to say, I won't hesitate to use Chompie's for catering again in the future!Incredibly odd layout to this place.  I needed a few minutes and a rosetta stone to figure out why there needs to be segregated dining.  Still a mystery.  The food is pretty good.  I echo the overall sentiment about the authenticity.  But they've done a decent job of melding the Upper East Side with the Southwest. One thing they should have left on Manhattan is that NYC attitude.  Because customer service matters in the rest of the world.Had this place bookmarked after watching Adam Richman eat a dozen sliders on Man vs Food.  Since I was in the area I decided to stop by for lunch.  The place was packed and I had to wait a few minutes to be seated. While I was waiting I browsed the Bakery side of the joint.  I didn't realize it was a Bakery & a Deli.The Bakery had a ton of awesome looking Desserts....I almost scrapped lunch in favor of a Dessert or two, ha!  But my name was called and I went to be seated.The food menu is pretty large and I had a tough time selecting a dish.  I asked my server for her opinion and she suggested trying the Sliders and making a combo with the Original Jewish Sliders (Mini Challah Rolls, Brisket, Potato Pancakes, Jack Cheese, Brown Gravy) and the Western Sliders (Mini Challah Rolls, BBQ Brisket, Cheddar Cheese, Onion Strings).....there would be 3 Sliders of my choice and Fries for $11.99.  I decided to go for it and ordered the combo with 1 Original Jewish Slider and 2 BBQ Beef Sliders.After a short wait my food came out.  I couldn't wait to dive into it.  I went for the Jewish Slider first.  I've never had anything like this before.....it was dripping with Gravy.  Took one bite and could taste the Gravy, Potato Pancake, and Jack Cheese immediately....then I could taste the Brisket, which was very moist.  It was pretty good, but I'm not a big fan of Gravy unless it's Thanksgiving.Next I went for the BBQ Brisket Sliders......they were very tasty.  The proportion of BBQ Sauce and Onion Strings were just right to give it that Sweet & Tangy flavor.  Of the two types of Sliders I prefer the BBQ Sliders over the Jewish Sliders.  The Fries were Breaded Wedge Cut Fries and were awesome......crispy on the outside and moist & soft on the inside.  The spices on the Fries were very good too.Overall, it was a good meal.  My server was very friendly and checked up on me often to make sure I was satisfied with my meal.  She offered to replace the Jewish Slider if I didn't like it.  I told her that it was good and then she suggested Pumpkin Creme Brulee for Dessert.  I wasn't planning on Dessert, but couldn't resist and said yes.  It came out and the portion was pretty big.....there was no way I could finish it but I gave it a good shot and ate 1/2 of it.  It was very flavorful and gave my meal a nice Holiday Touch.I enjoyed my meal here and got my money's worth.Will I return?  You bet.....I might actually give that 12 Slider Challenge a shot if I'm in the mood.***********Little Known Secret About Chompie's Rye Bread*********+++++++At their Deli Counter they charge a $1 more than Fry's+++++++FACT............Chompie's sells their Rye Bread to Fry's for resale.FACT............half loaf at  Chompie's $3.99FACT............half loaf at Fry's $2.99Their prices have exceeded the level of acceptability.Our Deli of choice is Miracle Mile ....... Great Quality ..... at Fair Prices.      **********We no longer eat at any of Chomie's 3 locations**********I am annoyed. Let me be clear, I've purchased dozens of bagels from this Chompies and they're always good. Big, fluffy with a little exterior crunch. The ordering process is simple and quick and the price is low.Yet, I am annoyed. I came in this late morning for a breakfast sammich. I ordered an everything bagel, toasted with a fried egg and sausage. I don't get down with the cheese. I get my sammich home and open it up and am immediately annoyed. Hence, why I'm annoyed. I will attach a photo, but allow me to describe. The bagel is burnt on the inside edges, like Black. The egg is overcooked, not hot and runny like it should be. And the sausage is literally the size of a silver dollar. It BARELY covers half the bagel. I mean, come on. I ate most of it, but it was dry, with no salt or pepper or any seasoning beside the bagel itself. The sausage tasted like nothing. So annoying. I will continue to buy bagels from Chompies, but I will never order anything else. And some old lady cut me in line after hovering over my shoulder for five minutes. Back off lady! Grrr.The year: 2010.  The episode: "Phoenix."The Man: Adam Richman, himself.The Challenge: Chompie's "The Ultimate Slider Challenge."...12 Original Jewish Sliders: each one brisket-filled and gravy-drizzled, stacked as well with mini potato pancakes, Jack cheese, and onion strings.  Knock this 5-pound nemesis on its ass within 30 short minutes, and you rule the stoop, my friend!  Myself, I don't entertain delusions: I'm weak.  I didn't even consider the Challenge.  Instead, I ordered the Combo.  And after tearing through an incredibly tasty two, alongside a cup of Matzo Ball soup, I was full.  Adam, however, he Manned-up!  Sadly, though, after a hard-fought battle, he--as many have before him--ultimately threw in the towel. The Challenge, it seemed, proved too hefty.  Food had won....However, if one, brave soul decides to accept this heaping challenge ($39.95) and conquers this plattered beast, it's free.  But not only that: upon winning, you will be forever immortalized on Chompie's "Hall of Fame" website (http://chompies.com/wall-of-fame/) and an "Ultimate Slider Challenge" T-shirt awaits you and your bragging self!! You bad!!  (By the way, there's no California representation on that website, zero, none, not one, nada...  Who'll step up?This having been my first time to Chompie's, I was truly impressed!  A Yelp check-in offer allowed for a free bagel from their awesome deli/bakery; our very cool server, Trudy, brought out a few, free cookie samples for this first-timer; and our just-as-cool host made lunch suggestions, which we ordered verbatim.  As promised, those Sliders were "deli-icious."  And the Matzo Ball and Chicken soup hit the spot.  But I couldn't leave...not yet.  As full as I was, I couldn't head back to CA without first trying the carrot cake, could I?  I mean, you don't blame me, right?So, "Man vs Food"...  That takes care of Phoenix: Alice Cooper'stown (http://www.yelp.com/biz/alice-cooperstown-phoenix?hrid=esDZwjuGZQlkpKrZAC_guQ), Los Reyes de la Torta (http://www.yelp.com/biz/los-reyes-de-la-torta-phoenix-2?hrid=nJiqRCfTtxs2bIoFrPdmkA), and now Chompie's.  On deck, LA.=]I came here with a group of guys from my Men's Group. We decided to meet here at 6am. Wow. Really early for me. Anyways, as I assumed nobody was here except for my friends. I thought it was a big dining area and they had a big back room that we were able to sit in. Our waiter was really good and got our drink orders as we sat down. I ordered the Corned Beef Hash Skillet. It was layered with home fries, corned beef hash, cheddar cheese, and scrambled eggs. It came with your choice of bread and I chose the English Muffin. Huge portion. It was pretty good. Thought the hash was good. Very filling. I could barely finished it but somehow managed. Service was really good. I didn't expect anything else since we were the only tables that early in the morning.So at 6am there was good service, food was okay but they do serve breakfast all day which is good. I'll be back but have to try their pancakes and French toast. This will tell me if they have good breakfast or not. Enjoy. I did.

Restaurant name  Macayo's Mexican Kitchen
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Working my way through my Phoenix trip, my next dinner out was to meet yet another "old" friend from high school. This one, I hadn't seen in almost 21 years and thanks to FB we got reconnected. MacAyo's is another local Mexican chain restaurant. This location is the newest probably open about 8 or 9 years now. Long ago, the location on Central Avenue was all the rage, but like any chain, sometimes growth does not necessarily equate to great.My friend and I shared a cheese crisp. I like the one here better than the one at Garcia's. I also had a shredded beef taco and black beans and rice. The taco had much better flavor than Garcia's and the beans were good. We each had a house margarita and I only drank half. Not because I was getting sauced, but because it was kind of nasty. All in all decent, but not blow me away good. Might come back but there are several other great Mexican food restaurants in the Valley that I will have to visit next time. Sadly with mom living in Sun City West, the schlep to get to some of these places is a bit too great.The waiter again was nice and accommodating. My friend and I had such a great time getting reconnected we also closed down this restaurant and then sat in front chatting till around midnight. This became the second night I did the tip toe walk through my mom's house hoping not to wake anyone up...I cannot lie. I am in love with their pork enchiladas, but that's pretty much where I draw the line. I think their decor is obnoxious, and the salsa sucks, even though for some godawful reason it was voted best in Phx for 2008... I do not agree, I also think their uniforms are possibly the ugliest I have ever seen. I'm not sure you could pay me enough to wear those bright ass parrot themed button ups. Although the food is decent this place has never been my first choice for Mexican cuisine.. I only came here because the Garcia's across the street was closed down, which upset me to no end because their bean dip is fucking amazing, well was... stupid economy. I had a margarita, and an hour later still have a decent buzz so cheers to the bartender.. The portions are big enough for two dudes, so I always have leftovers.. their service is suffice, but about as boring as this review is. I am now in a food coma, from the food baby they served me. Time for a nap.Meh.There was 9 of us in our group. We went here after our weekly Thursday meeting, Normally we go (when we go) for Mexican food to another restaurant but we all wanted a different Mexican food establishment this time around. If you have read my reviews about Mexican food restaurants I always start with how the salsa tasted to me and then go from there. The salsa was a combo of other places hot and mild chunky salsa so it was OK but the chips were served hot and added that "little" extra that marked their salsa & chips right there with some of the best.Now to the food: My dish was the Fajitas de Macayo. A flavorful treat of steak Fajitas grilled to perfection on top of  a bed of grilled onions and green chiles. Served with sour cream, guacamole, shredded cheese, Pico de Gallo, and refried beans. I asked our server (waitress who's name  I didn't  get) if I could get a side of grilled vegetables instead of the  refried beans. She said no problem so I substituted the  refried beans for a side if grilled vegetables. I expected I would be getting grilled onions, and the other grilled vegetable that came with the meal but instead got grilled zucchini, squash, broccoli and some other grilled veggies. But it was all good just not what I expected.My wife got a como plate of Shredded Beef Enchilada &  a Shredded Beef Taco served with refried beans  she really liked the Taco and next time wouldn't get the Shredded Beef Enchilada. all in all she liked what she picked out.FOOD: Everyone in our party liked what they ordered. AMBIANCE/ DECORE: typical modern Mexican restaurant décor .clean interior. SERVICE: Outstanding. Especially considering every had something different . they provided excellent customer service.  CONCLUSION: Very filling meals. This restaurant is spotless. The prices are excellent. What else do you want from a Mexican food restaurant. I'm sure we will be back RETURN FACTOR: 100% ******************* What does my OVERALL rating mean? ********************5 stars -Highly recommended.  I would be willing to drive out of my way to this business. It is that good. This place represents their industry or cuisine very well! 4 stars - Highly Recommended. I would frequent this business. 3 stars - Not that good but not that bad. Just average. I wouldn't mind going again. 2 stars - I would not recommend this establishment to friends or family. 1 stars - DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND DO NOT patronize this business. I would RUN AWAY from this place and you should too! DON'T WAST YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY AT THIS ESTABLISH .-An acceptable chain restaurant to take "out-of-town" visitors for (overpriced) sit down Mexican food with tacky decor.-Expensive! Almost $11 bucks for a carne asada burrito???? Really?? For that price, I could had bought like 2 or 3 burritos at any "...Berto's" type place in the Valley!-Refried beans are bland and thick like drywall putty.-$1.98 for a small side of guac OR sour cream with your meal.-Salsa not as good as it used to be...tastes like chunky watered down tomato soup with added preservatives (mostly ala sodium benzoate) . You'll be consuming a tin of altoids afterwards from "salsa breath".-Loud background music. I shouldn't have to talk super loud over the blaring music, was I in a nightclub or restaurant?-Service was ok. Servers seem to scowl when you request MORE chips & salsa.-Parking is plentiful.-Separate entrance in the back for take-out.

Restaurant name  Carrabba's Italian Grill

Review Text :
So much hating on Carrabbas - I don't get it ! I guess I should start with the fact that I don't come here for "Italian" food (or what I consider Italian anyways). The pastas are disappointing - they are clearly processed chain garbage. I'm all about the wood grill plates! This place gets major points in my book for all the degrees of customization offered. Small or large sized? 4 choices of salad? 3 choices of side!? I'm in heaven. The chicken bryan (grilled chicken topped with goat cheese & sundried tomatoes in a lemon garlic butter sauce) is a MUST for me ! Their caesar salad is awesome, but honestly all 4 of their salad offerings are great. I love that you can choose veggies, potatoes, OR any pasta as a side. Last night's veggie was a delicious sauteed spinach with beautiful fresh cloves of garlic. YUM.So yeah, I wouldn't pit this against any actual Italian places in town - but for grilled chicken dressed up and done right it's my staple!Great service and delicious meal!This location of Carrabba's provides a great dining experience for all.  We were greeted and seated immediately.  Our waiter was over in a flash.  He was over the top attentive for our entire meal.  He had many many wonderful suggestions and opinions which helped us choose our meals.  He brought out the complimentary bread with oil and vinegar for dipping.  I chose the Mahi Wulfe. This was a wonderful seafood dish.  The mahi was lightly breaded topped with artichokes, sun-dried tomatoes and lemon butter sauce.  The combination of ingredients gave this fish a great flavor and would definitely order again.  This also had the mashed potatoes on the side which were good but nothing too exciting.  With the entrees, you can choose soup or salad.  I went with the caesar salad.  This had just enough dressing with a perfect blend of cheese and croutons.  When he asked if I'd like more of the freshly grated parmesan, of course! I can't say no to more cheese.  We truly had a wonderful dinner here.  I'd come back again for sure!

Restaurant name  Shilla Korean BBQ
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
If you wanna go off strip and eat somewhere 'normal' and kinda feel like Korean, this is THE place to go. The food is excellent. OK, you'll smell like a BBQ when you walk out, but the food is great and the panchan is also really good.Whenever we've been it's always been a 99% Korean clientele -- with us being the 1%. Prices are not cheap, but no more than what you would pay in the LA/OC area. Just a thought since I don't particularly like to eat on the strip at the hotels where everything is overpriced and often, not really all that good. Plus, it's the same stuff over and over again. I like variety thank you very much.This 3 star rating is based on what the prices will be after the end of July.  For the current grand opening prices of $15.95 for dinner AYCE sushi or korean bbq and $12.95 for lunch, I would give it 4 stars.  We decided just to opt for the korean bbq by itself.  AYCE Korean BBQ and sushi is available for $5 extra which is a nice option that other restaurants in Vegas do not have.  The Korean BBQ and sushi sections are separated.  This is a good thing, since the Korean BBQ area is HOT! I'm a little sensitive to warm temperatures and with all the grills going, it really seemed like the AC wasn't working properly and the vents over each table weren't working properly.  The decor is a little dated and has an old school feel, which matches the location of this restaurant.The cuts of meat I feel were average and on par with all the other AYCE Korean restaurants.  The galbi, kobe beef belly, boneless short rib (dinner only) were the best cuts of the night.  The pork belly was pretty average.  The barbeque steak (dinner only) was horrible and a waste of stomach space.  It ended up being tough and dry (and no it was not the cooking technique).  Other options available that we didn't get a chance to try are the chicken, marinated pork, bulgogi, brisket, octopus, intestine.  On the AYCE appetizer menu, there's steamed egg, gyoza, crisped rice, mixed tempura, and chap chae.  The ban chan selection was average with kim chee, cucumbers, bean sprouts, and a sweet marinated dried fish.So don't be fooled by the picture of the crystal cooking plate in the pictures, out of the 10 tables that were there, only one lucky table got to use it.  By far it is not the standard.  Most of the cooking plates are these gold colored plates that burn and stick badly compared to the cast iron ones at other locations.  They did change out the plate once for us since I turned it off because it was smoking so badly.  One older asian lady was outraged that she was not given the crystal plate and went up to the staff and complained loudly.  They ushered her back to the table and quieted her....not sure what the response was in regards to one table getting the magical crystal plate.  I did notice the crystal plate didn't smoke and burn like the older gold cooking plates.  So overall, great value for the current grand opening price.  For $25.95 for AYCE korean BBQ and $29.95 for AYCE korean bbq and sushi later....I'd probably pass.Before you come here, lets get the most important thing out of the way.GET YOURSELF THE ROSETTA STONE KOREAN LANGUAGE LEARNING PROGRAM OR BRING SOMEONE THAT SPEAKS KOREAN!Apparently, these guys are trying to be so authentic that they hired Korean staff that hardly speaks any english. I asked for a fork and dude says, "You want spicy pork?" I said yes because I love spicy pork but at the same time I really wanted a fork because I am chopstick challenged. I dont have any patience to use that crap.Anyways, I came here because of their grand opening special of AYCE bbq 12.95 for lunch and 15.95 for dinner. Add 5 dollars more if you want AYCE sushi with that. Come August 1st its going up to 20.95 for lunch and 25.95 for dinner. The 5 dollar sushi AYCE sushi option still applies.Keep in mind that you pick out what you want on the menu and they bring it out to you on plates. It's not like Sura where you get up and get whatever you want and bring it back to your table. We ordered Short Ribs, Brisket, Bulgogi, Pork Belly, and Chicken. The short ribs and Barbequed Steak (which they were out of) are only available for dinner. All that we ordered was really good except for the chicken which was kind of dry. Besides the language barrier as the first major disappointment, im sorry to say that there were more to add to it. One was the parking or should I say lack there of. The parking lot is small and the spaces are narrow. Dont be surprised if your car has a few more dings or dents when you come out to leave. I recommend parking on the street. Next, the grills they have you use are gold colored and are not designed properly. When cooking fatty foods like Pork Belly, there is no place for all the excess oil to drain except the sides of the grill where they can catch fire. Ours did and we had to turn off the fire so they can extinguish the flames. One of the bussers came up and sprayed some kind of all purpose cleaner to put the fire out but it caused it to flare up and almost burn our faces. Im glad I didnt get burned or there would have been a severe lawsuit pending. All they could say was, "Oh, sorry". From that point on, our server would come by and mop up any excess oil off the grill with napkins. Really? I dont ever recall any Korean Bbq joint doing this.I would also like to mention that they have these crystal grills that you can use as well. We were not offered this option and would have turned it down anyway because of my friends that tried it several days ago said it sucked.Some random info: Hours are 11 am to 12 midnight every day. Lunch is from 11 to 3 pm. Dinner is 3 pm to closing (12 midnight). Makes me wonder if you can sneak in right at 2:45 to get charged lunch price and get dinner items. If you try it and it works, let me know. Lol. Also, dont eat here if you are wearing nice clothes or are planning to go to a nice or formal event. The smoke from the barbeque stays in your hair and clothes. I made the mistake of eating at a Korean barbeque restaurant right before going to a graduation ceremony. Everybody was looking around wondering if somebody was barbequeing somewhere close by and ironically thats what people wanted to eat for dinner as soon as the event ended. So in closing, I suggest that if you wanna try this place out, bad service and all, now would be the time because of the promo price. Then, you can decide if its worth any future trips when they charge regular price. For me that's a negative captain.

I play squash racquet's, a sport favored by the east coast "elites" from them Ivy League schools, those snooty Britishers and the Pakistani leisure class:) Why they let me play, I'll never know:)Last evening, we had a little tourney in which a group of us from the Village traveled to the outer reaches of Tempe to play a group from Lifetime Fitness:)It was a jolly good, show, ever so much fun and our Village group gave the Lifetime group a bit of a "Rodgering":)So it was with happy hearts and high spirits that we headed down the street to the post tourney repast at Skip & Jan's...let me start by saying that the Lifetime group picked this place, and it's almost like they knew they were going to lose and wanted to select a venue that would be the grimiest, greasiest, grubbiest, grossest spot to try to eat...they succeeded:)Where to start...I know...the parking lot:)When we arrived, the total Kelly Blue Book value of the 50-60 cars in the parking lot was about $832...we raised that by several orders of magnitude, just by driving in...this parking lot hasn't seen a lot of traffic from the Mercedes/BMW/Lexus/Jaguar crowd (and may never again:)After I safely parked a block or 2 away, I went inside and took in the look and feel of S&J...crappy old wood paneling...tables and chairs from a circa 1955 high school cafeteria...an intriguing mix of flat panel TV's, regular TV's and OTB results screens (yeah, you can bet the ponies here...the sport of Kings, in a slightly less than "regal" atmosphere:)They must have 20-25 pool tables...faded felt...and a whole bunch of people playing pool (and frankly looking like they weren't enjoying themselves...extremely tight and serious expressions on the faces of the people playing and watching...aren't games supposed to be fun? :-)...I suspect there was gambling going on:)The smell in S&J can only be described as "extreme humanity"...the place smelled like it has seen a century's worth of spilled beer, cigarette smoke, BO, vomit, urine, spoiled food and every other aroma that humans create for themselves...remarkable, given the fact that this place can't have been here for more than a few years...how did they do that so quickly? :-)S&J has menus, they have some sort of kitchen, they have Jagermeister on "tap", they have a bunch of beers on tap and they had a buffet (or "boofay" for my friend Ryan C) set up for our group.It was supposed to be a Taco Bar:)S&J provided a table full of taco "fixin's"...the centerpiece of which was the taco meat hot tray...Holy Crap, was that disgusting! :-(They told us it was ground beef, but I know my beef, and I don't think this was it...this was ground "creature"...possibly some sort of unfortunate non-distinct animal which happened to be near the kitchen when duty called.I kid, of course...as far as I know, this was indeed, "beef"...just not very good "beef":(The hot tray holding the "meat" looked like a relief map of the Hawaiian Islands...small mountains of "meat" rising out of the ocean of brown/orange grease that was the real body of the dish:(But, I was starving (a banana for breakfast and nothing else) so I tried to make a taco.I decided to forgo the slotted spoon that everyone was trying to use to fish some meat out of the soupy brine, and use some tongs instead...my idea was to try to squeeze as much grease out of the concoction as possible...I was sort of successful, but in doing so, I probably squeezed any flavor out as well:(I got back to the table and tried a bite...not good...I added several shakes of Cholla and tried another bite...and that was that:(One of my buddies had decided to forgo the mystery meat tacos and ordered wings from the menu and offered me one...I'm not sure what the deal with the wings was, but the wing I tried seemed to be boiled (no, not "broiled"...boiled) and then dipped in buffalo sauce...not crispy, just wet...all the way through:)Then they announced that Karaoke was going to start soon...and that was enough for me:(Adding amateur singing to this tableau would have just been too much:)Still, it's not all bad news...the tires and wheels were still on my car when I was ready to leave...I didn't become immediately ill (although I had kind of a rough morning, this morning).They say shared adversity can make teams grow together, so I think I should thank S&J for making the Village Squash group nearly invincible:)

Review Text :
This place has been on my bookmark list for years ! We finally tried this place Saturday night as a double date with some of Yelp's finest - Lisa L. and Eric R. I will definitely be coming back again in the future - it's by far the best Italian I've had in Henderson. I agree with everyone that says Gaetano's needs to print a Specials menu! The list of 15 specials was so complicated even our waiter couldn't keep it straight. I love that they have specials, but the confusion of listening to soo many and trying to remember them was annoying. We started with beef carpaccio (YUM) and a pretty mediocre bottle of wine. Although I don't blame Gaetano's for the wine - that's my fault for picking the wrong one :)I had a 1/2 order of the chicken ravioli and a caprese salad for my main. The chicken ravioli was really good - definitely seemed homemade. The caprese was pretty awful. The mozzarella was yummy, but the olive oil was bland, there was no balsalmic, and they called it "Caprese con pepperoni" (I guess I'm an idiot for thinking "con pepperoni" implies there is pepperoni in the dish?). They had a huge pile of slimy red peppers in the middle and lots of onions. It was a weird rendition of a Caprese - not one I'd ever order again. My husband on the other hand got one of the best Italian dishes I've had in my life! I had major jealousy that he got to eat such fabulous food while I was picking at my weird Caprese! It was veal stuffed pasta in a cream sauce with proscuitto and peas. It comes with mushrooms but my freakshow of a husband had them leave those out. Seriously this pasta was incredible!!! Even without the mushrooms this pasta was SO GOOD. The veal was so tender and perfectly flavored. Next time I guess we'll just be getting 2 orders of this fabulousness!!A wonderful evening with friends and great food. Service was so-so, but the veal stuffed pasta will have me coming back!! Thank goodness it isn't a special and seems to be on the menu full time.My fault for not making reservations and requesting my friend Nick to be our waiter.  However, nothing is like a night out on the town dressed up with Blair B., her husband Mike B., and Eric R.!  We each brought restaurant.com coupons, and ended up using the $50 off $100 (what a deal!)  The coupon includes alcohol.Mike B. proudly picked the wine with his wine app, so I said we would go with it.  It was okay, but since Blair already said it wasn't her favorite, I will go ahead and agree (I am not much for red wine but did it for my heart, baby!)We started off with complementary bruschetta, bread and olive oil/basalmic, and the wine.  Gaetano himself gave us the specials, and there were like 42 of them.  Our waiter finally reviewed them with us (though a few were sold out) and we were more confused (the menu is already big as it is).  I ended up getting the butternut squash ravioli with sage and brown butter, and magnificent it was!  The beef carpaccio appetizer was also delicious and at least I can say our waters were refilled rapidly.  Eric R. ordered a veal dish as his main and a half order of the special risotto of the day, bay scallop and shiitake.  It was outstanding and I couldn't stop eating it.To top it off, my friend Nick sent over via our waiter complementary "house cappucinos" which were essentially hot bittersweet chocolate with 3ish liqueurs and topped with whipped cream.  Eric R. was skeptical because he hates coffee and when he tried it, he was relieved.  YUM!The food was just so good! Usually I can resist the bread, but their bread was so fresh and chewy that I had to have some! The cioppino was amazing, with Maine lobster, and a generous amount of mussels and clams. They had a good gluten-free pasta for my husband as well, so he got to have pasta too. We will definitely be returning!We had a $40 Groupon for the restaurant and went last Saturday evening.  Our reservation was for 5:15 and we were right on time.  The place was almost empty at the time and we were shown to our table.There is a Yelp check in offer for free bruschetta but you can't double dip on the coupons--either the Yelp or the Groupon--so of course, we went with the Groupon.We were brought iced teas and a bread basket shortly after being seated and ordering.  The bread basket was a let down.  The one piece of lavash was more like pressed cardboard and the two types of focaccia were merely OK.  We did not get butter but rather a mixture of olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  I have to remember in Italian restaurants to tell them to hold the balsamic.  It's just to sweet for me.  Give me plain olive oil and a salt shaker.We ordered fried artichoke for an appetizer.  It was very good.  The dipping sauce was quite good.  There were 6 pieces of artichoke.  For mains, we each ordered ravioli.  I got the Lobster stuffed ravioli with lobster sauce--a house special for the evening.  My wife got the ravioli stuffed with butternut squash.  We both enjoyed our ravioli.  The serving size was just right.For dessert, I ordered a cannoli and my wife got the vanilla crème brulée.  Both were good.  The cannoli was fairly standard but I didn't taste any of the pistachio nuts that were supposed to be in the cream.  The crème brulée was the winner of the two desserts.I think Gaetano's is overpriced.  It only makes sense to go here when you have a coupon of some kind.  Service was good.  It was pointed out when the bill was brought that gratuity had automatically been added because of the Groupon.  I'm not a fan of that.  Actually, the server lost because he got a lesser tip than he would have gotten had I made the decision and not the restaurant.  A good meal but a bit of a drive from Summerlin.  I can get equal or better Italian closer and for a better price.I may not have eaten at too many gourmet Italian restaurants so far, but this one is definitely great.Gaetano's Ristorante is a dinner-only Henderson spot that claims to cook homestyle food with fresh ingredients. It also seems to offer discounts through websites regularly, and I took advantage of the $20 for $40 Groupon today shortly after they opened for service. Fortunately, I had just arrived from work and was dressed reasonably well - otherwise, the tablecloth atmosphere and vest-wearing employees might have made me feel a little uncomfortable.The softly played music, which included some notable Italian tunes, opera songs, and Buble hits, helped me to relax more, as did the dim lighting (which did hinder some of my activities though) and the friendly service by the waiter, the bread server, the water server, and others. The waiter presented just the dinner menu, as I requested, and left me time to think about my options before coming back to rattle off the daily specials (and their ingredients) from memory. I'd been considering various dishes, but seeing the option for the Risotto of the Day on the menu, I inquired about that as well. After hearing his description, I ordered it as well as an appetizer.The complimentary bread basket came out first, along with a bowl of olive oil with vinegar. This alone was enough to win me over because those carbs were so delicious. The long, triangular sesame cracker was crispy but had some body to it, and it also doubled as a second utensil at times later in my meal. The tomato focaccia had a rather moist chew and was delightful. My favorite, however, was the ciabatta. Crunchy on the outside and with a long-lasting chew (that wasn't moist) in the center, this bread served as both appetizer and dessert after I asked for more later in the meal. I could hardly get enough ciabatta, and I'll be hungry for more gluten next time.The beef carpaccio came out next. True to its its flowery Italian name, the "carpaccio con arugula e parmigiano" ($14.95) had a full layer of thinly sliced raw beef tenderloin on the bottom, with a good portion of arugula on top of that and coarsely shaved Parmesan cheese above. It also had a light drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and some pepper flakes (to the server's liking, not necessarily mine). I loved the tender beef and the light bitterness of the arugula, and the cheese was surprisingly plentiful. I could see more of this in my future.Finally, the Risotto of the Day ($28.95) arrived. The server described it, once again, as a risotto with bay scallops, shiitake mushroom, parsley, and truffle oil. It was very rich and creamy, and it would have been piping hot if any steam had actually been able to rise from the plate. Be careful and save your tongues with this one! I don't typically like the bay scallop as compared to the sea scallop, but its meatiness worked well enough here, and the mushroom's contribution was felt throughout. My main issue, albeit a minor one, was that the rather large pieces of parsley required too much manipulation. They should just chop it up and mix it in for you so that you can also avoid getting a huge hit of parsley if you're a bit clumsy with your cutting.I'd already mentioned my Groupon at the start of the meal, so the waiter simply brought pen and paper over at the end of the meal to record my voucher number for input at the register. The check came shortly afterward, with the promotional value having been deducted from the subtotal. They did print a list of suggested gratuity amounts based on the original subtotal, which I much appreciated because that's how I learned it. (For the record, I tipped the 20% from the pre-Groupon price.)After this meal, I'm excited to come back to Gaetano's in the future to try more entrees. Several of the pasta dishes sounded enticing, and I'd originally planned to try the veal chop before I was lured away. This already seems like a great Italian restaurant to me, and hopefully I'll upgrade that positive praise next time.

Ate pizza and played video games at Peter Piper Pizza with my lil bro Saturday afternoon as part of a larger pizza party, and we had a blast. No, the pizza ain't great, kind of tastes like a greasy sponge, but the kids don't notice - and really that's why you're there anyway. I say greasy sponge, but you know I had at least three or four slices. Even bad pizza is good pizza.This location definitely felt a little cleaner than some of the others around the valley.The game selection was decent, though still doesn't compare to an actual arcade - they had Star Wars Trilogy, Area 51, a boxing simulation, air hockey, at least three different sets of racing games that two people can play together, a bunch of the ones where you just drop your token in and that's it (aim for the back of the dump truck, aim for the railroad bridge, etc) - some of which are actually a little addicting. And Skee Ball, of course. God, I don't know what it is that makes Skee Ball so addictive - my lil bro and me, we must have dropped tokens into that game for over an hour. He walked away with hundreds of tickets, which he redeemed for cool stuff - a slinky, and some playing cards. Oh, and vampire teeth. Can't go to Peter Piper Pizza and leave without redeeming your tickets for vampire teeth.

Delicious, hot, affordable and filling! Pro Tip:  Opt for the dinner sized bowl and also buy a to go container too.  Then cram as much stuff as you can in your silver bowl before they cook it.  Then fill half of the to go container with rice and pour all your leftovers into the take out container when you are done eating.  Viola!  Ready made lunch for tomorrow.  :)OK, I really wanted to give this place 4 or 5 stars. Been coming here for years. Affordable and delicious! Especially love the Spicy Hunan Sauce. Always have had a great experience.Today, I went to this location with two of my coworkers. One of them has severe peanut and seafood allergies. The staff was very accomodating at first: They gave her an "Allergy Warning" tag and instructed her which sauces to steer clear of (a previous reviewer mentioned that some of YC's sauces have fish stock in them). Once we got to the grill where your bowl is cooked was where trouble hit. One of the two gentlemen said, in Spanish, "Just cook it on this used one. And play dumb like you don't understand them!" Beyond inappropriate and dangerous! Unfortunately for these clowns, two out of the three "snowflakes" speak Spanish and we called them on it.  They were very cautious after this, but it still left a bad taste in our mouths. Will I come back? Likely, 'cause . . .1) I'm a sucka, 2) LOVE stir fry, and 3) It's close to my house. Bottom line: If you have allergies, WATCH OUT!

Dropped in for breakfast at around 8:45 and the place was empty.  Good for me, bad for them I suppose.  When you walk in the the first thing you are struck by is how unlike the inside is the to the outside.  From the outside Morning Star looks like any old breakfast/lunch shack jammed into an industrial park mainly to cater to the employees of the various surrounding businesses, but the inside actually reminds me of an old time breakfast joint replete with funny old time signs strewn about declaring how wonderful their fresh brewed coffee is.I ordered the Italian omelet with an iced tea.  The first thing to point out is that Morning Star does not accept credit or debit cards.  They do, however, have an ATM conveniently located next to the register.  Luckily I had cash so this wasn't an issue, but I can imagine that first timers who hold up the line during the lunch rush could be on the wrong end of some dirty looks.  The omelet was fantastic, it was absolutely bursting with with tomatoes, marinara sauce, cheese, and Italian spices.  The wheat toast was thick sliced and the bread was made that morning, though not on site.The owners, a married couple, were extremely pleasant to chat with and while I write this I regret not learning their names.Overall I have to say that I'm sold on this place.  If I wasn't moving out of state in the next few weeks this would definitely be my short-drive breakfast place of choice.The owner may claim to be simply 'politically incorrect' however that is a statement that I have heard from many a racist before. Its the same as saying, "I'm not a racist, I just believe in genetic purity." I was unhappy to be at the receiving end of a rant that wandered from how he threw his wife's food out because she'd put salt on it. Which apparently offended him as a chef...or something. In my opinion that is abusive, controlling, misogynist behavior that is reprehensible. It at least points to an inability to communicate and a sharp need to be correct, perhaps a dangerous need.Furthermore, his referencing 'Lousy-anna' referring to Lousiana, the Shreveport area if I remember correct, became tiresome immediately. He called the population of the area he used to live, please forgive me, niggers! His claim that he was referencing the white and black population fell short when he told a story of catching a young black child he caught stealing. He apparently asked the child why he was stealing and was offended that the answer as that "You whites have been stealing from us for years."  I had to leave to get to work, I would have left just as quickly had I not had to be at work 5 minutes later. My only regret was that I had to leave my poor girlfriend there...Sir, if you wish to be a racist (excuse me: Politically Incorrect) you can do it without my dollars lining your pocket. I am sad to no longer have a place on my way to work that I could stop to grab a bite. I am truly discomfited riding my bike past the cafe and seeing that you are still in business. If you like your breakfast with a side of racism and misogyny, eat here. If you are a Russell Pearce, Joe Arpaio, or SB1070 supporter, here is your place. If you feel that people should not be judged, eat somewhere else. Somewhere that doesn't just dress up in bible verse, perhaps somewhere that embraces christian values, not just trite statements everywhere you look.So I have been hearing about Morning Star Café for a while now and since I was in the area I decided to give them a try. I was already prewarned to call my order ahead, which I did,  I have to be honest I really didn't look at a menu, I just asked my besty what her favorite thing was and that's what I tried. What did I try you asked?? Well I ordered the Green Chile Chicken sandwich and it was delsih!  It had chunks of chicken breast, diced green chilies and melted mozzarella cheese, this sandwich was amazing!!! Loved it, the flavors of everything was so fresh, it reminded me of homemade green chili for burritos, but instead severed on a sandwich, which worked, I would have never thought of doing that, but that's because in my house we use tortillas more than bread .I also grabbed a brownie/cookie because it looked too good to pass up, and man was I glad I did! Deliciously sweet! Glad I gave Morning Star a try, I do have to admit I did past the place up when 1st looking for it, didn't know it was in a industrial area, but now that I have found it I will be back more often, and calling in my order ahead worked out perfectly for me too!

Review Text :
I was in the hood and visited for lunch today.... was super impressed.I ordered the special, which was a Japanese hamburger. The beef was tender and delicious. The burger was huge, and had a tasty sauce which made the burger, like, super duper umami. It came with a salad that had a tasty dressing, a bowl of rice, and a small seaweed salad.What a delicious meal!I didn't order sushi, but split an order of monkfish liver (!!!!!!!!!!! a favorite of mine) with the guys I had lunch with, it was sublime and wonderful.Most of their lunch menu items are $9-$11, for the quality and quantity they served, I felt it was a good value. I will def. be back!!I've been trying to shrink my "To-Do"/"Bookmark" list on Yelp.  Shimogamo was on my list for quite some time and I was happy to stop by late last year!  I really wish that I had gone long before.  This is now my favorite place for sushi in the valley and I keep going back and forth between 4 and 5 stars.  Let's see by the end of the review where I'll leave it.Shimogamo sits in a strip mall at the corner of Warner and Dobson Road, just barely inside of the Chandler city limits.  It share a wall and a door in that wall with a popular DimSum restaurant.  I have assumed that the 2 are sister companies because of the door.  Shimogamo is definitely a modern day sushi/Asian establishment with a modern feel to it.  It can appear kind of cold, but I guess when you're dealing with sushi, you need things to be cold.Needless to say, I think that this place is fantastic.  One of the things that I like about Shimogamo is the fact that the quality of the sushi is stellar.  The fish that they use is incredibly fresh.  The sushi that I've tried is unique and creative.  My favorite roll is the Big and Spicy Roll.  It lives up to its name too!  While just spicy enough for me, the smokey oil marinated jalapeno's may be a bit much for others. Since size does matter, this big role is a perfect fit for my appetite!  I love to eat Black Cod cooked in Japanese restaurants....Amazing delicate and flaky.  Seasoned well and simply delicious!  Shimogamo did not disappoint. The service is attentive and professional.  They have a large room in the back from a semi-private dining experience for large groups.The best part about Shimogamo is I spend less money here than I do in other sushi establishments in the valley, but I have had a far better experience with respect to flavor, creativity and freshness!I've decided given the quality of their sushi and the price... this is the best sushi in Phoenix.  If you disagree, send me a compliment with your suggestion.

Authentic Home Style Cooking from El Salvador with a great tasting selection of delicious items to choose from their fantastic menu. Seafood, Meats, Appetizers, Salads, Pupusas and Traditional Entrees as well as Tasty Desserts. They even provide pictures that you can see of each of the dishes on the menu. Nice!Inside is clean and tidy with fun items on the walls that give you the sensation of being in a little tucked away place in El Salvador. The service was very friendly and helpful when I arrived and when it was time to order. I saw some photos on Brother Yelp and showed a few to her and said I want this one and one of your famous Pupusas to test out.Ordered the Churrasco Salvadoreño plate which is Steak, Shrimp, Sausage, Black Beans and Rice, Queso Fresco, Fried Plantain, handmade Tortillas and then some. Had to get a Pupusa and asked her what she recommend. She happily replied Pork, Beans and a Cheese or Revueltas con Chicharrón,Queso y Frijoles as shown on the menu. It comes with a delicious side of spicy cabbage and a very tasty red sauce that you put on top for some extra kick. Hotter sauce also available on the table if you are crazy like me.Everything was packed with flavors and super good. This is not your typical Mexican style food. You must check it out to experience it. In the same complex as Family Dollar store in the deep corner. Yummo!4.5 STARS

Pretty consistent, average sushi and hibachi experience... or in other words, 'eh.'I've been more to the sushi side of the restaurant and sat both at the tables and the sushi bar... I've also done hibachi on several occasions.  The service is just ok.  I kind of consider Benihana to be like the fast food chain version of sushi...I was there over the weekend and had a fly in my water... other than that, the food was fine, but it still ends up being $25 - $35 per person depending on how hungry you are...I'm sure I'll be back when I am craving sushi and don't feel like dealing with a wait or care much about atmosphere.  However, I'm not rushing either...I think it had been a solid 5 months since my last visit to Benihana... and I still stand by my 3 star review.  It was just as I remembered - same waitress and all!  I took my BF's sister for dinner there on a Sunday night.  We each ordered a Benihana salad (I do love that dressing) and a miso soup.  I think they gave us a different kind of soup but we ate it anyways...We shared a Las Vegas roll, a spicy tuna roll, and then each had our own selections of nigiri (I had ikura and she had eel) and handrolls (I had spicy scallop and she had eel).  It was all edible but not spectacular.  I recommend against ordering the Las Vegas roll - it has way too much cream cheese and sauce on it.  Other than that, go to Benihana for a quick sushi dinner that is decent quality and price for sushi but no atmosphere - don't say i didn't warn you!

LIVID.  They need a ZERO STAR rating. I came in and was polite, when they quoted me a 7-10min waiting time I said no problem and sat patiently and had my money in hand intending to leave a little extra as a tip..........I asked for hash browns with green peppers and mushrooms and explained NO ONIONS due to an allergy ::to go:: with a coffee. THEY GAVE ME A BOX FULL OF ONIONS ONLY... NO HASHBROWNS w/ green peppers.  They also gave me a TOGO coffee cup with creamer and sugar filled with cold dark Pepsi... AND A BILL hoping I would pay without checking my order before leaving.  They rushed me to pay and when I stopped to check my order they literally ran screaming ::"Oh no - she's checking her food!"! DISGUSTED.My stomach just growled in pure agony at the idea of slop they packaged as some sick joke on my limited time to head to business... and it's hours later. Treatment like this should not be tolerated and BELIEVE I won't be shy in protecting others from such a unwarranted, spiteful, cruel and unethical experience. I'm keeping the box in the freezer should ANYONE at this establishment take a moment to review the poor experiences mentioned thus far about this particular location on Green Valley.  I've seen ZERO responses to other patrons to date which paints a pretty clear picture as to just how this type of behavior continues.  This is not a personal opinion, a food critique,... This is a HUGE slap in the face to a local with a big heart for supporting her community, but a bigger mouth when it comes to cruelty... Not letting this one rest.The phone has rang approximately 20x for me to call in what happened ... No answer.  They picked up somewhere between ring 20 & 30... informed me the manager was gone for the day, not coming in tomorrow, doesn't have an email and to call back another time. After putting in way too much out of character work I received the contact name of: CHENCHO and hope he will be just as appalled by the behavior as I was/am.

Review Text :
Decent food, I think the jalapeño puffs were the standout item i sampled.  The crab fried rice had huge chunks of crab, but wasn't nearly spicy enough as advertised, so that was a little disappointing.  None of the entrees we ordered stood out (orange chicken, strawberry-kiwi chicken, cashew chicken, or crispy honey shrimp), so i can't claim that this place has amazing food.  What it does have, and that in spades, is atmosphere.  my friends and i thought we were suddenly transported to mexico - i could have been sipping a corona and talking about the day's dive (maybe it was just Shark Week on the tvs) while waiting for our tacos.  Go to the bathroom and the impression only grows stronger.  then you see that they have beer pong on tuesday nights, they actually have a decent selection of beers on tap, and a few other elements that bring you back to the USofA.  Glad to be back.  So about three-ish stars for the food, and a full 5 for being a great place for grownups to go and remember college.  3.50 beers isn't half bad at happy hour, but the rest of the prices weren't amazing.  try the signature drink, though, it's pretty yummy.I had driven past this place for years and was reluctant to enter, but after reading Yelp reviews and seeing the posted photo of the interior (thank you Jason A.) my interest was peaked beyond what could be ignored. I've since been twice and enjoyed it both times. I think the best way to describe this place is that it is a bar that serves Chinese food. The food comes in Chinese take out boxes with plastic forks and styrofoam plates. The bar has limited table seating (unless you're willing to sit outside) and the walls and ceiling are adorned with (among other things) glass beads, starfish, cymbals and Chinese dragons. There's a breathalyzer machine in the corner. Ordinarily, I would not pick Chinese food but after my first visit I longed to come back. Mostly for the atmosphere, but hey! Chop and Wok got me to pick a Chinese place. :) The food is not exceptional but I have never found Chinese food to be exceptional. The variety IS exceptional. More than 10 vegetarian options alone, even more if you are willing to eat shrimp! Jamie has been behind the bar both times I've been there. The very first time he made me feel right at home by asking my name, shaking my hand and introducing himself as the owner. The second time, he generously made amends for a slow kitchen without even being prompted by complaints. The vibe is super chill and is a lot of what I love about Chop and Wok! Last night, some dude started playing guitar at the bar. He had an awesome voice and offered to take requests. When you're feeling low key and hungry, this place is a great solution!Thanks to Christina P for introducing me to Chop and Wok.  I would have never found my way in here otherwise, and I love it!Nice laid back bar for those of you not into the whole typical Scottsdale scene.  You can actually order your food from the bar as well.  There's a large outdoor seating area in between the bar and the restaurant which seems to really be just take-out and delivery unless you enjoy baking in the Arizona heat.  I didn't mind the styrofoam plates or take-out boxes at all since I always need a box anyway.As far as the food, most entrees run $6.50 for a small (pint) and $10 for a large (quart).  You can adjust the heat in your dishes, but even the ones that were ordered spicy were not that spicy.  The food is really good for what it is.  Keep your expectations in check.  The jalapeno puffs were excellent and a nice take on the crab puff.This will most likely be a place I end up at the end of a long day.  The bartender/owner? was friendly, and it's just a comfortable place to be.A dive bar that features Chinese food? Now those aren't two things you hear in the same sentence!  After trying this place I know why! My buddy and I stopped at Chop and Wok on the way to the airport  and ordered the food to go. The NFC championship game was on in the bar and patio area, so this review is a bit late.  We both got the same thing, a chicken and veggie combo on brown rice.I barely had time to eat a couple of bites as we rushed to return the rental car. 2 bites was 2 too many.  My navigator on the other had time for a bit more. Sad part is the chicken tasted like it was still frozen.  If you have ever microwaved one of those prefabbed frozen dinners, that is the level of flavor this dish had, bummer. Had high hopes for this place but all I can say is yuck! I hate to give it 2 stars but that was some bad Chinese food.

Review Text :
Normally, I wouldn't take the time to review a place like Chili's. We all know by now how unoriginal and uninspiring their menu is, and that Chili's is the Denny's of late night grub. Well, having said this, the reason that I'm reviewing Chili's today is to tell you about an interesting thing that happened to my bf and I when we visited this Chili's not too long ago. First, shame on us for resorting to eating here, but it was a cold winter night and we didn't want to venture too far from home. There food is so forgettable that I honestly can't even remember what we had, I just remember that it wasn't that great. I think we had some sort of sliders and maybe some taco's that we took a few bites of and quickly got sick of. The real reason that I am writing however, is to tell about a lame thing that happened to us when we visited (even lamer than the food). My boy and I were cuddling in a booth, his arm was around my shoulder and my hand was on his thigh. We were talking to each other and laughing to ourselves quietly, nothing out of the ordinary if you ask me. We had ordered a dessert and were eating that when all of a sudden the manager of the joint comes up to our booth and says, "How's the dessert, let's keep it a family restaurant". Before we could even respond, he was gone and we just turned to each other with a bewildered look for the next 5 minutes. We couldn't figure out what we had done, and the more we thought about it the madder we got. It's not like we were having sex on the table or touching each other inappropriately in the restaurant. We were simply sitting close to each other cuddling and eating our dessert. We were so mad that we blew out of that joint and left our unfinished dessert on the table. We have never been back and we probably never will since we do not want to eat in a place that reprimands you for cuddling and having a good time. If a family restaurant is anything like Chili's, then I never want to eat in a family restaurant again!  Keep it a family restaurant my ass, there's probably more drug deals that go on there than anywhere in Scottsdale!

Never been to Cuba... probably don't ever wanna go to Cuba... so I don't know why such an intense craving to try Cuban food came over us on a random Friday night; but it did. Enter Havanna Café... the best/most reviewed Cuban place on Yelp in the greater Phoenix area. We went to the Scottsdale location which is nestled in a random little strip mall... if you didn't know any better you'd probably assume it's some no frills neighborhood diner, but how wrong you'd be... just beyond those stucco walls is a nice quaint Cuban restaurant with dozens upon dozens of dishes most people have never even heard of before. We were sat down right next to a live Cuban band... bongo drums and all... they were belting out some pretty groovy tunes. The main singer had a deep scratchy voice and a heavy Cuban accent... and he said 'wooooooooooow' a lot... this combined with the décor of the place really did make it feel like you were really in Cuba, very fun! We decided to order a schmorgisborg of stuff... what follows is a list of what we got along with a brief description:Calypso Chips - Fried Plantains w/ black bean dip... damn good... good chips and salsa alternative. Frituras de Frijoles Negros - Deep fried balls of black beans w/ avocado dip... heavenly.Dátiles con Chorizo - Chorizo stuffed dates wrapped in bacon... very unique flavor.Papa Rellena - Meat stuffed in a ball of fried potatoes in a bed of cream sauce... pretty decent though a bit rich. Tamal Cubano - A Cuban ground corn tamale with pork and other random goodness, it was alright but not quite good enough to specifically recommend.  Potage de Frijoles Negros - A black bean soup... a little too 'beany' if that makes any sense. Made a good dip for the black bean balls though. On top of all that we tried a couple of imported Cuban sodas... both were pretty different, but tasted great. The meal was very fun... flavors were all over the place; if you're a fan of trying new things then this should be high on your list. The Tapas section of the appetizer is quite extensive and you can easily make a fun and varied meal by getting nothing but appetizers. This place is easily recommendable for any of the more adventurous foodies out there; you'll have a lot of fun at this place trying some new things. For us, this place was more of a novelty, to try once just for the experience... but depending on your pallet I could see this place swooping in a stealing a lot of business from other more bland Mexican and ethnic restaurants nearby.  4/5.Yelp Eats Week 2011 (50% off!), Take 4:07/16/11Arrived before a friend did, was seated at a two-top, and I was handed a dinner menu.  Had to ask for the Yelp Eats menu (oddity #1 as all the other restaurants I've visited since the start of it all had hosts/servers deliver them w/ the YE menu on the very top of the pile), and when the host handed it over, I noticed a sticker that asked not to share dishes- oddity #2.  As I waited for Linda to arrive, I ordered a mojito ($7.50) and asked server Ana about certain dishes, and she demonstrated great knowledge of both food and beverage menus (kudos to Ana!).  The wonderful mojito (dark rum, fresh lime, muddled mint, sugar, and a "splash of soda") arrived just as L. arrived, and, having had their mojitos in the past, she also ordered one for herself.  (If you do not come to dine here, you should at least try their mojito... probably the best I've ever tried, besides the ones I've made!  Not very sweet, the rum not overpower, but still a potent cocktail.)  After a little chat, we placed our order (split checks) for the Bistec Encevollado (steak w/ onions, for me) and the Frituras de Frijoles Negros (black bean fritters w/ avocado dip, for her).  Despite my preface of "I'm going to skip on the apps and order an entree, because I want to have dessert later," Ana asked me AT LEAST two times "And what would you like for an appetizer?"  She even pointed to the app portion of the menu the second time, and again I said I was only going to order the entree as I'd wanted to leave room for dessert.  L. was going to start w/ an app first and see if she was going to order more later.  Again, Ana asked what she'd like for an entree, and when Ana left, we already felt like we were being treated rudely and pressured to order more.  (L. eventually ordered another app, and then a dessert.)  App and steak arrived together, and for the record, I offered L. a taste of the wonderful steak, and she turned it down, bec. she tries not to eat too much red meat, but she did try the Papas de la Casa (spicy homestyle potatoes) and found them very salty.  I described the side dish as "highly-seasoned."  Yes, they were very salty, and I hadn't noticed they were spicy, but Mom did when she tried a little bit at home.  L. tried to share her fritters w/ me, but I've already tried them before, and I wanted to concentrate on the steak.  It was a "good" thing that Ana had pressured L. to order a second dish, bec. she actually ended up liking the Frituras de Camarones (three crispy shrimp pancakes served w/ a Romesco sauce).  (Hey!  I was correct when I thought the sauce looked like it was thickened w/ some sort of nuts... friend described it having a flavor she couldn't put a finger on, aside from the pepperiness and acidity... it also contained almonds and sherry.)  I very much enjoyed the Bistec encevollado and would not hesitate to order it again!Ana had asked a couple of times if I was ready to order dessert, but I decided to wait for L. to finish eating.  I was still enjoying my mojito and was even contemplating on having another.  (Actually, I was stalling for time since I couldn't decide whether I was going to order the chocolate bread pudding w/ homemade dark fudge rum sauce, or the lime pie!)  Finally, I decided to order, and I chose the bread pudding and asked L. if she'd get the lime pie, and she said yes.  Score!  While I enjoyed both desserts (I'd had two "tastes" of the pie before I asked for one "to-go"), I favored the pie.  That night, however, I couldn't get enough of the fudge rum sauce!!  I tell ya, I don't know what I WOULDN'T do to have another chance at savoring this fudge sauce again.  ;)  As far as the lime pie is concerned, I don't know how Linda could sit there and watch me take three swipes off of her pie... I think I was only able to restrain myself from having more, bec. I knew I'd have another one to enjoy at home!  Oh yeah, take the bread pudding (but leave the rum sauce!), and I'll have the lime pie every time from now on!We plan on visiting again, esp. on Mojito Mondays ($3 mojitos all day), and we hope that the rudeness was only due to Yelp Eats Week (although there really isn't an excuse for the rudeness!), bec. it would be a shame to have to skip this HC location-- L. said that this location is less noisy than that on Camelback.  I probably should not have tipped 20% off of the original cost of the my bill (original would've been $40.50, plus tax, and w/ the YE discount, a total of $27, w/ tax), since she was so rude to us, but I didn't want her to think that Yelpers were cheapskates.  p.s.  Almost forgot to mention, upon entry to this location, I couldn't help but noticing that the restaurant smelled strongly of body odor!  (Onions.)  If I wasn't meeting a friend here, I might've walked out and gone somewhere else.  p.p.s.  The Cuban bread was terrific!- I must disclosed that this dining was done about a month and a week ago.   As you walk into this place you feel relaxed by the delightful Cuban music playing loud enough to hear in the background. I also love the dimmed lighting, oh soo relaxing!!   We were then pleasantly surprised by a warm greeting along with a big smile by our charismatic host, after the place was fully packed. We didn't even bother making a reservation, since the previous time I had visited this spot  was with my best friend who was actually the one who introduced me to this nice little spot, Special thanks Mr. B, and at that time, It was just about half way full.    So we weren't expecting to be seated right away, but we were, very nice!!. My boyfriend and I were both hungry, as usual, so we right away ordered the black bean fritters as our starting appetizer. We were surely pleased, they were hot and mushy on the inside served with a side of avocado dip, OH soo YUM, we also ordered ourselves the lime mojitos, talk about refreshingly good!!     We later ordered our main dishes, Tim got the Pollo Cubano and I ordered the Chicharones de Pollo, it was all pretty dang delicious!! Very flavorful, and just down right taste buds satisfying!!     We finally topped it off with my favorite, Arroz con Leche!! This on the contrary was just OK, it lacked cinnamon i think, I have made way better arroz con leche myself, If you like I'll share my recipe, but the appetizer and our chicken Cuban plates were bomb!! :)Thank you Havana Cafe for the great service and good food!! :)

Restaurant name  Ristorante Giuseppe

Review Text :
Fantastico! (I don't speak Italian but I'm pretty sure that translates!)I cannot believe it took me so long to make my way to Giuseppe's... I'd heard about it before and driven by that corner of Scottsdale and Thunderbird thousands of times, and little did I know that I was missing out on the cutest, most unpretentious, tiny little restaurant with amazing Italian food ever!  Well, Giuseppe - you've got a new best friend, because I need to make up for all of these years without you!The other yelpers are correct... it is BYOB and no corkage fee.  Although, I have a feeling Giuseppe likes tasting whatever you may happen to bring in :)  I have no problem sharing; especially when I am being served delicious bruschetta, 'Giuseppe's Salad' that contains everything in the kitchen sink except for meat, eggplant parmigiana that melts in your mouth, and pasta cooked al-dente - made to order exactly how you like it!We visited Giuseppe's on a Monday night and the place was packed... I can only imagine what it's like on the weekends.  I assure you, it's worth the wait!  We sampled everything I mentioned above as well as Cioppino, Chicken Parmigiana, Chicken Cacciatore, and homemade tartufa for dessert. Everything was so delicious that we all cleaned our plates... We cleaned them so much that at one point, Giuseppe himself could tell that my brother (who is training for Ironman AZ) and my BF (who just likes to eat) were still hungry, so he brought out an extra plate of yummy perfect pasta with tomato sauce for them.  I've never seen that before!Giuseppe's is open for lunch and dinner daily except for Sunday - I guess everyone deserves one day of rest!  One thing to note is that it's CASH ONLY, so make sure to go to the ATM before you go.  Our dinner was under $25 a person and like I said, we had a ton of food!  I can't wait to go back to visit Giuseppe again soon!We brought the entire family to Giuseppe's last night for a pre-Thanksgiving meal... yes, that's right - my family likes to carb up for all of the eating we do today!  We brought a ton of wine and had a great time.  Franco was our waiter - and I'm guessing since all the ladies at the table had a crush on him, that he is the waiter Sheila B wrote about in her review too.  Nice eye candy!I absolutely love the eggplant rollatini and pretty much order it every visit.  We usually start with a Giuseppe's Salad and finish with a dessert to share.  My favorite is the white chocolate tartufa.Pasquale (pictured above) is the sweetest man and makes the experience extra special every single time.  Since I'm writing this review on Thanksgiving, I want to give thanks to Pasquale and Ristorant Giuseppe for all the good times I've had there and all of the good times to come!  Salud!Adorable Italian family making amazing Italian food.  The owner and his wife and sons are total sweethearts and produce some unsuspectingly great Italian food in a strip mall in North Scottsdale.When I hear the name Giuseppe I picture a little old man in the kitchen making spaghetti and meatballs like his grandmother used to make. So I was surprised when I found out that there isn't anyone named Giuseppe working in the back, though this wasn't the only surprise of the evening. The other little curve ball was a little embarrassing, we were scrambling to scrape together enough money to pay the bill, Ristorante Giuseppe only takes cash. However, this little stumble did not interfere with the food nor the fantastic service and hospitality we received. Ristorante Giuseppe is what a mom and pop independent restaurant is all about. The charismatic father runs the front of the house, the sons are the servers and mom makes all of the desserts. The father Pasquale interacts with everyone, he's so warm and welcoming it was like going to a friends home for dinner. While they do not serve liquor, you're more than welcome to bring your own beer and wine to accompany your dinner and no corkage fee, unbelievable. The menu is filled with classic Italian-American dishes and as well as assorted daily specials. Our server was telling us about the specials and noticed that his eyes were steel blue. I'm not sure how long he was talking to us but as soon as he walked away my trance was broken; I have no idea what he said. I can be such a dork.Once you place your order you're brought out a basket of warm bread with garlic butter, I love little touches like this. Just be careful not to fill up on the fluffy bread, there's so much in store starting with the deliciously simple Eggplant Rollatini ($9.75). Slices of eggplant are lined with cheese, covered in bread crumbs and pan fried, then the roll ups are covered with tomato sauce and cheese. Or if you loved stewed peppers and onions try the Peperonata ($6.95), a great combination of sweet, savory with just a hint of spice. My dining companions filled me in on the nightly specials which ended up being a couple of pasta dishes. The first was the Peppino Special ($15.95), a mix of tube pasta, alfredo and tomato sauces with meatballs, chicken and sausage then covered with cheese and baked. Another was the big brother to the tortellini called Tortelloni ($15.95), a large ring shaped pasta, filled with meat then again covered in sauce, cheese and baked. Do you see the trend here? Baked pasta dishes are so hearty and satisfying; no wonder the other patrons looked so happy. Along side we also had Sausages ($1.95) and Meatballs ($1.95) which were platted as a clever homage to the maleness of the restaurant, with just a little bit of cream sauce on the tip of each sausage, well you get the idea. Desserts were as comforting and homey like the creamy smooth Cheesecake ($3.95) which ended up being one of the best slices of cheesecake I've had in a very long time. Not being a fan of Cannoli ($3.95) Id have to say that they turned me into a believer. Its ricotta filling was so light and airy with just the right amount of chocolate chips and a pastry shell that was crisp without a trace of greasiness. Genuine and honest, Ristorante Giuseppe is a neighborhood gem that I wish was in my neighborhood.Traditional 70's style Italian-American food in a strip mall mainly notable because you can bring your own wine with no corkage fee.  Don't believe the hype - this place is nothing special.Contrary to the many reviews here that comment on how cheap it is, I found it a bit expensive for what you're getting, which is not exactly nuova cucina.  $15.95 for two small (non-homemade) cannelloni a la carte is not a bargain in my book.  Their linguine with white clam sauce is some canned clams tossed with a copious amount of oil (1/2 a cup perhaps) and some boxed pasta for $12.95.  The $9.95 "insalata Romana" is a plate of tired iceberg lettuce, a tomato wedge or two, and a few shreds of bland cheese swimming in a very tart vinaigrette.   This is the kind of food that used to represent Italian food in America before the food revolution of the 80's.  The kind of place you'd find, not in New York or Chicago, but in Terre Haute or Tampa at a time when "eye-talian" food was still considered a bit exotic.The many reviews stating that this is "real homemade Italian food" are a bit puzzling since it's neither homemade nor Italian.  This is very old-fashioned pre-foodie Italian-American food and while it's OK for what it is, it certainly isn't "real Italian" food by any stretch of the imagination nor is it, for the most part, homemade.  N.B. No, a visit to this restaurant is not "just like going to Italy."  For that matter, it's not just like going to Little Italy.  I realize Phoenix is not exactly a mecca for italian food, but WTF people!    The mostly 60+ crowd seems to love it.  I can only guess that they are overwhelmed by nostalgia for a simpler time, because while it may not be Kierland pretentious nor a crappy chain restaurant, the food just isn't very good.  Seriously. The servers have a strange attitude that I guess is supposed to be "east-coast" or something (rushed, cocky, borderline rude) but seems a bit out of place in what is basically a mom and pop strip mall joint serving canned food with plastic red checked tablecloths and thin paper napkins.  In any case, they are very selective with their attention and you can wait quite a while to get something.Also, as several other reviewers have pointed out, they give you a non-itemized bill with just the total due written on it which seems to include an extra 10% or so with no explanation offered.   This seems quite bizarre to me but apparently no one objects.  At this restaurant, $15.95 + $12.95 + $9.95 somehow add up to $45.65.  The non-itemized bill is a weird affectation at best - why would you do that, especially in a cheap joint like this?  But to do that and then mis-calculate?  There's a word for that in Italian - it's imbrogliare. $54 for two with tip for a simple shared salad and two pasta dishes with no meat and no drinks.

Review Text :
Don't go aggro on me, Chain haters! Yeah, I like P.F. Changs. Deal with it in a constructive and mature manner.So I go here last night with my wife and son.  I didn't have to wait, for I called in earlier and got on the list (smart thinkin' bro!).  We all meet up and walk into the joint.  Oh, and exterior decorators... My son LOVED the ginormous horse outside, BTW thx!  We get a table and order.  I can't recall what my wife ordered.  Some sort of garlic shrimp plate with snow peas... It was worth a nom. My dish, however was the full triple nom. Double Pan Fried Noodles. Freaking amazing.  It tasted like the Kung Pao Chicken had rolled around on a bed of noodles so FAST that it cooked them to a delightful crisp and then left its tasty juices behind on its bed. Nom Nom Nom.We also order Crispy Green Beans for my son, but we ended up eating most of them ourselves. Sorry Conor :( but they were too good to pass up!!!! Tempura coated green beans lightly cooked and served with a spicy ranch style dipping sauce.  It was equally delish!Not to mention our waiter was on key that night.  He stopped by a few times and filled our mango ice teas and even bagged us up some extra sauce for the beans. Score!Overall, it was a memorable night with my beautiful fam... good freakin times, yoThis place is where Asian fusion food goes to die a miserable lonely death of un-deliciousness.  Everything that made PF Changs a go to Chinese food spot 15 years ago has completely disappeared.  The food is sub par to say the least and I am positive the business survives on its ever aging senior regulars and young couples with coupons.  I did not make it past my appetizer when I completely gave up on this place.  The "handmade" steamed shrimp dumplings tasted soggy and frozen.  I couldn't even taste the little micro bits of shrimp in the soggy wonton wraps because the dumplings arrived coated in a cold oily black peppercorn sauce.   So.... Ummm ... Mister or miss chef ... What happens when you eat two tablespoons of whole black peppercorns in a sauce???????? I'll tell you, you can't taste anything to else for the next ten hours!!! Extraordinarily poor composition of sauce and plating.  In addition to worst food I've tasted in years, the bar service was even worse.  The bartender made it fairly clear she was "opening"'tomorrow and made cleaning and preparing the bar for the next day her priority over serving guests.  Hopefully she ll be a better server tomorrow. If you have taste buds and care about your waistline, avoid this travesty.

Restaurant name  Romancing the Bean
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
I am immediately suspicious of coffee shops with coffee-related puns in their names. It's almost uniformly a sign of someone who doesn't know shit about coffee and subscribes to the "country kitchen" school of decorating.But Romancing the Bean is on the ground floor of my office building, so let's face facts: There's no avoiding it. I go there almost every day. On coffee alone, the Bean gets 1 star. It's just not good. Unflavored coffees taste burnt and bitter, while the flavored coffees have names like "snickerdoodle" and do, in fact, taste just as sweet as a cookie. Espresso drinks have too many problems to name, the chief of which is that the espresso has the same burnt-and-bitter flavor as the house coffee. And don't get me started on their frothing abilities. But I digress. There's more to the Bean than the coffee, despite what the name implies. Muffins, cookies, croissants, cakes and other treats are all homemade and absolutely delicious -- I recommend the chocolate chip cookies or any of the berry muffins. At lunchtime, the Bean has sit-down table service and a variety of sandwiches, salads, soups and these stuffed croissant things my friend insists on calling Hot Pockets. It's all homemade, including the bread. Eat here a few thousand times like I have and the menu gets a bit dull, but the ingredients are quality and the staff and owners are great.Just stick with water.Never, ever, ever again. Ever. Because even if I think your coffee blows, and even if I only gave you three stars (*gasp*), there's no excuse for talking shit about me -- loudly -- while I am forking over $10 for a sandwich. That's just a poor customer service decision, folks. As business owners, you should know that. And just for clarification, I never wrote that your coffee tastes like shit. But I will now: Your coffee tastes like shit. So, no more $12 chef salads. No more $3 croissants. And definitely no more of your fake-nice bitchiness or dirty looks when I walk by in the morning with my Cartel coffee. I will save my money for an establishment that treats me like a person.PS -- look forward to a severe business decline as soon as the place across the way opens. I'll make sure to smile and wave as I walk by.Are YOU kidding me? This very morning I walked over to this "hidden treasure" as I had found it a few weeks ago.  I saw the fantastic baked goods and couldn't wait to share with my friends... I wouldn't spend a nickel here.Rude Rude Rude.10:20 this morning I was treating myself to breakfast and the little girl behind the counter was sweet.  I spotted the menu and decided to use the table service the girl was bringing me a menu and a muffin; as I'm sitting the owners whipped husband comes to the table and tells me he needs the table for the lunch crowd.  I said and lunch is when?  He says well you have a computer and you may stay for hours and I need this table.. so I proceed to another and that was the wrong table too.  He wants me at a tiny table in the doorway in the sun.  I asked if he was kidding, I had been in the hospitality industry and he was not acting hospitable.The little girl is trying to hand me the plate with the muffin and I'm telling her it is okay please wrap it to go...I'm not wanted here. The queen bitch sitting in the wing back chair with her strap on under her apron in case the husband acts up.. pipes up to tell me that I do not need to buy the muffin - I told her she was absolutely right and walked out.

Review Text :
Found across the nation, this Buffalo Wild Wings location does a good job!We stopped in on a busy night during happy hour.  There was a wait in the dining room but the bar is open seating.  Luckily we found a table with our name on it.  Our waitress was over quickly to get drink orders and take advantage of the HH price.  She was friendly and attentive even with the hectic time.  We decided to share the Tablegating Sampler.  This comes with wings, spinach dip and pretzels & cheese which were all great!  We chose the chipotle BBQ rub for the wings.  They had a great flavor! The spinach dip is served with warmed pita chips.  I absolutely loved the chips.  There were two pretzels which was perfect.  The plate also came with cheddar bacon jalapeño pepper bites.  I didn't really care for the flavor and consistency of these.  I think it would be better with a cream cheese filling than the cheddar.   It was a great visit overall.  It doesn't hurt they are a Red Wings bar for this Michigan girl.  Now I know where to watch the big games with some good food!

Review Text :
Denny's is, well, Dennys.  Standard just-this-side-of-fast-food chain place.  But who can fuck up Bacon and Eggs?  Well, honestly, pretty much anybody can, but I've never had a problem with this Dennys.  They also do a decent lunch menu.  I've been there for dinner, but at places like this, I pretty much stick to the breakfasts and burgers .  It's hard to fuck them up too.  Denny's is the kind of place you go to when a. nobody else is open, b. you don't know any other place, c. you know what to expect.  Kinda like comfort food, but commercialized.I have been by this place many times and finally stopped one day. I had Breakfast on a Saturday morning. My server was Maxwell. He was adorable and very professional.I was happy I had gone in.Food is not the best but, it is very inexpensive, so no complaints here. After such a great experience, I thought I would go back for lunch.Since this time it was a week day Maxwell was not working, so I was given another waiter. He tried, however yelling at me from across the room ,did I need anything else was not professional at all.I know he just did not know any better. Please do not discuss your personal lives at work where all the patrons can hear. It is bad Business.Perhaps Maxwell should be teaching the others how to behave when they are at work. I had gone in for a late lunch so there was only 3 other tables in here. All the more reason not to put your business out on the street.I am sure I will be back. But, I am hoping to get Maxwell or someone similar next time.Bathroom is clean and lots of parking in the lot.The lines at Tacos El Gordo were too long so we decided to just eat at this Denny's. Bad choice. It was New Year's Day but the place was dead. Only one other table of customers besides us. A guy came to our table and took our drink and food order and never returned. We went 35 minutes with no drinks or acknowledgement. The manager had time to clean a window partition yet couldn't find the time to get us our drinks or even just acknowledge us. We were sat in the far corner so I couldn't see the kitchen but the manager seated us and the guy cooking took our order so they knew we were there. Finally I decided we would leave and go to a different location. I walked over to the kitchen to tell the manager we were leaving. She said "oh wait I'll cook your food right now" and I told her to forget it. I mean they were only going to start cooking our food because I said we were leaving. She never once said sorry or showed any type of sympathy to the situation they put us in. She  had no issue with us leaving and could have cared less.

Restaurant name  Liberty Market
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
If you've never been to downtown Gilbert to visit Joe's Real BBQ, Liberty Market is another reason to check it out. Not only are there those 2 destination worthy places to chow, but Hale Centre Theatre which offers live performance theatre for post eating entertainment. The icon for downtown Gilbert is a massive water tower that is just amazing to stand by. I know its just a water tower but the history, being built in 1923, and the scale, 123 feet tall, it's quite a sight to stand underneath. With a 3 million dollar renovation and new park surrounding the tower, it's both modern and well, cool. Here is some good news if you're a fan of Joe's Real BBQ or Joe's Farm Grill; restaurateur Joe Johnston also owns Liberty Market. So you'll know right away that there will be high quality and tasty food at very affordable prices. This is also due to the fact that Chef David Traina and his wife Kiersten are pretty much running the show at Liberty. Both were so helpful that we felt like we were honored guests; as I'm sure most will feel when visiting. Chef David came from behind the open kitchen and greeted us personally. His gorgeous wife Kiersten was so helpful as she had many recommendations from the menu and drink list as we ordered. Its customer service like this that will not only make you a loyal guest, but you'll quickly share this experience with your friends.Built in 1935 the building has been lovingly restored into that retro-American-modern feel that the other restaurants have. On a side note, be sure to check out the bathrooms, there are several in which to chose and each has its own theme. To get things moving along at Liberty you stand in line and place your order at the counter, then they give you a number to place on the table and when your order is ready they bring it out to you. There are quite a few places to sit including a large patio, main indoor dining room and a long bar overlooking the wood-burning oven. This is the place to be if you love to see your dinner being made before your eyes, its up close and very personal.Depending on what time of day you go the menu has its bases covered. From the coffee bar to a fun and interesting breakfast menu as well as the main menu, you might be hard pressed to just order one thing. The main menu is comprised of sandwiches, pizza's, salads and cold case offerings such a fresh hummus and potato salad. You may also be happy to know that they serve beer and wine to compliment your dinner choices, priced so well that you may want to try more than one if you're not driving.  Be sure to take a look at the wall of kitschy gift items like bear shaped salt and peppershakers and Party Snaps. Who didn't play with those when they were a kid?Being all about fresh and local we started with the Antipasto ($11), which was large enough to share between 4 big eaters. A large serving platter covered in Molinari and Sons cured meats, roasted Brussels sprouts, baby carrots, olives and slices of artisanal cheese were a delight. The grilled bread that came with the platter was a nice compliment to the deliciously salty cured meats. Instead of ordering the Caprese Salad ($8) we opted for the Caprese Sandwich ($7), which even came with a cold case side dish. The corn, tomato + bean side was a bounty of freshness from the crunchy corn to the smooth toothsome Navy beans. This was a real compliment to the wonderful flavors of the mozzarella, sliced tomato, fresh basil and balsamic on the sandwich. The Liberty Joe ($7) is a take on the classic Sloppy Joe enjoyed by millions of kids over the years. Tender ground beef in a rich and hearty tomato sauce a top a toasted bun, lots of love for this one. Mac and cheese was the only side that could have been chosen for this one, kid heaven!The pizza's are all hand tossed and baked in a beautiful Renato wood-burning oven. The pizza crusts that come from this oven are lightly crisp, slightly charred and simply scrumptious! Starting with the White ($11) this one is not to be missed! If the combination of cream sauce and smoked mozzarella wasn't enough, wait till you taste the chopped bacon and tender pieces of chicken, oolala! Another sure fire hit was the Grilled Sausage ($10) covered in stringy mozzarella, roasted onions and tomato sauce. While the Molinari ($11) sounded great, the cooking of sliced cured meats makes them way to salty and intense for my taste, gamey.Desserts vary from day to day, so on our visit we had the pleasure of a slab of Red Velvet Cake ($5). If you've never had red velvet, please do. Moist chocolate cake covered in thick frosting of cream cheese delight. If you're in the mood for something a little different, order the Bread Pudding ($5). This was probably the lightest bread pudding I've ever had, which was more like French toast pillows swimming in a sea of creamy love.Load up the car with friends and go ahead, make the trip to Gilbert and see what you had no idea existed.Forgive me Joe for i have sinned . i visited your little restaurant a month ago for breakfast and never reviewed it..Yikes!!  Well here is the scoop I really enjoy the food, ambiance and downright hipness of Liberty .Can I can you Liberty?   The breakfast was super tasty and now I have eaten dinner here as well.  Hubby and I ventured out to Gilbert on our way to Pinetop ..yeah it's on the way. We split two entrees . Plus one had the Apricot Chicken, yummy  and generous with a grilled /slight char and a tasty apricot glaze that didn't scream sweet. The veggie with it was asparagus also grilled and a interesting sweet potato mash with a savory taste that I ignored because I kept loving the stuff on my plate.   For me I had a flat iron steak with a Chimchurri sauce that made me smile. I also had a garlic mash potato   which you cant go wrong with  and tasty grilled carrots . We also had the red velvet cake which had a smooth texture and a light cream cheese frosting that really made it. As always the service was friendly and prompt and made me want to come back.  Love the decor so updated modern farmy , how do they do that? I also love the unisex  bathrooms with recipes on the walls, yes I took pics hope the recipes turn out!This is the sort of review that the Liberty Market powers that be might not want to associate themselves with.  They should read it, and then disavow it if need be.So we've been to LM a bunch of times.  I famously said that I'd eat myself to death on their red velvet cake (more on that later) but had marginally less success with the rest of the menu.Well all that changed two visits ago.  My wife ordered the italia salad, which is sort of like an antipasto salad with garbanzo beans, kalamata olives (the lone blight on the salad, but I can appreciate that that's only my opinion), and italian meats with lettuce and tomatoes and all.  Totally delicious.  And I ordered the italian sausage pizza which is actually amazing.  Totally delicious.  It comes with ricotta cheese and onions, the ricotta being delightfully creamy and the pizza, on the whole, being perfect in every way.  Thinish crust (but not too thin) and just really flavorful.We got all that last night, too, and it was amazing again, but the trip was marred by...the worst customer ever to live.  If you see a mushroom-shaped woman probably in her mid 40s, wearing a visor on her mushroom shaped head, and a t-shirt with "talk to the (paw print)" emblazoned on the front, look out.  You'll recognize her by her disconsolate husband/significant other, who carries around with him the ethos of a beaten pet.WOMAN: I'll have the (five thousand different desserts to go) and the pecan bar.  But NOT the pecan bar that was cooked on the side of the pan.  I HATE that.HAPLESS EMPLOYEE: Okay... what about that pecan bar right there.WOMAN: NO! Not that one.  Look. You can tell that that one was cooked on the side of the pan.  No, I want that one (the one predictably buried under thirty others).  That *should* be all right.  It looks okay.HAPLESS EMPLOYEE: Uh.  Okay.  Sure.WOMAN: (orders fifty more things)HAPLESS EMPLOYEE: (rings up woman. she pays.)WOMAN: And MAKE SURE that I don't get the pecan bar because (points credit card menacingly at HAPLESS EMPLOYEE) I am *very particular* about this.  If it doesn't look right, I will send it right back.HAPLESS EMPLOYEE: Okay (reassuringly).  We will.  Thank you.So I roll up behind her and give her a withering look as she turns away and commiserate with the homeboy at the bar.  Then we order, etc.A couple of pointers.  One) if my wife thinks you're an asshole, you are.  She's got a pretty long fuse for this sort of thing.  And yes, that's how come we're married.  Two) if you're fat, why would you act so... fat?  It just reinforces the fact that you're a great big fat person and what the hell?Fat person code: (I am an authority)1. Don't act like if you don't get the exact pecan bar you want, that your life is OVER.  It may be true, but for fucks sake.2. Don't order a disgustingly fatty triple-super-size quadruple burger with extra mayo and then a large diet coke.  You get laughed at when you do this.3.  I would say DO diet and exercise but I'm fat and I think those two things are profoundly boring.Anyway, I know this has dragged on but I talk so that I can hear myself talk, and the same generally applies to my writing.  BUT: If you are from LM, I HOPE YOU READ THIS BECAUSE...Our red (please see updated below) velvet cake last night was (sorry about the parentheticals but the yelp-bots are to blame.) terrible**.  TERRIBLE!  We got it to go and whoever served it to us either grossly misunderstood the quality of what they were serving, or they should be fired.  I have (albeit indirect) experience with Joe (the owner/conceptual mastermind) and I am certain that if he knew that this five day old, dried up piece of cake were being given to customers, he would be upset. There were even two people in line ahead of me trying to decide between the carrot and red velvet and I told them they should get red velvet, hands down.  YOU MADE A LIAR OUT OF ME, LIBERTY MARKET!  And for this, I won't forgive you unless I get a free slice of (do I even need to specify "fresh") red velvet cake.Having said all of that, every restaurant has it's moments, bad or good, and I forgive that and on the strength of the usual red velvet perfection and the deliciousness of everything else, I give LM five stars.__________________**Red Velvet Update: I have been in twice since and this most recent time, Kiersten (one of the owners) gave me a new piece of red velvet cake.  And a pecan bar, from the middle of the pan no less!  But I want to make this clear, just in case it isn't: I love liberty market--it's exceptional.  And I really want everyone to know that I've had the RV cake many times before *and since* and it has, every time, been amazing.  I still hold that it is the best piece of cake I've ever had.  So it clearly was an aberration this time.  And the carrot cake is almost as good.  Really.  The bread pudding is totally sublime.  If you get a dessert there, you won't be disappointed.  I promiseI love Liberty Market. I grew up in Gilbert and remember when this was a small grocery store. I've been wanting to check this place out since the conversion and I'm so glad I finally stopped by. It was perfect. This place just feels like home. Casual, but warm. When we walked in my friend and I were lost and didn't know where to start. Luckily one of the staff quickly handed us menus and told us where to order. I had a couple of caramel iced lattes and the Liberty Bowl. I loved both. The Liberty Bowl came with 4 big meatballs in marinara sauce and and two slices of toasted bread. It was so hard narrowing down my choice because there were so many delicious looking items on the menu and the baked goods display kept calling my name, but I resisted. Next time I think I'll just give in and have a slice of red velvet or carrot cake, or a cup cake or a slice of zucchini bread or a sticky bun. So much to choose from. I would love to come back here and have a coffee and sit and enjoy the atmosphere at the espresso bar. Loved all the different themes in the bathroom stalls. You have to check each one out. Joe was there and stopped by each table to see how everyone was doing. We spent so much time here chatting and catching up. It's a great place to come and hang out. I will be back soon.02/07/10What a fun and inviting space!  I loved it!  If it weren't for the fact that I was on my way to join some friends at their house to watch the Super Bowl, I would've stayed here longer!  (My first, and so far only, visit lasted three hours.)  Liberty Market reminded me of Scottsdale's The Kitchen, but geared more towards the younger crowd- college, young upstarts, thirty-somethings (who here miss that show?), and the young-at-heart.  Loved the whimsically retro mini "giftshop."  I would later on come to find that the restrooms here are reasons enough (five, to be more precise) for a visit!  Maybe it's just me, but it's the quirky touches such as these that make destinations like Liberty Market and brother company Joe's Farm Grill stand out from the pack.  (Although I must admit enjoying LM's restrooms MUCH better than JFG's (check out my review!).So, what did I eat??  Only one of the tastiest white pizza and farmer's salad I've ever had.  The thin-crust pizza wasn't as crispy as I'd like (I'm very finicky), but this pizza was bursting w/ so many flavors!  With grilled chicken, crunchy and chopped thick-cut bacon, parmesan cream sauce, smoky mozzarella, peppery arugula, and pine nuts, how could it not?? Can you believe I ate the entire thing??  Well, OK- I did shave off half of the crust (the soggy center), but nary a chicken chunk, lean bacon (I trimmed off the fatty layers, which there weren't much to begin w/, as these chopped pieces were grilled crisp-to-perfection!), nor arugula leaf escaped my ever-vigilant fingers!  And what about the farmer's salad?  (BTW, you may find its recipe on the walls of one of the themed restrooms.)  It, too, was quite scrumptious, if a bit too salty, and contained lightly-roasted vegetables, mixed greens, heavy on the palatable sesame-crusted croutons, and a really great lemon vinaigrette.  I'd be hard-pressed not to order these again on my next visit, but I am determined to try other selections as they sound so appealing.LM's layout made it fun to look around and get a feel of the place and what it has to offer.  The desserts looked so tantalizing that, on one of my next visits, I may have to consider throwing caution to the wind (food allergies), and select one to have with an Americano or a cafe latte from the espresso bar.  Oh, the choices I have to make...I'm disappointed in myself for not getting dessert or iced coffee, but i needed room for food. I think that should be an entire separate trip because the food was too good to stop myself. I even got to spot a little local celeb while there. Mr. Bianco himself. I tried to be sly and peek at what he was eating so that I could order it. You know it's good if he's eating it, right?! All I could tell was that it was a pressed sandwich for anyone curious. And I think he caught on to me being ridiculous because he started smiling. Or he wants to date me, in which case HAAAAYYYYYYYYYYYY ;)During my wonderful trip to Liberty I got to taste the hummus, sweet potato salad, pizza, the picnic sandwich, and the caprese sandwich.first things first, i am going to spend now until november trying to make  that sweet potato salad. it was insanity. It was roasted and I could taste the garlic and there were craisins and oh my gosh. I need to figure out how to make it so that I can take credit for it at thanksgiving dinner. with respect to liberty of course :)second- how the heck can i pick a favorite between balsamic drizzled bread with ripe, red tomatoes, tons of fresh basil, divine mozarella or the turkey with bleu cheese crumbles, granny apple slices, and candied pecans? both sandwiches were so amazing. my eating companion and i decided that the caprese sandwich was the winner. so amazing. but that doesn't discount how awesome the picnic is, because that is amazing in it's own right. i've already figured out my next trip. instead of ordering two entrees and switching halves with the other diner, we will order and split only one entree, one side and then we will have room for dessert. or i'll just go in and order a ton of desserts. whatever.Dear Gilbert,Don't take this the wrong way, but I've never had a reason to come visit you. I'm sure I've skimmed your edges, or skirted just around you many times in the past. Sometimes maybe even on purpose. Sorry. You've probably seen me drive by and thought - "There goes that prick again. Who does he think he is?" But you're miles away. We don't have any friends inside you. You lacked a compelling draw to pull us out of our mid-town cocoon. Until now. So I hope we can put the past behind us and shed our preconceptions about each other and just move on with our relationship. So...LIBERTY MARKETWhat a refreshing, rewarding surprise. A hip, family-friendly, easy-going place to get great food and beverages in a clean, clever setting. The website hinted at its authenticity, but how many times does that fail you??On the street, it's a nifty setting that harkens back to an Americana that I grew up with in the midwest: water tower, mid-century neon diner signage, real brick, public sidewalks intended for human use, trees, etc. But the building itself is a clean juxtaposition of modern worked into a cool old (by PHX standards) building. Old brick meets steel beams and open space. Everything is functional, not just there to look cool. From the structurally relevant beams to the authentic wood-fired oven, it all serves a real purpose.We (me, wife and 9mo old daughter) chose our seats at the pizza oven counter and clamped on our baby's magical floaty chair. We immediately struck up a rapport with James, at the oven, and learned that almost everyone we encountered, other than customers, were his family and friends. That's pretty cool. We've now been several times and the food has never let us down. In fact, we've been drawn back almost weekly on our little pilgrimage to keep exploring the menu. I don't see a James Beard award in the future, unless they give one for consistently delicious, honest comfort food. But we're all happy to drive out of our way for a visit that puts a smile on our faces every time.THAT CHRISTIAN THINGNow, to address something that really shouldn't matter, but often does to many people: "The Christian Thing". Due to the amount of interest in Agritopia and its "Bible-based design", I think most people know going in that this is a Joe Johnston place (Joe's Farm Grill, Real BBQ and now LM) and he's pretty open about his beliefs. I'm sure to the surprise of many who would avoid establishments that clearly identify as one religion or another, there is nothing in-your-face or proselytizing or patronizing about this place's pretty public Christian identity. If anything, the experience speaks volumes about the honesty of their description of their beliefs on the Liberty Market website. Yes, when you know about it going into it, you feel the presence of their faith. But all in a good way.I almost feel like bringing this aspect of it up was unnecessary, but at the same time, I think it needed to be brought up; simply because of how many people I've talked to who immediately jumped on that angle - "oh, the Bible Thumper enclave in Gilbert", or "sounds kinda Stepford-ish", etc. If you just wandered in without any background info I think your takeaway would just be - "Now that was a friendly group of people and a great meal."Oh, and check out the bathrooms. It's fun.So for what it is: friendly, sincere, fresh, honest, well-thought out, comfy, delicious, consistent, complete and did I mention friendly? - 5 stars.4.5 stars!I've eaten at Liberty Market a few times already, but this morning marked my first breakfast- and what a fantastic meal it was!- of pancakes (3 in a stack; $6.5) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3N9U549Zse8UP-MwKZAjAQ?select=Xg8U6Fz2E8hu0xQ3Hf7CZg#Xg8U6Fz2E8hu0xQ3Hf7CZg w/ added topping of "market-made granola" ($1), a side of Grilled Flattened Meatballs ($3.5) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3N9U549Zse8UP-MwKZAjAQ?select=MMwKpMltbKCWNNlraI-tGw#MMwKpMltbKCWNNlraI-tGw, and a double-shot of espresso ($2) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3N9U549Zse8UP-MwKZAjAQ?select=M1WrCuX3oouHHrynL8KJQg#M1WrCuX3oouHHrynL8KJQg.  Service was in fine form-- I couldn't have the market-made maple syrup blend, nor any of the house-whipped cream, blueberry compote, raspberry and apricot jams, or any of the flavored syrups used at the coffee counter (my server patiently checked for those items we were unsure about), and when I asked for chocolate chips, I was, instead, offered a chocolate syrup made from scratch composed of chocolate, sugar, and coco oil... good stuff!  This syrup would be excellent on ice cream sundaes, too.  (FYI, I didn't really need anything extra to add to the pancakes and meatballs... the two paired well!)I've mentioned this once before, but I think it's such a great thing to yelp about again-- buy an espresso (or any of their specialty coffees), and you can have unlimited cups of regular coffee during your meal!  Not like I needed more caffeine after the double-shot, but I did have some of the house-blend coffee.  After 1.5 pancakes, the meatballs (watch out, they're very greasy!), and caffeine, I'll be good to go for a few hours, despite only having four hours of sleep!  (I'm hoping, anyway!)p.s.  Despite tipping more than 20% at the cashier upon ordering, I thought Bruce, the server who took care of me at my table, deserved a couple more bananas for not displaying annoyance at my staying here so long.  One more reason why I love Liberty Market so much!  Addendum:  After getting directions from Bruce as to the quickest way to 101 N, he asked me if I wanted a cup of coffee to go, gratis!  Have I told you how much I love Liberty Market??Helpful hint:  Free wifi can be accessed by entering the code printed at the bottom of your receipt.-Wait in line to order your food, the Hostess will seat you, and someone will bring your food to your table.-Friendly service.-Parking sometimes sucks, depending when you go.-BUSY, busy, busy...they claim they will find you a table, while you wait in line to order...but, what if the table hogs who are DONE EATING continue chatting for hours and NEVER leave and there are no tables available???-The restrooms are unisex. The toilets are individual restrooms and the day I went they smelled like urine, pee-pee men's restrooms. GROSS! Usually the restrooms smell clean...-YUMMY pizzas! Baked in a fire brick oven.-Yummy salads! Perfect portions! $9+. -Italia sandwich is a bit weird...what is that sweet vinegar jelly on the bread? Too gourmet for my liking!-Sandwiches come with a side of your choice.-Ambiance is like eating in a trendy warehouse.-I like Liberty Market!I don't know what I could say about Liberty Market that hasn't been said multiple times already.  But here goes. The people- helpful, friendly, accommodating.  Always happy to answer a question or to whip up a sample of some tempting little treat.The menu- exhaustive. I've yet to try something I didn't love. If you can't find something to eat here, then you must work for the competition!  My go-to meal is the Liberty Bowl with pasta. The atmosphere- kitschy, eclectic. The neon, the colors, the espresso machine (more on that in a bit). Plenty of indoor seating. Nice outdoor patio. Bathrooms that are works of art. Parking- can be a little rough, what with all of the other businesses there in downtown Gilbert. The Espresso Bar- Oh. My. Goodness. That E61 espresso machine is older than me- and probably most Yelpers (if not any two combined), but wow does it make a delicious shot of espresso!  If you've never had a Cortadito, I highly recommend giving it a try.Go to Liberty Market. Do it. Do it now. Thank me later.It's more Liberty than Market.  I was just back from vacation and hoping to buy some ready made food for my empty fridge - my options were beer and cold salads.  So instead, I sat down and had a meal there.  I ordered a salad and my partner in crime had a grilled cheese sandwich, both were tasty.  Very cool minimalist decor but the tables and soda station were messy in the rush of the lunch hour.  The service was friendly - you go up to the counter, order your food and they bring it out to you, you grab your own drinks - it's not the type of place where you're being waited on.  The restrooms were unisex and then had an outer area where the boys and girls washed their hands together, I thought that was nice because you don't have to commit to going into a restroom just to wash your hands before your meal.  The sinks don't have a mirror in front of you, it's a window that looks outside - I liked that little detail.What an odd experience. :-/I seriously dislike the waiting 20 minutes in an order line, getting seated, then waiting another 30 minutes for food after we were seated. Why not just take names like every other restaurant and seat people as the table opens up? My thought is that you're standing in line right next to the display cases the whole time, when it's your turn to order, you've been eying that slice of cake, scone, or other baked dessert for so long that you have no choice but to order it. Will power won out this time - no scone for me!The food was decent and the service was also pretty good. I ordered a chicken salad sandwich, being more in the average category than extraordinary, I don't think I would get it again. Having to serve my own drink from the fountain, waiting in line for so long to just make our order, getting taunted by all the baked goods, the general chaos of the place, and me personally living so far away (in downtown PHX), I can honestly say I'm not going to be making this a destination for dining. If you're close by and it's not a weekend, I imagine this spot is a lot less hectic and easier to deal with.Happy Yelping Phoenix. See you on Yelp!Yet another great local restaurant brought into being by Joe Johnston (creator of Joe's Farm Grill and Joe's Real BBQ).  The place is built out of a revamped 1930's grocery store and is super cool inside!  They have a wood fire pizza oven (you'll see all this wood stacked outside on the patio -- adds to the cool ambience) and swanky espresso bar.  The bathrooms are pretty awesome too.Most all the food is amazing here.  The pizzas are really tasty, so much so that I never seem to have the self control to not order them and try something new.  If you're vegetarian or trying to eat more greens, try the veggie pizza -- made with local produce, whatever is freshly picked ends up as toppings!  Salads and sandwiches are also delicious.  And the dessert selection is always pretty great.  The only negatives are that the place can get incredibly busy at peak hours, so come early or be prepared to wait.  Also, food (entree, drink, dessert, etc.) adds up quick and can get kinda pricey here.  Another bummer is that the waitstaff won't seat you if your whole party isn't present, which has been an issue/hassle in the past when a large table was needed for a birthday party or special event but all the guests had yet to arrive.  Other than that though, it's wonderful!Come here on your birthday and get $10 towards your meal!After anxiously waiting several weeks to try this restaurant, I was not that impressed with meal. $39.35 for two people for breakfast...Holy Cow! We ordered:- Bacon Pancakes- Liberty Potatoes- Side of Eggs- Side of Sausage- Griddled Bread Pudding- Kir Royale Pro's:- Appreciated the ability to order my food before sitting down- You can see the chef's prepare the food in the open- Bacon Pancakes were awesome! Loaded with plenty pig! - Liberty Potatoes were well seasoned and on point!- Sausage was acceptable; not too salty, which I preferCons:- Major attitude was given when I POLITELY advised that my glass had apparent lipstick of sorts and NOT from my lips. The person tending the E61 Bar suggested that it wasn't ..... I DONT GIVE A DAMN WHAT IT IS, MY GLASS IS APPARENTLY DIRTY! The manager was not all that pleased that I brought it up either, but so what! I just paid $40 and expect stellar service and clean tableware.- Potatoes, eggs and sausage were brought out several mins before the main dish....uh, I prefer my entire meal at once and not in courses. - Griddled Bread Pudding was a bit soggy for my liking. - Kir Royale IMMEDIATELY gave me a headache; clear sign of cheap alcohol- The line was a tad bit long to place an order. I would expect if you're standing in line to order and pay that it would move along much quicker than 25 mins.While the menu had several items I would love to try, it will be quite a while before I revisit. I never place a dollar amount on a good meal however, I do prefer to get what I pay for. This was NOT a $40 breakfast!

Review Text :
I know I'm not the first and I know I'm not the last person who has or will throw up at the Palo Verde on their 21st birthday.  I came in their already blind drunk and the bartender served me a gigantic, obscenely huge shot of Jagermesiter on the house.  Throwing up at the Palo Verde is hitting rock bottom.  It's like admitting to smoking crack before work.In case you've never been there before, here's the rundown:  It's disgusting.  There's a mop hanging up outside that's gotta be in the running for "Dirtiest Mop in Tempe," second only to a mop used for a murder scene... although I can't say for certain that the PV's mop hasn't done the same.The bathroom... my god.  One time I went in there, and there were flies on the toilet paper.  Once, I had diarrhea (I know! it was bad!) and some fat guy snorting cocaine sparked some conversation, "Man, I've been going to bars for 18 years, never had to shit in one before, though."  The bartenders are hilarious.  The one guy, Chuck, looks like he'd beat the shit out of you for wiping your nose wrong, but he's as nice as anyone I've ever met.  The drinks are stiff.  Ten bucks will get you more absinthe you know what to do with.  Chances are, you will stumble out of the PV, jump on your bicycle and wind up home somehow, giggling like a madman.I love it there.  I would give it five stars, but I had to surrender one due to the "punching machine," they installed and the classic rock that some douche-nozzle always puts on the jukebox.After a brief hiatus with the Palo Verde, I returned.  For a while there, I was seeing the same people time and time again and I feared that I was becoming a regular so for months I stayed away.I came back over the weekend and I'm glad I did.  When you go to the PV, sometimes there's a band playing.  Man, the PV does not need a band to be playing there.  The place is tiny.  When people are dancing and singing and what have ya, the temperature inside increases by maybe fifteen degrees.  The humidity raises.  It's disgusting. Other times, the place is just too crowded with douchebags who scream, "WHOOH!" each time they do a shot, and of course they won't just do one.  No.  If you say whooh, chances are you like saying it and you're going to use any and every opportunity to say it.  You'll take a shot to say it, you'll put a song on the jukebox you like or meet eyes with an attractive girl.  Whooh!Saturday night, I feared that maybe these two options were in effect.  But, no.  It was dead and I sat there for a few hours with my sister and my friend and we kicked back, watching Dinocroc and then Dinocroc VS Supergator.  Unfortunately we missed Supergator by itself but we did see the ultimate VERSUS match.  I shot the shit with the bartender/owner Chuck for a bit.  I asked him how much he thought the movie Dinocroc cost to make and he said, "I dunno... not as much as E.T., not as much as Star Wars, but probably more than.... Blair Witch?"Chuck told me one time he tried call Domino's Pizza because he had the number memorized.  He fucked up on two numbers and accidentally called 1-800-Condoms  I convinced him to call 1-800-pee-on-me and he did.  I saw his face sour and he was like, "Ah, man, nice sound effects...."It's a great bar.  I love going there, it's just such a nice, chill atmosphere and the drinks are dirt cheap.

Review Text :
I really enjoy this place, and for a few reasons. 1) A great Happy Hour, and 2) some really good fusion food.They have a huge bar, a huge area for seating, and a decent size sushi bar.  I've eaten at all three areas and the service has been consistent.  There are a lot of standouts on the menu so you can get whatever you like and expect good food.  I've had excellent sushi and a noodle/beef stir fry that was out of this world.This is not fine dining but I'd go here again in a minute.  The decor is nuevo Japanese (if there is such a thing).  The hostesses and the waitresses are smoking hot.  I woulda loved to have them feed me the food, nothing like being pampered (damn, time to wake up).I really enjoy Kona Grill for every time I go I never seem to have a problem! Each time I go I stop and look at the beautiful fish in their large fish tanks, I always sit outside on their shaded spacious patio and the staff is always incredibly friendly. This time I ordered the Basil Pesto, which was magnificent! It's a mix of sausages, chicken, noodles and their creamy basil pesto sauce. The dish is very flavorful and exciting with a hint of spicy at the end! My son was able to enjoy the basic chicken tenders and fries which seem to always satisfy him, we were able to have a very nice lunch and each of us enjoyed our meals.This is a great place to come for lunch or dinner; they have a great bar to sit at if you are looking to come for drinks. The inside dining area is very classy and open, and if your in the mood for being outside they have high top table and regular tables to seat plenty. This place gets crowded on Friday and Saturday nights, but there is definitely a reason! Great food, great service and great drinks!Kona Grill at Chandler Fashion Center never disappoints!Kona Grill is a casual sophisticated restaurant and bar which is perfect for a date, a party or whatever. Although there are 4 Phoenix valley locations (Chandler Fashion Center, Scottsdale Fashion Square, High Street, Santan Village), I always eat at the Chandler location. Kona Grill is modern American cuisine prepared from scratch in their kitchens. They also have an impressive, extensive sushi menu with fresh fish flown in daily. Although there is an impressive full menu and sushi bar, I absolutely love their Happy Hour food & drink menu/hours. (see pics)Happy Hours:Mon - Fri 3pm - 7pmMon - Thur 9pm - 11pmFri/Sat 10pm - 12amSat 11am - 2pmSun ALL DAYDinning HoursMon - Thurs 11am - 10pmFri/Sat 11am - 11pmSun 11am - 10pmKona Grill is located at the Southeast corner of the Chandler Fashion Center at the entrance to the Village, directly across from the Harkins Theatre. Valet parking is available right in front of main entrance. For more information:KonaGrill.comI 5/5 highly recommend Kona Grill!

Review Text :
I should've known this meal was hopeless when our waiter brought my dining companion non-alcoholic beer instead of the real thing.  Thankfully he did not make this mistake with the wine however it still puzzles me as to why he brought the bottle to the table for inspection but did not think to also bring an implement for opening it. The chicken tikka masala was almost passable but the assorted appetizers we ordered were pretty woeful. A tiny little plate of dried up little bites, almost indiscernible in flavor from one to the next.Suffice it to say, India Oven is not worth putting on your list of "must dine at" spots in Las Vegas!

Review Text :
What a nice little place for breakfast! The boy and I made our first trip over to Dragonfly Cafe for our usual late Sunday morning breakfast (2:30ish by the time we got there) and were pleasantly surprised at how tasty the food was. The place is cute as a button inside and out with a quaint down home cozy atmosphere that you just don't get from a national chain restaurant. Looking over the menu, it was difficult to decide on what to try as so many things looked good. We finally decided on the daybreak breakfast sandwich and the cinnamon raisin french toast, and boy oh boy were they good! The sandwich was so fresh tasting and they must have picked the onions that day, because they were so flavorful and perfect in the sandwich. The potatoes that came on the side also had a nice flavorful garlicy taste to them and the french toast was pretty darn good too! And the best part of all is that they serve breakfast all day every day (except Monday's) so I know for sure that we will be back soon to sample more of this tasty menu at the Dragonfly Cafe!Decided to stop by for breakfast by myself one Sunday morning.  The reviews on Yelp were enticing, so I gave it a shot.  I ordered the Sonora Potato and Sausage Hash (Eggs, Potatoes, Hot Links, Chipotle, Garlic, Onions, Peppers) w/side of Sourdough Toast, $8.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nEyREad5GZd3RiEZA-Irpw?select=TKoW6UY1opAaH4wFxLkFpgI couldn't wait to take a bite of my dish as I love Hot Links and have never seen it in a Breakfast item before....it didn't disappoint, it was very good.  The Hot Link was actually spicy, which is often not the case.  The Potatoes were very tasty as well.  My only complaint was that it was kind of a small portion...I was left wanting more.My server was very friendly and welcoming.  She asked how I found the joint and addressed me by name when I left....very cool.Return Factor - 98%

I went here for a 'nice' steak dinner. however, i think 'nice' is actually 'bleh'.All I wanted was a big, fat hunk of delicious meat and some healthy vegetables. Apparently they have vegetables but I wouldn't call them healthy. They have green beans, and I'm sure they are delicious with all the butter and bacon they are cooked in but I am 100% sticking to my New Years resolution. I asked instead if I could have fresh green beans cooked by themselves. My waitress said NO.NO?! you mean you don't have fresh vegetables?Everything they have is already premade and nothing is fresh. GROSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!The steak was bland and I pretty much used an entire mound of salt for flavor. It ended up being like $20 bucks after tip. Totally ridiculous. I don't understand restaurants that don't use fresh vegetables and nothing can be cooked to order. that totally grosses me out. I will not be back. If I was by myself I would have left when I found out nothing was fresh, but I was with people and didn't want to insult them because one of them chose this place?I have to say this is one of my favorite steak places.Although you will fill up on Peanuts before you get to your meal if you are not careful/ It is a popular place to go. So many times there is a wait. We came here on Monday fairly early ,so we got a booth right away.This time I got the Rib eye and Ribs. I usually try to stay away from pork. But, everyone raves about them so I wanted to try them. Divine!However, The steak was awful! It was cooked very perfectly. But, it was full of gristle, not something I would expect from and $20.00 dinner. I took most of it home to the dog and I had to cut it into small bits for her. But, she loved it!Most every other time I have been here the food has been great! So this one time is just that , One time.Vegetables are really good as well as the potato.We all know the bread is great(rolls) but, not gluten free. Great staff, clean place.Tons of parking outside as well.

Thanks to Derek r.'s review, I thought I'd add my $.02.  It's been awhile since I last dined here (at least a couple of years), as I try to support non-chain restaurants these days, but I enjoyed the few dining experiences here, solo and w/ relatives.  Servers were always friendly and efficient.  Tables, chairs, booths, and women's restroom were clean.If you're one to check out those mailers that arrive in your mailbox from time to time, you'll know that 5 & Diner usually has BOGO offers on there (buy one, get one).   Years ago ('03, '04?), this very location sold, during Christmas season, upcoming new year calendars that had cute 50's theme pics.  Each month's page offered coupons such as BOGO, free children's entree with paying adult, or a free shake w/ an entree.  Does anyone know if this promotion is still running every Christmas season?Had an awesome time here at breakfast.Its an old school diner.  Juke boxes at the table and everything!We got the breakfast special which was 3 pancakes, 2 eggs, 2 bacon and hash browns.  It was only $3.99!  I got a heath bar shake and my buddy got coffee.  The heath bar shake was awesome!  They hook it up too by that they give you the shake, plus the leftovers in the metal shake container.  So its like 2 shakes in one.  It was kind of hard to suck through the straw because they put sooooooo much heath bar in there but I wasn't complaining......I love heath bars!  The service was awesome and our waiter was really nice!  Cool vibe, good food and low prices make this one of the best diners I have ever been in!

I came here with my co-workers for a team lunch. We do this every quarter and decided come here cause they can handle large parties and they have a big variety menu. When we got here our table was already setup and once we sat down our server was really quick to provide us with our drinks. I ordered the California Burger. I thought that this was really good. Bursting with flavor. The burger was on a grilled sourdough bread with avocado, green chilies, pepper jack cheese, chipotle mayo, and ranch. Burger was very moist and perfect. It came with shoestring fries. Half the plate was filled with fries. It was a huge lunch meal but really worth it. As for the service, our server was always checking on us. Refilling our drinks and clearing the empty plates. We even had the manager come by to make sure everything was okay. It seemed like they really cared for us. So overall, I would say that we had a really enjoyable time. We had a table over 10 people and the service and food came out in a reasonable time. The only regret was that I didn't order their Pizookie. Those are so good. Enjoy...5-star Happy Hour!  We had a bunch of beverages and a bunch of food for 35 bucks!  Can you believe that?  The bartender...I think his name is Geoffrey...took great care of us.  Next time we need to leave room for a pizookie.  That Harvest Hefeweizen is so good it took me back to old Bavaria AND made me blaspheme.  Now that's a great beer!  We always enjoy stopping in at BJ's.

I drive past this place constantly but never really hear about it- good or bad. Finally stopped in for takeout and was impressed with the quality and selection of dishes. Cafeteria-style ready-made dishes available as well as a large menu for fresh-made food, takeout is their specialty but they do have a few tables to dine-in as well.SALT AND PEPPER PORK CHOP: Gigantic portion, flavorful and good quality cuts of pork. Wish there were a bit more peppers and onions for added flavor.SINGAPORE NOODLE: This is more or less a combination pan fried noodle dish with veggies, chicken, bbq pork, and shrimp, along with tons of veggies and noodles. Portion size can easily feed two.BOKCHOY AND BLACK MUSHROOM: Simple but good, generous portion.BEEF & PORK SHUMAI: Better than expected, and much larger than other versions elsewhere at dim sum specialty places. Bit less flavorful than expected but still better quality than most would associate with the location appearance.Most dishes are a flat $9, their ready-made combination meals are also really affordable. Service is polite and prompt, if the order takes a bit longer than expected they may tuck in a few Hong Kong donuts in your order gratis.

I have eaten at Cracker Barrel once or twice before (long ago), and just had to visit one before heading back home to Los Angeles where we don't have any nearby.It is a store with lots of knick-knacks and a restaurant with good old-fashion country food.There are a bunch of rocking chairs you will see as you walk down the long porch/patio to the front door.  There are some for sale.  Such a cool country feel to it.  Sit a spell and relax.  You can play checkers while you wait.  We had to wait for our entire party to arrive before we could put our name on the list to be seated.  Once they arrived, we were seated rather quickly.They were busy and our food arrived at the table cold.  We had 7 in our party.  The service was okay, I think our waitress was there and then disappeared and then reappeared later on.  My husband ordered a breakfast combo with scrambled eggs, sausage, & hashed browns.  It was rather basic.  I got the Blueberry Pancakes, they were really, really, really delicious!  They bring out individual bottles of maple and blueberry syrups.  I got the blueberry syrup and was surprised that the syrup contained real blueberries!  It was deliciously awesome!  My daughter ordered french toast with maple syrup.  If the food had arrived promptly to the table, it would have been ideal!  When you are ready to settle your bill, you have to take the ticket to the cashiers in the store to pay.The store is full of cute things!  There were a few items I would have bought, but I restrained!  The pig salt & pepper holder was cute!  I would have liked to taste the Divinity although it would not compare to my mother-in-law's fresh divinity!!  They had their Easter items out as well as a religious section of goodies.  There was a big poster announcing the sale of the new Casting Crowns CD, which I thought was rather neat.  If I ever return to this Cracker Barrel, I sure hope the food is hot when it is brought out to the table!  I should have told the manager when she walked by and asked us how things were.  We asked for more syrups and she then went and had the waitress bring them out.  I guess she herself doesn't get things for guests.  I was really hoping this would warrant 5-stars, but it just didn't measure up.

ANOTHER GREAT FIND FOR MY HOLE IN THE WALL PLACES LIST!Based on some of the reviews I read, the wings, fried chicken, hot links, and catfish were all highly recommended.So I ordered wings and catfish. Originally I wanted to order fried chicken as well but they told me that they had just run out. From what I heard, their fried chicken is so good that they usually run out. Ok, so why don't they fix that? Anyways, the wings were decent. Your choices were mild, medium, spicy, and barbeque. The catfish was really good. It had that perfect blend of batter and cornmeal. Nice and juicy too. Next time I hope I can come early enough to try their fried chicken.Now when you go to this place, they are situated in their own building in between an apartment complex on the right and a convenience store on the left. Parking is rather small and on busy occasions, you might just have to park down the street somewhere. When you finally make it inside, you will notice that they are basically a convenience store that just happens to serve burgers, wings, fried chicken, catfish, and many others that looks appetizing. You have about 4 decent tables and if you're lucky, you are able to sit at one of them if you are not gonna take your food to go. Yes, they take cards and I dont remember seeing any signs of a minimum amount so I guess that's a good thing. Their bathroom is all the way in the back and it's not all that obvious. You kinda have to do a little bit of exploring before you can find it.I hate to say it, but the actual appearance of the place looks rather ghetto. But the food and the service they provide is quite remarkable. If they had a better location and make up they would be making some serious money.So in closing, my advice would be to call ahead for a pick up order and if there is a table available then by all means, go ahead and eat there. As for their menu, you really have to be there if its your first time and some parts of their menu are not all that clear.  4 stars for the food and 2 stars for the location so 3 stars it is for me.

RUN, RUN, RUN AWAY FROM MARCELLO'S!!!!!!!!!!!!! I have to say that I absolutely had one of the worst dining experiences of my entire life at this place. It was surreal!Let me explain. Years ago, my sister, a friend and I went here for dinner. We were seated in what was at the time an empty dining area. We waited for the server, none ever came. We waited longer, still no server to take our drink order. After about 20 minutes we stood up and left. Since that time I had no interest in going back.Then a groupon showed up... OK, so maybe I'll chalk it up to it just being an off night years ago. Tonight my sister and my nephew decided to go and use the groupon. I arrived first and was quickly seated by a very nice young man. Our server, Cheryl came over a few minutes later and took my drink order, I had the Sangria. Cheryl was very nice but seemed a little either nervous or out of sorts. No problem we all have off days. (However, side note to Cheryl: If you are in the service industry you really should keep your perfumes to minimum as it can be extremely overpowering and offsetting especially when serving food!) Cheryl brought me the Sangria and the water as requested. Good Sangria however, nothing really special... basically a sweet red wine with an orange slice. Certainly none of the layers of flavors you expect with Sangria. Decent start. My sister and nephew arrived and both ordered waters. Here's where it starts to get odd. Cheryl brings the waters back and sets down another Sangria in front of my sister. She then states that "it's sort of a freebie, I'm not sure where it came from so you can have it." She then asks if we are ready to order, we ask for a few minutes. She then looks up at the table two over from us and says: "Oh, I just remembered where this goes." She proceeds to pick up the glass and take it to the next table and serve it. 1) Weird, right? 2) Health code violation? 3) Rude? She comes back several minutes later and explains the specials (well 3 out of 7 specials we later find out) and we ask for a few minutes. Honestly, we were trying to see what the better deal was for our dollar. Groupon vs. 40% off Early Bird discount vs Dinner for two combo for $29.95. Cheryl returns and takes our order. Appetizer: EGGPLANT MARCELLOEggplant stuffed with cheese, served in a marinara sauce with caper and topped with melted mozzarella cheese $7.95Entree 1: RIGATONI VODKAEntree 2: CHICKEN PAILLARD(sub the pasta for a side of green beans $2.95 up charge)Entree 3: FETTUCINI ALFREDOAs we were waiting for the appetizer a fairly familiar scent from my youth wafted in our direction. I asked my sister if she smelled it also and she confirmed, smells like the kitchen staff is smokin' a lil weed in the back. I get how the restaurant industry works and honestly I don't mind as long as the food and service is good.Appetizer came out... It was OK...nothing special... had that previously frozen taste. Entrees came out... Entree 1: The Rigatoni Vodka was soupy and tasteless... extremely bland. I decided I wasn't going to eat it. Entree 2: One bite into the chicken and my sister decided that she wasn't going to eat it. It really should have been served in a bowl with as much "sauce" as it was in. I took a bite and agreed... the chicken was tough and bland and her whole plate was greasy... including the green beans. Entree 3: Does Chef boy-ardee make fettucini alfredo now? My nephew ate about half of it because he was starving but left the rest and didn't ask for a box. Just not good... you could tell that it is not made in house and again was very bland. I had enough and when Cheryl returned explained that we were not happy and asked for the manager. Mark showed up and we explained the situation. I mentioned the sangria incident, gave him a bit of advice in that if his staff was going to smoke weed they should really shut the back door so that the patrons do not have to smell it and final explained that we were not happy with the food. His immediate reaction was to say that "no one was smoking marijuana in the establishment." Whatever. I know what I smelled. He then offered to exchange the food. We explained that we were happy to pay for the drink, the appetizer and my nephews food but were not interested in trying anything else. Cheryl arrives with the bill. Surprise, surprise! It's wrong. (we went with the 40% discount but where charged full price). My sister explained the error and Cheryl corrected it. I provided my card to pay the total for the 3 items (w/the discount $19.26). When she returned she had only charged my card $4.95. She asked for my card again. I refused and asked for the manager again. Worthless. Bad food and incompetence do not make for a good dining experience. But hey... I did get the evil eye from the old lady that may be the owner... so that was fun!  :)Don't put yourself through this when there are so many better places out there!

There are so many choices for Mexican food in our neighborhood.  We've passed by this place more than once and finally decided to stop by and give it a try.  There is a lot of influence from New Mexico here and it's evident by the use of Hatch Chile in many of the menu items.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/y2e1DgIUBlERep7hrKz2-w?select=jR0gwZgN7GK1O0Spel1N_gAfter browsing the menu, we ordered:Hatch Chile Cheese Crisp (Fried Tortilla topped w/melted Cheese & Hatch Chile)White Sands Chimichanga (Spicy Pork Green Chile covered w/Queso Fundido)http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/y2e1DgIUBlERep7hrKz2-w?select=Ev2eduloh_wsuBGoRq9xDQThe Hatch Chile Cheese Crisp was pretty good, but the Tortilla wasn't cooked all the way and was still soft....not crispy as it should be.The White Sands Chimichanga was simply awesome!  The Queso Fundido made this dish taste soooo good.The service was pretty good.  They have craft beer on tap and I wanted to sample some before I decided....the server brought out a few tasting glasses for me to try.  I thought that was cool.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/y2e1DgIUBlERep7hrKz2-w?select=8pgTu034N-xFslG8NGjn7wOverall, it was a decent experience.  I wasn't blown away by the food, but it is definitely worth coming back to try other items on the menu.Return Factor - 80%The only way I would ever eat here again is if..... 1. Every restaurant in the world has closed except Arriba 2. I died and was reincarnated with no taste buds 3. I'd just smoked some chronic and had already finished off all the moldy stuff in my fridge 4. I was a rat. 5. I was a cockroach. 5a. I was a  rat who'd eaten a cockroach and wanted to get the taste out of its        mouth. 6. I was King or Emperor or something, wielding enough power to have the head chef tortured if he fucked up my meal. 7. Roadkill no longer existed. 8. There was a nuclear holocaust and for some strange reason, this was the only     place left standing. 9. I'd just been released from a mental hospital.10. My in-laws were visiting from the east coast and wanted to 'try some really good Mexican'.11. I lost a bet.12. I needed to get out going to church, blaming  'food poisoning' as the culprit.13. I'd just landed the role of surly waiter in a major Hollywood film, and needed to       practice the part by understudying the real thing.14. I was into philanthropy and accustomed to the idea of throwing money away.15. I was on my deathbed, and my family refused to honor my living will by not      pulling the plug on me. I'd ask them to take me here for one more meal where I'd      die on the spot.My waiter was a major sphincter, telling us about the happy hour Margarita for 4.99 when a moment later, he informed the couple in the next booth of their 'famous' 99 cent margarita. I want my four bucks back.When I ordered the taco salad for 9.99, trying to be helpful, he suggested I order the salad on the next page..the one for 11.99. I did. It came with cold chicken tasting as though it had been boiled. The lettuce was layered with gobs of sour cream and featured rust spots. I ate about two bites before sending it back. Arriba, between its sphinct-o-waiter and the god-awful, overpriced food, was so bad, if I had to compare it with shit, shit would win.  Even some rare form of shit only found on the bottom of the ocean, left there by some deep sea creature who's never been photographed. Please tell all your snowbird friends about this place.Friend raved about the margaritas here, so we checked out Arriba's for dinner last night.  I'd called ahead to ask if Arriba's makes their sour mix from scratch- it does.  I also inquired about happy hour-- from 3p to 7p, and reverse HH from 9p to closing, 12 oz. house margaritas are $0.99 each!  There's a short list of apps at 50% off, as well.He wanted to try the "margarita for two" on the rocks, as he's tried the house margarita on previous occasions.  Presentation was nice, and it tasted very good- not obnoxiously strong and not cloyingly sweet. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/arriba-mexican-grill-scottsdale?select=ZuAE6ZAXVIeGNKKMWbJogw#ZuAE6ZAXVIeGNKKMWbJogw  $7 during happy hour, which I thought was a steal, since the last time I shared a margarita that big (with sister) was at one of the restaurants on the San Antonio's touristy River Walk-- the margarita was $14!  Our drink last night had a LOT of ice, though, so we'll have to request for less ice next time, and there will BE a next time.  :)  Our server also suggested guacamole and chips, or a queso fundido app, so I chose the latter.  We both loved the cheese dip, despite the fact that my friend hates tomatoes and there were tomatoes mixed into the fondue. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/arriba-mexican-grill-scottsdale?select=fVPVC3W4MQx5SNDyVN1QMw#fVPVC3W4MQx5SNDyVN1QMw  The fondue/fundido also came with a dollop of chorizo.  I appreciated its spiciness, but found it too salty.  Due to my corn allergy, I requested for fried flour tortilla chips for dipping, and thankfully, the kitchen obliged!  Awesome service, so far, which reminds me kudos to our server Chance! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/arriba-mexican-grill-scottsdale?select=F8pySbJ7wQ_z3O5Bj-u5eQ#F8pySbJ7wQ_z3O5Bj-u5eQ  Friend didn't enjoy the flour tortilla chips as much as I did, so he asked for regular corn tortilla chips, and again, Chance and kitchen gratified.My friend was going to order the enchiladas, and I told him I was going to try Arriba's pollo con queso.  He's had it before, so he decided that we'd just share the entree.  Fine by me, since I don't ever finish an entree at the restaurant, anyway.  (I always take leftovers home.)  The entree was a deep-fried chicken burrito, split three-ways, and smothered with three different cheeses. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/arriba-mexican-grill-scottsdale?select=hzYXTqkmjXz9IOQ-AjgVoA#hzYXTqkmjXz9IOQ-AjgVoA  I don't know what kind of cheeses, and the menu online does not state what they are, but I liked the white variety the best- it's a softer cheese, which equals meltier, creamier, more sensual cheese to me!  He liked one of the dark yellow cheeses.  Will have to get more info on our next visit.  I wonder if I may order this dish with just the one type of cheese?  Hmm... further investigation of the menu is needed!  ;)My friend doesn't have a sweet tooth, and none of the desserts really caught my eye last night, except perhaps the ones with ice cream; However, Arriba uses Good Humor ice cream, and these contain corn syrup, so I must say no.  Only the best, for the most part, para mi, por favor!Can't wait to take Mom here.  I've already told her about the dinner and shown her the photos, and she looks very interested.  :D

Review Text :
4/11/11It's been so long since I could enjoy bagels, since most are made w/ corn syrup and/or other additives and preservatives, that when I found out a couple of weeks ago, via online inquiry, that the bagels here aren't made w/ cornmeal, cornstarch, corn syrup, or baking powder, I knew I had to try this place!  By sheer luck, the day after the email notification came through, I was able to take advantage of a groupon for LSaB!  (However, that will have to wait another time to be used.)  As if I needed a third excuse to try this cafe, I found out that this venue is in the vicinity of where I work.  How lucky am I??After a bit of adventure locating this place using the Yelp mapping directions, and then driving around the busy complex looking for a spot, I entered the cafe.  It seemed like luck was on my side again, bec. this place got busy right after I placed my order.  (BTW, business is still brisk as I'm typing this review!)  I couldn't decide what to try, so I decided to do two bagels: a French toast (w/ maple syrup and bacon bits baked in!) w/ honey-whipped peanut butter (Skippy-brand), and a sesame seed bagel w/ Nova lox cream cheese.  I asked that half of the bagels be toasted for me to eat here, so that I may take the other halves to-go.  No problem, said owner Michelle, and she gave me the spreads "on the side," so that I may have leftovers to take w/ me, as well.  I really like the personable service here, and I appreciate the patience and consideration shown to me by both Michelle and her employee in looking up ingredients for me.  Spotting the book I was holding (Picoult's Sing You Home), Michelle asked me if I was enjoying it (yes!), as she had just finished reading it herself last night.  Did I know that Picoult visits LSaB when she's in town??  What an interesting day that would be for me if I were to run into her on a future visit!  :)Anyhoo, to make a long story as short as possible, I will say that I enjoyed the bagels so much, that I decided to try a third one- the wholegrain whole wheat bagel (again, half to-go), and I also ordered a small coffee.  Michelle uses the local roaster Espressions, which I was happy to hear since I have enjoyed Espressions in the past.  The wholegrain wheat bagel is definitely more dense than the other two, which were made w/ white flour.  LSaB also offers a fluffier honey whole wheat bagel made w/ a whole wheat and white flour blend.  Since I already had the sugar in the honey-whipped peanut butter to contend w/, I decided to go w/ the denser oatmeal-topped wholegrain bagel, which indeed was heartier and chewier than the other two- I liked it!Can't wait to return, w/ or w/out the groupon!(FYI, the bacon served here is from a local distributor, and while it doesn't contain celery juice/salt, it does contain cornstarch-- corn allergy sufferers beware.)

I have been racking my brain to think of nice things to say about Morton's:* They plastic wrap they use on the "selection tray" is very shiny:)* They have single malt scotch:)* The lighting is very low if you have light sensitivity problems:)* The steaks are better than the steaks at Lonestar or Outback or the buffet at Eagles Nest in the casino:)I want to say something nice, because that's how I was raised.But I'm having trouble.Was the food really bad?...Well, no it wasn't a horror show...although medium rare isn't that hard to achieve...I shouldn't have to put up with an over cooked steak (I don't like to send food back when dining with clients...doesn't send the right message)Was the service inept or ill-mannered?...Not really, although being asked if everything is "to my liking" after every third bite can become cloying (I suppose it's in the manual somewhere:)Was the bill really that bad?...Well, my prospective clients actually took me to dinner, so I didn't pay, but I did see the bill...$460 for the three of us, so not as much as some but for that kind of dough I do expect a better meal:)Morton's seem to have become the McDonald's of steakhouses (as contrasted with Ruth's Chris...the Burger King of steakhouses:)They are safe...You won't get the wildly uneven results that you'll find with say...a Mastro's location:)You always know where the toilet is:)...and the bar:)...and the coat room:)...and etc.:)You always know where the rib-eye is located on the "selection tray":)But the preparation of the food is pedestrian, the presentation is uninspired, the sides are uninspiring and the whole feel is formulaic and dated:(I do expect more at this price point and Morton's just doesn't deliver these days:(So, just like MickieD's, I only go to Morton's these days, when I am dragged (or is it "drugged":)Are there worse dining experiences?...oh you bet...we could still be dealing with The Pink Taco:)Bought by corporate Landry's (and the Camelback location closed) this former steak giant is headed south, and fast.What do you think about when you think, "Morton's"?--strangely tan vinyl booths (yes, I've seen them in Chicago, and I finally get it)--sinatra standards--bow ties--to be shown what a beefsteak tomato looks like (from the cart)--to be shown what a life lobster looks like (the poor kiddo)--to be shown what a porterhouse looks like (oh, YUM)--crabcakes--AND THE BEST DARNed steak you can get in town, _no matter the cut_--don't forget the sprigs of watercress, my favorite.But Landry's isn't having it. A multi-million dollar brand is taking a new direction:#no more Sinatra#no more cart#maitre'd has no tux#limited Champagne options; $160 Tatt is a plain ripoff.Steakhouses are a dime-a-dozen these days and with Eddie V's nearby putting on the Ritz with live jazz and magnums of the Heitz Martha's Vineyard _besides great steaks_, Landry's Morton's won't be here for long.

Whenever I crave Chinese food, which is often because I AM Chinese, I hop in my car and drive 27.1 miles down to this place for several reasons.1) It's authentic.2) It tastes reliably great every time I go.3) There isn't another Chinese place on the north side of town that serves anything comparably good.I know the young college kid/busboy/waiter that Madi D. mentioned and yeah, there are times when he's a little space brained but it's not intentional and for the most part, he's pretty attentive to customers.  So yeah, the service may not be a 5 but once you get to know the people working there, they take care of you.  While I agree that it shouldn't matter because a patron is a patron but still - this is just how it is... My favorite dishes from this place include:* Eggplant and garlic sauce* Beef stew* Porridge* Salty fish & chicken fried rice* Four season beans* Beef noodles* Bitter melonIt's all very tasty and believe me, I wouldn't drive over 50 miles round trip several times a week just so I could yelp about it later.  I've brought many friends and family here and will continue to do so in the future because it's just that damn good.If you see me there, feel free to introduce yourself, you can tell if I'm there because my oil dripping car will be in the parking lot (read my review for Right Toyota!).Cheers!cProbably my mother's favorite place for siu laap!  Since she lives in Glendale, I'm often asked to be the delivery gal to bring her roasted duck, boiled chicken with the head still on, and roasted pork whenever she needs to do some Chinese ceremonial tradition.  If it's not me she's forcing to do the grunt work, it's one of her co-workers.  Regardless, even if it's on the east side, it will always show up to Mommy W. fresh!I first came across this place when my friend invited us out for dinner.  It seemed to have all your Americanized and authentic foods.  Service can be a bit of a wait but it's definitely worth your time.  Kudos to the chef for making such amazing flavorful food.  Prices are reasonable and the place is clean.  I haven't tried any of their lunch specials but my friend says they're pretty decent.  They make a delicious Mussels with Black Bean Sauce and their Salt & Pepper Shrimp is pretty amazing as well.  And there's nothing like some rice soup [aka porridge] when you want something warm.  It's the Asian chicken noodle soup [comfort food].  I stick with either the pork with the century egg or the fish fillet porridge.  Momma W. makes it best but Best Hong Kong Dining is a close second.  The only reason why I don't frequent here as often as I should is because parking is always a pain.  There are some other eateries and a grocery store in this strip plaza so parking can be pretty sketchy.  You know us Asian drivers.  Look out!  :P

How simple, yet intricate can a country breakfast be? What makes it different than a breakfast you would make yourself, or grab in the city? Is it because it's made with love, made with lots of fat, or is it because you're not in a rush to eat it? Probably all of the above. I was starving and taking a drive with Mr. Hottie and Erin. We were passing through Wickenburg and I wanted breakfast. I suggested we stop at a cafe we passed. When we walked in, it seemed as though the whole town of Wickenburg was in the cafe! It was packed and hopping full of locals. We city slickers seemed to stick out like sore thumbs. Oh well, no matter, we were greeted warmly. An adorable old man gestured for Mr. Hottie to come over and lend an ear. He told him that if we were thinking of leaving, to "wait. This is the best breakfast". Soon after, a table cleared out. We were greeted by a very friendly waitress who gave us time to look over the menu after taking our drink orders. I always want a little of everything when I go to breakfast. I decided on a bacon cheddar omelet with a side of hashbrown, and sausage gravy and one pancake..whew! I don't mess around with breakfast, my friends! I sipped on my OJ and played black jack (cards are at the table) with my breakfast partners. It wasn't very long until our food arrived. My OJ was refilled and my hot, steamy food was delivered. My omelet was FLUFFY and full of cheese and bacon! The hashbrowns were fresh cut, and well cooked. I was a happy girl. I poured the sausage gravy over the top of the omelet. PURE PURE HEAVEN!! This is THE BEST sausage gravy I have EVER had. I wanted to spoon it into my mouth! The sausage wasn't fatty (chunks of fat mixed with meat), it was flavorful with just a hint of spice. The gravy was also seasoned well. My pancake was HUGE. It was bigger than a regular sized dinner plate and fluffy! Oh my goodness it was so good! Of course I didn't finish my food, but I surely tried! I think I waddled out of the restaurant! We didn't eat anything else until we got back into Phoenix around 7pm if that tells you how filling and delicious our breakfasts were! I'm looking forward to the next road trip that takes me back to the New Frontier Cafe! The service was great and the food was delicious!

I really should explore not-so-attractive strip malls more because some of them have hidden gems like this one. After you are seated by the gracious hostess, you will have the challenging task of choosing from so many tempting dishes listed in the menu. The food is VERY flavorful, the curries really rich (watch for the heat, though; even "mild" packs a respectable kick), and the prices are great! Four and a half stars, probably going up to five with future visits.Who would have thought that such a hole-in-the-wall spot in a semi-suspect location would have such great food?  Luckily, my fellow yelpers pointed me in the right direction, since I never would have stumbled upon this gem on my own.Since I was dining with a group, I was able to sample a wide variety of items, and my stomach was so happy for the variety.  The many appetizers I tried were delicious.  I particularly enjoyed the papaya salad, Thai toast, and fried tofu bites.  For dinner, we had the veggie curry and pineapple fried rice.  Both were delicious, well-seasoned, and made perfect leftovers the next day.Despite the drive, this has moved into the top spot on my Thai take-out list.  Be sure to be patient if you come with a large group - there is only one server and one cook.  However, if you don't mind a leisurely pace (and perhaps refilling your own water), the food will make you smile!I came to Siamese Kitchen with 19 other Yelpers and we plowed through much of the menu and overwhelmed the kitchen but they were gracious and didn't mind when I jumped in to help clear tables and keep the food moving.Wow, that was a run-on sentence.Overall the food was really good and the service was good as well.  They did have a hard time keeping up (as most restaurants would when 20 people order at once) but were good natured about some of us jumping in now and then to bus tables or refill water.I really enjoyed the Yellow curry although I would order it hotter next time.  Dottsy ordered her pad thai hot and the leftovers came home with me...too hot for most.All of the dishes I tried (7-8) were nice and flavorful.I will keep Siamese Kitchen in mind for lunch when I'm in the neighborhood, good stuff and good prices.

You know, I'm surprised over these other reviews.Sure the layout is bit awkward, the lighting is always a tad bad, and the negotiations needed to grab a table is a bit disappointing, but I do love me some Rae's.First off, it's a Bar and Grill.  And it's always pretty empty when I'm there.  The owner/lady is always sitting in the same booth going over whatever owners/ladies do in a restaurant.  I don't know if it's unprofessional, but it is a little poor in taste seeing her on a phone with stacks of paperwork in front of her - and it's one of the first things I saw.I've frequented this place dozens of times because the food, despite the fact that it's a Bar and Grill, is severely underrated.  I've had the chicken fingers, the taco salad, the tuna melt, the hamburger (with bleu cheese crumbles is the way to go), the fish and chips, and prime rib:  all are very good.  All are well flavored.  Put it this way: I've never had something here I didn't like a lot.Speed of service isn't terrible, but it can work in your favor if you have nowhere to be.  A gripe here is the cups.  They are so small (12 ounces-ish) that I feel like I'm at the kid's table.  Wouldn't be a problem if A) I wasn't thirsty ever again or B) the waitress was more attentive.All of this to say:  Is it my favorite place?  No.  Would I want to frequent it every day?  No.  But based on how close I do work to Rae's, it's not bad.  And I usually leave there (despite the atmosphere and mediocre service) pretty satisfied.  Try it out?  Could be good.

This place is hit or miss. Sometimes the food can be superb and sometimes it could be just average. I do have to say that I do come here every now and then for my Taiwanese food fix. My usual suspects as far as dishes ordered here are the 3 cup chicken, braised fish, pork with chives and bean curd, various cold dishes and noodle dishes. Not a bad spot to eat usually.

I was running some Errands out in Gilbert and it was far past lunch time. So I thought, I will stop at the next place I see.There it was Subway located inside a strip mall. As soon as I walked in I noticed how clean it was. There were several customers inside and it was nicely decorated.I really do not know how long it has been there since I do not get out here too often. But, now with all the new building it is getting very busy out in these parts.Anyway, Vijay was my sandwich maker. He did a great job. One thing they do not carry Gluten Free, which is something I think everyone should go to now. I got the Philly Steak Sandwich and you can get anything you want on it which I think is great!  He even toasted it for me. Napkins are not out so you have to ask for them.  I keep noticeing this in a lot of places. I don't know why, but I hate not having enough.  However, he gave me more and I was on my way. Food tasted fresh and that is all I ask for.Lots of parking in the lot. I wish they still did the punch cards for Subway, but I know that went away a long time ago.

When my brother and our friend Ron asked if I wanted to join them for lunch today, I said yes before I realized where they were going... I was super hungry! Although I've been to Chipotle just a couple of times before, I have to say, I'm not as big a fan as everyone else seems to be.  Reason being - both their corn relish and chunky salsa have a ton of onions in them... yuck!But, I was hungry and needed some quick fuel, so I decided to tag along with the boys. I will admit, that for fast food, Chipotle doesn't seem so bad.  I ordered the chicken salad and although I would've liked some corn or tomato salsa without onions, the rest of the options were tasty; especially the guac!I will agree with Zack that Steve, the new GM, and Sam, his apprentice, treated us like VIPs.  Never before have I been approached by the GM at a fast food restaurant like that.  (Then again, I rarely eat fast food).  Needless to say, it was impressive. If I need some quick food, I won't hesitate to return to Chipotle, it grew on me quite a bit today!When I'm craving Mexican Food, I always get tempted by Chipotle to stop by and grab a Steak Burrito.  That's exactly what happened a couple of weeks ago....I couldn't shake the image of a delicious Steak Burrito, so I dropped by this location to satisfy my craving.When I arrived, there were 6 people ahead of me however it didn't take too long for the line to move.  I ordered my usual here....Steak Burrito w/Rice, Pinto Beans, Cheese, Guacamole, Sour Cream, and the Spiciest Salsa.It only took a few seconds after sitting down for me to take a bite.....yep, it was just as good as I had imagined.  My all day craving was finally satisfied!  Needless to say, I devoured that bad boy in no time.Overall, it was a pleasant experience at Chipotle.  I like this location and will definitely return.Return  Factor - 95%I love Chipotle. I can eat it everyday if I could. I've been going to this location pretty much since I moved into my house and their service and quality of food have gotten worse. Last time I was here I wanted guacamole in my bowl. They were out of it. I simply asked if they meant for now or they're going to make more for the entire evening. The girl looked at me like I was crazy and didn't understand what I meant because I had to repeat myself three times. I came back today to get a bowl for myself and a steak burrito for boyfriend. After they did the burrito, as they came to my bowl, they were out of both steak and white rice. I told them I don't even want it then. Note to chipotle, order/ make enough food to last you the entire day. Half the line behind me walked out. Distance doesn't matter at this point because I won't be back to waste my time if they don't even have half the items I want in my bowl.Definitely nothing wrong with this location per se. Standard Chipotle decor, food and quality of food. I've never had a bad experience coming here and I have to admit I frequent Chipotle quite often. (We don't have this chain in Hawaii and there's just something about it that keeps me coming back for more.)I'm a fan of the chicken burrito bowl with brown rice (with my tortilla on the side sometimes) with extra lettuce and corn salsa yummm!My only gripe is the parking lot. It takes quite a few twists and turns to get into the parking lot from Sunset and once in the lot, it's a little narrow so I usually like parking further away and walking those few extra steps.

We came here for a business lunch. The restaurant was completely empty so we had our choice of seating and opted for a booth. Our server greeted us immediately and took our drink order. They have a happy hour special 3-7pm daily for those looking to imbibe and enjoy small bites. We ordered off the regular lunch menu. I had their lobster bisque which was very underwhelming. I will always and forever love Brio's lobster bisque. As my entree I had FRESH CATCH PONTCHARTRAIN - broiled tilapia fillets, lump blue crab, mushroom ragoût, white wine cream sauce; rice pilaf & broccoli crown. I thought it was very well prepared and delicious, especially for it being tilapia. I also sampled some of their fish and chips and Shrimp Jambalaya and decided that my option was by far the tastiest. Unless a client insists on lunch or dinner here, I would not come back. It is not cheap and the food quality and taste do not warrant the price.

As Karen K says in her review of this restaurant, this address is WRONG!**** Yelp has since changed the address! Now you can all find your way to ONO! *** BUT, boy can I say that although this place hasn't gotten much attention on Yelp, it's certainly gotten enough attention to stay open for 15 years! I had a short but friendly conversation with the older man who works there. (I'm sure he's probably one of the owners OR SOMETHING, and I thought it was cute he was in a shirt, slippahz and shorts!) They are closed on Mondays, which is an odd day, but at least they are available for Sunday church-goers! The menu is extensive, and they have pictures of almost everything they serve up on the walls, along with some interesting pictures and a few local articles. The food is amazing and portions are generous! It is Local/Hawaiian style food from a hole-in-the-wall mom & pop sort of place, so don't expect wonderful presentation or anything, but the taste is definitely there. In fact, they have some of the best mac salad I've tried... WAAAAY better than L&L's hands down! I've been there twice, and have had a chance to eat the Sweet & Sour Spare Ribs, THEY FALL RIGHT OFF THE BONE! and taste just like home... MMM and the second time I went I had the Beef Sukiyaki! It was much bigger than what most Japanese restaurants would serve and it came with rice. My boyfriend had the Combo Adobo the first time. He preferred the chicken Adobo over the pork, and the second time we went, he had the special that came with Lomi-Lomi Salmon, Kalua Pig, & Lau Lau. EVERYTHING WAS GREAT! Also, the both times we've went large families have come in and dined as well. I'm talking about 15-20 people all at once! They also got taken care of well, considering that there is one cook, and one server. Amazing how they handle themselves!If I lived closer to this, I'd definitely be getting take out more often... but I'd say it is worth the drive, regardless. If you're looking for some "local kine grindz"  this is a spot to hit. They get the flavors right on, and at the same time offer friendly & casual service.OH, and they have shave ice!!! THE REAL SHAVE ICE! NOT "snow-cones" and they are only $1.75 for up to 3 flavors (if I'm remembering correctly.) You can even add ice cream for a small extra charge. Talk about feeling like you're back on da 'aina. Thank goodness for Hawaiian Hale.

After having a pretty good experience at the last L & L http://www.yelp.com/biz/t8HbRjam5R1z0hH0I4WajQ?hrid=nX30_xaimagO3kJ_TMQSVQ, I was craving for more of it.  However, instead of going to the S. Maryland Parkway one in Vegas, I was at the N. Stephanie location in Henderson.As always, I had a regular order of pork lau lau.  It was about $7 and came with two small scoops of rice and one small scoop of mac salad.  The mac salad was creamy and peppery.  Imagine my surprise though to find not one, but TWO pork lau laus in my order!  Wow!  They were already getting four stars just for serving up two of these babies.  In all my years of ordering this stuff, I have never gotten two in a regular order.  (They never offer a mini order of pork lau lau either.)  However, the pork lau lau was a bit watery.  It wasn't dry, thank gawd.  But it lacked flavor.  I had to douse it with a lot of soyu, unfortunately.  They did have a good amount of pork and fatty goodness in there though.The BF requested a combo with Chicken Katsu and Hawaiian BBQ Short Ribs.  His order cost $7.70.  Upon opening the box, he saw the chicken was a bit darker than he would have preferred, either it's from over-frying it, or old oil.  I think it was from the former because the katsu was really crunchy.  His order was surprisingly large and we both ended up with leftovers.  His short ribs had a distinctive sauce on the ribs, like they put the sauce on top of it after it was cooked.Cleanliness of the store was an issue here.  Initially, we were seated at a booth and saw this red sauce on the wall.  "Uh, is that hot sauce?"   "Yeah."  "Uh, okay then...let's move."  There is hot sauce up on these walls, and dark marks too that I think a good wipe down would take care of.  They obviously have a leak in their ceiling as you can see by the dark water stains from above.  And it's just a bit grimy here.  I don't think anything bothers to clean up the tables or seats here.  Sidenote: They do offer a weekday lunch special.  For $4.95, you get  a choice of chicken katsu, BBQ chix, or BBQ pork, and it comes with a 16 oz soda, their daily appetizer, rice, and mac salad.Overall, I give them four stars for the amount of food you're getting for the price.  In terms of quality, that's where the stars go down.  And plus, stuff on the walls should always bring your star mark down too.  Take your order to go so you won't have to see the grime.

I tried to take the family here for dinner 3 times.  Each time, we were told the wait was 30+ minutes.  Since I hate waiting and they don't take reservations, we passed and went somewhere else.  On the 4th attempt, The Better Half went ahead of time to put our name on the list so that I could join them later when we got seated....it worked perfectly.  I was in a business meeting and she timed it perfectly so that I was able to make it right after my meeting.We ordered:AppetizersSpinach Artichoke Diphttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_ZwDLtBopUHb6F2mIPFUJg?select=kmUXZrIRtqqJbOxfJeksrwSweet Potato Frieshttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_ZwDLtBopUHb6F2mIPFUJg?select=0FNCsaKdjoPOayWsFC8x5wPizzas10" Thin Crust - Onions, Green Peppers, Sun-Dried Tomatoes, Jalapenos, Mushrooms, Gorgonzola Cheesehttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_ZwDLtBopUHb6F2mIPFUJg?select=dD0jzKpj2Oh-eaE7sVvLZw8" Thick Crust - Pepperoni, Sausagehttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_ZwDLtBopUHb6F2mIPFUJg?select=VxSsA7mn7xU0QCmvjHrfUg10" Thick Crust - Anchovies, Mushrooms, Gorgonzola Cheese, Onionshttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_ZwDLtBopUHb6F2mIPFUJg?select=HOLWbqCsw7-cPBoyFTY19QYeah....we were hungry!  We ordered too much food and had to take a lot of it home.The Pizzas were cooked well done, per our request.  We enjoy well done Pizza.  Because the ingredients are fresh, it took 45 minutes for the Pizzas to come out.  I had the Thin Crust.  After such a long wait, I had high expectations....unfortunately, I was disappointed.  It was just OK.  The Crust didn't have much flavor and the ingredients, while fresh, didn't hit my taste buds on a positive note.....damn.The rest of the family felt the same way about their Pizzas.  Kiddo had the Thick Crust Pepperoni & Sausage....he too is a Pizza lover like me and he said his was just OK.  Mom & The Better Half had the other Pizza and they too were underwhelmed.The Appetizers were the highlight of the evening.  The Spinach Artichoke Dip was delish & the Sweet Potato Fries were awesome.Overall, it was an average dining experience.  Was it worth the long wait to get in, then the long wait to get your Pizza?  No.Return Factor - 10%

Review Text :
I was inspired to visit Casella's after a coworker told me about their authentically Italian goodness. As my tummy growled today, I was in the neighborhood so I knew just where to go. I walked into a simple yet clean deli. Immediately, I was welcomed by the entire staff (I believe they are all related or at least family through friendship). They asked me if it was my first time in and I said yes, so right away they started giving me a history of the shop and the tasty cuisine. Celebrating their 33rd anniversary (congrats!!), I learned that everything is homemade -- from the meatballs to the chicken salad. The owner said he goes through 40 lbs of chicken a week. He gave me a sample and the chicken was chunky and delicious. I'm not surprised he has to prepare so much chicken every week! The meatballs and freshly cut meat for Philly Cheese-steak sandwiches looked great too! The owner mentioned he is from Philly so better be ready for some authentic Philly and Italian style cookin'! While I was there, the owner was slicing some fresh provolone, so I added that to the warmed turkey sandwich I ordered. The turkey was tasty, the provolone was yummy and the sourdough roll tasted like it was fresh from the oven. It was $8 for a sandwich and soda but the sandwich was hefty enough that I saved half for later. As I walked out, everyone said goodbye to me and I felt like I was leaving a family dinner. In summary, here's what made Casella's stand out: - The very friendly staff- It's a local family-owned neighborhood deli celebrating their 33rd anniversary. Gotta support the local businesses! - Clean decor - Tasty, homemade food that's on display for visitors to see - A good family-style atmosphere that greets you the second you walk inside. I'm not sure how it's taken my so long to find this local treat, but now that I've found it, I plan on becoming a regular. Directions: Note that this is hidden in the Basha's strip mall (on the side of Granite Reef) but don't let that fool you!While I love each and every visit to Casella's, today was something special - Casella's was celebrating an anniversary - 34 years in business!!There is something to be said about good food and a friendly atmosphere that stands the test of time.  It is easy to see why this family-run business has been open for 34 years and counting.Since first discovering this local gem with my Favorite Yelper a few months ago, I have lost count of the number of visits we have made.  Each and every time, we are greeted like family.  Denise even remembers our order!  Well, to be honest, every customer is greeted like family.  That is one of the many reasons we can't stay away.The decor is unpretentious, and the wood-paneled, nostalgia-filled walls tell the story of years of being a staple in the community.  Don't be surprised if you are offered a taste of whatever is being sliced behind the counter - thank you again Joe, for that Provolone!  :)Ready to taste a little bit of heaven?  Order the Hot Italian Beef with Provolone.  Served on a soft yet slightly crisp roll with a side of Au Jus, I struggle to find words to describe how good this sandwich is.  Just try it.  You won't be sorry.  Maybe money can't buy you love, but it can get you a fantastic meal - Casella's is cash-only.I have decided that I want to be adopted by the Casella family.  Sorry mom, but if you ever taste one of Casella's sandwiches, you will understand...I met fellow Yelpers Brian S and Shannon M here and learned that it's all about the sandwich.  And feeling like you have walked on to a set for "That 60's show" or "That 70's Show".  It's pretty clear the owners of Casella's are focused on the sandwiches, not updating the decor.I had an Italian beef sandwich.  It was great.  And I sat and soaked up the 70's decor as the bread from my sandwich was soaking up the juice.This place is old school all the way - old school awesome.  F#%*ing A.  Now where's my Trans Am?This place was recommended by several Yelpers on the Talk board, so I decided to give it a shot for lunch one day.  Since everyone recommended the Italian Hoagie, I decided to order it.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/GTuAPBRsM5dVPqPy9oe14Q?select=wlDWkJfzaYGWqDVviW9-oghttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/GTuAPBRsM5dVPqPy9oe14Q?select=YIheIM7GeCTUlLRrczkM_QThe Bread on the Hoagie was pretty good, but I thought it was a little on the dry side.  Would have enjoyed a little more Oil in it.  The ingredients tasted fresh and it was a solid Sandwich.....not the best I ever had, but pretty good.  Will have to come back to try some of their other stuff.They're not open on Sundays, so I'll have to try and squeeze in a visit during the week.Return Factor - 85%I'm not sure how to write this review without telling a story. I normally don't write dissertations, favoring the short and sweet condensed review, so if it's a little verbose, bear with me as it's a story worth reading.We've heard about Casella's for years but have never eaten there, usually due to bad timing on our part as they close early on Saturday and are not open for business on Sundays. We finally made it there today during normal business hours.Not knowing what to expect, we decided prior to going in if we weren't impressed with the menu, or the joint itself, we'd give each other the signal and find another lunch place.Well we weren't impressed with the decor, the menu or the overall ambiance, so we gave each other the nod and started for the door. That's when the owner, Joe Casella stopped us.Recognizing us as newbies, he told us all about his restaurant,  the menu, and even offered us a taste of whatever we liked.We declined, perhaps being a bit skeptical.But then something interesting happened. Joe introduced us to his wife and two of his four daughters (who were on duty) and we were instantly enamored with this family. Who does that in 2011? Seriously. He asked our names and even shook my hand. Long story short, after talking with Joe for just a few short minutes, my wife and I gave each other a reverse nod, signaling our eagerness to try something...anything! We ordered a couple sandwiches on Joe's recommendation.The food was superb.The bread was one of the best rolls I've ever had and is enough reason by itself  to keep us coming back. Crusty and not overly breaded, it reminded me of the rolls in Atlantic City where the bread is pure perfection. Same for the sandwich ingredients, full of flavor and cooked just right.But the best part was how Joe came over to talk to us after finishing our meal. He wanted our candid opinion of the food and service.If there's any single reason for me to frequent this place, it's the genuine heartfelt sincerity of the owner and his family, not to mention the food!Sure, the decor is old and needs updating, but somehow, after meeting the family, and eating lunch, I didn't care about the decor, or the no-nonsense menu, or the layout. None of that mattered anymore. What mattered was the overall experience of a true family restaurant, their wholesome foods, and being in the company of genuinely warm people. In a time when most of us tend to rely on first impressions, judging the proverbial book by its cover almost caused us to miss out on the Casella's experience had it not been for Joe Casella taking our hand and welcoming us into his unique domain.Casella's took me back in time today, when my grandparents would often take me with them to the Italian deli for lunch. As they visited with the owner (in Italian), sipped espresso for what seemed like hours, and ate a slow lunch, I wanted to die. I remember sitting there in the booth fidgeting as they talked, hoping like hell we'd get out of there soon.I hated that experience as a kid.I loved it today as an adult, but more importantly, finally recognized and appreciated the gift my grandparents unknowingly gave me. Thank-You Joe

We were impressed with Golden Gate.We started with an order of Crab Angels.  $4.50 for 6.  They were plump and the filling had a much higher mixture of crab than most Chinese restaurants provide.We shared House Fried Rice, Triple Seafood Delight and House Special Chicken.  The fried rice had chicken, beef and shrimp.  The rice alone I would give 3 stars.  The seafood delight lived up to it's name.  I'm normally not a fan of the traditional white wine sauce on this dish but Golden Gate's is very nice.  The scallops were done just right, melt in your mouth.  The crab also was tender and cooked just right with no taste of fishiness.  The shrimp was slightly overdone but still very good.  The house special chicken was a whole chicken breast dipped in a thin coating and deep fried, then sliced and placed over a small serving of vegetables.  The chicken was very tender and flavorful with a robust brown sauce.My daughter had chosen the restaurant for her birthday dinner and they must have heard us mention it because after the meal they brought out fried dough pockets filled with banana and sprinkled with confectioners sugar.  Nice touch and very tasty.Our total bill was about $38, a great deal for the quality and quantity of service.  An appetizer, fried rice and 2 entrees shared among 4 people and we brought home 3 boxes of leftovers.Some people have said that this place serves the best Chinese food in the Valley.  Others say it sucks.  I have an opinion between the two extremes.Being from the San Francisco Bay Area, I have had a lot of Chinese food of all qualities and types.  This stuff was pretty mediocre, middle of the road stuff.  The place really does have the look of a 1970s Chinese joint as has been said by other reviewers.  They also have that little mini grill lit by sterno that they put on the table so you can cook meat on a stick (or burn it if you are not careful).  They don't have that back home. . .Sure, I'd eat there again some time, but this place can't compete even with the average Chinese restaurant in the Bay Area.  You will get a plate of quite edible food here for your dollar, will get good, attentive service, and will leave full--just don't expect anything special in terms of taste.

Yo, Yao serves Americanized Chinese food that is pretty good.  The food falls solidly in the 3-3.5 star range.In my only visit to Yao the service was definitely lacking.  I don't know if this is the norm or they were short-staffed.  I had to wave people down through the entire time I was at Yao to get:-refills on water-refills on tea-boxes to take home leftovers-the check-I finally gave up waiting for someone to take the bill and took it to the counter.I would try Yao again but probably just for takeaway.I came because of the high ratings, I stayed because of the low dinner prix fixe menu.  $10.75, after tax, will score you any one of their special menu entrees.  My Hamilton garnered me a small cup of egg flower soup, a sizable deep fried egg roll, 2 crab puffs (which I could partake in, as they are not made from real crab) and a plate of kung pao chicken with fried rice.The chicken was sparse, but the taste was ok.  But lets face it, why get Chinese when there's Thai?  Lesson learned

We found this place via Groupon and have eaten here several times.  It can get busy during the main dinner hours (6:30 - 8), so be sure to call ahead of time.  There's a small bar area on the left side of the restaurant if you're interested in dining solo or to grab some appetizers and drinks.  We prefer to sit in one of the booths in the main dining room.  During our visits, I've had the following items:Mozzarella Caprese & Bruschetta, $9.99http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-torretta-ristorante-scottsdale?select=or8bZj8bwnbM9IyObpUuRA#or8bZj8bwnbM9IyObpUuRACalamari, $10.99http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-torretta-ristorante-scottsdale?select=77WwI7Ut1lSoKKMR25xw4Q#77WwI7Ut1lSoKKMR25xw4QBreaded Ravioli, $7.99http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-torretta-ristorante-scottsdale?select=rrlu2zLgF8f-tFhw3bvVjw#rrlu2zLgF8f-tFhw3bvVjwCheese Ravioli, $15.99http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-torretta-ristorante-scottsdale?select=PnHlTuqTJksi0c1XDFKG9g#PnHlTuqTJksi0c1XDFKG9gCannelloni Fiorentino & Gnocchi (Baked Pasta filled with braised Veal, Chicken and Wild Mushrooms with Potato and Ricotta Pasta Dumplings), $22.99http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-torretta-ristorante-scottsdale?select=jdDIvDXs1Q0WV1ovGqDDmQ#jdDIvDXs1Q0WV1ovGqDDmQhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-torretta-ristorante-scottsdale?select=O9MptWALjOVNfDTKvLuNxA#O9MptWALjOVNfDTKvLuNxATortellini con Ricotta (Tortellini with sautéed Mushrooms in a Cream Sauce and Parmigiano Cheese), $18.99http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-torretta-ristorante-scottsdale?select=1FSj93ZjHABis7iarBfWxA#1FSj93ZjHABis7iarBfWxAGnocchi w/Cream Sauce & Cheese (special order), $18.99http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-torretta-ristorante-scottsdale?select=Vez8LJdi8YULSbMPATRT_A#Vez8LJdi8YULSbMPATRT_AVeal Scaloppini alla Parmigiana (Herb Veal Scaloppini baked with a Tomato Herb Sauce & Mozzarella Cheese served with Penne Marinara & Vegetable of the day), $29.99http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-torretta-ristorante-scottsdale?select=hm_q9fzAdOPjt0powPL1Dg#hm_q9fzAdOPjt0powPL1DgStuffed Shells w/Vegetables, $20.99http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-torretta-ristorante-scottsdale?select=J9vXuJUV2V5mxfyY4mlczA#J9vXuJUV2V5mxfyY4mlczAChocolate Lava Souffle (Cocoa-soaked Sponge Cake with a rich molten warm Godiva Chocolate center w/Vanilla Ice Cream), $8.95http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-torretta-ristorante-scottsdale?select=k2R5CnbA-ySqckl2aijSuw#k2R5CnbA-ySqckl2aijSuwThe Gnocchi is outstanding.

The Stuffed Shells are a special menu item and it isn't always available.  The rest of the menu items I've tried are pretty good as well.The customer service here is very good.  There are a couple of fun waiters who are always smiling and cracking jokes with you....they're also attentive to your dining needs.  Overall, it's a good dining experience.Return Factor - 90%

Review Text :
When it's my turn to cook, I pick up the phone an order Fuzzy's. Thin crispy crust pizza sliced in easy to handle squares - just the way I like it. I have had the opportunity to enjoy Fuzzy's dine-in, pick-up and delivery numerous times over the years. The owners have changed a few times and it has always been consistent. Fuzzy's is as close to Chicago-style pizza you can get without a plane ride. Vienna dogs, Italian beef , wings and pan pizza options are available. Chicago sports memorabilia and bold colors mark the decor. Good prices fast delivery gets a hot pie to the door.

Where do you go for some off strip sushi to die for? "I Love Sushi" of course. I didnt know what to expect especially from a place called I Love Sushi, let alone it being located in a strip mall. Boy we're we surprised. This place was huge and had about 20 sushi chefs working behind the counter. The place was packed on a Tuesday night. I think the place seats about 200 easily. Wow. The food was awesome. AWESOME. The rolls were about $12-15 each but boy were they worth it. I guess one of the gimmicks of this place is the names of the rolls. Screaming Orgasm, Taste Like My Ex Girlfriend, Fat A$$ Special, and so forth. Regardless about the name, the flavor was top top notch. This is definitely one of my favorite places to eat at. Even though the names and description mention "special chef sauce", they are all different sauces that are highly recommended by the sushi chefs. I read somewhere there was a total of 81 chefs that are employed there. Here's a list of rolls we had:(Check out the pictures I added to the I Love Sushi page. Warning: May cause a craving for some Sushi!)Jackpot Roll - I dont remember the exact description but its a fried tempura roll with spicy mayo sauce.Spider Roll - Soft Shell CrabScreaming Orgasm - Seared Tuna in chef special sauceFat Ass Roll - Tuna, salmon, yellowtail, white tuna, crab meat, avocado, deep fried panko, spicy mayo, hot sauce & eel sauce.I Love Sushi Special - Spicy tuna & cucumber topped with tuna & spicy special sauceDouble D roll - Raw Salmon and tuna on a roll and then into the yummy sauceDragon Roll - Lotsa lotsa Unagi.Baked Scallop MushroomAlright! Off season is officially over. I'm all settled in Vegas. It's time to get back to some good ole fashioned reviewing. I've got a lot of places to review but what better place to start than "I Love Sushi" because anyone that knows me, knows that I really LOVE sushi more than anyone!Cozily located in a strip mall in Henderson, I Love Sushi is one of the best sushi restaurants in Vegas, on or off the strip. The place is always bumping and the staff is always friendly. Although some of the roll names are less than desirable (example: Tastes Like Your Ex Girlfriend...) TMI and very SCARY DUDE! Not partaking in that one right off the bat, no offense! I'd use more examples but I am unable to find a copy of their heavily sexual connotated menu online. Poking fun at their menu's items is like fishing from a barrel.I recommend starting off with the oyster shooters. I order mine minus the quail egg. For those that are into the whole Rocky raw egg thing, have at it! You might want to even ask for my discarded ones as I've certainly discarded enough of them, although I can't guarantee they'll hook that up. Their oyster shooters set the mood quite nicely for date night. Gotta love those aphrodisiacs! Yum yum!I typically am a creature of habit when it comes to ordering sushi so I don't mean to bore anyone after this point. I love the Philly Roll + asparagus. Even better is their "spicy ponzu sauce" option which is not offered elsewhere at most other sushi bars.All in all, this place is one of the good ones. It's about as unpretentious as it gets and the quality is as good if not better as that that can be found at many of the high end strip sushi bars, without the lofty price tags. My name is Bobbi Billard and I approve of this message. I'm on a mission to become the Duchess of this restaurant... Stay tuned.Our friends Nicole B. and Steven S. begged us to try I Love Sushi, so after 6 years of avoiding it, I finally went.  Eric R. didn't think it would be a good deal since it is a la carte, and I heard it was all about pornographic-named rolls, so I wasn't expecting much.  Our friends made reservations, which we thought was weird for a local a la carte sushi joint, but lo and behold, there was a crazy wait at 7 and we skipped all of that.  The servers wore kimonos, and this place is really big for a sushi restaurant - less activity at the bar and more at tables around it.Our server was very friendly and efficient, and we had a private-esque booth.  I got iced green tea.  Steven S. does NOT love sushi, so he ordered a dinner bento with chicken and beef.  He got brown rice for a $1 charge.  Nicole B. got udon and the cherry blossom, a non-rice "roll" which is really a massive amount of soft shell crab chopped up and wrapped in avocado slices.Eric R. got the rainbow roll, ikura sushi, and had a few pieces of my nigiri order.  I went for it, and appreciated some interesting selections here.  I got hamachi, sake, saba, amaebi, uni, salmon skin temaki, and a quail egg shooter.When I got the first pieces, salmon and yellowtail, I immediately noticed the same problem Goyemon has - HOT rice, COLD fish.  YUCK!!!!  The sushi rice was hot and not really sushi rice, which is upsetting because 1) sushi is about the rice and 2) the mixed temperatures make everything taste weird.  Not okay.  The fish quality was fine enough, though the yellowtail was splitting apart at each seam so to speak.  I liked the salmon better.The mackerel was cured just fine and covered with my fave vegetable, green onions.  The uni was okay.  The salmon skin handroll was stuffed, and it was prepared with gobo, kaiware, cucumber, and avocado without sauce, which was very good.  The quail egg shooter had 3 quail egg yolks, masago, green onion, and ponzu which was different and tasty.  I got the amaebi last.  The sushi was good and the fried heads were enormous and covered in tempura batter.  They were on top of shredded daikon and served with ponzu.  I was very full after all of this, and I am glad I tried it finally.  However, there is no excuse for poor rice when sushi is about rice, so I do not see myself returning.This is where I broke my Las Vegas sushi cherry... TMI?After a long day of driving a U-Haul across the CA/NV stateline, lifting and unpacking boxes I was ready to eat, but I was sick of fast-food and pizza options. I yelped Sushi and this place popped up with 4 1/2 stars? Let's do this! I placed an order for pick-up and they said it would take about ten minutes. Hmmm, ten minutes for 2 orders of Udon Tempura and 2 Caterpillar Rolls? I decided to test this and arrived 8 minutes & 25 seconds later. "Hi, order for Tiffany?" (my GF) "Yup, right here...two orders of Udon Tempura and 2 Caterpillar Rolls"...whoa, this place is on it, but how does it taste?I brought it home and feasted. The Udon Tempura was very good and full of flavor. The tempura was delightful, not to greasy just lite and flaky. Poi-fect!The Caterpillar rolls you could tell were super fresh and delicious. These were definitely made to order. This place gets an easy 4 stars. I'm coming back to get the full restaurant experience soon. Maybe this will lead to an updated review and a added star?So I guess I recently went on a sushi splurge. What can I say? I love sushi! HahThis place was hustling and bustling the Friday night that I came. We had a group of 8 people and they accommodated all of us very nicely in one booth. It was my first time here so I didn't know what to expect. It's a sushi/Japanese restaurant run by Koreans with waitresses in kimonos. Interesting.. Let's start off by the saying that the specialty sushi roll menu is.. well.. extensive. Like really extensive. There are so many options.. maybe too many options for my indecisiveness haha.. The sushi was not bad though. I ordered the Ryan roll which was basically a crunchy shrimp tempura roll with maguro and special sauce. It was quite tasty.Our service was great! Considering how busy the place was, our server was really attentive and fun. So why just the 4 stars? I was a little thrown back by the price of the rolls. My roll was $15 already. I was a little disappointed to find out they didn't have a AYCE option but it is what it is. (I think people from Hawaii are just too spoiled with cheap food) They also have bento boxes/dinner specials that also looked yummy. I would give those a try if I come back next time!I love sushi, but not so sure if I love it here.  There are many pros to this place, but here's why I thought it was just A-OK.Walking in, you're greeted and waited by waitresses/servers dressed in kimonos (cute).  It was busy going to lunch on Saturday, but there was plenty of seating.  We decided to sit at the sushi bar.  I'm not exactly a fan of sitting at a low sushi bar where I have to look up to talk to the sushi chefs.  It's just awkward.  Tuna Karai, Candy Cane Roll, and the super white tuna nigiri (ono) are what we ordered. The Tuna Karai:  $16.50 for a bowl.  You can go to Sumo Sushi and get a Tuna Karai for $14.00 and double the amount.  This was good, but not $16.50 good.  I love softshell crab, and I'm glad that I Love Sushi has a variety of sushi rolls that include softshell crab.  I decided to try the Candy Cane Roll.  There wasn't any sauce on it.  The flavor was just okay.  It had a weird after taste to it.  It was also a bit too salty too.  Just a weird flavor.  The super white tuna nigiri (ono) was probably my favorite.  They give you a generous amount of ono sushi.  Great with a piece of wasabi and soy sauce.  Maybe I'll come back and give this place another chance in the future, but for now, it was just okay.

Review Text :
It's almost as if Cucina Tagliani doesn't even exist. Despite its visible location right off the Loop 101 freeway, I've never seen a wait. To some that might be a good thing; in my opinion, if it's too easy it's probably not worth it. And Cucina Tagliani proves that it isn't worth it time and time again. Lets start with first impressions: tacky and unoriginal. The whole interior is decorated to look like some small Italian village or something. Oh gee, I've never seen that look before...Oh, wait isn't that what every Italian place looks like? The food is so-so. Nothing special at best, and downright disgusting at worst. They don't even have spaghetti and meatballs. This place fills the Italian restaurant stereotype to a tee, and then they don't offer traditional Italian fare. It just doesn't make sense. The service is just terrible. They never have enough people to keep everything running smoothly, and the waitresses are so fake. Working in the food industry myself, I'm not the kind of customer that asks for three sides of ranch after my food is already at the table. But even if you order the simplest items, the waitresses will still treat you like they'd want nothing more than to poke your eyes out with the rolled utensils. With this deadly combination it's no wonder Olive Garden has a 45 minute wait at any given time, and Tagliani can't even fill the dining room.

I just moved to AZ so I haven't "been around" yet.  But, I did go to Pong Pong Restaurant. Let me start here... I love Chinese food.  I have been to many different types of Chinese food restaurants.  I usually order won ton soup...and that's what I did at Pong Pong.  I took my first sip of soup and it tasted like someone poured the entire contents of a pepper shaker in my soup.  I couldn't eat it, so I returned it to get another soup that was completely disgusting.  Let me describe the soup: DIRTY GAS STATION TOILET BOWL WATER.I also ordered the chicken chow mein combo - which includes pork fried rice.  The chow mein did not have any taste and smelled funny.  I noted 5 small chucks of chicken in the whole plate. The rice was favorless and had a spackle-type texture.  Last, but certainly not least, my pepsi was flat.  How do we screw up SODA, people?My husband ordered the sweet and sour chicken, which looked more like vomit than anything.  No part of this dinner was good, not even remotely good.  The place isn't the cleanest either.  My husband said the unisex toilet was filled to the very top with water (I didn't have the pleasure of witnessing this).  If you were sitting down, you would have drown.So we blew $17.00 and ate about 5 bites each of what we ordered.  Big waste of money.  I was surprised I didn't get sick to my stomach when I got home, my stomach ached for the rest of the night.  Every time I drive by Pong Pong, I think Puke, Puke.So, if you are into getting ripped off and eating crappy food, I recommend Pong Pong!  :)

I came here last night to see Bobby Yang and his Unrivaled Players in their only Las Vegas concert!  I'm not usually at bars but this was an exception and I had to go hear Bobby and his group.The bar is called a dive bar and I guess you could say it is although it was a lot nicer than I was expecting and there was a lot less smoke than I thought there would be.  The place is small.  A narrow aisle past the bar to the performance area in the back is the only space to move around.  As we gathered in the back, we tended to block the entrance to the ladies room.  The bartender from whom I got my Coke was very kind and the price was right.  There were some problems with mic feedback at times, but nothing serious.  The band rocked the joint and it was great fun to see and hear a friend lead his band with his great fiddle playing!It was a fun night and the Lounge was great.  I'd like to go back sometime and get photos of the whole Frank Bowers mural behind the bar.  Bowers was a Los Angeles mural painter who is said to have painted this mural to pay off a bar tab.

Restaurant name  Pho Vietnam Restaurant

Review Text :
I used to think this is my favorite pho in Vegas but now I'm not so sure.  I recently went and ordered the dac biet with extra tendon.  The broth is pretty good, it's not as sweet as Pho Kim Long and not as salty as Pho Saigon 8.  The extra tendon I ordered was way undercooked - so it was yellow and a little chewy.The worst part of the meal was that my server decided to sit at the table next to me and start clipping her finger nails.  I was so worried that a little piece of her nail was gonna get in my soup that it ruined my dining experience.  She had her back to me and I'm pretty sure it was her fingernails she was clipping, but I kept worrying it was her toenails.  Either way f'ing disgusting.In the past, breakfasts in Vegas for me meant huge buffets or overpriced Starbucks meals... or it was an especially rough night, overpriced room service. However, this last visit to Vegas opened a whole new world for me. This was the trip where I realized that pho, my favorite morning after meal, was available to me even in Las Vegas! Pho Vietnam is located in a huge, sprawling Asian plaza with a 99 Ranch and Volcano Tea. It's a combo pho place and Chinese food restaurant, which would normally make me wary, but my friend the pho expert vouched for its delicious broth. I ended up going with the bbq pork and egg roll bun, my favorite selection when I'm not feeling like soup. It was a huge serving for about $7, with deliciously crispy egg rolls and lots of veggies, including pickled carrots and radishes, which I'm not typically used to on this dish. I did think the pork was a little bit dry but still very flavorful. The place is really simple and straightforward, like most good Asian places tend to be. The tables were filled with fellow hungover partiers who know that pho heals all bad decisions. Definitely a new go-to during my trips to Vegas!CHEAP MEALS CLOSE TO VEGAS can be found in the vegas "chinatown" where the asian food resides!!I was skeptical that this restaurant would be mediocre because it was a vietnamese & chinese fusion restaurant BUT i ordered my ~$3 banh mi regardless... lots of bread! it was just okay ... the EGGROLLS on the other hand were surprisingly delicious!! ANOTHER vegas budget meal for those gamblers who've lost too much money at the tables!... but beware, you get what you pay forThe holidays are upon us which means I run screaming away from my family. No joke. I ended up a Pho Vietnam on Thanksgiving afternoon when a few friends didn't have plans until later and I got skip out on the family.Since it was Thanksgiving, we decided to head to China Town and we all decided on Pho. Entering the complex, we spotted Pho Vietnam and headed up the staircase.The restaurant is large and has multiple large tables. This was definitely a place you came to with the whole family. The restaurant was busy, spaced a little tightly, and was nothing pretty or noteworthy.We were sat right away, water and tea arrived shortly after, Vietnamese Iced Coffee, Pho, & Spring Rolls were ordered. I was bummed the Iced Coffee isn't steeped at the table. I love watching and smelling it brew, then swirling in the lightly sweetened condensed milk. Also, how long was the premade iced coffee been sitting. Answers I never got; nonetheless, the iced coffee was delightful.Our Pho came out, it was a decent portions, and a decent price. For me, a great pho has an amazing broth. A simple, yet complex flavor profile. I don't like to add anything other than veggies and spice to my Pho. I had no choice but to try and spruce this up. The broth was less bland than the time I tried instant Ramen. Meh. Our waitress disappeared and our spring rolls were MIA. I made eye contact with another staff member at another table, she rushed over, grabbed our spring rolls. The Spring Rolls were deep fried and that's all I can tell you about that. They were fried, you couldn't taste the vegetables inside, which were just mushy and off color. Not even fish sauce could save it. It was, for a lack of a better term, gross.I won't return to Pho Vietnam: poor service (which doesn't deter me from the dankest of the dank), lackluster flavor profiles, and a menu with nothing that you wouldn't find at any other hole in the wall Vietnamese joint.I originally came here to eat at Capital Seafood Restaurant, not realizing that it shares a space with Pho Vietnam. With two menus to choose from, I ordered from both!The Combination Pho #2 has flank steak, tripe, and meatballs (my favorite!) and a solid, complex broth. This was better than another nearby version I had recently, but not the best I've had in town. Amount of noodles was extremely generous.  I only had a little of this dish, BF at the majority and felt ill afterward.Service was typical for Chinatown plaza- you order, you receive your food, and you have to hunt them down for anything else.

Restaurant name  C-Fu Gourmet
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
After reading all the reviews here about C-Fu Gourmet being the best place for dim sum in the valley, I am really disappointed to be writing my first 1 star review for the areaWas the service rude and uncaring? The answer here is yes.  Especially the way that push-cart servers call out the food which make you feel like you're in a rowdy tourist market full of cheap knock-offs they're trying to get rid of.  But all would have been forgiven if only the dim-sum being served was any good.  However the dishes we ordered reflected a sloppy kitchen that was focused solely on putting in minimal effort and taking every possible shortcut on the food. Dishes that made me ashamed to be Chinese (yes, the level that C-Fu dimsum brought it down to was that bad):-  Fried glutinous rice:  The preserved meat that was supposed to flavor the dish was MIA. We complained to one of the waiters who replied that "they probably forgot" (um are you sure it's not cost cutting for those who don't know any better?).  More over, the proper way to cook this classic dish would be like risotto where you're constantly stirring and gradually adding water just a little bit at a time (except of course everything is being done in a wok)...Here the C-Fu kitchen obviously just shoved the whole thing into an electric rice-cooker and try to stir fry the huge sticky mess at the end by adding in gallons of oil.   -  Glutinous rice with chicken steamed in lotus leaf:  Once again that electric rice cooker in the back of the kitchen must be working real hard cause the dish lacked the aroma that it would have had if it had actually been steamed in lotus leaf.  Just tasted of sloppy topping of minced chicken and last minute wrapping in the lotus leaf.Dishes I was amazed by (and no not in a good way):-  Deep fried taro dumpling:  Have never quite had it in that simplistic way before where the filling literally was just mashed taro held together by a prodigious amount of oil-  Steamed bok choy:  How the heck do you get oil into steamed vegetable?  C-Fu managed to accomplish this amazing feat of greasy steamed vegetable...unbelievableOn a good note, the Siu Mai was decent.  We did keep on ordering more dishes hopping that something good would pop up...but nope that was it,...so if  you must go to C-Fu for dim-sum...just order order a lot of siu mai and be careful of all the other dishes.  Dinner here was much better. 1 star is for dim-sum only.Next time I have a dim-sum craving, you'll be finding me across the valley at China Chan's (Glendale) where the short & sweet dimsum offering is cooked by a man who doesn't cut corners and it shows.  That's where I'll be sticking to from now on.My Aunt Sue and Uncle Frank told me about C-Fu Gourmet awhile ago, and invited me to join them for dim-sum once or twice... they rave about this place, making the drive to Chandler from North Scottsdale quite often, so I figured it would be worth it.  I saw there were mixed opinions on previous Yelp reviews for C-Fu, but sometimes you want to decide for yourself...Well, in this instance, I agree more with the Yelp average rating than I do with my Aunt and Uncle... Jared and I really wanted to like this place, but nothing about it was that great.It has an old school Chinese feel to it, but the food was nothing to write home about... we had an order of egg rolls, wonton soup, chicken with Chinese veggies, and a noodle dish... you'd think something would stand out, but unfortunately, it didn't.  It was all pretty bland.  We didn't even take home our leftovers... (that's when you know it's bad!)Needless to say, we won't be returning to C-Fu, so I cannot even say "C U to C-FU," cause I won't!I came here for dimsum with a few friends during lunch. The quality of the food is mediocre compared the legit ones in Hacienta Heights, CA or San Gabriel, CA. My friend and I are hardcore dimsum fans, so we have been to this dimsum a few times, until we decided to change to the one across the street called Phoenix Palace Buffet. For some reason, we returned back to C-Fu to try it again, but the service was horrible!! We requested water and tea, and in my water cup and all around it were white residue from a previous mixed drink of another customer. I had already drank half of the iced water and realized there was all over the sides of the cup. I immediately asked for a replacement and even the server was grossed out! They did not do anything to compensate for such a gross encounter, which in the end made everyone at the table lose our appetites. Seriously... traumatized. Definitely not coming back until their service improves!As far as dim sum goes, C-Fu has always been the last option for me.  While the restaurant itself is definitely the most gorgeous out of the rest, the food is pretty white-washed and Americanized.  If I am to drag myself out of bed for dim sum on my precious weekend, I expect hot steamy food and delicious steam to waft over me.  Instead, the food is always mediocre and warm at best.  Don't arrive too early for dim sum or you'll get the leftover steamers from the prior day.  While their food isn't downright disgusting, the targeted audience has definitely changed the past few years.  I say come around 11pm so you get the fresh dishes of the day!

Review Text :
This is Olive Garden and I knew what I was getting into when I suggested lunch here.  I knew Rand would be all over the all you can eat pasta and I was right.  The only thing I've ever liked at Olive Garden was the soup and salad and for 6.95 you get all that and breadsticks.  The zuppa tuscana soup had little flavor and the pasta fagioli which has always been my favorite was bland and tasteless.  Even the salad was rather sad, only 1 little piece of tomato and no cucumber.The ledge of the booth had crumbs on it, and so did the windowsill.  There was scraps of paper on the floor under the table next to us.  Disappointing especially since were were the first table today.Service was good but I don't think I'll be going back to an Olive Garden anytime soon.We were seated.We perused the menu.We chatted.We colored.We waited.We were not ever approached by a server, not in 10-15 minutes of sitting there.

::::::      ::::::            ::::::      We looked at our entertainment book for pizza coupons and came across Domino's in some cruel twist of fate.  Since we hadn't had Domino's in easily 10 years and it was a pretty good coupon we decided in what later seemed a momentary lapse in judgement that we would use the coupon and give them a shot.It will likely be at least 10 years before we try them again.Pizza that was on a par with those frozen ones from the grocery store and a free sandwich we shared that left us with tummy aches.Despite the coupon savings it's no deal for poor quality food.

Sometimes it really doesn't matter what the food is like when the people are just this awesome. My coworker and I came here for a quick lunch the other day and were greeted as if we were old friends. The Lunch Bag is a family run place with mom, daughter and son working the counter and making the food. They were laughing and joking with customers that they clearly knew very well. We felt like we were really apart of something fun and special. The food was good too and a decent price for lunch. I had the New Yorker (minus the cheese) and it was super tasty. I would get the coleslaw on the side if you don't like soggy bread but otherwise would totally eat it again. Absolutely will return.

when i worked in retail my paycheck was spent before i got paid. therefore, i relied heavily on coupons and splitting meals w all of my other poor college friends.well, i hit the jackpot. $15 coupon for a FEAST. the picture on the coupon showed everything we would get: a huge steak, shrimp, and lobster PLUS 2 sides. there were 3 of us- this was PLENTY. it was prom night too so we were initally fooled with how popular it was. popular for prom girls with light up clear shoes (not even lying), if that says anything about the crowd for you...our waitress stops by our booth and just stares at us. one of my friend kinda looks around at me and our other friend, then back at the waitress. 'ill have a diet coke?'then our waitress writes it down and doesn't say anything but looks at my other friend.i lost it and started laughing. why isn't she talking to us? this is so weird. we ended up asking for a different waitress, then found out the coupon was a big fat liar. you didn't get all of that. it just says you do but you don't. the food ended up being nasty. probably one of the worst meals ive ever had. as we're leaving susy talks a lot waitress trips over my friend and it was all too awkward bc i couldn't control laughing. awful food, awful service, AND the bathrooms were some of the grossest i had ever been in. if wal-mart ran a restaurant, this would be it.Its 6:45pm on Thursday night and daughter and I are starving, I'm not in the mood for cooking and would like a steak, so happens there was a flier in the mail for Black Angus Campfire Feast for Two for 39.95. I told my daughter here is our mission, to get Black Angus have our dinner and be done in 50 mins to be on time to pick up son at his job. So off we went, we were seated right away. I clearly explained to my daughter how the campfire feast worked, but somewhere between talking to her and her looking at the menu she got carried away, so I got her back on track, and asked her what type of appetizer she would like, for me it didn't matter. She started us off with the wagon wheel sampler, which is perfect to share with 2, it's the best of everything, Shrimp Cocktail, fried garlic-pepper zucchini, buffalo chicken and loaded potato skins. Everything was great, I have to say my favorite where the zucchini, even though it was fried, it was lightly fried and not greasy, and the flavor was delish!For my meal I ordered the 12oz ribeye a loaded baked potato and Caesar salad .Lets start with the Caesar salad, omg the slices of parmesan cheese on this salad was amazing! I love parmesan cheese and this salad was not lacking in it! So very good!  My loaded potato wasn't really loaded, it had bacon cheese and sour cream, but more like a micro mini scoop of it, but it was better for me that way because even though I went all HAM on this dinner, I still need to watch what I eat.  The ribeye, it was cooked medium and still very pink, but it was flavorless it could have been hit with some salt & pepper before the grilling.For the dessert we had the cookie and ice cream, my daughter really enjoyed that, I had a few bites, but honestly I was just full!  The chocolate chip cookie though did taste heavenly sweet! Our server was Rachel and she was awesome! We did make it out within 50 mins and I did make it in time to get my son from work, did I feel guilty for going out to eat, maybe for a brief moment when he was heating up his hot pockets in the microwave, but that passed away quickly .  ( I did take him to get food elsewhere I'm not heartless LOL)I have not been to Black Angus in about maybe 6 or 7 years. To be honest , I did not think they were even around any more. So I was surprised when I was over in Chandler at Mimi's & saw there was a Black Angus there.A few nights later we came here for dinner. We came about 5:30pm. There were just a few tables in there dining. About 6 people in the Bar.Our Hostess was really perky and sat us right away in a booth,with our menus. We waited so long to be greeted that we actually were ready to completely order by the time our Server came over. The menus are nice well laid out. However, The first thing I noticed was how high the prices all are. This is not the Black Angus I remember . I remember decent food at a good price.Our server was not interested in waiting on us at all. As if she had better things to do. I promise, they were not busy in there at all.With the Tip our bill was about $100.00,so I really thought for that kind of $$$ I would rather go to The Keg, or Somewhere with a nicer ambiance. The dishes were very plain, almost looked plastic. The Tables were not set high end at all.The food was good! I really liked it. But, I thought it was priced too high.If you look at my photos, the food is just put on this really plain dish. was not appealing at all.We had to wait far too long for our bill as well. I don't know where our Server was because, I did not see her anywhere. I can honestly say we won't be back.I did like the Ladies Room, it was decorated nicely with great old adverts that were framed. That was a plus!Never DisappointsIt has been quite some time since I last visited Black Angus Steakhouse.  However, today my sister and I were craving steak for lunch and Black Angus has the absolute best lunch specials when you have a hankering for steak.Black Angus offers an extensive menu and well prepared food at a reasonable price.  The drink menu is great, and the beer is cold on tap.  We seldom have to wait very long for a table and food is served promptly.On this visit my sister had a medium rare sirloin steak with grilled roasted corn and a loaded baked potato and raved about it. I had a filet mignon sandwich with grilled onions and roasted red peppers.  The filet mignon was the most tender steak I've ever had, as well as being flavorful, both cuts of meat were cooked to perfection, just as we had ordered them.  Prior to our entrée we were served a small loaf of bread which was delicious and hot from the oven. The bread was hot, crusty, and soft on the inside.  I could have ate the entire loaf myself, but decided to share.  The deserts at Black Angus are to die for, however, we usually take ours home to enjoy later. Our server was amazing.  Once seated our drinks were served within a few minutes and we were given   a lunch discount card (8.99 for each lunch meal with the purchase of a drink) The Manager at Black Angus knows how to make the customer feel special. During most recent visit, the manager cleared plates,  assisted with getting our desert ready for leaving, and made sure our dining experience was a pleasant one.We have never had a bad experience at Black Angus and plan to return every time we get the chance.

Review Text :
This is your classic dive-asian-restaurant-take-out-buffet-joint-and-ma-pa-convenience-store. This places specializes in quick take out food, with a steam table of rice and other Vietnamese deli foods to make assorted Com dishes.There are also a few shelves of desserts and deli/convenience foods.  But it has about 6 tables to sit and eat, and you can watch the TV with a DVD playing over and over again the traditional Vietnamese outfit contest portion of the Miss Universe Pageant in Nha Trang, Vietnam,They have a decent smattering of Vietnamese fair in a grungy envirnment devoid of any charm, but the food is pretty good. Khai Vi, Pho Bo (about 17 combos) Hu Tieu, Mi Xao, Com Dia, Che, and special dishes like Bun Bo Hue, Bun Rieu,  Banh Cuon, Goi Du Du, Nem Nuong Cuon, etc. They also have Boba drinks, coffees, etc.Don't expect great service. The Pho Tai Bo Vien and Pho Tai came in quite large bowls, with full size rounds of rare beef and decent size meat balls. There was also a lot of noodles, more than most places. Only $4.99, good price even for San Jose or Little Saigon. If you want quick to go Viet food, or a cheap and large bowl of Pho in Las Vegas, try here. It is in a 2 story strip mall just below Korean Garden BBQ.Open 7 days a week, 9 AM til 9 PM.

Review Text :
Geez!  I've been dreading this review for the last couple of hours.  If this is the last review you see from me, it is because I have upset someone and they have killed me.Cash Only? WTF! The hot dogs are barely good (flinches, looks over shoulder).  YEAH I SAID IT!  Its not so much the food I have a problem with, its the staff and the hype.I mean, I had a feeling it wouldn't live up to the hype.  How could it?  Its a hot dog joint that has the reputation of a 5 Star restaurant.  The dogs are good. Thats it, good.  The staff and functionality of the restaurant, however, was not. Plus, they charged me for an extra order of fries! Hey! My 20 month old can't eat two orders of fries!I ate at Ted's for lunch on Sunday with my wife.  We both got the Jumbo All Beef dog with all the toppings (Catsup, Mustard, Onions, Relish, and a Pickle)... The problem was, while in line for only 5 minutes the staff managed to screw up 3 different orders.  That was like 40% screw up!  They were not apologetic, and the customers were getting irate!  This isn't the atmosphere I look for when eating lunch.  Irate customers and hasty cooks are not a good combo.  The onion rings were just a knot of messy fried mystery.  Don't get me wrong, I ate them!Unfortunately, I can't give this place more than 3 stars.  And with this review I will be buying a handgun for protection.Thank god for Ted's Hot Dogs!  There is nothing better in life than a charbroiled hot dog with tasty onion rings and a soda.  My cohorts at work turned me onto Ted's and I kept it secret from my wife.  Yes, I'm that cruel.  Then one Sunday morning we were watching one of those Top 10 Hot Dog shows on the Food Network or Travel Channel.  She said to me, "I wish we could have a great hot dog today."  I broke down and wept, confessing my multiple sins of all the times I tip toed to Ted's to enjoy a chili footlong dog and an all beef dog with the works. She, loving me, immediately hit me a couple of times about the head, and said "Get dressed bitch - lunch is on you."  Now, if you ever meet Marie, you'll come to know that she is sweet and understanding, but on that day, I found one of her few limits.  Needless to say, we had a great experience at Ted's that Sunday.REMEMBER:  They only take cash.  No debit cards, no credit cards, no bartering.Someone asked the question in the Yelp talk threads where the best place was for fried things, like french fries and onion rings.  Several people said Ted's had great onion rings......so off I went!  I expected a smaller place but I was pleasantly suprised when I pulled up to a medium sized store.  I was greated with a smile and asked what I would like.  It was a Sunday afternoon so they were not very busy.  I liked the fact that you tell them what you want and they toss it on the grill right in front of you.  Everything is freshly cooked.  They did the same with the onion rings and french fries too.  Everything was fresh and hot.  My daughter had her favorite....a hot dog, which she loved, and fries which were fresh and crisp.  I had a burger and onion rings.  Yes, the onion rings were delicious!  The batter was great and the onions were a little on the sweet side.  My burger was cooked to perfection.  This is another great little place we will go back to.  It's also sort of near my work so maybe I'll get out one day and go here for lunch.  Thanks Ted's and Yelpers!Alert the media!!!Ted's is one of the Top Ten hot dog shops in the galaxy!!...Ted's is on the Travel Channel!!...Ted's is really authentic, because they are from Buffalo NY, the home of the Buffalo Bills football team (in an interesting side note, everybody thinks the Bills are named after "Buffalo Bill", the cowboy showman...but "Bills" is an acronym for "Boy I Love Loosin' Superbowls").I learned most of this standing in lines at Ted's over the years (not the Bills trivia...they love their Bills at Ted's and you would do well not to question that or to make sport of the Bills, as I just have:)Why is Buffalo the home of the best hot dogs, you ask? Well, don't ask...it just is...as far as you know.Ted's created the Tempe outpost a few years ago when the owner of Ted's got tired of shoveling 24 feet of lake effect precipitation off of his driveway every winter and needed to have a way to write off the trip west every year.So he packed up his sausages and some plaques and Buffalo newspaper clippings for the wall and landed in Tempe, AZ:)It's our good fortune, really. I doubt we'll get the Papaya King to relocate to the Valley of the Sun, and I'm pretty sure Pinks will stay put, so this may be the closest we'll get to galactic class hot dogs.And yet, they're just hot dogs. Good hot dogs, yes...and I do like them...but just hot dogs.The dogs (and everything that they cook at Ted's) are open flame broiled over a real charcoal fire, with the standard compliment of condiments available (including chili, although I am not a big fan of Ted's chili dogs...the chili just doesn't grab me).They also do a nice job on brats, white hots, polish sausages, etc. And, I understand the hamburger is decent, although I have never had one...I go to Ted's for one reason and one reason only...the stars of the show...the hot dogs!And I'm not the only one...people do, indeed, line up to get these dogs!It's like trying to get a pizza at Bianco's. In fact, Ted's can be a tougher test of your dining will than Bianco's...to wit:* Wait     o Bianco's - 2-3 hours, but you can sit at a table and drink and eat     o Ted's - You must stand in line for the full hour...no cuts!!!* Ordering     o Ted's - you better be ready or be prepared for a bit of a public dressing down ("sir, are you ready? Ma'am, the menu is right up there!! sir, other people are waiting!!)     o Bianco's - "You want what on that pizza?!?! Chris will not make "his" pizza that way"! "Did you get my wine and cheese order Mr. Shaved Head-non-responsive bartender at Bar Bianco...hello...hello"? "Yes, I know I told you check with me every hour during the wait, but now that's annoying me"* Price     o Ted's - 2 foot longs and diet coke for $11? That better be a hot dog made with sausage imported all the way from Buffalo, NY! Oh, right...it is:)     o Bianco's - $15 for a pizza that I can't even get my way after a 3 hour wait and $150 bill for wine cheese from your shop next door! This pizza better be made with buffalo mozzarella, made by hand, by you! Oh, right...it is:)For the local "Best in the Universe-Peasant Food Division", Ted's certainly gives the pizza joint a run for its money, in pretty much every category:)Give them try, but bring your comfortable shoes and something to read in line (unless you'd enjoy reading 3 week old Buffalo, NY newspapers from Ted's reading rack)...and for the pete's sake be ready to order!Best hot dogs ever?  Almost....damn near a photo finish but Wieners Circle in Chicago has my #1 vote, but you know what?  Coming in second is still something to be proud of.  Teds Hot Dogs are a-m-a-z-i-n-g!We came here 2 times during our 4 days in the desert.  Both times I left with a smile on my face and a stomach full of tube steaks.The first day we went I got 2 regular dogs, a white hot sausage, split an order of onion rings and washed it down with a Loganberry shake.  We got in line and the man grilling the dogs kindly asks you what you would like.  You kind of shout it out and then he grabs the dogs and stacks them in order of when they are going to be cooked.  A very streamlined operation.  By the time you reach the man, they are pretty much done and then handed off to the condiment lady.  You tell them what you want on each dog.  I went with mustard, onions and their hot sauce concoction. They dish up your onion rings and make your shakes and then off you go.These dogs are super tasty.  Everything just works so well.  They use a soft potato bun and the dogs are char-grilled over charcoal so they get a crispy/burnt like texture to them.  I devoured those things in a matter of minutes.  The onion rings are more like an onion loaf.  Pretty good.  The Loganberry shake was very good too.  Just sweet enough without overpowering it.  The shakes are a tad small though but they are the right consistency and you can easily drink it through your straw which was nice.2nd trip I got a foot-long, a regular and an Italian sausage.  This time we split fries and got another Loganberry shake.  The Italian sausage was the winner of both trips.  It was the BEST sausage I have ever had.  I got it topped with just mustard and onions.  It was perfectly cooked, snap when you bit in, but soft and almost mushy when you chewed through it.  Kind of hard to describe but god damn that was a tasty sausage.  Perfect flavors and everything.  My 2 dogs I got topped like day 1.  Mustard, onions and hot sauce.  The wife had a burger which she said was ok.  Looked kind of skimp though.  She doesn't eat dogs so she missed out.  I will have dreams about this place.  It was by far my favorite 2 meals in AZ and I would eat here all the time if I lived close.   I cant wait to find some reason to go back to AZ just to eat here.  It may even be worth the 5 hour drive just to eat these, turn around and come back.  Seriously.....these dogs are great!Still my favorite hot dogs.  We started the trip and ended the trip with meals at Teds.First visit-  Got there about 2pm on Saturday afternoon.  I have never seen a line of more than 5-7 people here at Teds.  We walked in and there was a line about 30 people deep.  I don't know if everyone was getting their hot dog fix since they were closed on Easter or what,  but it was busy!  Waited in line and placed my order for a Footlong, Polish, White Hot and a Corn Dog. (This trip, I was going to eat every hot dog they had....veggie and kids hot dogs don't count ;-) lol)  Washed it down with a loganberry shake.  My wife got some fries.  Second visit-  Got there around 10:30am and there were only 2 people in front of us.  Today I placed my order for a Bratwurst, Italian, All Beef and Regular Dog.  My wife got a hamburger and some onion rings.  Washed it down with another loganberry shake.To add to my previous review, in my opinion, this is the order of greatness of Teds dogs/sausages.1. Italian- My favorite.  Spiced right and always delicious. A must order every time!2. Bratwurst- Close runner up to the Italian.  A must order every time!3. Polish- Another great sausage. 4. Regular Dog- The classic.5. All Beef Dog- Huge and beefy.6. White Hot- Wont get it again probably.  Not enough flavor.7. Corn Dog- Foster Farms regular corn dog.  Fried proper but plain.  I can make one like that myself at home.8. Foot Long- Tastes different than the other dogs.  Bun was stale, have not liked it the 2 times I ordered it.  Wont ever get it again.Cant wait to go back.  The dogs are always delicious!I came to Ted's last week to meet up with the lunch UYE group, but I was a little late and they were on their way out.  So, I waited in the line, alone, to order a dog to go.  The funny thing, they call to you from behind the grill to place your order.  As they were calling for my attention, I looked around over my shoulder as if to say, "Oh, you're talking to me" when the cook was calling for my attention... haha, that's something you should look out for so you're not caught off guard if its your first time around the block.I got the beef dog with ketchup, mustard and a pickle.  They grill the hot dog on an open flame.  The dogs don't taste "grilled" enough for my tastes, but it was ok.  I really enjoyed the onion rings that I ordered on the side.  Very tasty.  I won't miss this place if I don't go back.  But if someone wants to go, I'll meet them there.  No problem.I love reading about my yelp friends' vacation finds.  I always bookmark them because although I never know when I'll be in that part of the country, I do know those bookmarks will eventually become tourist destinations for me.  My yelp bud Tim S. knows his comfort foods.  When he raves about a pizza in New York, a cheesesteak in Philly, or a hot dog in Phoenix, I'm so there.  Wait a Hot Dog in Phoenix?  That can't be right.  This ain't Chicago or New York.  Or is it?  Ted's is a Buffalo, NY Hot Dog blooming right here in the middle of the desert, transplanted in 1983 from it's 1927 original wintery environment.  Sometimes when you are a food tourist, it's ok to over order and try a few different things.  It's not ok for your waistline, but "Hey you're on vacation!"  At least that's what I tell myself.  And I got absolutely no judgement from Ted's when I ordered a Regular Hot Dog, a Jumbo All Beef dog, an Italian Sausage, and a Bratwurst.  Chased down with some Onion Rings and a Loganberry Milkshake.So what makes Ted's so good, is the charcoal.  As I came in, they were adding a bunch of new charcoal to the grill.  It gives the dog a nice smokey flavor and a good snap.  Each of my 4 dogs/ sausages were excellent and it's tough to choose which one was best.  I actually think I preferred the basic hot dog, because of the soft grind of the wiener offset with the crunchy slightly charred casing.  It was texture heaven for sure, and I got this one dressed in classic Chicago style - chopped onions, relish, tomato, pickle, and yellow mustard.  I dressed the all beef with kraut and chopped onions - excellent dog although a little firmer in texture, as most beef dogs are.  They have polish, bratwurst, italian, and a white hot under their sausage menu.  I read a couple of slightly negative reviews on the white hot, so while it sounded very interesting, I had no room to put one down on this visit.  Italian and Bratwurst it was for me and I got them dressed the same way with grilled onions and peppers.  I opted for the hot sauce on the side.  The hot sauce pairs perfectly with the Italian Sausage.  This is a nice and spicy Italian.  Adding the hot sauce seemed to just reinforce that same flavor, rather than cover it up.  Ted's has an interesting home made hot sauce.  If you made a salsa out of hot dog condiments, this is what you would get - relish, onions, in a ketchup vinegar base.  For the bratwurst I went straight up with some brown deli mustard.  Awesome!   Next visit, I'm trying a chili cheese dog for sure.The onion rings taste like an onion loaf, but not super peppery.  They have a great batter here, but I like that you can still taste the onion and there isn't too much batter.  The Loganberry shake is a must order.  The perfect sweet creamy drink to offset the spicy Italian Sausage.  From what I understand loganberry is a Western NY flavor, because you don't see it around these here parts too much.  It's like a red blackberry.  I have no idea if it was loganberry flavored ice cream or vanilla ice cream with loganberry syrup.  Whatever it is, order it and you will be happy.  I can't wait until the next time I'm in Phoenix (or Buffalo) to get me a charcoal grilled dog at Ted's. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/teds-hot-dogs-tempe?select=HYh6Dv4htWxebTjRMwgh6g#OCLoB-p-pzUUNcCib8xK-QTed's Hot Dogs is one of those places that just emits an aura of times long gone. When walking into this establishment I immediately heard music from the 1950s and 60s. I could smell the meat cooking on the grill and I felt like I was in another world. I looked over Ted's menu and some of the signage and became aware that this place is tied to and related to a chain of "Ted's Hot Dogs" found in Buffalo New York. The line was fairly considerable on my initial visit and after perusing the menu I settled on an all beef hot dog, onion rings and a soft drink. With the hot dog I decided to make it as close to a Chicago style hot dog as possible. So I asked for mustard, relish,, onions, tomato, and a pickle slice.  I took the dog to an open table and dug in. The taste of the sausage here is definitely different than the steamed Chicago style dogs I'm used to. One primary reason is that everything (well all the meats) at Ted's is char grilled. This gives a nice grilled flavor to it, the actual hot dog used had an unusual filler taste with a somewhat sweet flavor rather than spicy. All things considered it was a strange mix.The onion rings weren't so great, these were very thin onion peels deep fried. While they were plentiful there was very little onion and just lots of batter. I'd say I was a bit disappointed with them.Since I've been in Arizona for quite a few days I did decide to return to Ted's and try things just a little differently. I went for a footlong dog which was only a little more expensive on my second visit. And rather than go for the toppings mentioned above I opted for Chili. The footlong dog was a great value and while the chilli was an extra 60 or so cents, I felt this was a much better dog than the one I ordered the first time and a lot of food for the money.I ALSO got a regular cheeseburger, this was fairly standard and tasted like most burgers that come off of a backyard grill. Not bad, but nothing worth writing home about.My overall opinion of Ted's is that I love the ambiance and atmosphere, the food is pretty good and it's a good value if you go for the giant footlong hot dog. I am going to give Ted's Hot Dogs four stars and a recommendation if you happen to be in Tempe Arizona.Ted's = The fuel that kept me running when I went to ASU.I first came across Ted's after my classmates up'd and kidnapped me after our studio class one sunny afternoon.  I've never heard of the place and was intrigued with promises of the "best wiener you'll put your lips on [Sun Devils at their prime]."  Upon entering the small establishment, the scent of meat sizzling on charcoal perfumed my senses.  I was sold.  I had the White Hot [veal and pork], a Regular with chili cheese, and a vanilla maltshake.  It was the best meal I had that long stressful year as a Digital Art major.  If this is a taste of Buffalo, I'll gladly say that I love New York!  Been a faithful customer of Ted's since that first bite~

Review Text :
Was fiending arepas so I searched Yelp and seems like this is one of the only places serving them.  You walk into a little Colombian market and the dining area is to your right.  I understand this dining area also becomes a salsa dance floor one night a week.The photos on the menu look amazing.  I wanted to try everything.  There were a couple different kinds of arepas and they were decent, but none of them compared with really good arepas I've had outside of Vegas.  The empanadas were so-so.  They hard-sell you on their fresh juice - I got the tamarindo and it was pretty good.  For dinner I ordered the Sancocho de Gallina which is hen soup w green plantains, yucca root and a piece of corn on the cob in the soup.  The picture looked incredible.  But the dish did not taste as good as the picture looked.  Very bland and the cliantro wasn't fresh.  Also the yucca root was undercooked.  The plantains were decent.  The corn on the cob was the same sweet corn used in the arepas which was pretty good.I'm not sure if I'll be going back.  Maybe if someone came from out of town and really wanted to go.BABY THIS AND BABY THATIn 2011 I went ahead and purchased a batch of restaurant.com coupons for a couple dozen places.  What I didn't anticipate was that more than half of them are still in my makeshift folder. This evening it was either Russian or Colombian. Russian place is closed and/or relocating.  So, it'll have to be Colombian.Last time I dined Columbian style was at Pueblito Viejo on Bird Street, Miami, FL http://www.yelp.com/biz/pueblito-viejo-no-2-miami#query:colombian%20restaurants in Miami, FL  It was like the second coming of Walt Disney. Eccentric, overwhelmingly eclectic to the max, animated and authentic Colombian from the moment I had set foot into that restaurant.Now keep that picture in mind and strip all those Disney characters from the ceiling and walls.  That's what Oiga, Mire, Vea Colombian Cuisine is simply about.  It's all about the muy rapido speaking server, a room fit for a union hall meeting and those monster black JBL speakers suspended from the ceiling.  Fortunately, it was not time for the partying to start.  So we got to dine in peace and quiet. Yelper Kevin P's review will tell you what it's like during party time. It's the work hard and play hard factor.Our server was quick to suggest sampling the following (talk about being lead by the nose):Bunuelo:  round bread, fried, made from white corn flour and cheeseEmpanada:  turn-over stuffed with meat and diced potatoes. Served with "Aji" homemade mild green sauce.Bandeja Paisa:  Colombian traditional mix plate of grilled steak, fried pork rind, red beans, rice, chorizo, fried egg, in this case fried ripe plantain.Ajiaco:  Chicken soup with Colombian yellow potatoes, domestic potatoes and corn on the cob,  Served with sour cream, capers, and rice.As it turns out there's enough food for another meal for two.  In retrospect, the leftovers tasted even better.  To wash things down, we ordered a Colombian pina and their version of a cola soda. Our muy rapido server has now begun to call us "her babies." She obviously took a liking to us.  We talked story about family.  She has a 37 year old son... you couldn't tell by looking at her (that's a compliment).Once again I've tinkered with Colombian cuisine, I would very much like to taste more of this cultural mix of indigenous, Spanish, African, Arab and some Asian influences. It was much too late in the evening to try their Colombian coffee and desserts. BTW... in Miami there are over fifty Colombian restaurants and that does not include the Chinese/Colombian which are extremely popular.

Where to begin. How many times have I driven by Randy's over the years? Maybe 100 or probably even more? Every time I drive by, I look in and see crowds enjoying themselves; especially around 4:30 for the early bird special. But can you blame a place located in the heart of old town for having some retirees on their list of regulars? I can't. In fact, I applaud Randy's. Apparently the old timers know what's up. Let me be truthful here. Randy's is just a diner. It's your everyday, run of the mill, All American neighborhood diner...and it's awesome. Walking in on a Saturday morning at 9:30, the place was jam packed with folks of all ages. The staff quickly greeted us and scurried us to an open table while keeping a smile on their face. Looking around, guests looked like they were having a good time. Whether it was the group of partiers who needed some grease to settle their hangover or the retirees on the run from Sun City andd taking a morning walk to get breakfast and coffee, I saw just about every type of person at Randy's. Now let me get to the menu. I am pretty sure that not a thing on the breakfast menu exceeds $6.00. Slowly but surely, Scottsdale's losing this trait of economically priced meals so I salute Randy's for keeping the prices down. Now on to star number two in my book of Randy's cuisine. Do you ever go to a restaurant for breakfast and think...I'd really like an egg but I'm also craving a pancake or french toast, but I don't want nor do I need a full order of carbs. I do all the time. I love pancakes and I love french toast, but there's a rare occasion when I actually order that as my main entree for a meal. Enter Randy's. In their 20+ breakfast combination choices, they offer options like "one egg, one piece of bacon, and a half order of french toast" or the same but with a pancake instead. When I read this, my heart skipped a beat for Randy wherever he is. And let me also mention that this meal is around $4.50. Can't beat that! The food itself was just what the doctor ordered. It tasted homemade, with flavor and it was just the right amount of food. Now don't walk in expecting The Food Network to feature Randy's, but if you want a solid breakfast at a decent price, this is your spot. But buyer beware. They only accept cash or checks. Better bring some cash because if you are under the age of 60, I highly doubt you're walking around with a check book and if you lack both, you'll be slapped with a $3 ATM fee. That's nearly the price of the meal! So until next time Randy's. With a six (?) page menu chock full of everything imaginable in small town USA dining, I think I have my hands full getting through it!Omgosh.  This place is a block from my house so the location is convenient.  My initial perceptions before going were sketchy but once my husband and I went in for breakfast a few weekends back, we are weekend regulars!! The employees are so great! They are friendly and whether they are serving you or not, they give the friendliest greeting with a smile. Nothing phony. The place is VERY clean - dated but CLEAN. Just the 80's pink but it's cleverly nostalgic. My husband and I love sitting at the bar so we can watch morning sports after our workouts. The service is quick!! I don't think I've been anywhere with faster service - and even firing the busiest of morning breakfast hours!! The kitchen crew is crazy organized and efficient.  The food is FABulous!! Yum yum!! My favorite is the skinny skillet. So freakin good. My husband is a big muscular guy and he easily is fueled up by the food, too. We will definitely keep coming back. Love this place!!!! They only take cash or checks which is probably why the prices are so great, too! But if you forget, they have an ATM by the front door. Get in here!!! :-)

Review Text :
Fast Eddie's is one of those places that you forget how good it is until you go back. The prices are dirt cheap and the food is consistent. Three of us can gorge ourselves at breakfast and walk away with a $20 check. The waitresses are all friendly (sort of like that one weird aunt that everyone has). Service can be a little slow if they are busy, so take a does of patience. They have a relatively large menu and you can order off either the breakfast or lunch/dinner as long as they are open... so if you have a hankering for killer buttermilk pancakes and bacon for dinner, it's there for the taking. In addition to their menu, they have daily specials (you know the drill - all you can eat fish Fridays, stuff like that).The decor is a little cheesy - they bought out the inards of the long defunct Ed Debevicks, so they have the old "Eat at Ed's" signs all over. But the shakes are killer good and the pancakes are light and fluffy. What more could you want from your local dinner hang? Not much, unless you are like me and believe that a side of bacon makes everything better!

Restaurant name  Pasta Cucina
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
If I could eat one food everyday for the rest of my life, it would be eggplant parmesan. In my mind eggplant parmesan is a tasty food that is hardly possible to ruin. I am attracted to eggplant parmesan as a duck is to water. With that said I have good things to write about Pasta Cucina.  This is actually my second dining experience in a Pasta Cucina. It is an accidental dining experience. I was in Boulder Station bound for Feast Buffet. So were hundreds of other people. I passed over an expected blah meal in the Grand Cafe. I tried Pasta Cucina. I was very satisfied. Fast forward to a couple of weeks later and I was dining in the Sunset Station Pasta Cucina.  What is surprising is that Pasta Cucina's prices are relatively the same as the Grand Cafe. An example is that spaghetti and meatballs is $7.99 at Grand Cafe. At Pasta Cucina's it was $9.99 and INCLUDED bread sticks with dipping sauces plus a salad or Minnestroni soup. Where Grand Cafe has a decent atmosphere, Pasta Cucina borders on the elegant with the Sunset Station Medditeranian motif. You could say Pasta Cucina is a borderline classy restaurant with Grand Cafe pricing.  When I stepped into Pasta Cucina, which is to the right of Feast Buffet; I observed that the dress code was casual and the noise level average. Throughout the meal, the Waiter was professional and attentive.  A few minutes after ordering, the Waiter placed the warm soft bread sticks on the table. They were served with both mozzarella and ranch sauces. I enjoyed every bite being careful to save my appetite.  The salad with ranch dressing was a taste of the food to arrive. Meanwhile the Waiter was on top of the Pepsi refills. If I was up to an alcohol beverage, the menu features a decent selection of cocktails for $6.   The serving of the three slabs of eggplant parmesan over spaghetti was moderate yet delicious. Although the eggplant parmesan is levels below Chef Mark and Chef Olds, it was slightly better than I remember Olive Garden and Long Island (NY) diners. I had zero issues with the eggplant parmesan and spaghetti. They could of added an additional slab of eggplant parmesan, but I would have little appetite for the cannolis.    After savoring every bite of eggplant parmesan with spaghetti,  I treated my tastebuds to desert. It was two cannolis with a cup of coffee. The delicious taste of the cannolis complimented the quality coffee.  If you are in the vicinity of Sunset Station and enjoy Italian food at Grand Cafe prices, I recommend Pasta Cucina. You live once, why not enjoy delicious Italian food at a price that won't drain your wallet.ITALY IN 15 MINUTESBaked Penne:  meatball, Italian sausage, marinara, mozzarella, Parmesan. Marinara sauce was subdued meaning not very zesty.  Plenty of sausage but the few marble sized meatbals prompted Yu-go to start wondering if the kitchen had forgotten something. Would had preferred more marinara sauce and much less mozzarella. Chose the Minestrone soup to start.Eggplant  Paremesan:  spaghetti marinara, mozzarella, Parmesan. The thin large slices of eggplant coated with seasoned bread crumbs and prepared crisp that went well with the not so al dente spaghetti.  I choose the house salad to start.Dinner includes either:Minestrone Soup:  ditalini pasta, beans, potatoes,  tomato,  peas, spinach, squash, cauliflower. Not spicy but packed with the listed ingredients ... was served lukewarm. House Salad:  Choice of mixed greens, tomato,  cucumber, house dressing; or romaine,  parmesan, croutons, caesar dressing. Went with the romaine, served with a lemon based dressing.  A full salad could be an ideal meal in itself.This restaurant is more than romantic and mimics an every day dream like perfect Italian courtyard filled with lemon trees. Waitstaff is very cordial and constantly monitoring their diners.  Now that we're aware of their cooking style, we can ask up front when ordering for more marinara sauce and less mozzarella. This could be the beginning of a beautiful friendship.Ciao baby.

BEST Tacos Off the Strip!How there are no other reviews of this place IDK!It is always busy, It's Open late It has A drive thru it's Cheap and it is damn good.I almost forgot it's ONLY 5 minutes west of the strip near IN & Out. Check it Out!!I love the carne asada so I always get 6-8 tacos and 2 churros to go. It always hits the spot.I got punished and paid the price for trying a burrito at a place best known for their tacos. It also kinda helps too if I did more researches on things to do and places to eat and avoid when I visit any city. "I know, that is why we have Yelp!"This place is opened 24 hours and a drive-thru, which are the only positives. But my $6.00 "so called" super burrito wasn't what I was expected for a city best known for good food. First of all, I love all my "super burritos" fat, juicy, and wrapped tightly in a aluminum foil. But my burrito from here was small and wrapped loosely. Therefore, all the key ingredients fell apart on me leaving a fat mess. The meat, beans, and rice were also dry. And the chips were stale.I'm an old man and still play with my food. So I dissected my burrito and noticed, "I got ripped off." The shop didn't give me any cheese, guacamole and sour cream. If I wanted those fillings in my super burrito, according to menu I have to pay extra. Now I got it.  I ended up throwing 3/4 of that burrito away and left just finishing my Sidral Mundet sparkling Apple drink, which was refreshing.To find a decent "super" burrito in another city continues.

Review Text :
Tropical. Not paradise. This chain smoothie location isn't amazing, but it does the trick. I came here after a four-hour long dentist appointment and needed some sustenance. I didn't feel like driving the extra two minutes down the road to Greens and Proteins, nor did I want to spend nine dollars on a smoothie. Not hating on G&P, just stating a fact. This was probably the first time I walked into Tropical Smoothie and there wasn't a line out the door. I stepped up to order and I waited and waited... finally a person walked up to help. "I'll take the Peanut Paradise please", my order was placed and I waited and waited, and waited. By this point there was now a line out the door and there are only two people working here. Yikes. Finally my order was called, but not before they called out two mystery smoothie orders. When I first walked-in this place was empty, who orders a smoothie and bails? Would I recommend this place, probably not? But if you're the Smoothie-Masochistic type, then this is the place for you.

This was my 1st trip to @BlkMtnGrill. It's A lodge-like bar & grill with seperate dining room the kitchen is open in the dining room so you can see your meal being made. Really Cool:)After taking a minute to clean up and check the place out-which if you are a hunter you will love it. Very cozy with a fireplace front & center big comfy seats and lots of great decor;-)Since we arrived just before 11- we could order breakfast or lunch and decided to do BOTH.We started off with the cheese plate(cheese & fruit really)-then ordered a 3 item omelette with ham,bacon & cheddar-potaotes & english muffin-also a burger with grilled mushrooms and french fries.(NOTE: Drinks-they serve PEPSI)Service was OUTSTANDING-our drinks were filled quickly and the food was brought out in a timely manner.When the food arrived we knew immediately we were in way over our heads-it was ALOT of food!!The burger was good a little-bit over cooked, the fries were great.The omelette was insane-the was a whole hog in there soooo much ham & bacon:) maybe a little too heavy on the cheese but that was an easy fix:) I like shredded potao hashbrowns myself but the kids loved the country potaotes!!The cheese plate was fantastic with strawberrys,granny smith apples,grapes and raspberries and several different cheeses-my favorite was the smoky cheddar-yummy:)Yeah I know I only tried the bar food but it was damn good.They serve a much more sophisticated menu than the items I ordered so I'm gonna have to go back some Tuesday evening (2 for 1) and try their dinners. Maybe the Stuffed Alaskan Halibut of Petite Beef Wellington;)I knew we'd found the secret best deal spot in town when I walked in and the average age in the dining room was 70 or so. The social security set knows where to get the best food deals in town, and in this case they picked a place with damn tasty food as well. As far as the more "moderately priced" steak type places in town go, take a date to Twin Creeks. If on the other hand you're an old married couple just looking for good meat - this is your spot ! Tuesday night is incredible. All entrees are buy one get one free! This makes their normally reasonably priced steak dinners ($25ish for a filet mignon + 2 sides) INSANELY priced. $12.50 for a filet mignon and 2 sides? WHAT?Let it be known that I'm a steak snob. I've tried to do the $9.99 steak dinner casino rap and ended up throwing it away too many times. I can't do chewy cheap steak. I don't even eat Prime Rib as I find it beneath me. Yup, I said it, I'm the world's biggest steak snob. I went in to this place with pretty low expectations, I mean how the hell can you serve a sizeable filet for $12.50 with sides? The steak here blew me out of the water! SO TENDER, so perfectly cooked, so quality. It was crazy. Honestly it was just a couple ticks below a filet at Hanks. I asked for double green beans to avoid the carby potatoes and they were happy to oblige. The husband got a HUGE ribeye and also liked it, but it wasn't as money as my filet. It was really really good for a cheap ribeye, but it wasn't anywhere close to a Hank's ribeye if you catch my drift. The filet is where it's at!The dining room is comfortable (it's like a lodge inside) and service was really awesome. Wine was fairly priced (we had a fabulous bottle for just $24 that retails for $16! Very low markup for Vegas). They also have very creative specials (think duck, inventive salmon dishes, etc - they post them on their website ahead of time). Unfortunately I've only had this $12.50 Filet mignon dinner once so I'm scared it was a fluke but I really hope it's not . Sometimes in life you don't get what you pay for - you get so much more ! A bottle of wine and 2 steak dinners with sides and bread for $50ish? Crazy I tell you.

Review Text :
Another Food Network find.... Supposedly the best thing cheesy "Chef Beau" ever had was the onion soup from here..... In looking at Zinc it boasts some local awards for its French cuisine... I am on vacation sure why not. Service Stellar. Frankie was super funny, polite and ensured we felt like we were his only table. The food: I did get the onion soup and it was good.Yes the crispy gruyere was yummy and the soup was good but not the best I have had....HOWEVER the scallops were probably the best I have had in a while. I got the scallops with black lentils and mustard cream... I give those two thumbs and a snap around the world. They were perfectly seared, sweet, buttery and huge. The lentils were firmer than I am used to but not unpleasant. The mustard cream was a perfect topper. We also got the parma/truffle fries were good. The fries were not greasy, crispy and the aiolis that accompanied them were a good complement. The curried chicken sandwich was well liked by my boyfriend. Other things ordered at our table: duck confit sandwich, chicken salad and house fries.  Overall: great place to grab some lunch, excellent service, don't believe the hype about the onion soup.09/23/10My first of two Restaurant Week 2010 experiences began at Zinc Bistro.  Let me preface that I took Mom w/ me, and it was this meal's experience that I have learned never to take her to a place that ranks higher than a "moderate" in terms of costs.  It doesn't matter that she's not the one paying, and I refuse to let someone, not even my mother, dissuade me from enjoying a great meal!We'd arrived 30 minutes before dinner service, and Mom was already hungry.  I tried stalling for about 15 minutes, looking over the off-hour menu for something for her to nibble on.  (We also found it difficult to flag down someone to help us during our stay here, even though it wasn't busy!)  I decided I'd get her the open-faced Zinc Burger, which was listed at $13.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zinc-bistro-scottsdale?select=MgpZeM3N2f8wi6EuEbjd3A#MgpZeM3N2f8wi6EuEbjd3A  The menu didn't list a side dish accompanying it, so I asked our server if there were any fries or salad that came w/ it.  No was the answer.  This angered my Mom, who did not wish for me to pay $13 for just a burger.  She only had the ambience (of which she thought wasn't great) and the arrogance of our server to go on; I knew of Chef Matt Carter's reputation, as well as Chef Beau MacMillan's endorsement of the best French onion soup (at Zinc Bistro) he's ever tasted on Food Network's episode of Best Thing I Ever Ate: Cheesy.  Those 25 minutes waiting for the burger to arrive were the longest 25 minutes I've ever experienced in my life, no exaggeration!  Thank God that when the burger finally did arrive, that it was a VERY tasty burger!  Of course, she wouldn't admit this to me.  No... I only learnt of her approval when our server had asked us later on if we were enjoying our food-- a very enthusiastic yes was her reply!My restaurant week meal thus followed: 1st course: Smoked Scottish salmon tartare- green apple, creme fraiche, and toasted brioche.  A truly lovely dish to gaze at, and even more wonderful to taste!  I loved the texture of the salmon- very creamy, and the cubed hard-boiled eggs added some fun mouth-feel!  This dish made me think I was eating salmon sushi w/o the rice!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zinc-bistro-scottsdale?select=z--Qcv88vRbjCa_KUDY7Hw#z--Qcv88vRbjCa_KUDY7Hw2nd course: Seared Ahi Tuna- preserved lemon creamy orzo, roasted beet, and fennel.  Another winner!  Great presentation-- seared ahi tuna chunks, w/ red centers atop wonderfully creamy orzo (Mom's first time trying orzo... she loved it!), with a beet reduction glazing the dish.  Really enjoyed the meaty tuna chunks, which tasted fresh-from-the-sea and not "fishy" at all.  Again, the orzo added great texture contrast to the meaty fish-- I enjoyed this dish so much, I had the leftovers for breakfast the next day! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zinc-bistro-scottsdale?select=SHDk_-fvZRXr4O82qOEKFg#SHDk_-fvZRXr4O82qOEKFg3rd course: Apple "Tart Tatin" Brown Butter Caramel, which really wasn't a tart tatin.  It wasn't even a pie, which was a bit disappointing.  It consisted of a cake that looked like angel cake but had the texture of a pound cake, apple-flavored, and quite dry.  Not even the brown butter caramel sauce nor the house-made ice cream could save it. :( [I was told it was either a cream cheese, sour cream, or buttermilk- based, but all I tasted was vanilla.]  My favorite components of this dessert were the three, caramelized and very thin-sliced pieces of apple.  We also enjoyed the French-pressed coffee, which also came w/ one piece of biscotti each, that I chose to accompany this "tart tatin."  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zinc-bistro-scottsdale?select=M8rhOQyLbDHHNTSq7nF6gw#M8rhOQyLbDHHNTSq7nF6gwhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zinc-bistro-scottsdale?select=sXKSvx7P8pLPKLeZPdLHeQ#sXKSvx7P8pLPKLeZPdLHeQ4 stars overall for the food, and less than 3 stars for the arrogance and absenteeism of our server and for the ambience.  (We didn't like the flow of the rooms: the tables were too close to each other, and while there was a lovely mini-Eiffel Tower on display, on its base sat containers filled w/ artificial sweeteners- a bit tacky, I thought.)  I wouldn't mind ordering the Zinc burger again, but please add a side dish to it!  And lose the arrogant servers.  Unless, of course, they have sexy French accents to go along w/ their dispositions!  (Pa dum dum!)As a general rule it is a bad sign when a restaurant is too dark to read the menu (and presumably see your food). Another general rule is that a waiter starting with a terse "no" will lead to a bad evening. Lastly the manager not acknowledging an issue and even trying to deflect it indicates that no good will ever come from the dinning experience. Fortunately we left before getting started and am better for it.Having researched Zinc Bistro  I was excited to eat there. Unfortunately when we got there in the evening we found the interior to be very dark. Dark enough that it was hard to read the menu (I have very good eyesight). My wife politely asked if they could turn up the lights and the waiter responded with a terse "NO" and then proceed to offer to get us a flashlight. I talked to the manager about the waiters attitude and the issue of the lighting and he was dismissive and deflected the issue saying that they had alot of flashlights around. We also noticed that other patrons where using their iPhones to illuminate the menu so it wasn't just us. All I have to ask is why in the world if you know it is an issue (to the point of having several flashlights ready) would you subject your patrons to the inconvenience. We left and will never return. There are so many options for great dining (e.g. Roka Akor) in Scottsdale, don't waste your time on a restaurant that doesn't deliver even basic customer service. The choice is yours.I. loved. this. place.my favorite spot I tried while in AZ this week. it was so good I was longing for my favorite Uptown girl to be there dining with me.i started off with a cocktail called rye direction. that was definitely a step in the...I had the Scottish salmon with onion ravioli. every last bite had more flavor than Public Enemy. I was blown away and damn near licked the plate clean. and then to follow it up with the bread pudding - which is such an understatement, because it is so, so much more. I forget how it is referred to in French; please accept my apologies.my colleague ordered the chocolate soufflé that was oooooowee goodie good. (I finish off all of her desserts after she has a couple bites.)this would be a great date spot. I would definitely come here again if ever in the area.*rubs magic lamp*

Review Text :
9/15My first visit, and probably my last for awhile.  Loved the pastrami and corned beef combo on marbled-rye, but found the slightly-under $12 price tag too high for a sandwich, chips, and a pickle.  I will note that I was able to squeeze four small, but ample, meals out of this: two with the marbled-rye, and another two meals from the leftover meat cuts with bread from home.  I might stop over and buy some deli cuts to enjoy at home, but I find the price paid repulsive, esp. when I drive many miles to dine out at least three days a week!BTW, I chose to eat one-half of the sammy at nearby Crust, which explains the background.Okay, after 17 reviews that received either one or five stars, I'm actually writing a two star review (technically, I'd give them 2.5 stars but there's no mechanism for that). I feel it's my duty, being a transplanted east coast Jew, to weigh in on Jew food here in the valley.First, the positives: the food was pretty good. They didn't put any of those annoying coatings on their fries and when I said "extra lean" I got a corned beef sandwich w/o any fat. They also stocked one of my favorite sodas, a deli staple, called Doc Brown's diet black cherry. Yum!That doesn't sound too bad. So why the 2.5 stars, you ask? Okay, the negatives: the negatives all center around price. I paid $10 for a SMALL sandwich and fries. Now, don't get me wrong, I got enough to eat. But that's not the way a Jewish deli works. Half a sandwich and a side should be enough to eat. It is at every other Jewish deli I've ever been to. That way you can share or save the rest for later. Plus, I asked for an extra pickle. How dare I?! Little did I know when I made the request that they were going to charge me $1 FOR A FREAKIN' PICKLE SPEAR!!! THAT'S LIKE AN EIGHTH OF A PICKLE!!! I couldn't believe it! Add to that the cost of my beloved Doc Brown's $2.49 and I'm quickly going broke. But wait, there's more. I dared to order pastry.Now, there are several reasons I ordered pastry and none of them are particularly startling. First off, I'm never in a Jewish deli so I couldn't let the opportunity pass. Secondly, I'm a real sucker for apricot pastry and they had two different kinds. Third, they had mandelbrot, which is prominently featured in my novel so I wanted to try theirs and see if it's any better than what I get from Simply Bread (it wasn't). Though I only had nibbles of each of the three small pieces, just to try them, I paid $3.30 for the privilege.Will I go back there again? Probably not. While the food was okay, I feel like I was mugged. Kinda leaves a bad taste in the mouth. One even good Jew food can't get rid of.Goldman's is a prime example of a delicious deli that was hiding right in front of my face! Yes, I've passed by Goldman's hundreds of times and it's a small sin that it took me this long to step foot inside. But, now I have and I am happy to report that this is going to be added to my rotation immediately! First, I like that Goldman's has some serious pride in their love of Chicago. It's nice to see a deli with some passion and this deli is definitely passionate about their food and the Windy City. The menu has it all...burgers and grilled cheese to brisket and pastrami. Let's not also forget about matzah ball soup and other classic Jewish deli cuisine. I decided to try their famous hot pastrami sandwich. My bf has the brisket so I was able to try both! I think I liked the brisket better then the pastrami but the pastrami was also delicious. The food is definitely meat happy so come with an appetite or you'll be leaving half the sandwich on the plate like me. I don't think I would stay and eat here, but it's a very worth deli for on the go! PS -- they also serve breakfast starting at 8 AM!So, I'm always on the hunt for a good Deli, especially out here where they seem to be non existent.  I saw another reviewer talk about this place recently on yelp, and thought that I MUST go check it out.  I can't believe I've lived here for 7 years and never heard of this place. How is this possible?Anyways, Scott W and I came here and I really liked it.  I think its probably the best Deli that I've had since having moved here.  For starters, they have a really great full menu. TONS to choose from, and a small deli case with some side items in there to choose from.Some of the things that won me over about this deli are the following. For starters, they serve Beet Borscht.  This, my friends, is by far one of my absolute favorite Jewish dishes.  My grandpa and grandma would make this from scratch when I was growing up, and bring it over to the house when I was a kid. It was always a treat to eat, and I haven't found anything as good since.  There's a few deli's in Michigan that serve it, but nothing out here that I would recommend.  I didn't get a bowl of it here, but the fact that they serve cold beet borscht is going to make me come back and visit again.Secondly, they have real gefilte fish!  They serve it by the piece here, and it looked like it was supposed to look in the case...large with a carrot on top.  This, my friends, is the way to my heart.In regards to my food, I really enjoyed my brisket sandwich.  I got it on challah with a side of fries.  Really really good, and it came with au jus sauce. I was able to plow through half the sandwich, and brought the other half home for later.It was also a really a good sign to see other Jewish grandmas in there when we ate.  As someone who is not only Jewish, but has a high bar for Jewish food expectations, this place is awesome. I do plan on going back in the future for more, as I was really happy with my experience here.  Plenty of seating indoors and out, I really wish they had waitstaff instead of ordering from the counter.  This is a million times better then Chompies any day of the week, and I will gladly drive back here in a heartbeat to get more food.Solid place, worth the drive.  Go check it out if you want good Deli done the way its supposed to be.

The meat shop in the back offers some good selections for you. It is very convenient to pick up from their refrigerated section or if you have a special order of halal goat, or cut up chicken etc then you just go in the back and talk to the butcher who quickly prepares it for you. A lot of people also choose to order over the phone and pick it up. We were so disappointed over the last few months with Baiz market for their meat selections and offerings(their halal ground beef is just gross, even the extra lean ground beef is awful )  that we finally made the switch to I-Mart after 5 years of exclusively purchasing our meat from Baiz originally. The meat and prices are incomparable to Baiz as I-Mart certainly offers a better selection in meat and their prices are slightly cheaper plus we don't have to deal with any attitude from the butchers like at Baiz. I am glad we finally found this place. They also carry a bunch of Indian and Pakistani spices, indian desserts, whole wheat flour from India etc.

Restaurant name  New York Bagels 'N Bialys
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Picked up a dozen bagels & bialys and sampled the corned beef.  Unfortunately the corned beef is at best a good goyashe corned beef, not Kosher or Kosher style.The bagels and bialys were top notch though.  Great selection.  What's the difference between a bagel and a bialy?  A bagel is boiled before baking, a bialy is not.  Bagels have a chewier hide.If you enjoy noshing on bagels (or bialys) I recommended getting them here.  It's about 9 bucks for a dozen and they are so much better than anything you'll find at the grocery.  We're talking east coast quality bagels here.This place reminds me of a mullet. Business in the front, and party in the back. In front, this place has all the characteristics of a hardworking, economically priced and noteworthy bagel/bialy business.But in the back, they have a full-blown, totally stacked, BAR! Party time, baby!New York Bagels 'N Bialys cracks me up. For the life of me, I will never understand this place. NYBB is an eerie combination of bagels and booze. Totally random and off the wall - just like my personality, and probably why I enjoy this place. I know it's hard, but try not to judge this book by its cover.Their bagels and bialys are my favorite circular delights in the valley. I'd never even heard of a bialy until Matt and I randomly stumbled upon this spot one hung over morning. I came to realize that bialys are awesome! Instead of getting boiled before being baked like a bagel, a bialy skips the boiling part and just gets baked. Their bialys come in almost all the same flavors as their bagels.NYBB does breakfast and brunch really well. When I used to live in the 85254, I came here almost every weekend. First of all, they make really great nonfat lattes, mimosas and road rash bloody marys. The coffee is around $2-3 depending on what espresso drink you desire, and it's cheaper/tastier than Starbucks. From the breakfast/brunch menu, my favorite dish is the veggie omelet but all the omelets are pretty delish. They have every ingredient combination imaginable, you can sub egg whites, and you get the following sides: a bagel or bialy and cream cheese, in addition to your choice of home fries (greasy deliciousness), cottage cheese, french fries, tomatoes or a potato pancake.I also recommend the house breakfast specials. The bagel with nova lox is to die for and the breakfast burrito is filling but it won't make you feel like an oinker. They also have egg bagels with cheese & bacon, sausage or ham! Oink Oink!I've never been here specifically for lunch or dinner but I have tried a pizza bagel from their lunch menu for brunch. They start at $3.49, and then you can add on your own toppings for 50 cents each! No pre-made garbage here my friends, just deliciousness. As a note, I'm only rating this place of breakfast/brunch and happy hour but FYI, they've got: sandwiches, salads, regular pizzas, nachos, quesadillas, chopped liver & bagels, potatoes and gravy, macaroni & cheese, desserts made from scratch, soups, smoked fish, burgers... oh, and they also cater. Basically, they try to accomplish too much with just one restaurant. Food wise, your best bet is to stick to the bagels, breakfast menu and pizza bagel (the desserts look good too).Then... after you finish business as usual for breakfast... you can come back!! Not only does this place change its name to the Rush Café in the evening but they also get the party started with $1.50 domestics from 4-7pm during their happy hour!!! Your buzz will be buzzing with wine, champagne, premium spirits and cocktails. Whatever your little heart desires!NYBB is one of the cheapest breakfast spots I've found. The wait staff ensemble does consist of a crazy cast of characters (they are all a little "different") but they provide excellent service. Everyone here enjoys engaging customers in conversation.Therefore, instead of giving yourself a mullet (if you do please send pictures), just come here! At NYBB you get business in the front and party in the back, without having to cut your hair.I wouldn't dare compare any of our delis in the Valley to those you'll find in New York.  Hell, the delis we have in Arizona don't even come close to the delis I group up going to in Detroit.  But, I've recently become very fond of New York Bagels 'N Bialys.  Not only do they have close to four dozen different varieties of bagels and bialys, but they have history... they've been around since 1987; they have fabulous service (thanks to Angela, who was my waitress the last two visits), they are kid friendly, ad they make a good bagel with lox and omelette.  They also have a check-in offer on the yelp app... check it out!I'm sure I'll be back to visit NYBNB soon... as a matter of fact, I already have a date planned with friends to return again during Passover.  Matzoh Brie, here I come!One last thing: the prices here may be higher than what you'll find elsewhere, but I do think the quality is worth it.This place has good bagels, but tepid service. I get bagels to go, and the last time I was there the kid making the bagels had no food service gloves on, and was taking money, making bagels, etc. Not the end of the world, but it does kind of junk you out. Another odd thing is that when you like your bagels double toasted, for some reason they put SO much butter on, it's almost like the bagel is deep fried. I haven't been back since the kid had poor food hygiene practices, but I need to get back there.

Restaurant name  Sam Woo BBQ Restaurant

Review Text :
The DYL crew was hungry and seeing as I know my way around town, I suggested some Chinese food.  That seemed to pique everyone's interest...the hungry group was ready to go as soon as I had mentioned it.   We managed to cram 8 people in the backseats of the Jeep Commander. Luckily, as the driver, I didn't have to feel like a sardine.  We headed toward Chinatown Plaza and reached our destination and piled out like clowns at the circus.  Sam Woo's was a blessing to many who thought they'd only be eating at the casino's the whole trip.I've been to Sam Woo's many times and have not been disappointed with the food.  It's typical HK/Cantonese food and reasonable for an individual or group.  They have Chinese BBQ, which includes roasted duck, roasted pork, BBQ pork, salted chicken, and soy sauce chicken, as well as other staples such as chow mein, chow fun, porridge, won ton, and other meat, vegetable, and seafood creations.  For this particular feast, we decided on a beef chow fun, chicken chow mein, honey walnut prawns, roast duck, bbq pork, spicy tofu, salted pork chops, Chinese broccoli, and Westlake soup.  Everything tasted good and seemed to satisfy everyone's palate.  The Asian restaurant row along Spring Mountain Road has grown over the years, and there are probably similar restaurants that can deliver the same or better quality than Sam Woo.  But it's nice to have a goto place that you can rely on when you're craving Chinese food in Vegas.B.A.R.F. Somehow we ended up here on 12.28.2008 instead of Ichiza (http://www.yelp.com/biz/ichiza-las-vegas) or Harbor Palace (http://www.yelp.com/biz/harbor-palace-seafood-restaurant-las-vegas).  BIG Mistake.  Long waits.  Poor service.  *Mediocre* food.  This is nothing like the Sam Woo BBQ in the Los Angeles Chinatown (http://www.yelp.com/biz/sam-woo-b-b-q-restaurant-los-angeles), which I was quite fond of from 1990-1999. 1 STAR for the decent Pork Chop with Spicy Salt.  Better food and better service at Food Express (see: http://www.yelp.com/biz/food-express-chinese-restaurant-las-vegas).  No go for Sam Woo LV.This place used to be my favorite Chinese restaurant in Vegas. What the hell happened? I told myself that I wouldn't mind paying a 15 dollar cab ride(one way) to Chinatown to eat here but it was terrible this time. The won tons here used to be great. The roasted duck was awesome. It's just not the same anymore. I hate to say this but I think MGM's Grand Wok is a lot better than this place. Not only that...........the prices are comparable to casino restaurants. After the cab fare...........Sam Woo is probably more expensive. A real disappointment.For a real decent Chinese restaurant off the strip................try Joyful House.  They have the best soy sauce supreme shrimps.  It's more of a dinner place but I love their food.My sister came to Vegas a couple of months ago and was raving about the roast duck she chowed on from Sam Woo.  She lives in San Francisco, and my parents were very skeptical about her excitement about this fabulous duck that she begged them to fly back with on their recent visit. (They refused.)The Husband and I wanted to see if it was all quacked up as she said it was supposed to be.  Mission: Roast duck to go.We did the quick take out side, although a peek at the menu definitely reflects that it's a better deal to take out if you can.$12 for half a roast duck$19 for whole roast duckIt was pretty easy to go for the whole duck.  We also ordered a couple of boxes of steamed rice as well so we could eat on the run.It was good - but then again, we haven't had any other roast duck in Vegas and it's been a long time since we've had roast duck in general.  Sure, I've had fattier ducks though than what Sam Woo offered, but there was definitely a good flavor in there.  The skin is the best part, but they could definitely have more meat on them.We ate half last night and the other half tonight.  We think we got a pretty good deal on the duck and we were satisfied with that.I spent some time living in SoCal, so I've had a few visits to Sam Woo BBQ there.  It definitely has me looking for other places that serve up roast duck though.Cash only on the take out side.Was a bit skeptical having lunch here because of all the negative reviews, but we came based on my cousin's recommendation who lives in Vegas and has eaten here numerous time.The positives:+ Food came out very fast.  We were very hungry, so this was a bonus.+ Food was tasty.  We had: beef chow fun, kung pao chicken, roast duck, roast pork, scallops with vegetables, choi sum, fried calamari. The negatives:- Cash only. - Extremely RUDE service.  Staff was more interested in eating their own lunch than taking our order of filling our water cups.  Actually, they never filled our water cups, just plopped a pitcher of water on our table and walked away.  As a matter of fact, that's how all of our dishes were delivered - server just dropping the dish on our table and walking away.  Never asked us how we were doing or if we needed anything.  Also forgot to give us the rice we ordered - had to remind the waiter.  Only made an attempt at being pleasant when it was time to deliver the bill.Won't be going out of our way to eat here again.CRAPPIEST CHINESE JOINT I'VE EVER EATEN AT! AVOID! I don't want to give it one star, but there's not an option for NO STARS on here. This place is CRAP.It's located in Chinatown about 10 minutes away from the Las Vegas strip. My family and I entered and waited to be seated. We waited for about 5 minutes. The joint was pretty empty except for two tables. We really shouldn't be waiting that long since there is a hostess stand, but the hostess was no where to be found. Weird...Anyways, we were seated and were immediately asked in Mandarin what we wanted. My mom asked them to speak in English and the waitress said, "What do you want?". Rude much. We ordered and our food came 10 minutes later.What we found most surprising? Charging for rice. We're Chinese and we frequent Chinese restaurants a lot and it's always complimentary rice whenever you order a dish. We ordered roast duck, soup, beef and broccoli, and the beef chow fun. We asked for rice and they gave us two small bowls and there's five grown adults here. I see other tables had the large red containers of rice while we didn't. When we got the check, they added 18% to 20% gratuity even though we were not a table of six. On their menu, it says they add in gratuity for tables six or more. We didn't want to tip at all, but they already included it. Don't dine here unless you want to be mistreated. There are numerous plazas and restaurants (pho/Vietnamese, Japanese, etc) surrounding this crappy place.  The service sucks as the servers are lazy and give you attitude if you try to get their attention. Also, PLEASE speak Chinese to them if you MUST dine here. My mother made the mistake of NOT speaking Chinese which I think made them believe we weren't Chinese and thus, gave us bad service.

Better than an average 3 star, for sure!  It reminds me of a Johnny Rockets or a nicer 5 & Diner.  The first thing I noticed was how clean it was.  All polished stainless steel and freshly wiped down red booths.  I almost felt like I was in a circuit board clean room.The food? Ohhhhh the food!  I split a swiss mushroom burger with the wife and I got my young one a kid's cheeseburger meal.  I really wish I would have ordered more, but the current status of our yackonomy advised me against it.The other food coming out looked ridiculously delectable, and it was brought out with the haste of an olympic sprinter.  Who could ask for more?I will definitely be coming back to here and recommending it to my friends.  Its well worth the 2 block drive from my house.  Did I mention they have breakfast!  I'm so there!

Review Text :
I love local run shops! I love when the owners are friendly with their cliental. This was my 1st time to Yoko, but I have to say I'm sure it won't be my last!   I ordered the orange chicken bowl, and now if you're thinking panda express chicken man you are off base. This is fresh orange chicken, with slices of fresh orange rinds in the sauce. It was a clean orange taste, very delish!  Was impressed.I'm from the Los Angeles area, the mecca of all good eats. So, believe me when I say this, there really isn't anything good to eat in Arizona.That said, Yoko is one of the very few places that I frequent when I'm in the area. It is definitely on par with, if not better than, most of the Asian/Japanese fast food joints in LA. Allow me to explain why this is the case.1. The food is freshly prepared from scratch. (In this day and age, few businesses can lay claim to this kind of practice because it is, dare I say it, honest) The orange chicken is my favorite item because, as names should suggest, the sauce is actually made with real oranges and the meat undeniably comes from chickens. I have asked the friendly, elderly Asian man (presumably the owner) on a number of occasions for the recipe for the awesome teriyaki sauce. No surprise, it is a closely guarded family secret - and with good reason.2. Some have commented about the decor of this establishment. I believe that this is a ridiculous criticism leveled at the restaurant owners. Take your pathetic sensitivity elsewhere. This is a casual, family-operated, fast food restaurant, not PF Chang's. (And if you're eating at PF Changs, I question your tastes) If anything, I am fond of the modest decor of Yoko because it isn't distracting. The owners have focused on bringing the customer an affordable, delicious meal. This is commendable. You should focus on your meal as well.3. The business is family-operated. The employees are genuine people and I always appreciate interacting with them at a level beyond my order. One reviewer commented that he/she was offended because an associate shared his/her gun control views. This is laughable. I guess freedom of speech stops short of restaurant and small business owners.Trust me on this one. Yoko provides excellent food and service at a reasonable price. It is definitely worth your time and money.

Review Text :
I don't know what I was expecting... I thought this would be a nice place for a nice breakfast... I was expecting frills... and boy was I disappoitned! My mom had breakfast there with a friend at the downtown location and loved it. So when we were on a shopping excursion to scottsdale this was the natural place to go for breakster. We entered the CRAZY busy resturant that was all hustle and bustle... I was excited. We sat down and pour ourselves some water and ordered our food. We laughed at the silly egg-centric western themed paintings and waited for our food. When it arrived it was a bit of a let down. The eggs benedict were mushy. I wish the english muffin was toasted more and the hollandaise was luke warm at best and became cold before I was done with my meal. It didn't help that the skillet they served it in was ice cold! I would have preferred it on a warm plate. The country potatos aren't anything great - but they aren't anything terrible eaither.  My mom loved her sun devils egg scramble with bell pepers and onions. Everything really reminded me of Denny's and Ihop. Nothing was substantial, other than the rudeness of my fellow diners. One woman sat and picked at her teeth with her bare hands! Mouth WIDE open and everything!! Another man came in without shoes!! not even flip flops! WTF?! I thought this was Scottsdale?! The hell?!To my fellow yelpers: it's nothing great, save your money and your time and try somewhere else.A classic breakfast joint that always serves up a tasty breakfast! I've been coming to The Good Egg for so many years, I can't remember the first time I visited. However, over the years, I've always known that Good Egg was there waiting for my visit. Consistency is perfected with The Good Egg and no matter the location, I always know I'm going to get quick service and classic breakfast food. Some say that breakfast tastes the same no matter where you go and I agree to a certain degree. When you perfect a classic, why switch it up? There are some who have created a unique twist on the classics, but The Good Egg is more about the classics (in a good way). They serve up pancakes, french toast, skillets, healthy start meals, omelets and a variety of Eggs Benedict. They also have a lunch menu but I typically stick to breakfast. You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu and if you are looking for a classic breakfast at a reasonable price, this is your spot. Be warned that they do get crowded on the weekends,

Restaurant name  Buono's Pizza

Review Text :
Ugh, I just made my first Yelp retraction.  I wrote a review of Buono's right before they switched over to new management.  When I got the text from a friend, a twice a week customer to Buono's that they switched owners and the food is now garbage... it was like a family member died.  We had our daughters birthday here, our son and I used to go to lunch here every Saturday.... This was our family establishment.  Sure enough my family had to try the food with the new ownership.  The pizza was garbage.  It was cheapened up... how could it be?  I was in denial.  Maybe it was an off night.  That's allowed right?  So we tried it again, this time I didn't even want to eat pizza.  I tried the meatball parm sammy (which was always my go to meal) it was horrible.  Soggy bread with tasteless meatballs... what struck me the most was this was a Friday night... it was a ghost town!  Two tables sitting at 6:30 and a 20 minute wait for the pizza.  Back in the day on a Friday night, the place was packed and an hour wait for the pizza.  Well, it looks like I am back to square one.  I need to find a pizza place.  I am so  bummed that a place I gave 2 five star reviews now get's 1 star.  Gone are the days....After watching my sister try on wedding dress after wedding dress after wedding dress after freaking wedding dress all day, pizza and Netflix sounded like a well-earned evening. I wanted to shake things up from our normal pizza routine (two other NY Style places, one in Mesa and one on Arizona Avenue in Chandler) and finally got around to trying Buono's Pizza this weekend. It's been on my bookmarks for years with several recommendations from friends, five minute drive around the block, can't hurt.Called in a 14-inch Neapolitan Pizza with Pepperoni ($13.95 pre-tip). The lady on the phone was friendly, and let us know that it'd be ready in 20 minutes.Walk in, and the place is pretty cool. Nothing fancy, but covered wall to wall with New York Sports Teams Memorabilia and other affiliated decor. Divey. My kind of place! Got home ready to tear into some pizza and the Netflix cue. Slight layer of grease typical of NY Style Pizza? Check. Crust that's still substantial and crispy despite said layer of grease? So far, so good! The pizza wasn't horrible; however, nothing stood out about it in terms of flavor . . .  And this was a very simple order, the ingredients should SHINE! Bland sauce and unexciting cheese blend. Perhaps Buono's was just having an off night, but I found their pizza to just be average. Not the first place on my list next time I want to have a lazy evening in.

So met my best friends in the world, Z and Dally, here for lunch today. I drove the 33 miles to Mesa in order to try a sub that I have been told is amazing. So, having trusted Z on many a thing and as he would tell you, always trust him when it comes to food, I was gleefully happy at the end of my eating experience. There are a lot of subs to choose from and it took me about 5 minutes to finally decide on the La Canna. Salami and ham with provolone and olives. Get it on the garlic-herb bread. Have the happy dude behind the counter throw on some spicy mustard, lettuce, tomato, onion, oil & vinegar, Parmesan, and oregano. The sub is toasted and doesn't shred the rough of your mouth, which happens to me quite frequently. I was still not satiated after this sub, so I split the White Widow with Z. Marinated chicken, bacon, provolone and ranch dressing. Again another great sub. The employees were all in a good mood. Not sure if that was herb induced or not, but it was pleasant. Phylis behind the register was particularly kind. She came complete with the stereotypical stoner laugh. She's cute. It was totally worth the drive and I will be back in the future to try something else.roll, roll, roll your joint. twist it at the end. take one puff, that's enough. pass it to a friend. ya sonnnn, i love this place. that song gets stuck in my head every time i go to cheba hut... the same way the jingle bells gets stuck in my head during christmas. i'm festive that way. i like the chicken with marinara on garlic herb. i add black olives, parm and oregano. ya son. then i top it off with a bite of one of their crazy rice krispy treats- reeces puffs, coco krispies and cinnamon toast crunch joined together by holy matrimony (aka marshmellow cream) is my idea of the perfect cereal  menage a' trois. those weird little kelloggs elves have NOTHING on the cheebs concoctions. i love people watching here, is everyone high except for me? the employees are so nice. i genuinely think they care when they ask me how my day is. so sincere. and they ask for my ID, so thumbs up on preventing theft. however, since im the only sober person there i have noticed the dust bunnies accumulating on their toaster. time to dust.

Restaurant name  Manuel's Mexican Restaurant - Tempe

Review Text :
Finally, a Mexican joint in Tempe I can rank with some of the best places in Phoenix.  We've been looking around for a while now to find a spot that is on the same level as Mi Patio or La Santisima.  This is it.  There have been a lot of disappointments and "pretty good" places, but the prize for best Mexifood in Tempe goes to Manuel's.For between $10 and $15, you get a big, hot plate of food with a smile from your server.  Every bite of my enchilada was loaded with cheese and meat, with a taste far more complex than that of most of the Mexican places in town.Manuel's has been around for a while, so they know how to serve you right.  Apart from the good taste of the food, our server and even the manager came around frequently to check in on taste, drink refills, or just to see if we wanted something.  Because of this, Manuel's is now our go-to place for a sit down Mexican meal in town.I have been coming here for many years. I had not been here for about 4 years now. So a long over do visit!This place is simple, simple and good!  It is very clean inside, including the restroom.The staff is great. We had a great male server. Sorry to say I cannot remember his name.  Chips and Salsa fresh and great!   Enchiladas are fresh and tasty.  I did not realize that Mexican food could be so bad till I went to a place in Scottsdale called , Jalapeno inferno! Because, of my Visit there I found how much I really appreciate Fresh, good Mexican food.This place is worth your time. Worth your Money. Good price as well. Get it a go!

Review Text :
Adequate - it filled me up and was convenient to where I was at.I was going to give it two stars for "Meh, I've experienced better" but the wings were pretty good, so I upped a star.  The wings had a good sauce on them, vinegary and spicy, and they were crispy.  They could have been a little bigger and meatier. The burger I ordered was a little overwhelming in flavors, and I actually had to stop eating it before it was gone.  The burger itself was rather small for a restaurant burger, slightly bigger than a patty from In-n-Out.  The fries were real potatoes that were nice and crispy, but not outstanding.The atmosphere was pure chain, through and through.  The service was adequate but not exactly great.I wouldn't go out of my way to go back, but if it was convenient I wouldn't say no.Islands... Something about the name in collaboration with the tropical sign that makes you feel like you are going to a wonderful amusement park for adults.  A place where you can relax on a beach with endless Mai Tais and feast on rotisserie style pig with pineapples.  Where dolphins spray you with mist from their little snorkel holes and Ariel gives you a lap dance. Okay, I probably took that a little too far, but you get the idea.As a matter of fact, the REAL Islands isn't much different than my fantasy restaurant in the Bahamas.  I mean, take away the dolphins, the pig, and the pornographic Disney character and you are right on the money!  Their drinks are marvelous and their burgers are insane!!! I mean psychiatric ward insane! You can take your 80 year old granny to Islands, and one bite of the Bluenami, and she will be ON the table doing the Arsenio Hall "Woo! Woo!"... It just does that to people.  That is why the LAST time I visited this place, I stayed FAR away from the burgers.I got the nachos.  I mean really, how can you go wrong with nachos? You can't, and believe me... Islands DELIVERED! It wasn't your typical 2 foot pile of tortilla chips with cheese and everything else.  It was a beautifully made craft of corn tortillas. The binding agent was an aromatic and delicious blend of cheeses that also cooled the palette from those commercial jalapenos.  It arrived with glistening globules of sour cream. The fresh stuff. I could have just stuck my spoon in it and eaten it all by itself. I didn't, of course... That would be nacho sacrilege!!! Olives, Beans, and Hot Sauce... enough said, right? I think so.The service was impeccable.  Aside from our waiter constantly calling me "Boss" and winking at my wife, it was perfection... I can't STAND to be called "Boss"... Seriously. No, really.

Wow. I thought I'd been to a Gameworks before, but this isn't the place I remember. Puts Dave & Busters to shame. Shame, brother. Hung out for a couple hours there this afternoon with my lil bro and man, we had a blast. Price-wise you can't beat the 2 hour unlimited play for $15 we hit. Don't think that's available all the time, but it was today. Score.  Service was actually really good too - what kind of service do you really need at an arcade? Well, not having been in one quite like this, it was kind of nice to have someone patiently explain the swipe card system (no pockets full of quarters anymore), not to mention the layout of the place (which is huge - two floors!). The selection's incredible - everything from your typical racing games, shooting games and fighting games to basketball and skee ball and air hockey - there's even stuff I've never seen before, like a Karoake booth and jumping games (?) and roller coaster simulators. And as one reviewer mentioned, there are several that even require a seatbelt. A seatbelt. Sweet.

The chocolate lava cake alone gets this place 4 stars. You place your order for it at the beginning of you meal because it takes quite some time to bake. There is a cute little lake/pond that you can get a window seat next to and watch the ducks. They print out their menu daily (maybe twice a day, I can't remember). My boyfriend loves the fillet here and I've had the sea bass and it was delicious. They also have a very nice salad bar where you can add your own ingredients to the salad and try some of their cold pastas. Our waiter was very attentive and made some great wine suggestions. This place has an upscale atmosphere to it even though most people dress in resort casual wear. It would be a nice place to go for a romantic dinner. *Sign up for their dining program. You get one point for every dollar you spend (not including taxes and tip) and my boyfriend said they accumulate toward free gift certificates.

NIGHT TO REMEMBERWednesday's three plus hour visit to the St. Rose Dignity Health's emergency room eliminated the idea of a home cooked meal. By the time I was released it was already most dark. So, where do you go for late dinner ?  How about trying Henry's American Grill that has been in our Garmin forever.This place is a few doors from Fausto's and across the street from the dreadful DMV. Two entrances, one to the dining room and the other for their smoke filled bar which was full of patrons.  Dining room was occupied by just one group of six and then us two. We pulled up to the small round table adjacent to the open kitchen.Tonight I'm in a mood for something fried. It would have been the chicken fried steak and eggs but they only start serving this after midnight. So how about their Pollack fish and chips. Tonight Yu-go chauffeur can eat a bear and quickly focused on "The Henry" aka "The Hank" their Blackened Prime Rib Sandwich. He asked our server Kali if she would request from the kitchen the closest to a rare cut.While waiting for our meal, we're watching the Chicago Bulls/ Thunder game. Derrick Rose is definitely back. More interesting was the sighting of the NFL TV package banner in front of the kitchen counter. Going to call in before Sunday to see if they'll show the Niners/Jaguar overseas game in the dining room where there's no smoking.The coleslaw, tartar sauce and three large pieces of pollack was plenty filling.  Not to forget their crispy fries.  Yu-go couldn't stop raving about his prime rib sandwich. He said it was the best with the rock salted outer trim, tenderness of the cut topped with a slice of Swiss cheese together with seasoned grilled onions and peppers. He didn't think he could put the sandwich away in one sitting.... how wrong was he. Definitely five stars for "The Henry" or "The Hank" when he eats it again.Kudos to our server Kali who works only on Wednesday evenings. Thanks for all the suggestions and information about Henry's American Grill. Looking forward to returning on Sunday morning and trying out their chicken fried steak and corned beef  hash while watching an NFL action in Wembley Stadium.Update:  Returned for another dinner plus watched a NBA game on TNT. The chicken fried steak was over the top wonderful. Prime rib this time was slightly disappointing.Cannot enjoy and watch sports in this environment with the type of background music being played.  I guess we could have watched the remainder of the game in smoke filled bar. But elected to head to the Sunset Casino for a quieter setting.Located in an obscure mini mall in Henderson, I came here with my friend on a drizzly day in July. When we arrived the restaurant was pretty empty. Just one other table was occupied, so the waitress told us to sit wherever we liked. Henry's has a home-y vibe. Lots of large booths and tables available to accommodate large and small parities alike.Our server approached us quickly for our drink order and returned swiftly with our drinks and carafes for each of us. As someone who requires lots of refills, I was a fan of this. Everything on the menu looked great so it took a while to figure out what we wanted. Our server helped us out by letting us know what her favorites on the menu were. She also explained that everything is made from scratch, so I was already excited about our meal.My friend ordered the Savannah burger with waffle fries and I ordered the fried shrimp with crispy fries and cole slaw. The food came out and it was delicious. My friend's burger was enormous and despite his hearty appetite was only able to finish half before throwing in the towel. My shrimp was tasty and fresh. I really wanted to try their desserts, but we were just too full. We will definitely be back next time for that. Service was friendly and incredibly attentive, as well.Used to be a favorite, Frank was awesome as the head chef however last time I went in I was told he was gone.  It's been a while since I had been back and I am sad to say its not the same.The wings were over cooked, they were supposed to be garlic Parmesan, what used to be a lot of garlic and Parmesan, now is barely garlic and Parmesan.  They just were not the same, they used to be covered in garlic and Parmesan.The BLT was good but again something from the taste was missing.  It seemed like the bacon was not only over cooked but it almost seemed like they are using a different kind then they used to.This was a great place for comfort food now it is just an ok place.  They do not have wifi still so that makes it inconvenient as a place to hang or meet with people if you need Internet access.All in all, this visit was less then spectacular.  I may give it another try some day but there really is no rush after the last two experiences.

Tea Lite Cafe's offers a quick and delicious meal. Located in the same complex as the Harkins 101 Theater, Babies-R-Us and several other large shops. Tea Lite offers a nice meal option for shoppers and business people alike. I recently visited with Gabi M, who is an expert (in my eyes at least) when it comes to Vietnamese cuisine and luckily I was with her to guide me through the menu. I wanted to get a full taste of Tea Lite Cafe, so we ended up ordering the Tea Lite Special which comes with spring rolls, egg rolls and Pho (choice of chicken or beef). This is absolutely the way to go, especially if you're a first timer! It provided a nice variety and was large enough to share. It's also very inexpensive and less than $9 for the entire dish! I thoroughly enjoyed the Pho and added hot sauce and the various spices.  There's not much to say about the atmosphere because there isn't much to the cafe. It feels like a cafe that you'd find in the busy streets of a big city. It's casual, clean and they featured pictures of the menu items on the wall. The service is incredibly fast too! We barely got our drinks and sat down and our food was already being served! It's perfect for a busy lunch hour. The owner was very friendly and helpful during our ordering process. We ordered a decent amount of food and after our meal, I decided that I wanted to try a BOBA because I had never had one before. However, I only had a credit card and they have a $5 limit. The owner was so nice that he ended up just giving me the BOBA because I had already ordered so much. It showed their level of customer service and his gesture went a long way. Meow, what are you waiting for? It's time for you to visit for lunch!I've been driving by Tea Lite for awhile but never had a desire to try this place but for some reason we decided to try it today. This is a small little place with a few tables outside with umbrellas and with about 8-9 tables inside. So for a big group is can be a little difficult. So you order at the counter and then you find your own table. They bring your food to the table. No number given, no name given. They somehow figure out what you ordered. Interesting. I ordered the Spring rolls to start it off. They looked really good. The rolls were pretty good. There was a lot of vegetables and shrimp. When you put the roll in that peanut dipping sauce, oh my goodness. Really enjoyed it soaking it in that dipping sauce. I ordered the Beef and Egg Roll. What a meal. Grilled beef, noodles, salad, and egg roll. Loved it all. They give you this sauce to dump all over it and it really brought out the taste. Nice tender beef. Nice salad. Really enjoyed the egg roll. Surprisingly, I enjoyed the egg roll more than the spring rolls. This was a really filling lunch and really good. My wife ordered the Chicken Pho. She really liked it. Got to try the chicken. Thinly cut chicken and it was pretty good. My wife was able to finish up her Pho. Only issue was it had a little to much MSG. Little thirsty afterwards. So the service was amazingly pretty fast. Our spring rolls came out really fast. This older Asian man rolled out the rolls on a carts and knew which tables ordered spring rolls. Impressive. All the food came out fast on this cart and the tables were cleaned up pretty fast. Tables were turning over pretty fast. So I couldn't ask for anything more. Good food, fast service, and big portions. We really enjoyed it and will be coming back again. Enjoy.

Why only 3 stars??? Well it was the service and not the food.We have been here before and had really good food and really good service. Not last night. We came here for dinner,I was very tired after a long day of work. I just wanted Ice Tea. No alcohol,which I very rarely drink anyway. T went to wash her hands and asked me to order her a hot water with lemon.When our server Sareena came over and I gave her the drink order, she seemed miffed we did not want alcohol. She kept saying ,"you don't want any Cocktails???When did CPK become the boozing place, Anyway, she brought out the Ice tea and hot water, however, no lemon and she was holding the glass from the top. It is a glass coffee mug ,it has a handle. Why are you putting your fingers all over the tops of the cups.??? T had to go to get lemon and napkins. She never asked her if she wanted more Hot water,but she did refill my Ice Tea.We ordered the Chicken Waldorf Salad. Which was great ,but she never asked us what type of dressing we wanted. It has 2 choices.  Plus she never brought us bread, we had to ask for it.I got the Fish Tacos and they were quite good made with Mahi.T got the Kung Pao Pasta, with Shrimp. I sampled that as well and it was awesome.However, Sareena never picked up any dishes from our table or trash. The manager did a drive by and she cleaned up the table for us.Even the table behind us,yelled out to her, hey can we get some bread!I do not agree with that, but clearly she did not know the proceedure.When T asked for more hot water,as she was not offered any.  Our server once again brought out the cup by the top and when she put it down she actually ran her fingers over the lip one more time for good measure. IT HAS A HANDLE,WHY ARE YOU FINGERING THE CUPS! Of course T was freaked out,because she is such a germ aphobe anyway.But even I do not understand why you would serve a glass or cup like that.We have always had good service at CPK, but not last night. However, the food was very good.

I've been coming to this place since I've moved to AZ about 10 years ago.  I ate here so often that at one point I was a "Mayor" on FourSquare and "Duchess" on Yelp!  They've changed ownership twice since 10 years ago, and the new one took over about 4-5 years ago I believe.  Their food's ok, but the best thing on the menu is their kimchi jjigae.  That's the reason why I came here all those times and I don't even touch their banchan, because it's so subpar compared to LA, SF, or NYC that it's laughable.  Their Soon Tofu is average and the Kalbi is average as well.  But you take what you can get here in AZ when you have a craving for Korean food.  Well, if you're serving mediocre food, at least you expect them to provide really good in service right?  NO!!  I have always been unhappy with their service since day one, but I just dealt with it.  Well, I've just had it today and sort of lost it!  The waiter (in his 20s, about 5'11" tall) who speaks fluent Korean and Enliglish, just pushed me over the edge!  WTF??  Are you kidding me??  I could not believe the service I was getting from this guy!  OK so here's what happened.I ordered 1 Soon Tofu Jjigae with only beef,  2 lunch special Kimchi jjigae, 1 Lunch special kalbi, 1 lunch special kalbitang. (5 total items)  He brought the banchan (side dishes) and rice and asked me if I wanted eggs in "all of our soon tofu jjigae."  I said I only ordered one soon tofu.  Then he said I ordered 2 kimchi soon tofu, 1 beef soon tofu, 1 kalbi, and 1 kalbitang!  I said "no I didn't" and I repeated what I ordered.  Then he argued with me and said "Yes you did! You ordered 3 soon tofu, plus kimchi jjigae, kalbi, and kalbitang!"  I said "are you kidding me right now?  Look here!  We're only 4 people!  Why would I order so many soups for?"  The guy must be a moron, because he can't even count how many people there are to be ordering 7 items?  Do we look like we could eat that much?  We were two slim adults, and two kids under 15!!  Then he let out a big sigh and then stomped off to fix the order at the kitchen.  He comes back with our food and he literally bangs the soup bowl onto the table!  He is obviously emanating a negative attitude, bangs down the rest of the stuff and stomped off.  I just shook my head and we started to eat.  Half way through the lunch we needed more rice and napkin so I called him over since he was bringing stuff to the next table.  He obviously heard me and didn't bother turning around.  OK, so I'm thinking to myself, maybe he didn't hear me.  I call him again second time and he pretended he didn't hear me.  Then the third time, I called him loud enough for the whole restaurant to hear me and then he turns around, rolls his eyes, makes a face and then comes over.  I couldn't believe my eyes!!  I asked him "are you giving me an attitude right now?"  then he yells (yes he yelled at a customer) at me and says "did I even look at you right now?"  Then he passes by our table, goes to the next table and "politely" asks  "may I take your order?"  WTF?  I asked him to help me get something and he completely ignores me?  Ok so let's recap here.  He takes the order wrong, puts in 2 too many orders of Soon Tofu, then gets mad at me when I correct him that isn't so, then he practically throws the food at us banging every chance he gets, and then he ignores me when I call him!  OMG!  At this point, I'm FURIOUS!  I get up and go talk to the owner who happens to be there today.  I reiterate everything that just happened and he doesn't say anything but to just look towards the direction of the kitchen!  Then I say to him "is it ok for the server to do that to a customer" and he turns and apologized.  He said that it's his fault for not training the staff correctly.  OK, so I'll take that for an apology, but then he should go quietly talk to the server, have the server come over and apologize to me personally!  Nope, that never happened, and guess what happened next?  The owner comes over to our table, being extra nice, and says he's going to take care of our lunch on the house.  At this point, I'm still shaking from rage and I can't even eat anymore.  I said I'm not making a scene, because I want free lunch.  I'm going to pay for what needs to be pay for, I don't want free lunch.  So while the owner's talking to me at our table, that server is standing near the kitchen talking to another server, looking directly at me, and laughing at me!  WOW!   Just amazing!  I've dined out at so many restaurants over the years in my life at all different levels, from Michelin starred to hole-in-the-wall scary places, but this was just the worst service ever!!Stay far away from this place!  I called my mother after what happened.  She was at a luncheon with 20 of her Korean friends for a church function.  You can bet that she spread the word.  None of those ladies are going there in the future.  And neither am I.  To the Owner:  word of mouth is a scary thing.Went here recently with the tour around-the-world lunch group that I organize.   This was a great lunch.  I appreciate a restaurant that understands that a group can grow.   Our group doubled in size from the start and our servers were more than accommodating.I ordered 2 things at this restaurant for lunch.  I ordered the Haemul Pajeon (Seafood pancake) to start.  I ate a small piece of it and had it packaged to bring home for lunch/dinner the next day.  A very tasty pancake with lots of shrimp and squid in it, onions and other spices.  Similar to an okonomyaki that we frequently see in Japanese restaurants.For my main portion of the meal, I had a bowl of the Kimchi chigae  (Kimchi soup)  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=piisc06BvMh6csRPY7RvHw&userid=DHQWSHz6b7Jsy-A04m1cIA.  The yelpers that said this was a delicious dish were  not mistaken.  A very well seasoned and delicious bowl of soup that had nice chucks of pork in it and the veggies.  Fellow Yelper and ATW lunch groupie, Dawn K, said she really enjoyed the somewhat fatty meat in the soup.  I personally enjoyed the spiciness!  I would eat this again and I can't wait to have it again.I wasn't very impressed with their banchan selection.  The side dishes just were not as tasty as I would have liked.

"You better cut the pizza in four pieces because I'm not hungry enough to eat six."  ― Yogi BerraNothing beats a cheesy deep-dish pizza with all your beloved toppings.  That original pan crust is crazy delicious.  It's always busy here for a reason.  I personally love the BBQ Chicken.  If you grab it to go, make sure you toss some fresh cilantro on top for even more flavor.  Their wings are also incredible and they even throw some Parmesan on top of the Garlic Parmesan Wings for more cheesy-goodness.  Nello's pies are flavorful and packed full of calories so if you're on a diet, leave it outside and indulge.  This 30+ year-old award-winning establishment is made of love.I think of dieting for the new year and then I eat Nello's pizza.  No shame.  No regrets.Thick crust, fresh toppings, great service! Delicious spinach salad, but super fatty and gross buffalo wings.I am officially on great pizza overload in this town.  Now that we've tried Nello's, it will be really hard to choose where to go the next time we're craving pizza (which is like every other day!).  Yesterday we decided to try somewhere we'd never been and Nello's was the place.  We walked in and sat at the bar and right away were greeted by Joshua who took great care of us.  He was fun to talk to as well.We started with a 1/2 doz. of the BBQ wings and those were nicely done and I think I managed to grab 2 before Mr. M scarfed them down like they owed him money.  They don't fry them, they bake them, which I can appreciate.  The less grease in my life the better.I ordered the 7" Pizza Bianca which was just four cheeses, but "just" four cheeses doesn't give this pizza credit.  The flavors were amazing!  This might be my new favorite pizza.  And I loved the crust.  Golden and buttery, chewy on the inside.  Perfect.My husband ordered the 10" Numero Uno, thin crust, which is sausage and mushroom.   This is our favorite pizza combo and it was great as well.  Chewy cheese and fresh, flavorful toppings.  It really doesn't get much better.The cold beers were reasonable too.  I had a pint of Four Peaks peach ale, and Mr. M had 2 pints of the Franziskaner Hefe Weiss.  That took us right back to Germany.  Each beer was $4.50.  What a deal!  All in we spent $36.36 before tip.  I can't wait to go back!

My experience here was awesome from start to finish.  I was greeted by an extremely friendly, smiling man (I believe to be the owner) who helped me with my order decision, took my order, then asked me to "please, sit down, be at home".  Awesome.I inquired about the salad and asked if they put any feta on the salad (they don't), he followed up informing me the sauce they serve has dairy, but that he would substitute garlic sauce instead.... now this might not seem like much, but to someone who has food allergies like myself, having someone with intimate knowledge of the ingredients and the care to make sure they don't serve you anything that might not agree with you is really a blessing and gives you assurance when you eat there.  Huge bonus.I had a half chicken shawarma and  half gyros plate which came with hummous, salad, rice, cucumber (substituted instead of pita since I don't eat wheat... nice touch) and a side of garlic sauce.  I do not normally enjoy chicken shawarma, but he insisted I try.  Well, he was right, I will say now I love chicken shawarma, Aladdin's chicken shawarma.  Their gyros was awesome too.. homemade, not the typical Kronos Meat Cone variety.  I paid after my meal and was welcomed back with a handshake.  Service was awesome, food was awesome, and they were able to easily cater to my picky food needs.  A+!

Review Text :
Wow, I'm going to have to show this to my friend who thought I was "being too picky" when in essence, he obviously  has some simple ass taste buds.It started out wonderfully. The sun was about 1/2 hour from setting and casting that orange glow that Phoenix does so well. We went there for the ambiance. I offered to treat. Little did I know, I was in for a treat and it sure as hell wasn't a good one.So we get Kathy (I think that was this crappy waitress' name).  She takes my friend's drink order and I'm still deciding and she just walks away. No "I'll be back" or anything customer service-y like that. Then she comes back and takes my drink order. Fine.She suggests the Pork chops and even though I eat 90% vegetarian, I go with her suggestion. Cause the alternative is one boring salad choice.  It comes back pink and rubbery. What the--?I don't give a crap what anyone says, pork ain't supposed to be pink. That  means it ain't cooked and I ain't eating it. So I send it back and it comes back clearly microwaved for a few seconds and guess what? Still freakin' pink on the inside.Lovely! So this girl asks if I want to try the  Chilean Sea Bass. Ok, now I've had too much alcohol and I'm not thinking properly cause that shit's endangered - - very politically incorrect but I'm near my boiling point  so I  agree and think surely something's getting spit in or on.Well, she brings out beers stating that "he bought you  2 beers for the trouble". Huh? He who? The waiter? The manager? And she damn near slams them on the table. Now I'm about to ghetto but my friend just casts me a look that puts me in check.So the sea bass finally comes and you are seriously not going to believe this-----it was pink and pretty much undercooked. And of course, I had her take it back and then it came back flaky. I ate a few forkfuls but was pretty much frickin done at that point and now burdened with a 3-beer buzz within 1.5 hours. Not good.That's why they put the restaurant on top of those damn rocks so you'll be distracted away from the crappy service, mediocre food, ignorant help, and gouging prices. There is no way that food is worth what they charge. And I agree 100% with the other reviewer that I could have made that shit at home. Cooked thoroughly and a helluva lot tastier and I didnt go to culinary school.There's so much more to bitch about people but I'll stop right here or you'll be scrolling down forever. I apologize for all the cussing. I don't normally in my reviews cause I think it's tacky. But this review could not have been true to itself without these appropriate words.I can't believe I tipped that jerk. What the heck was I thinking. One star and that's only for the view. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THE FOOD! DRINKS MAYBE SO YOU CAN GET THE VIEW BUT THATS IT!The view is definitely worth seeing. My fiance and I have been here twice. Once for Valentine's Day and a second time for a wedding reception. We actually pass this restaurant on the I-10 quite often and we would have never thought the view would be amazing. I actually don't remember the food all that much but the atmosphere was great.If the weather is nice out they'll allow outdoor dining but I'm sure with a little coaxing the Maitre d' will turn on the heaters and fire pit for you. Bring a coat/jacket/sweater in case. The service was amazing and the waiters were very helpful. Sunset is obviously the best time to go. During colder months I would suggest going in an hour before just so you're not stuck in the cold weather. You will be treated to the bright lights of Phoenix and the airplanes that go in and out of Phoenix International Airport. But don't worry you don't hear any noise from the airport or the nearby freeway.The wedding reception followed a beautiful ceremony that took place below the restaurant near the pool/waterfall. I think they fit about 200 guests in the entire restaurant. The appetizers were decent and the buffet was typical nothing out of this world.I would definitely rank this one of Phoenix's best restaurants with a view. Perfect for any romantic dinner or social event.I do not know what is going on at this place. It used to be a lot nicer.I know that they are fising this whole place up to be high end again. But, they should just shut it down and start fresh. Shut it down, remodel, and reopen.We were staying at the hotel here so we wanted to give them some business. We went at happy hour. The server suggested some really good food items actually we ordered about 4 things. They were all really good.The best thing was those Canadian french fries. They were really great! We ordered those on suggustion of our server. Glad we did. All the food was good , but those were best.It just looks old and dirty and worn out in there. THe Manager was standing around doing nothing the whole time. I thought maybe he should of been more pro active helping the staff. They were not slammed but, you can always help your people.If not why even be out there helping.I hope they fix it up nice again then we will be back. But, for the prices they charge on everything it is just not all that.

Review Text :
Word must've gotten out about Sakana because tonight (on a random Tuesday night), I showed up with 2 girlfriends around 6:45... we were all craving sushi and couldn't wait to sit down and order.  We walk in and what?  a wait?  20 minutes?  Wow!  I never had to wait at this place before!It's great quality sushi, large portions compared to other sushi in this town, decent service, and casual.  Yes, casual.  We were all in gym clothes and no one looked us up and down.  It was great!The garden salad with ginger dressing is like 3 x the size you get at other places.  The rolls are big and filling and the sashimi comes with plenty of fish!  Caution on spicy items:  IE spicy tuna and spicy salmon - you might want to tell them light on the spice... I usually like spicy but I think tonight's sushi chef has a heavy hand!Nothing better than the complimentary fresh sliced orange and whipped cream to end your meal here either... it was worth the wait!There are sushi snobs everywhere. Sushi in Phoenix? Ha. At least that's what I used to think. Sure it's easy to look down on everyone who thinks they've had good sushi after eating at Ra, or Zen 32 - but forgive them, this is Phoenix and they're still learning about sushi and that's okay.When they're done having bad california rolls and a happy hour menu full of pieces that fall apart, take them to Sakana in Scottsdale. I know, I said Scottsdale but don't let that turn you away. Sakana is away from the cheesy old town and located in a non-descript strip mall on Hayden just east of Scottsdale Rd. You won't be disappointed. In fact, you'll be surprised at how awesomely fresh, clean and flat out delicious your food will be.If it's just you and a friend, I'd definitely recommend sitting at the bar and not only watch the sushi chefs work, but actually talk with them. While there are a few who would prefer not to say anything, there is usually at least one who's up for anything and definitely up for you buying them a cup of saki.The lunch and happy hour specials are excellent here. Order lots and try everything eventually. It's all good.We used to live deep in Phoenix at 36th st & McDowell and we'd make the trek to Sakana simply because anything else was bound to be sub-par. Sure Zen32 was practically in our front yard, but we'd simply keep driving.The ambiance is everything you'd expect for being in Scottsdale except you'll notice that families come here. You'll see groups of friends both old and young eating and drinking - all without the pretense you'll find down in Old Town. This isn't the sushi restaurant to be seen, this is where you go if you want the best sushi you can find in all of Phoenix.If you grew up and Phoenix and the first time you had sushi was during a Zen32 happy hour, graduate and get over to Sakana in Scottsdale.So I really fought coming here because it always looked like a hole in the wall to me. My mom loves coming here (but then again she loves wildfish )So I said what the hell. She chose this place for here bday. We got there at 5:30 right when it opened so we were instantly seated. It was happy hour and they had the basic rolls half off. We ordered the spicy tuna and the tootsie roll. The tootsie roll was not the normal salmon cream cheese schpeal it normally is. It was just cali roll with Shrimp tempura. I would give the spicy tuna roll 3 stars, it gets 3 and not 2 only because it wasnt fishy. It was just rice and heavily mayo'd tuna, with no spice. They should have added a little green onion put half as much mayo and maybe added a little cucumber for crunch. The tootsie roll is impossible to f up there, so it was good for what it was. We also ordered one of the speacialty rolls the yellow tail tempura. It was ok again 3 stars only that high because no bad fish flavor. It seems the quality and care for the fish is there but the sushi chef destroys all the rolls with too much mayo or Krab. They should invest in a few new chefs or training or something. Even the shape was off, it seemed this guy was straight out of school? Maybe it was  just the guy who happened to be there that night?I would go back but only if I was meeting someone there.I ate here months ago, but I still yearn for the great crunchy calamari salad I had!  Golden-brown calamari, tasty, yet not too greasy, over crisp-fresh greens (mostly romaine) and just the right amount of sesame house dressing.  This resto is significantly smaller than that in Ahwatukee, which gives it a nice romantic ambience.  That is, until it fills up, and then it can feel quite claustrophobic in here.  I would imagine that it'd be a great place to chill out during happy hour: I've spotted nice-looking people here when I wasn't even looking to meet any!Eat and drink your heart out and chances are, you'll leave with less than $20 missing from your wallet; at least that's how I feel every time I visit Sakana. Hidden within a random strip mall on Hayden and Indian Bend, Sakana is unassuming and I've passed by many times before actually venturing inside. Friends swore by it, so I had to give it a try. When I walked inside, I was immediately welcomed by sushi platters staring right at me.. very similar to sushi restaurants I see in SF's China Town. As weird as it seemed to stare at sushi that was either plastic or had been sitting out way too long, it did give me a good idea about what I wanted to order: everything on the menu of course. When I visit, I can roll in sushi, wash it down with plenty of sake bombs and leave with a satisfied appetite and happy pocket book. I've been with a large group of friends as well as just a couple and it's always an enjoyable...sake-filled experience. You can't beat their happy hour. From the inexpensive sushi to the really inexpensive sake, it's a match made in sushi roll heaven. The restaurant isn't exactly huge and I've visited when there was a line out the door. At the same time, I've also visited when I'm the only one there, so it all depends on the time of year and day of the week. The staff is very friendly and you can watch the sushi chefs working their magic at the sushi counter. Sakana proves that you don't have to visit the finest sushi establishment in the Valley to dine on some high-end, delicious sushi. Their prices make me walk through the door and their sushi keeps me coming back for more. And the sake? Well the sake just turns the night into a whole different story in itself,As a foodie, cook and native Arizonan, I've always had this strange misconception about eating fish and seafood in a landlocked state. My mindset was simply this, don't do it. You see it only took that one bad experience from years ago and I've held ever single seafood restaurant accountable since. With the passage of time and through technology, modern shipping and refrigeration methods the life of fresh fish and seafood has been greatly extended. So much so that my attitude towards eating fish has turned around completely and now I crave it.While fish was exiled from my life, Sakana sushi was quietly building a mini sushi empire of Japanese restaurants. Since opening their first in 1996 they've continued to expand and now with 4 valley locations, it won't be hard to get your sushi fix without breaking the bank, especially at lunch time. Each day Sakana offers several different daily creations and specials in addition to the 15 or so items on their standard lunch menu. Between you and me, go for one of the daily specials. These lunch plates are massive and will satisfy the most famished of appetites. You'll see exactly what I mean if you order up the Chicken Maturi ($8.99). A whole chicken breast pounded out into 2 thin slabs, breaded and deep fried until golden and crunchy is then dressed with a slightly sweet soy sauce. Oh and that's not all, along side is a salad of mixed greens and a half of a crab filled California roll. You will not leave hungry.Along with a happy upbeat greeting when you arrive at Sakana, Miso soup comes standard just as soon as you sit down; talk about an efficient lunch service. For a light snack to accompany the soup I also enjoy ordering Edamame ($3.25); steamed soybeans sprinkled with salt, that are as much fun to say as they are to eat.Many people do not understand the difference between sushi and sashimi. This is actually really easy; sushi refers to the vinegar cooked rice while sashimi refers solely to the fish itself. To see the difference first hand, order the Sakana Lunch ($9.99). Thin slices of sashimi; raw salmon, tuna, shrimp, albacore and house smoked salmon are placed on top of sushi; rice. Served on a wooden board, a California roll and a rotating fried item accompany the special. If you're dieting and trying to watch your starch intake, Id highly recommend trying the Sashimi Deluxe ($11.99). Not only do you get a crispy salad but a platter filled with a delicious combination of sliced salmon, tuna, albacore and hiramasa aka Australian King Yellow Tail. However this line up isn't set in stone as the chef will change these out with what's available any given day. What you can take for granted is the freshness and quality of each type of fish served.For the price, Sakana is hard to beat, though for peace of mind, I would have gladly paid more.

Yes, you see it correctly, I just gave Chevy's 5 stars.... Why you ask? Well when i lived in Cali we would meet our friends at Chevy's for the awesome happy hour and have some great margaritas. Since coming to Vegas I thought that there was not any Chevys around anywhere. We ventured over to the mall and guess what I spy?!?!?! CHEVY'S. I think they have great salsa and I really like the nachos.. I am in no way saying that this is "real" Mexican food but it was good and cheap. If I really think about it I am giving this place stars just like how you would give your friends that you have not seen in a long time a high five long before you ask how life has been treating them. So in all reality the food could have been so-so but it was all about the reminiscing.Anyone want to go get a Margarita... Count me in!I am disappointed after tonight. We were seated quickly, the place was not busy.My guy asks what kinds of Tequila they have (he hasn't been here) and the waitress snottily says, "We're a Mexican restaurant, reallyyyyy...?"RUDE. You couldn't have told him a few of your best sellers, or any recommendations? Our waitress took our (alcoholic) drink order, but didn't come back with any waters. We were then approached by 2 separate servers trying to take our drink/food order. A few weeks ago, I was here with a girlfriend (DEC 27,2013). Their fresh fish tacos are done with Tilapia (gross to me) and last time I was able to switch it out with their Mahi.By the time our waitress got us our drinks from the bar, we had gotten our waters. We asked our original waitress for lemon slices when she was ready for our food order.I asked for the fish tacos, with the Mahi. She said that there might be a up-charge (there wasn't last time) but I told her that was fine. I didn't recall what my guy had, but it was a combination plate with floutas, a Chile rellaneno (I know I am completely butchering this spelling wise, sorry) and a chimmechanga.After taking our orders, and our menus, the waitress comes from the back and tells me that her "manager said no to the Mahi." I grabbed another menu and ordered the Mesquite chicken tacos.Still no lemon wedges. She walks around the restaurant. We ask another waiter, who Finishes cleaning a few tables, putting dishes away, and still gets us our lemons before she does. Ugh.Our food comes, and it's good. I prefer their kickin chicken tacos, but those were discontinued, I guess. We asked for some sour cream, which they will charge you $1.30 for. Annoying, but whatever.While we were eating, we saw the manager walking around, and usually, a manager will ALWAYS at least greet us and ask how our food was. This guy didn't.... Our waitress had no problem just kind of yanking our plates out of the way. It must have been a bad night for her.Meh. It makes me sad to write this review. Food was good, but service and management are not on the same length.

If you are going to include 'Island' in your name, you better make us feel like we are on an island.  Indeed that is what they have done.  From the faux palms to the cartoonish waves and surfers, it was well decked out for a school play.  But that's not why I love this place.  The one item that beats the competition is their teriyaki beef bowl.  The beef is prepared so tender topped with their homemade teriyaki sauce.  You can tell it had been braised for hours.  When you can leave a memorable impression like that, you can Yelp about it later.Their menu is focused on primarily meat and rice--just the way I like it! The lady behind the counter is so sweet and kind.  This mom and pops is the type of place you come for those delicious cheap meal nights.  No doubt I will make a return.

Um, something has happened to this place, and it ain't good. I felt like I walked into a Cronenberg film where you don't know if anything is real.Every redeeming quality is now gone. The roaming singer is gone. They have a bar but don't even produce drink menus any more, and the waitstaff can't readily list drinks available. Not good when the wife is looking for drinks. The service is awkward and slow, even though they sat us at a table next to at least a half dozen servers who loitered around the kitchen area with the manager. I couldn't tell if they were off the clock or hanking or both. The only reason we went here is because they take reservations and someone in our party was concerned about restaurants being crowded. The hostess made a point of telling us over the phone that they don't usually take reservations on such short notice, but they would accommodate us. When we arrived, the place was mostly empty. Inflated sense of self-importance, much?The only reason I bothered updating this is because you might be like me: easily conned into going here when you're hungry. Well, resist the temptation and insist on going elsewhere.A friend of mine invited us to dinner here.  It's been a while since we've been to Macaroni Grill.  We use to eat at a Macaroni Grill for lunch all the time, but in recent years have ignored it.I have a favorite dish....the Pasta Milano (Roasted Chicken, Sun-Dried Tomatoes, Mushrooms, Farfalle Pasta in a roasted Garlic Cream Sauce, $11.99).....but I got it without Chicken since I'm on a no Meat diet.The Better Half ordered the Crusted Sole (Filet of Sole topped w/Lemon Butter & served w/Sun-Dried Tomato, Spinach Orzo, $14.99).I didn't like my Pasta Milano.....the Cream Sauce was very watery and didn't have much flavor....bland, which has never happened to me when I've ordered it.The Better Half enjoyed her Sole, but didn't think it was anything beyond average.My friend ordered the King Salmon ($17.99) and enjoyed it.If I was rating this dinner on my experience alone, it would have been 2 Stars....but since the other two dining with me enjoyed their meal, I'm bumping it up to 3.  The service was so/so.....young wait staff here with plenty to learn about service....I didn't ding them because of their inexperience.  They were pleasant and sincere....which goes a long way with me.Return Factor - 30%I'm giving one star for the friendly waitresses. The food portion sizes for to-go are horrible . I paid a lot of money for kid portion sizes... will not return or recommend. I recommend those waitresses go elsewhere .

Another five star service restaurant in Fountain Hills. I think people here are just very nice. We came here for weekday night quick dinner the other day, and I really had nice pleasant time dining here.It wasn't crowded at all at dinner time, very small place, six or eight tables (can't remember exactly). You order at the counter first and they will bring your food.  Since it wasn't the full table service restaurant, I wasn't expecting much but the staff took our order came back to our table at least 4 or 5 times over the course of dinner to make sure we were doing well. He brought a big bottle of water, and when we finished a bottle, he came back with more.Food was good, I liked the pizza I ordered. Garlic knots and marinara sauce was nice appetizer to have.  Pasta meat sauce wasn't what I expected but we ate all anyway.  It's so close to my house, I think I will add their number to my phone, so I can order pizza from them whenever I don't feel like cooking.

Review Text :
A fantastic breakfast/lunch spot that supposedly caters to Vegas power brokers...whatever those are. Lots of signed headshots on the walls, that kind of thing. Patio dining looking out over a quiet parking lot, extensive menu, great food. I dig everything about this place except the fact that it closes at 3pm. Who the hell wants to weigh themselves down with a ginormous meal that early in the day???Still, highly recommended. If looking for a good breakfast spot on the West side, it's a toss-up between this place, the Omelet House, and the Egg &I. The food at all 3 is of equal excellence, but Coffee Pub has the edge because you can dine al fresco, and the view/atmo is better than that of the Egg &I's patio.Arrived for breakfast on a weekday morning. Parking was convenient to locate and I was seated immediately. Free wifi is a plus but you need to obtain the password from a staff member.I asked my friendly waitress what she recommended and she replied - the Hervos rancheros, which I went with. When my entree arrived I bit into the eggs which were smothered in cheese, cooked perfectly medium and tasted delish. The entree came with a large amount of re-fried beans and I ended up eating only half.The coffee here was hot, strong and was a good chaser for any BF entree. I noticed they also offer a lobster omelet so that will be worth a return visit.A lovely surprise!I just found out about Coffee Pub from a girl friend of mine. She promised I would love it. We met there for coffee and she was right, this place is so cute. We sat outside and enjoyed delicious caramel macchiatos. Our server was a younger guy, super nice and very attentive.The owner was walking out to run a delivery and stopped to say hello briefly. I have yet to eat food from here but their menu is extensive and I have heard good things. I will definitely be back to try breakfast.I have driven past the Coffee pub more times than I care to remember- because until yesterday, they were usually always closed. But finally, I made it by when they were open!Walked in toward the end of lunch for a takeout order. I went with their daily special, the Baja Chicken sandwich- chicken with olives and onions and a chipotle sauce and two kinds of cheese, with tomatoes, and lettuce. Each sandwich comes with a side, (potato or pasta salad, chips or fruit)- I chose the pasta salad. I also added the Chai This blended drink- chai, banana, protein powder, and soy milk.Service was friendly though they nearly mixed my order up with a group order.  Dining room with the barista is surrounded by windows and has almost an old school diner feel to it- but there is far more space in the other adjacent dining room than I expected. Larger than it appears on the outside.Got home with my meal- sipped the chai drink as I drove and it was delicious! A bit steep at over $6 for a 24 ounce cup, but it was tasty. Sandwich was $8.50 including the pasta, and the sandwich itself was enormous! I only ate half and gave the other piece to my BF, along with the pickle. Pasta salad was also a decent portion, served in a lidded Styrofoam cup to keep it cold and prevent spills. Also fresh and flavorful, with bits of tomato and a creamy white sauce similar to salad dressing.Delicious sandwich, good portions, lots of variety on menu- will come back to try another sandwich, or perhaps a soup. Today they were out of cream of mushroom, but let me know it usually sells out fast.I've had this place bookmarked for a minute and I was majorly disappointed. Coffee Pub has all of the makings of a hole-in-the-wall/hidden gem, but doesn't stack up. We were instantly greeted and sat, but it took about 5 minutes before a waitress came over. The place wasn't busy at all. Our drinks came out quickly and their iced coffee and espresso based drinks are amazing. Unfortunately, everything else was lackluster.I ordered the Pub Dip, the bread was over toasted and the beef was cooked to the point where it has a rubbery, bad clam texture. My sister ordered the huevos rancheros which was eggs covered in salsa and crusty re-fried beans.My mom's eggs were overdone, her potatoes burnt, but the sausage patties were okay.The food here was on par with a low grade buffet. Nothing tasted fresh.  The food took forever to come out and the service was just blah. I won't be headed back to the Coffee Pub no matter how great their coffee is.

Saddens me to drop a star but tonight's fish was not up to par. It was a different breading and not as good. Service was almost bad, no refills on water, never received the beer we asked for, and never received the last refill of fish. The wife salad was just ok, they were out of blue cheese. I swear shit like this only happens when she goes with me there. LOL

When I think of sports bars I envision pitchers of beer, hamburgers, more TV's than you can count, team memorabilia, life size cardboard cutouts of Shaquille O'Neil that scare the shit out of you when you turn the corner, shoddy service, janky menus, video games, tons of dudes and the token girl who pretends to be into sports.. Horse & Hound delivered and will provide you with all of the above. Two rooms of it even.. this joint is huge! They even have one of those claw games, but instead of being full of cheapy stuffed animals or 6 year old snickers bars, there were lobsters in it. Live lobsters that you can catch and have them cook.. no I did not do this.. I had nachos instead.I am adding a star for the sheer fact that they had an area devoted to the Red Sox (Yes all you Yankee fans can unfriend me and kiss my ass), another star for the shuffleboard table. I freakin love shuffleboard with a passion.. wasn't sure why it was situated directly underneath the 17 big screens, perhaps for the attention whores out there? Whatever, bravo anyway.This place is great for all you sports fans.. literally, every sport was playing on one of the 50 TV's and they will put your game of choice on the large flat screen front and center if you ask nicely, or tip well.. Either or.P.S. Its also great for off-site betting ;o)

Review Text :
I just hung up with Rosati's pizza after calling to let them know of our poor experience.  My boyfriend went there with our two kids to pick up the pizza.  He waited 10 minutes watching our pizza sit there while they served about 10 other customers picking up their pizza.  By the time we got it it was cold.  The kids were hungry so he brought it home and we ate it.  Cold pizza is better than no pizza and hungry kids.  I called Rosati's; while on hold I listened to their "Satisfaction guaranteed" message.  Finally talked to a woman who claimed she was a manager.  I asked for a refund because my pizza was cold.  She insisted my pizza was not cold, and refused to give me a refund because we already ate some of the pizza.  So I'm supposed to turn around with my hungry kids and bring the pizza back and wait 45 minutes for another one?  Please.  Clearly they are disorganized about their service because they couldn't even find our pizza for 10 min while it was sitting right there getting cold.  She was extremely rude and obviously uninterested in providing good customer service.  1 star because the cold pizza was edible.I pass on this place.  We had loved Rosati's in Arizona and finally decided to try them here.  I would think they would be close to consistent in their food but I was completely wrong.  First off their delivery time initially stated was 1 hour. That was fine but then 1 1/2 later was when it was finally delivered.  Time is of the essence when I'm hungry.  They failed. Once we received our order I noticed they sent pizza dough nuggets instead of the garlic knots I ordered.  Fine. Whatever I was hungry.  Upon opening the bread box, sauce was leaking out of the corner with sauce all over the top of the pizza box.  In the end it didn't matter because they were cold and not good.  We didn't eat them.  They are consistent with one thing... Spilling sauce all over their delivered items.  The chicken wings had blue cheese dressing all over the container.  Did it make the wings better? No. They were completely overcooked and tough.  Yuck.  Was the pizza alright? Nope. 3 for 3.  It was cold with hardened cheese.  Crust had no flavor.  With bad food and delivery wait time, it was clearly disappointing.

Yum! Yum! Yum!  Friends introduced us to this place - they're regulars and we may be too.  It's a hidden place, but once you find it you are welcomed into a gorgeous restaurant with plenty of space.  They have a good sized drink menu, and my first "Yippee!" happened when I saw they had choices for margaritas that didn't include syrup and sweetness that you can get with margarita mixes.  I could actually taste (and later feel!) the tequila.  My second "Yippee!" happened when I was informed that the Chile con Queso was (gasp) vegetarian!  It was absolutely delicious and hot and if I wasn't watching my athletic figure I would have chowed down on it and the thick chips that go with it.  My third "Yippee!" happened when I saw black beans on the menu.  Black beans that are lard free!  My black bean and cheese burrito was amazing - not too greasy, just the right amount of cheese.  They also had more vegetarian choices, and I'll have to try the Spinach Enchiladas one of these days.  Loved everything about this place - will definitely be back!  But not on Tuesdays, since I'm not interested in seeing kids eating free.

Review Text :
First off, I love this kind of Mexican food.  The kind that is covered in cheese and so unbelievably unhealthy that I shudder to think what the caloric content is.  I swear AZ has it's own brand of Mexican food.  When I lived in L.A., there was no way I was finding a deep fried burrito covered in jalapeno cream cheese and then topped with more cheese or a Mexican pizza with that same jalapeno cream cheese used as a sauce.   Ajo Al's does have lighter options and their Salad Carbon is favorite of mine as well, but sometimes I just need to indulge. You should know something else.  I worked here as a hostess when I was a senior in high school.  So, I had the opportunity to try a ridiculous amount of Ajo Al's food.  I still love this place and always will.  If you're like me and you love the Sonoran style food served in places like Julio G's and Valle Luna, you'll like Ajo Al's too.  You should also know that I don't understand when people say this type of food is not authentic.  Authentic to what?  I sure can't find this crap in California, New Mexico, or Texas; all of which border Mexico.  So, it must be authentic to Arizona, right?  And that is what I love, good ol' AZ Mexican food.Happy 25 year anniversary, Ajo Al's!Yes, it's a local chain with four Valley locations, and this is one of the two locations I've actually been to... but it's family owned and operated and still going strong after 25 years.  There's something to be said for that!It's not at the top of my list, but I've never been disappointed by Ajo Al's.  I go maybe once or twice a year for lunch or dinner.  When I recently had a craving for Mexican food, I suggested this place to my friends and they gladly met me here.  Our waiter was attentive, the atmosphere is fine, the chips and salsa are addicting, and the food is A-OK.  Portions are large.  I had a burrito (enchilada style per the waiter's suggestion) and a salad and took half of my meal home.  My friends went with a burrito and a quesadilla respectively.  None of us oohed or aaahed over the food, but we ate it and it was fine.  Prices are moderate.  Oh, and my leftovers were just as good the next day for lunch!One weird thing: on their menu, they list several items with guacamole but it's funny... every time that guacamole is listed they put "(meatless)" by it.  Has anyone ever had guacamole that is not meatless?  I found that really awkward!Anyways, if you're in the mood for traditional Mexican food, you can't go wrong with Ajo Al's.  I'm sure I'll end up there again in another six months or so!We came here for Valentine's day because my husband's sprint phone was not working.   We drop off the phone and walked over for a quick bite.  We were lucky we got there before the crowd.  We waited for a few mins, before we were greeted and sat.  Within 15 mins, the place was packed with people.  We sat down and received a basket of warm chips and two salsa.  Then we got two cups and a pitcher of water.  The lady did not say anything to us and left.  I was not sure if she is coming back or not.  ???  Then our server came to greet us.  She was very nice and told us the special.  She took our drink order and swoosh she was gone.  She had a ton of tables.  She came back quick with drinks and to take our food order.  I ordered the Comb #11 Chimi with chicken served with beans and rice.  The red sauce had good flavor, the chicken itself was bland, the rice was good, and normally I am not a fan of refried beans but theirs was pretty good.  To sum up everything, it was ok.

This was the highlight of a wasted 2 hours or so on the way from Tucson to Sedona yesterday.  This and the magnificent sculpture of the horse in the parking lot of the strip mall that houses the restaurant.  The horse is a combination of chromed and rusted metal and found objects, larger than life and probably comes from a gallery here in Sedona.  We were on a fool's errand, looking for an arts and crafts show that was described as one of the 3 best in the nation.  Not by MY standards.  In fairness, I didn't look at all the offerings, probably not even half, but was I saw would have been juried out of the Brookside Art Annual in KC.  But on to this wonderful restaurant, a homey little cafe that we wandered into by chance.  It was fairly new but our waitress was an older woman who called us darlin'.  Tam, don't read any farther...  We both ordered their special green salad topped by small scoops of chicken salad, egg salad and tuna salad, each one excellent.  It was a light, pleasant lunch and very satisfying.  And Tam, I know you didn't listen to me and you just threw up in your mouth.  One of these days you'll learn...

Ok, ok, you got me Mr John. Seems like when lunch time comes around, you just happen to have a location that is conveniently nearby. I have been to this location several times before you guys decided to close down to remodel and boy that seemed like forever. Now that you guys are open, I see that you made the place even better. I think out of all the other locations I have been to, this is definitely the biggest one.As for the sandwiches, you cant really go wrong with any of them. Except maybe the veggie sandwich. Come on man! What kind of sandwich is that if you don't have any meat up in there? To me that sandwich does not exist except for when I mention that it doesn't exist in this review.I basically have 4 sandwiches I order as a normal rotation. They are #8 Billy Club, #14 Bootlegger Club, #16 Club Lulu, and if I am really hungry, The JJ Gargantuan (it's so much meat that giving it a number was not gonna be enough).Sure I can go on and on about what is in these sandwiches but I don't want to waste your time. Just stick to this rule of thumb: If you like ham, roast beef, turkey, and bacon, then any one of those that I mentioned will definitely satisfy you especially the JJ Gargantuan. This monster has salami, ham, capicola, roast beef, turkey and provolone topped off with onion, lettuce, tomato, and Italian dressing.Pro tip: If you refer to their menu, there are freebies that you can have them put in your sandwich like onions, lettuce, tomatoes, mayo, sliced cucumber, hot peppers, dijon mustard, yellow mustard, oil, vinegar, and oregano. If your sandwich does not normally have these items, they will not put it in your sandwich unless you specifically tell them to. Same thing for freebies that are already in your sandwich. You can order extra of that item. Also don't be afraid to ask for different bread. They give you the standard white bread with all your sandwiches but you can ask for wheat or the traditional sliced bread.Service will always be lightning quick because of a couple of factors. All the sandwiches they make are cold so there is no time wasted in cooking or heating anything up. Secondly, they have an assembly line type of set up so you have different people taking turns putting stuff in your sandwich.The only thing that takes that one star away is that because they don't have any hot sandwiches like meatball or a cheesesteak. I love my usual sandwiches but sometimes I gotta have something hot and fresh off the grill. Until they make that happen, it will always be 4 stars from me.Yelp 2014 365 Review Challenge #66

Review Text :
Maybe it's been a while since I last stepped foot into a Carrabba's or something but this place makes me, a 5'0" gal, feel like a giant.  After being given our beeper/pager/thingie for our table [10-15min wait at 7PM on a busy Saturday night], I managed to get the top of my riding boot caught in the stupid bench twice and bump my head on the trim of the window.  Is this how you normal height people feel?  Anyways, more boot-catching-on-seats-action followed as we were seated in the tiniest booth ever.  I was sitting on one side with my gal friend, who's about the same height and weight as me, while my brother had the other side for himself.  During the whole meal, we were bumping into each other and it's hard to imagine how two people can sit on one side of a booth comfortably.  It's a surprise how I even ate when I was curled up against her the whole time!Anyways, while I seldom review bigger chain restaurants, I really just wanted to say that Carrabba's has delicious food but I think their portions shrank... A LOT.  I had my fill of warm toasty bread with herbs and olive oil, a nice steamy bowl of sausage and lentils soup, and then had the tiniest plate of shrimp and scallops linguine alla vodka.  I'm not a big eater by any means but I somehow found myself in front of an empty plate with a hungry tummy.    It tasted amazing, so much more than my brother's lobster mac and cheese and my friend's champagne shrimp and scallop linguine, but it was ridiculously small.I know I look pretty young but seriously, it was like a kid's sized meal and considering that I was carded when I ordered my Limoncello and Prosecco drink, which tasted more like cranberry juice than anything, I'm definitely an adult.  $23/pp including tip for three entrees, one alcoholic beverage, and a lemonade.  Not sure I'd be back even though they have decent flavor.  Pity... I do love their sausage and lentil soup!

Review Text :
I've tried Golden Egg Roll twice. Once for delivery and once in the restaurant. BLECH! Both times. Actually ICK the first time, MEH slash ICK the second time. The delivery is quick and efficient. I ordered the House Fried Rice and a veggie egg fu young. I was grossed out by the shrimp in the fried rice. I could SMELL my shrimp before it even entered my mouth. Sounds normal right? No it was FUNKY shrimp that was slightly slimy. Blech. My Fu Young was unremarkable after you got past the saltiness of the dish. Months later, I was asked by a coworker to have lunch. I let her pick the place... I will never make that mistake again. She picked Golden Egg Roll. The restaurant itself is nice and clean from what I saw. I chose the orange chicken. Again with the salt! I was baffled and I asked the other ladies I was with if they were having the same issue. Yes, they were! Well that summed it up for me. I probably won't visit Golden Egg Roll again. What a bummer, they have all this swag from a service (they probably paid for) naming them one of the top Chinese restaurants in the area. I'm uninterested in giving this joint another shot, unfortunately. There are too many other places to try.

11/11/10Was in the area for a November OYE that was about to start in 30 minutes, but I was so hungry and didn't really think my second meal-of-the-day comprised of pie, cake, pastries, and wine was a healthy way to end the evening w/, so I decided I'd check out Red Devil.  It was dead inside (only a couple was there for dinner), and I got the feeling that most of the business that evening was going to be take-outs.Bartender was friendly enough, until I started asking questions about the ingredients.  He still remained accessible, but the smiles certainly went away.  I almost stood up and left.  When the food arrived 25 minutes later, I wished I had left!  I found the calzone crust soggy- no crispiness anywhere, and the mozzarella-ricotta mix made for an ugly, bland-tasting (I detected no ricotta flavor at all) conglomeration.  (See photos.)  The only thing that turned out OK was the marinara sauce, but what good is it if the item you're supposed to eat it w/ isn't worth the trouble?  I had the leftovers boxed, and stood up to go after only spending 5 minutes eating.  After all, I had a party to attend!p.s. What a poor example of a treehugger I am!  No sooner had I exited RD's doors did I take the first chance to throw the leftovers in the trash.  Should've just left it on the table...I have been coming in here for many years now. What is not to love~!I think the food is pretty fantastic!  Pizza, really good. Wings,excellant!Salads are freash and flavorful. Like how easy it is to call in an order, pick it up at the window and go.Good staff, the decor is a bit old fashion in an 80;s way. But, in the grand scheme it means nothing. I like the food here so I will be back many times!Lots of parking in the lot as well.This is a review for the pizza take out.There are a few levels of pizza in the 602.Top tier is Pizzia Bianco, Cibo, Federal PIzza, et al. Those are NOT daily pizza choices, to me they are special occasions. Everyday kind of awesome pizza is Red Devil! Light years ahead of NYPD, Streets, etc. this place is legit! I highly recommend trying the pizza 'well done' which gets you more char on the crust. It's super good. This place also has really great wings, which surprised me. I ask for all drums, as those little wings aren't worth the trouble.Keep up the good work Red Devil. You are an oldie but a goodie.

I like the Good Egg.  Really, I do.  I have eaten here sporatically at a few different locations.  This one gets busy, obviously, but not as busy as the other locations, from what I have noticed.Anyways, I came here this AM for breakfast.  I was out and about when I realized I was starving. I usually dont keep breakfast food in the house, so I knew it was time to stop.Came here and the service was quick and efficent.  I was in and out of here in no time.   I had scrambled eggs, an english muffin and hash browns.  Food was tasty!!I will probably be back.  Rock on Good Egg!We have come here more than a few times over the years. Today we came around lunch time, just missing the rush! We got a nice booth for starters. Our server was Annette ,she was friendly and very quick with everything.I got the Lumberjack scramble. It was a lot of food and I ordered an English Muffin instead of the bisquits that come with it. Lots of gravey,(Country style) I liked it but, I had to scrape some off because, it is so much. Something else that they had,that I thought was pretty good was the Marion Berry jam.T got The Krabby one,it is an Egg crepe (made with Crab) I had some and it was really good ,nice and light.I have to say there potatoes are awesome and the coffee is nice. Not bitter at all.We have always been happy with our meal at all the locations.Something else to love is the stamp card system they have. so many stamps and you get one meal free. Gotta love that!

Review Text :
I am soooooo confused why this place has good reviews? Stumped actually, no.. aphauled. Ive eaten here a few times because my mom likes this place. Why? ...Because she lives off lettuce and has never tried anything else here. She like the turkey gizzards, she has no opinion. So I went there and got a salad, dressing was pretty gross. My brother got a burger that was actually raw, so he took it back. So he gets the burger back and now............The lettuce was hot wilted the bun was soggy and the cheese was still in the shape of grated cheese. This was obviously put in the microwave, topping and all. Completely disgusting!!!!!I had chicken there too and it was like the turkey on Nation Lampoon's Christmas Vacation!!!If you remember that scene, that is exactly what happened hereHouston's delivers a solid meal every time and that spinach dip goes straight to my hips every time as well! Yes, there will most likely always be a wait at Houston's unless you get in right before the lunch or dinner crowd...but mind you, there are some early birds in the bunch. Regardless, the wait is ok because they keep a fire going to cozy up the wait time and then there's always the bar to warm you up from the inside out. The seats at Houston's are nice because they are private so you can have a conversation without feeling like four other tables have stopped their conversation to listen in on yours. The service is normally pretty quick and then there's the food. Like I said, Houston's delvers a solid and hearty meal. The spinach dip is a must on the list of starters regardless of the calories that come with it. I've enjoyed the chopped salad with a side of honey mustard. Their honey mustard is creamy and delicious and one of my favorite honey mustard locations. I do miss the Racket club. They used to do it perfectly with some relish and honey mustard on soft bread. RIP Racket Club. However, the normal club is good too and you can never go wrong with the Biltmore Chicken Sandwich and their ribs are famous too. For dessert, my personal favorite is the Apple cobbler but apparently it's seasonal and so they will switch it out for the Key Lime Pie. It's always a hit or miss on whether or not they will have the Apple Cobbler and personally, I think they need to keep the cobbler on the menu year-round because it would keep some regular customers coming in over and over -- like me! I've been visiting Houston's for years. It's also cozy once inside and the fireOh boy, where do I start?  A colleague suggested that we come here for a lunch meeting one day.  He said they had the best French Dip Sandwich in town.  Seduced by this claim, I had to give this place a try.  Of course, my first time there I had to try this legendary Sandwich.  Priced at $20, it better be good...http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/houstons-scottsdale?select=U0ixpfN85zASG-5U8eBq1w#U0ixpfN85zASG-5U8eBq1wI took one bite and OMG...!  It was friggin' awesome!  Even better than I expected.  The flavor of the Prime Rib and the Au Jus sent my taste buds into the stratosphere.  It also comes with a Creamy Horseradish Sauce that just adds to the flavor explosion.  The Bread is Buttered and soft, but had just the right texture to hold this all together and complimented the sharp flavors of the Beef and Sauce.  Wow, it is a masterpiece.The service here is also impeccable.  You feel like you're dining in a 5 diamond restaurant....and it's lunch!I was so impressed after that 1st visit, that I've been back several times and have brought many friends and colleagues to experience the French Dip.My other favorite item is the Hickory Burger (Canadian Bacon, Cheddar Cheese, Onion, w/Hickory Sauce), $14.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/houstons-scottsdale?select=CYjS0T6wl1Pe9fX_-DV9mw#CYjS0T6wl1Pe9fX_-DV9mwThat's right folks, there's a thick slice of Canadian Bacon that tops this Burger!  This is a big bad Burger....and it tastes awesome!  I can barely take a bite out of it....and it's not like some freakishly huge Burger, but the ingredients are fresh and stacked high....making for an awesome Burger.For sides, the Cole Slaw is by far the best you can order and I highly recommend that.  The Fries are so/so.  Another tip, if you come for lunch you can make reservations.  It can get busy, so it's worth the extra step to do so.Return Factor - 100%I've been here many of times but i was surprised that I haven't been here for a long time. So it was time to check out all my Yelp friends reviews to see whats recommended. The place is dark but elegant in its own way. We started off with the Spinach & Artichoke dip. The tortilla chips were nice and crispy. It came with a warm spinach and artichoke dip, salsa, and sour cream. Oh my goodness, the warm dip was so good. Out standing. We were licking every drop of it. We even got another bowl of chips to finish everything off. I ordered the famous French dip sandwich. When I first ordered it, it doesn't sound too exciting but wow. Thinly cut prime rib with this really soft bread and dipping it the sauce made it outstanding. It was like melt in your mouth goodness. My wife and son ordered their go to dish of a full rack of baby back ribs. They are fall off goodness. The BBQ sauce is sweet and tangy. Really like these ribs. The sauce really makes it so good. They had cole slaw to and it was good and goes so well with the ribs. Nice and creamy. I shared with my wife and it was so good. The service was good. Usually it's outstanding but today we ordered our appetizer and needed a few minutes to order but it seemed like she got lost and took awhile to get back to us. That was the only negative but our water cups were bought to us very quickly. Refilled regularly and took our dirty plates on a timely manner. Loved coming here. Great food,  good service, and a really nice ambience. We'll be back again but not to long like last time. Enjoy

Review Text :
The first time I had Rubio's ever was about 6 months ago in Casa Grande.  Now I'm hooked.  Love the original fish taco, and now I'm also really enjoying the shrimp salsa verde tacos that I think are out for a limited time only.  So fresh and delicious!  This particular location has very friendly staff, and when we were there over the weekend one employee was moving tables and scrubbing the walls and floor.  The joint was clean anyway, but how often do you see an employee taking the time to do a deep clean?  A lot of places I visit I don't even want to look at the floor/wall/behind the chairs.  Best to stay in the dark, but this place is as clean as it can be.  I also like the choices on the salsa bar and the fact that I can get a cold adult beverage to have with my tacos.   I've never had a bad visit to a Rubio's.  Definitely a fan.I'm a fan of Rubio's and stopped by this location for dinner one evening.  I ordered my traditional item.....Steak Burrito.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/j0h8OH6ktQsnTmIaJsN5Hw?select=Zx--exGz8noCK_pSNsQuOAOf course, I stopped by the Salsa bar to get a few cups of their Spicy Salsa.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/j0h8OH6ktQsnTmIaJsN5Hw?select=FpVfp0gkLcDXCZBTWSLyGgThe Burrito was very tasty as usual.  So far, all of the Rubio's I've been to have been consistent with good quality food and service.  This one is no different.  I'll be back again!Return Factor - 100%I am not ashamed to admit it, but I am a fan of Rubio's. I have been to several restaurants, but this was my first time at this location. It was a bit challenging to find, so be sure to look for the Party City store and look across from it.One of the things I like about Rubio's is they have a lot of lighter and healthier options.Don't forget the Fish Tacos! The beer battered fish tacos are really popular.I may eat mostly vegetarian, but eat fish once in a while. If you go there on Tuesdays, they run a special on fish tacos, and if you sign up for the Beach club you get coupons and a free taco.Very good value.2/28/13Redeemed a couple of free fish taco coupons I was given at the Yelp event held here a couple of years ago (?).  Was told they were for the Alaskan pollock- the same ones we were given at the party.  While I waited for these to be prepared, I realized I don't like the atmosphere indoors, as it felt too fast-foodish for me, and yes, I realize that I am writing a review on Rubio's... I guess dining al fresco is the way to go when you're here.  Should I ever go back, I will choose outdoor dining, or just go for takeout and head to a nearby bar with a better selection of beers and wine and better atmosphere, as well.Oh, and I liked the beer-battered pollock with the greens and signature "white sauce" on flour tortillas.  Just wished each taco came with more than just the one lime wedge-- I need more acid to cut through the grease!FYI, I was told by a Mexican coworker, who used to work at Rubio's many, many years ago, that the beans' side dish is well-prepared here, for those who are health-conscious.  It isn't refried in lard like in other places.  I can't say I've tried it in recent times, so I can't comment on it any further-- just passing on what she told me.Money talks. And where I spend my money, I talk about it on Yelp. Even if it is for a $1.50 Tuesday fish taco special.   This Rubios is located in the Pebble Marketplace, which is the Smith's-anchored shopping center off Green Valley Parkway immediately north of the I-215 exit. It sits in the far northwest corner of the shopping center where it shares a patio with Starbuck's. With the corner facing windows and outdoor seating, it is an appropriate restaurant to experience the Vegas sunshine.   Between a hard days work and a cup of coffee before shopping in Smith's, the $1.50 Tuesday fish Taco special is a rewarding weekday treat. When I walk in the door, friendly employees including Vivian will greet me before taking my order. They will give me a water cup (immediately after I will be drinking a Starbuck's beverage) when I order the fish taco, a few minutes later deliver the taco to my table, then check up on me. Whenever they deliver a fish taco to my table, it has been tasty and filling. The toppings station is advantageous to the fish taco experience. There are all kinds of sauces including pacante plus peppers that you could place in a small cup or directly to the taco.   After many Tuesdays spending  only $1.50 on a quality fish taco with a water cup served by friendly people, I talk good about Rubio's on Yelp. This is a  special that will brighten up a Tuesday.

Review Text :
After a long week, taking the family to dinner Friday nights at Los Olivos is quite the treat for all.  The highlights for us are the relaxing atmosphere, good Mexican food, attentive service, cold Negro Modelo beers and talented mariachis playing music.My kids would be happy just eating their awesome chips and salsa.  We all love to get the tortilla soup and share that as a starter.For the adults our favorites are the Huevos Rancheros and Chorizo Con Huevos.  The kids love the bean burritos and cheese quesadillas.  Would have given it a 5 star except last time really did not care for the tough to eat carne asada (way too thin and overcooked) nor the margaritas (way too sour).  If looking for a good Mexican restaurant in Scottsdale that won't break the bank give Los Olivos a try.The Northern sister property of the Los Olivos in Old Town Scottsdale, this is one of our family's favorite choices for Mexican food.  We enjoy the Cheese Crisps and Enchilada & Taco combo.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/LVyoW7-2XMnb1avqWNZ3yw?select=7OSp0zucUguetvAc48g37AOf course, complimentary Chips & Salsa is offered here.  What I like is that they offer a really spicy Salsa and a Mild one.  I love the spicy stuff and the rest of the family enjoys the mild.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/LVyoW7-2XMnb1avqWNZ3yw?select=1uhB-OTY0yApqdfsVZfMQwhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/LVyoW7-2XMnb1avqWNZ3yw?select=FrJYrz1giW5lvi0iDW-JjwWe've dined here several times and have had decent service each time.Return Factor - 90%This location lacks the character of the original location but it's a nice option for North Scottsdale dining! Although it's located in a strip mall on the freeway, once you step inside, it feels like a family-friendly restaurant with a little bit of Mexican flare. There's plenty of seating making this a good option if you want to have a big party. The food is decent and your generic restaurant Mexican food. Holy large portions though! I ordered the carne asada tacos and it came with a salad, then two very large flour tortillas, two large pieces (probably 3-4 inches long each) of carne asada beef and heaping beans and rice. All of it was very delicious but had I know the size of the portion, I would have definitely shared. You also get chips and two types of salsa with your meal. In summary, this is a pretty basic Mexican meal experience, but in a good way. I think it's nice that North Scottsdale has this option and I can only imagine that the bar area can get pretty crowded on the weekends.I really love this place!  I've been here many times on all different occasions.  They offer a great happy hour where I enjoy the chicken quesadilla and margaritas.The decor is just okay with nothing to brag about, however, the food and service is great!  The margaritas are perfectly made and the chicken quesadilla and enchiladas are delicious.  I also really like the salsa and chips!  When getting Mexican food, I usually go for enchiladas, tacos, or a trio plate, but If you can't already tell, I absolutely LOVE the chicken quesadilla here!  Give it a try!

Review Text :
This place sucks.Now I understand that's not the most helpful assessment, so I'll elaborate to save you from ending up at this crap hole should you think, "Oh Erica, you must have just been cranky that day!" Not so.It all started when I had a craving for hummus earlier this week. I work too far from just about every hummus slinging place in Tempe but Byblos. So I decided to try something new, and was left with a sour taste in my mouth.First off, the place is located in a shitty plaza of decaying shops (home to the Yucca Tap Lounge if that's any indication) and it's right next door to a Mexican food restaurant that I've never seen anyone enter or leave, so it looks like a front for some shady 'business' dealings. But my craving would not be deterred by a craptastic plaza, after all, Capistrano's is in the same plaza and it's delicious. Looks aren't everything. Hummus would be had.We enter. It's empty and dumpy looking. The only people here have a mean age of 70. We significantly bring this average down. Waaaay down. We are escorted to a table and peruse the menu. The server (I assume it's the unfriendly server you had, Kelly B., because he looked like he had a stick up his ass that had been festering there for the past 60 years) took our drink orders and came back with two itsy bitsy little cups. Seriously? You're going to charge me 2.50 for six ounces of lemonade? We order. He frowns for the umpteenth time in our short interaction and waddles off to the kitchen. The food arrives.The hummus was straight up GROSS, and the pita bread was shockingly similar to cardboard. The hummus tasted sour with a texture that was a combination between chalk and paste. If I can corner a five year old, I'm going to conduct a taste test between the two substances and see if there's any discernable difference. My money's on no. The presentation was nice, with pickles, tomatoes, olive oil and parsley, but if I wrap a piece of dried up dog shit in ribbons and bows, your gift would still be a piece of dried up dog shit. Maybe you could use it as a paper weight? The tomato soup that came along with lunch was pretty decent,and the gyro meat was well spiced. But the fact that my gyro was wrapped in the aforementioned cardboard pita bread was really unappetizing. It's like they took rock hard, stale pita bread, heated it in the microwave to make it pliable, molded it and let it cool in its rigid formation. So if you're 70 and your senses are slowly numbing, you might like this place. Other than that, stay away. It's unwelcoming and unappetizing. The antithesis of what a restaurant should be. Let it slowly decay along with the rest of the shops lining this creepy little plaza at the corner of Mill and Southern.I met Yelpette's Georgie S and Sunny B today for lunch and was pleasantly surprised by the experience. In addition to famously amazing company, the food was really good, we had quick and efficient service and I was happy with the portions and price. We started with Hummus, which came out immediately. It was pretty tasty. Both Sunny and I had the falafel pita/ sandwich. I was really impressed with how moist the falafel was. Normally it comes out really dry. We also got soup with our meal. I had tomato, which was EXCELLENT and she had the lentil. I forgot to ask how it was. Georgie had some chicken and rice thing which looked good and she said she enjoyed. Our server was a little aggressive with Georgie and Sunny because they didn't finish all of their food (yeah... I'm a big pig and devoured everything in front of me) but I think he was just trying to ensure they were happy with their meals. For the three of us plus the takeaway chicken sandwich for my sister, the $34 tab was extremely reasonable and they handled our multiple payment methods like a champ! Next time I am in Tempe and in the mood for some falafel, I will be back!!!I have driven by Byblos so many times and was looking forward  to join the International Supper Club UYE in September, the front parking lot is extremely small, but there is parking in the back, and it's a lot bigger on the inside then you would, ok I, assumed it to be. We all were seated and handed menus and the owner was giving us a very detailed list of the specials they had going, and was even ready to take our order right then and there, but we told him we needed a few more minutes, so he said he would be back in 5, and he was. I already knew what I wanted, I ordered the Falafel Sandwich, it came with soup & fries. There as 2 choices of soup, lentil and tomato or as the owner put it, fight for or die for. I went with the Lentil soup, I love lentil soup but after the order was placed he came back and apologized for the mistake and it was chicken noodle soup or tomato, so now I went with tomato soup.  He said it was to die for! Well let tell yall, that tomato soup was creamy, full of flavor and well maybe it was to die for! I'm not much of a soup person but I could see me having a nice warm bowl of that on a cold day.   The falafel wrap was good to, I had been craving falafel and this hit the spot.  Good food, great company, great time! Look forward to the next ISCUYE.

Mom loves the salads here, and today, I don't know why, but the "natural-cut fries" called out to me.  I've never ordered these here before.  Oh, now I remember why-- because the words "Natural-cut fries" were followed by "with sea salt."  My body must've been craving for salt, because these were oh-so-delicious.  Loved the crunchy texture, as well!  I detected a peanut-y flavor, so I wonder if peanut oil was used?  I thank the Lord that I only had the chance to eat about a little under a fifth of the large serving while driving before I decided to wait until I had safely parked and transferred all of the groceries from the car into my home.  By the time I turned my attention to the fries, they were now soggy and inedible (to me).  Have I ever told you how I hate soggy, floppy things?  No?  Well, I do.  Fries, pizza, sweet potato fries...---UPDATE   5/17/15Mom said the last three times she's had salad from here, the chicken was very salty, so no more of Wendy's salads!

This place was highly recommended to me by a friend. I have been meaning to try it again. I had eaten here once several years ago. Food is good... Sushi was fresh & tasted good. I would definitely recommend that no one order the garlic edamame as it was inedible, but other than that every thing else that we ordered was fine.  As far as sushi goes Octopus was really good, eel, white fish & yellow tail were great! ... Boyfriend said the sea urchin was the best he's had... I couldn't try it.... Maybe if it had been in a roll or something ... But just with rice & wrapped no thanks. For rolls the Japanese Lasagna was OK... Boyfriend didn't prefer it (so what - more for me) although almost every piece I had fell apart... But what can you do. We both really liked the Kiss the Ass Roll & Leo #3 (daily special), and sec on the beach. Our absolute favorite was the Unagi roll.  Delicious! As far as service that's where things get a little sloppy. For the most part we received everything we asked for... Although I did all for lemon for my water & was basically told no, until my boyfriend asked them he finally brought me some.  Neither sushi Chef nor waiter smiled at either of us even once during our entire visit, and I was going out of my way to be extremely nice. I said thank you about 40 times. It was kind of ridiculous. Twice the sushi Chef just kind of grunted our way when we ordered something new. Also we arrived around 2pm, lunch AYCE goes until 3,  but we were charged for the dinner AYCE. We didn't complain because we ordered a lot, but something to keep an eye on. I'm not saying we won't be back, but they're are a lot of sushi places on Eastern that have great quality fish & pleasant staff. Pull it together, Inaka!

i hadn't been to valle luna since i was a kid, but we went here recently and it was so great. i mean, it wasn't like amazing mexican homemade food, but it's pretty darn good for what it is. their salsa is amazing. so amazing. the chips are warm and salty. the bean dip is pretty great. for a meal, their chicken fundido is awesome if you're feeling naughty. i had the fajitas and everything was fresh, not pre-made. you know how i have a weird thing about pre-made food. nope, not here. they were even able to cook my fajitas with water instead of oil which was a bonus for me because i make crazy requests like that. we sat on the patio and enjoyed the water fountain. all in all, it was good and i'd totally go back.There's different kinds of Mexican places around.  Type A:  Pseudo-Mexican fast food (Taco Bell, El Pollo Loco, Del Taco, etc.)Type B: REAL Mexican fast food (whateveri-berto's, Baja Fresh, Rubio's etc.)Type C: Various traditional taquerias (Los Favoritos, Rivas' Mexican Food, etc.)Type D: "Mexican Denny's" or chain-type sit down Mexican Restaurants--traditional-style or not (Chevy's, El Torito, Macayo's, etc.) Type E: REAL formal or semi-formal Mexican restaurants (I don't know any in the Valley yet, but in the Bay Area there is the now closed La Michoacana in San Mateo, CA, etc.)Valle Luna is a Type D, and a pretty good one as well.  Delicious traditional-style Mexican food.  The interior looks like what you usually see in a Chevy's or Macayo's.  It's visually pleasing, and service is friendly and helpful.  They have all the beers, margaritas, and tequila that you usually find at places like this (you know what I mean).  It's the kind of Mexican place you take someone for their birthday--exactly.Do you check in to places on Yelp using your iPhone?   Come to Valle Luna!  Show them the check-in on your phone and you get $5 off of a meal costing $20 or more.  Perfect for lunch with your co-worker.Valle Luna means good Mexifood.  If you're in the mood for a Type D, bypass the "Fresh Mex" and come here.

Should be advertised as: ALL-WE-WILL-MAKE-YOU-EAT.Yes, I eat a lot of sushi. Yes, the sushi here is good. Yes, it is all-you-can-eat for $21.95... For that, you would think there would be more stars, BUT READ THE FINE PRINT... YOU GET CHARGED FOR WHAT YOU DON'T EAT, INCLUDING THE EXTRA BITS OF RICE LEFT BEHIND.I can understand that if you order like 8 rolls and leave several pieces from each, it's a waste, but that was NOT the case for us. Out of the 4 of us, 3 (myself included) ordered all-you-can-eat, so they were already getting a decent amount of $ from us. What we didn't appreciate is that EVERY TIME the guy came to our table he would warn us that we HAD to finish EVERYTHING. "We charge extra for leftovers," or, "We charge extra for uneaten rice," or, "I told you we charge extra, right?" The worst part was, if he wasn't at our table warning us, he never stopped staring at us. He would stand at his podium and WATCH us eat. Then he'd go back to his sushi chef and make comments in Japanese. Specifically, he kept his eyes on me and it made me lose my appetite. He seriously made us feel like we were trying to pull some scam; it was ridiculous. Who wants to be stared down and made to feel uncomfortable while they're trying to eat? I've been a server and bartender for 5 years, and I NEVER treated any of my customers (even the deserving ones) the way the server there treated me. I'm a laid-back person and I'm generous with my reviews, but this was, by far, my WORST sushi experience. I will not be back.Weak. This place has gone down hill fast in the last year. The fish was not fresh -- the salmon had dark patches all over and the rolls kept falling apart. The chefs weren't even trying it seems, and the place was practically empty. I was a loyal customer for 5+ years, but with so many sushi options in this town there is no reason to settle for poor quality and mediocre service.A few years back I've reviewed this place a 4 star, and today is a totally different story. If there was a choice in putting zero stars, that's what I would've put for last nights dinner. I called a head of time to see how much AYCE was for adults and children and whomever answered the phone said $25 for adults, $12 for 10 and up and $6 for 5 year olds. As soon as we got there, my family of 7 were seated, and then ordered AYCE sushi dinner, so a total of 9 sushi rolls and Tuna Poke salad and few more appetizers for the first round. As soon as the Chef (main) saw what we had ordered he asked the waitress how much did you tell them the price for dinner for AYCE. As soon as she told him, he changed the price. Which was unacceptable, but we decided to stay since we were already there. As we were waiting, the SF Giants game was on and we asked the Chef if he can change the channel and he says "no we don't that" with a very rude attitude. Normally I don't take that kind of customer service, but I was hungry and was already there, so we stayed. As soon as we got our Tuna Poke. I can automatically smell the tuna. Which I'm sure wasn't fresh, just by the smell of it and I've been to almost every sushi bar in Henderson and never smelled and tasted the way Sushi Bay's is. Just as I take a bite of tuna, it was very stringy and tasted horrible. So that didn't work out. Then we got everything else, but we ordered 5 baked tempura sushi rolls which was rock hard almost as if they meant to over cook it to make it that way. They kept brining sushi we didn't order to our table and also had skipped 3 sushi rolls that we ordered and they said we had them. The first thing I order when I go to a sushi bar is Salmon Skin roll, so I know for sure they didn't make me that. No to mention, they never checked on our table and kept having to ask for water. At this point, I was already aggravated and not only did this place ruin my dinner, they ruined my ability to try new places. At least I know Island Sushi and Sushi Mon are still there to satisfy my cravings as I've been going to those sushi bars for years. Who ever is reading this, DONT COME HERE. Their fish is never fresh. TRUST ME when I say this. GO TO ISLAND SUSHI or SUSHI MON. I WILL NEVER EVER BE BACK TO THIS HORRIBLE PLACE. EVER.New Favorite Sushi Spot Alert!!We decided to try this place because we felt the need to spice up our Sushi schedule. We have three places that we alternate between and it was just time to switch things up!I am going to warn you that when you pull in here and walk up your first instinct is going to be to turn right back around and walk back to your car. Ignore this feeling, I promise you the looks are decieving. It is a very, very tiny space probably has five tables and the bar, but I am telling you the rolls are amazing and the service is incredibly friendly and welcoming!We opted for AYCE, obviously. Our rolls we tried:Screaming OrgasmNevadaDragonAmericanBaked SalmonBaked Wet DreamTako (Octopus) NigiriDynamiteWe also had Garlic Edamame, Seaweed Salad, and of course Tempura Ice Cream for dessert!I cannot wait to come back again, and again, and again!Saturday Solo Sushi-Round #21st things 1st...I can put down alot of food!...and can not justify a regular sushi restaurant without leaving broke and hungry...so I opt for All You Can Eat (AYCE) deals. Through trial & error, i've learned some AYCE sushi restaurants are very average at best, and some are truly a diamond in the rough.After a Yelp search for an AYCE sushi restaurant in Henderson that i've never been to, I went out this past Saturday 12/12th by myself for dinner, hence "solo." I arrived here after an unsuccessful attempt to eat at a nearby AYCE sushi restaurant, that I walked out of due to bad service, no oysters available on AYCE menu, and questionable sanitary practices. So here I am @ Sushi Bay, on Windmill & Pecos, for my 2nd attempt of the evening to feast on AYCE sushi.Conveniently parked right out front, walked into this very small restaurant, and was welcomed inside by a very friendly lady, who seated me at the sushi bar. The sushi chef immediately greeted me and asked if i've been here before. Nope, 1st time and looking forward to eating mass quantities of delicious sushi. The sushi bar that could seat about 8 people had only 2 other people dining. The female dining patron was loud and noticeably drunk, and he was repeatedly burping w/o the courtesy of saying excuse me. Not getting a good vibe here. I always begin my AYCE sushi adventure w/ at least a half dozen fresh oysters and at least a half dozen pieces of salmon roe. The friendly sushi chef advised me they have no fresh oysters and salmon roe is limited to only 2 pieces per AYCE.  Well, at the price of $23.95 for AYCE sushi, I know there are several other excellent options for AYCE sushi in Henderson and Las Vegas for only $2 bucks more! So I politely walked out, got in my car and began my 3rd attempt of the night for AYCE sushi.See 1 photo below...YELP 300 CHALLENGE 2015: #299

This is my 400th review, so I chose a good one.I keep getting coupons for this place. People I know(friends) say yeah, it is OK. Nothing great. It is alright.So one day it was raining and cold. I was out running errands and did not want to mess up the house cooking when I got home.So I had a coupon so I came here to Venezia's!First I called on the phone to order a large Pizza and some wings.I have been craving Wings,soooo.Anyway, I got there a little early. Parking for pick up right in front,very nice.As I sat inside looking around it was clean and well maintained.Counter for napkins, condiments and such, clean and well stocked. They were busy pick up orders, people coming in to get a slice, etc.They handle it very well. Everyone is calm and it runs very smoothly.One girl that was cutting Pizza and boxing every thing up made it all look so easy.She was wearing a hat and had tattoos,I say that because, I do not know her name.But, she was getting those orders out so quickly and efficiently/ I was amazed how she made it all look so easy. Bravo to her, she rocks.The smell inside was really good. Italian Food on a cold day smells fantastico!When We sat down to eat at home. It was fantastic! I love their Pizza. Their wings were meaty and spicy! This is it , I have found my new Pizza Heaven!I am so excited.Also I read the menu and took a to go menu home, I can't wait to try all the other items, I am sure they are just as wonderful!

Big chains are important to submit reviews for.Even though the biz would have you believe that it  means you'll get consistent product and service across their multitudinous locations, has this ever been the case?  Even Taco DingDong taco meat is spicier in Phoenix than it is in Detroit.This Old Timer's Boofay is run sublimely compared to the metrocenter location. The service level and the quality of the food coming out of the kitchen is drastically in a different league.  Food is still pretty generic - lot's of starches and cheeses and such to fill you up.  There seems to be a bit more pride of execution here.  Yeah, I know, it's a chain buffet, practically a cafeteria.  No matter.  What many folks don't realize is the amount of food dishes in a place like this that are prepared in a traditional, homestyle way.  Things like homemade salad dressings, madaroni and cheese casseroles, etc. They do it to save money.  Reult is fresh, homestyle food for you. So they made it in a batch to serve 30 families, so what. Breakfast is the real deal here, and around $6 if you skip the overpriced drink. Huge selection of all the favorites, and they're busy enough that it stays fresh.I can't wait to be old enough to get my seniour discount here.Inside of this svelt, healthy body is trapped the wrinkly, grumpy soul of a 68 year old man.  You kids get the hell off my lawn.

Review Text :
Oh, hell YES! I am somewhat embarrassed to admit I have lived in the Valley since 1995, yet just today was my maiden voyage to the hidden gem known as Chizona's. As a Chicago girl through-and-through, I go through various stages of withdrawl for the culinary delights native to the city, including but not limited to pizza puffs and green and pink cookies shaped like leaves and dipped in chocolate, sold only at Jewel. (Although, apparently, not anymore, after I dashed in and out of no less than six Jewels looking for them during my most recent pilgrimage, eyes rolling back in my head from the tragedy of it all.)So, yeah. Chizona's. Total hole in the wall... but you're not coming here for the ambiance. The "side" salad/"one" slice and pop combo, clocking in at a staggering $6, gives you a ginormous fresh salad with crisp Romaine lettuce, chunks of tomato, black olives, and a handful of shredded mozzarella, served in a Styrofoam bowl, natch. It's practically big enough to be a meal on its own... but then you face the "slice" of pizza, which is really a quarter of a huge pizza, cut perfectly into the beloved squares. Gooey and greasy, with a thin crust that grows delightfully cracker-y towards the edges... we are talking down-home, for real Chicago goodness. The pizza puff (which I had to sample for austerity's sake) is a delectable deep-fried gooey handful of cheesy and perfectly seasoned sausage-y joy. Oh, heaven.The various hot sandwiches -- Italian beef, etc. -- are served on the Holy Grail of Chicagoland bread, Gonella bread, and they are humongous. The fries on the side are so-so, but you can bet your sweet ass I'm not wasting precious gastric space on fries when there's pizza perfection to be had.Oh delicious and heavenly joyousness. Next time you're too busted to spring for a Southwest ticket to Midway and are feeling the sting of homesickness... just pop in here. These creature comforts will dull the pain... temporarily, at least. Now, if they would only sell the pink and green leaf cookies!I'm not a fan of most chain pizza delivery spots. Because of that, I typically steer away from pizza delivery because I can't think of a good local spot that delivers in my area. But recently, I couldn't find it in me to leave my house and nothing in my refrigerator looked appealing, so I resorted to the quick and easy call to a pizza parlor. I did a Yelp search and found Chizona's which is practically down the street from me. I can't count the number of times I've driven by this little divey pizza shop and always wondered if it was good. Well, now I'm happy to finally share my report with the yelp world: it's more than good. It's delicious! The delivery process was pretty seamless. I called and ordered my pizza, paid over the phone and it was delivered to my doorstep in less than the 45 minute time frame they gave me. The delivery guy was clean cut and friendly which is important to me when I open my door up to a delivery person. So let's now move on to the food. The pizza was better than decent! It's cut into squares, with gooey cheese and nicely cooked bread. It's a couple notches above par but not quite gourmet level. It's pretty much ideal for a fatty pizza night. I ordered a side Cesar salad with it, but I should have asked for the dressing on the side because it was more like Cesar salad with a side of salad. After my experience and the quality of food, I will definitely become a regular of Chizona's and next time I will be sure to visit the restaurant itself and try the Chicago dog!Believe it or not, I haven't had the Pizza here yet.  I'm a huge fan of Pizza, but the reason for my visit is Pizza Puffs.  Yes, those mouthwatering pocket filled morsels of goodness.....it's one of the food items I associate with Chicago.When I heard this joint had Pizza Puffs, I immediately stopped by for lunch one day.  I ordered an Italian Sub & a Pizza Puff.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/6zincCvQTb9BsuK-GHZ4cw?select=Bb3c9tM6uvXJmgaiT9B8eAhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/6zincCvQTb9BsuK-GHZ4cw?select=32uwfuBXI-ig7g6METKPKAThe Italian Sub was served hot and came out first.  I kind of wish the Pizza Puff came out at the same time because it takes a little while for the Pizza Puff to cool off....but that's ok.The Italian Sub was very good.  It was a nice sized portion, not too big & not too small, just right for lunch.  The Deli Meats are tasty served hot and the Bread was very good!The Pizza Puff was brought out to me a short time later.  I couldn't wait to take a bite....hmmmm, it's just like they serve them in Chicago.  If you've never had a Pizza Puff, do yourself a favor and go out and try one as soon as possible....You'll be glad you did!Overall, it was a nice lunch, satisfying my taste for Chicago.  They also serve Pizza and Dog's here, so I will be back!Return Factor - 90%I drive by this place everyday and have never been inside, so yesterday I was feeling the urge for something new and stopped in.  Many items on the menu looked delicious and the pizza smelled awesome, but that sounded like too much food...I ended up ordering the Italian Sub and the Cheesy French Bread with marinara to-go.  I did not realize the sub came with a side of fresh cut fries, so it ended up being a ton of food, but I was not disappointed!  The French bread is made in-house and tastes good.  It came with Italian spices sprinkled over the top and the perfect amount of cheese, not to mention perfectly cooked (little crispy along the edge).  The only negative, it was a bit skimpy on the yummy marinara sauce.  The Italian sub was also tasty, no special meat or anything but delicious nonetheless.  The fresh cut fries were a pleasant surprise considering I didn't realize they came with my order :) The service was great and the gentleman at the counter was very helpful and informative.  Chizona's has been around 11 years and has a Midwestern vibe inside.  Lots of Chicago sports memorabilia on the walls and the smell of pizza, hot-dogs, and pizza puffs...yum!  I should note for all the Chicagoans that it is NOT deep-dish Chicago style pizza, but it looked good (have not tried it yet).  If you want to deliver, he informed me there is a $10 minimum. Also, they have walk-in specials (i.e.  Vienna beef hot-dog, fries and a drink for $4.99).  I have no doubt, I will be back for more!Had the opportunity to dine here with the famous Scott D and his lovely wife. We needed something quick to eat before the Doobie tribute concert and this is where we ended up. Sweet!Located in a small strip mall and easy to drive right past. This is a nice little hole in the wall restaurant with many of the all time Chicago favorites.Inside is decorated with all sorts of fun items that make you feel like you are back in the Windy City. You can order at the counter and get it to go or just sit down at one of their cozy tables and take the load off your feet.Ordered a couple of Chi Dogs and had them dressed to kill. Both my wife and Scott's went with the Chicago Dog special which comes with fries and a drink. Our traveling companion choose the Big Pizza Slice special and it was rather large. My main man Scott went with the Giant Meatball Sandwich and fries. It was HUGE!Really liked their homemade French Fries and had to grab a few from my wife's basket. The pile was very large and she insisted. Everything tasted really good and the portion sizes were quite large.Looking forward to trying out their Calzones and more of their other tasty treats in the future. Thanks Mr. Scott for recommending such a swell pick. Going to put this on my top secret rotation when in the area. CUBS WIN THE PENNANT!4.25 STARS

I read all the yelp reviews. I told myself "No, Emily. You are going to try this place, you are going to eat the teryaki beef and you are NOT going to comment on the old man. This is about food damnit! YOU CAN DO THIS".*Sigh*.I love this old man. All my grandparents are dead and I want to secretly adopt him and treat him as my grandad, or just sit at a booth with my elbows out and my hands holding my head, just watchin' him work. Maybe he'd want an adopted grand daughter to tell life stories and provide asian food to? No? Maybe? Just a little bit?Well fine, I'm an independent woman and I will get over it. Maybe. My regular-sized beef teryaki was only $6 and it was a pretty big meal to eat for lunch. I really liked the sauce and the white rice, although I added some red chilli flakes in oil to give the meal a bigger kick. I thought the pricing was great, the food came out fast and you got exactly what you came for. Now lets go back to talking about the old man...I don't like to write bad reviews but this place managed to get from really good to just average to now being pretty bad.   I am giving them one star as the curry chicken is still passable, its a lot more bland and watery now. else It will be 0 star.My friend ordered and picked up our orders.  She had the terriyaki chicken and she said its watery now and it seems the taste is off.  I tasted a few pieces and the sauce is indeed very different.  Its watery and sweet and seems like something you buy in a bottle at lee lee.  FAIL, they used to claim they make the best teriyaki chicken back when the old man was here, but now I guess U can make the best teriyaki chicken at home, since it's a generic tasting sauce :)I ran into the old man that used to work here last week and his wife at lee lee's, they confirmed that they no longer work there and, whoever is writing about them being there is probably posting it in the hopes that, those who really loved his service would go back and give it a shot in the hopes of running into him.  Don't waste your time if u are hoping to do that as I think the old man and his wife frequent the fry's across the street or lee lee's more often.  If I see him again I will tell him everyone misses him and if possible get a number from him.  He is doing very well and enjoying his time off after being let go off by the new owners.   He is not interested in finding a new job for the moment as he is headed to Malaysia for a holiday in February. He is healthy and happy and glad we all remember him.  I did not have a chance to chat long with him as another former customer saw them and came over to give him a hug and chat with them.anyway, back to this place, I guess its time for me to move on to trying the food at red dragon or simply going north to aloha kitchen.  too bad this place used to be cheap and good but now I guess its just cheap.

Review Text :
Knowing my love of pizza and my search for an AZ favorite, a co-worker highly recommended that I try Ray's.  Wanting to to see if the pizza was really as good as he claimed, I braved the never-ending strip mall/parking rodeo that houses this location and oh, I am so glad I did!  Walking up to the door, I nearly swooned over the beautiful aroma of baking crust, garlic and red sauce.  For me, it holds the same allure that "new car smell" holds for guys.  Inside is even better!  It is kind of a controlled chaos near the entry - lots going on but somehow it all works.  The guys behind the counter were taking orders, handing out food and working 5 ovens that I could see at the same time - very impressive!  Initially I was just going to try a slice, but decided I needed a whole pie all to myself!  It was ready quickly, and I am very proud of myself that I did not immediately rip the box open in the parking lot.  I managed to wait until I got home to savor the flavor!  Of course I went with the pepperoni and mushroom new place test combo and I was very happy.  Even reheated for lunch the next day, very tasty.  Yay!

Found this place because I bought 3 Groupons.  The first time we came here was the week after the Groupon came out, which is always a mistake because this place was filled to the gills!  We were lucky to snag a table for 4 after only a short 10 minute wait.  However, several people ahead of us left because of the wait.  The other 2 visits here were no problem, but that was because it was 4+ weeks later and the Groupon rush was over.After 3 visits, here's my breakdown of the joint:+We enjoy the Mom & Pop feel to the place.  It's cozy and comforting.+The food is pretty good.  I've had the Pancakes, Breakfast Burrito, and Waffle.  All very very good.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/V81Ahkb9QFlbEx4PoeRiyA?select=rFCTC-tGavGymtsmc-ddHQhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/V81Ahkb9QFlbEx4PoeRiyA?select=MV3p0qgtMtc0j2wg-rItQA+There's Gluten-Free options.  The Better Half enjoys those options even though she's not allergic to Gluten.-The Coffee is terrible.  Watered down.-The prices are a bit high, but considering the quality of the food isn't too bad.  Just don't expect to come in and get Denny's or IHOP pricing.  Let's just say I'm glad I had the Groupon.Overall, we enjoyed our visits here.Return Factor - 60%12/03/12Hmm... I could've sworn I had written a review of this place before.  At the very least, I uploaded a few pics of our breakfast here many months ago.  Took my Mom to try the oven-baked pancakes once.  Do yourself a favor and pass on these!  Guess the review AND photos were taken down.  (Let's see how long this NEW review sticks before it's taken down, too.)Cousin texted me yesterday and asked if I'd join her for breakfast at JP Pancake today, and I texted her back guessing that it was too late to warn her not to buy the Groupon... Yes, it was.  I thought it would be a good opportunity to see if JP had improved on its service and food prep.  As you can see, it hasn't...We arrived around 7:35 am to see a deserted parking lot with the exception of one car parked in front of JPP.  It looked like we were the only souls there, besides our server and the cook in the kitchen.  I thought perhaps we'll get better service this time, since we were the only customers.  The young man asked us to sit wherever we wanted, handed us the menus and asked if we'd like some coffee or juice to start with.  I asked for coffee, while my two cousins settled on hot cocoa.  He said he'd see if they had any in the back first.  He came back a few minutes later with their mugs of cocoa (Swiss Miss and canned whip cream) and said he'd be back with my coffee.  Upon his return, we placed orders of a "Golden brown" waffle ($6.25), two full orders of French toast (one with strawberries, one with bananas, $7.95 per), and two sides of bacon (3 pieces each, $3.25 per).  I later asked if the side of ham is off-the-bone, and after consulting with the cook, he came back with a "yes."  I placed a late order of that, as well.  While the service was good (food arrived fast, server checked back to see how we were doing), the breakfast we had wasn't as good.  Our French toast slices http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jp-pancake-scottsdale?select=Q5s2HavHzD9RrGJOUbx0NA#Q5s2HavHzD9RrGJOUbx0NA were very dry-- the menu stated challah bread, but I think it was more like cake, and the slices could've used a longer soak in the egg batter.  Out of the six halves on my cousin's plate, she only had one (and all but one of her berry slices!), while I had one slice and a quarter of another of my platter.  I would've suggested we share a plate, but she didn't want to get bananas, and I didn't want any berries...  As I've said, the only winner this morning was the waffle, and I think the dollops of butter had a lot to do with its success.  (Also, I brought my own bottle of organic pure maple syrup, since most restos offer up a non-organic cane and corn syrup blend.  My cousin tried mine first before trying the restaurant's own syrup, ditched that, and then used mine until she was finished eating.)  Their sides of bacon http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jp-pancake-scottsdale?select=OP_6MgCnCpDWtxi8JJAijg#OP_6MgCnCpDWtxi8JJAijg were very costly, considering that these were very thin slices and VERY greasy (even for bacon!).  I wouldn't hesitate paying $3.50 for a very nice plate of THICK-SLICED bacon, all-natural even, but these were pathetic-looking.  As unfortunate-looking as they were, however, they did save breakfast for my cousins.  As for the miniature slice of ham http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jp-pancake-scottsdale?select=cHiSI19XYV1wUDemaXumCA#cHiSI19XYV1wUDemaXumCA I was presented with, I sent that back.  I may have been a fool to agree to waste my calories on a horrible breakfast this morning (thinking it was time to give JPP another chance for improvement), but I'm not that big a fool to allow my cousin to be charged another $3.25 for a paltry serving!Also, zero props to our server who freaked my cousin out by hugging the wall by the kitchen with what I thought was the hope of keeping out of our vision while being able to hear our conversation without success!  Her sister confirmed seeing this behavior and thought it was very creepy, too.  I wished they'd alerted me sooner (by asking me to switch seats) so that I could see what they were talking about.  Overall, what a lousy way to spend $35* and a breakfast meal out!  :(*Original ticket was just under $45, which showed the order charges totaling under $38 before tax.  If you account for Scottsdale's food tax of 8.95%, what was the extra $3, or so, for?  A hidden tip?  Finding this hidden charge was surprising, because our server did not know we were using a Groupon.  There was a sign on the door that stipulated that all Groupon customers will be charged an 18% tip at checkout, and my cousin did not mention her Groupon until we were given the check.  Perhaps, just perhaps, JPP assumes that all of their customers are Groupon-users?  Not far-fetched, since the Yelp reviews can't be helping JPP these days...

Review Text :
Everytime I eat at pizza hut/wingstreet I'm always disappointed. I mean how do they make a great personal pan pizza but everytime the large is undercooked and flavorless.The wings are nothing special-they charge extra for ranch etc.Way to pricy for realitively crappy pizza.$20 for pizza & wingsI hadn't eaten at this Pizza Hut location is over 10 years. I honestly didn't know there were any left in town with seating inside. I have seen them in other states and even with the lunch buffet, but sadly they have disappeared in Vegas. There isn't a salad bar or tabletop Pac-Man game like they used to have however the pizza still comes out piping hot and just tastes better than when you have it delivered or pick it up and take it home to eat it. Inside is spacious and it was really clean. Booths are spacious enough to fit the family and they have smaller tables as well. On the walls they have a few TV's mounted and the decor is cute and funny being themed around the wings they sell and pizzas. It was almost 10:30 at night (open until midnight on Saturdays) when we pulled into the parking lot and I figured hubby and I would be the only people there since there wasn't anybody inside but employees. Walking in we were greeted by Vanessa. They have a TV screen that shows how many orders there are and I noticed a couple other customers ahead of us. Vanessa took our order and let us know how long it would be. After picking a table and getting our drinks, it really started getting busy inside. There were customers picking up orders, placing dine-in orders and as well to-go orders. We beat the late night rush! Our pizza was ready in the time promised and plates, silverware, crushed peppers and cheese were brought to the table. We ordered the "Big Flavor Dipper Pizza" priced at $12.99 and our choice of 2 different sauce sets. One of eh sets just being 4 cups of marinara, we decided to chose the "explore" option which gets you 2 cups of marinara, 1 cup ranch, 1 cup BBQ and 1 cup honey sriracha. The pizza is almost 2 feet long and cut into 24 strips. Each strip had 3 pieces of pepperoni. Like I mentioned before, the pizza just tastes different when it's brought to your table piping hot and right from the oven and I like that. This pizza reminded me more of an appetizer since it's smaller than your average slice of pizza and being easily hand held with dip. It was far from any appetizer though for just 2 people and we had plenty to take home. The pizza box is also about 2 feet long, so I wonder how the delivery drivers have been doing with that?! Speaking of that, they do offer delivery here.Yes a 5 star Pizza Hut. This is is dine-in location with plenty of tables and booths. Inside is super clean and the staff is courteous. This is probably the only PH in town with a family feel to it. Pizzas are made fresh to order and are brought to your table as soon as they are finished being prepared. Any parmesan cheese, peppers, napkins, utensils, etc. you need will be brought to you by your server. Much different than delivery! I tried the 2 foot pizza and that was tasty and then just recently i had a stuffed crust with pepperoni and sausage, They have these flavor crusts now and the "hut favorite" is garlic butter with parmesan cheese and italian herbs. It's real good. They do have delivery and pick up ordering available here however I'll be dining in at this location.

Review Text :
Mikado really surprised me.  I didn't expect to find a Japanese restaurant so close to home with a nice atmosphere and pretty good food...but here it is! Sushi is really the thing here.  The tempura is good although the shrimp tempura had an odd coating that didn't match the veggies and it didn't seem like authentic tempura.  Miso soup is pretty good too.But go for the sushi.  They're all about the sushi here.HORRIBLE SERVICE!! Although the food was quite delicious. I ordered a shrimp tempura appetizer, edamame and a spicy salmon roll. The total came to 18.00 even. I left 24 dollars on the table. When I left, as I approached my car, the waitress chased after me and stated "WAS SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE SERIVCE?!"Puzzled, I politely responded "no, why?"And this rude ass said "Because I thought you would have tipped more"ARE YOU JOKING ME? That is so rude and I almost wanted to tell her to give me my 6 dollars tip back because shoot, I could put that in my gas tank lady. Good food but not good enough for me to come back. Sayonara.Unfortunately we didn't have a great dining experience.  The service was slow but the portions were large.  I ordered the udon and it lacked everything.  The salmon teriyaki and pork cutlet were better.  They charge you for hot tea that tastes like hot water.

Back East is, well, not back East quality as I know it. I really do detest New York (except for the Metropolitan Museum of Art), but I have to say that the best bagel I have ever had was there. Back East is at least better than the limp sticky things from Einstein's, IMHO. I worked very near here for many years, and I would have to say that their lunch fare was better than breakfast. Their eggs are microwaved in a disposable plastic container, and I always pictured tiny little carcinogens gleefully nestling into my morning protein. I swear that the majority of the time, the early morning staff was in serious need of a caffeine jolt. Mmmmm, how I loved having some slitty eyed college girl yawn in my face and not cover her mouth. Wake up, bitch, and get my order right, for once!Lunch was far better with a wide variety of quality bagel sandwiches, so satisfying and filling I would never be tempted by the snacks in the breakroom for the rest of the afternoon. The BLT was super yum, with cream cheese, sprouts, and cucumbers as well as the B, the L, and the T.Drinks are are a little pricey, and I always found the coffee to be just alright. The best cup in the immediate area is Gold Bar, but in the direction I came, it was a bigger pain to get to most mornings. You have worse options in the AM on the corner of Southern and McClintock than Back East Bagels.

I'll start from the beginning... When this place is busy (for some unknown reason) the parking is a nightmare due to the lack of space and the inexperienced drivers. The absolute WORST thing was me witnessing the valet girl stalling someone's car. I really couldn't help but laugh - why would you be valeting cars if you didn't know how to drive stick?!When you walk in everything is kind of new and trendy looking. I noticed a lot of younger people like to go here so if that's not your crowd then this isn't where you want to be after 7pm. I personally don't like "trendy-young-and-cool" sushi spots. I've only gone for dinner time so I can't speak for what it's like at lunch. The few times I've been here the sushi wasn't all that great - and I feel I'm a pretty good judge when it comes to the sushi department. I try to give new places a chance so I've been here maybe 3 times. Sushi still wasn't all that, our service always left something to be desired, and the last straw....I COULD NOT BELIEVE after mediocre borderline poor service, our waitress had THE NERVE to hand me our bill and circle the suggested tip she wrote down. Seriously? I always tip my servers well and accordingly, and a whole lot more when the service is excellent. I rounded out my bill to the next dollar and will never come back here again.Horrible service. Very disorganized. It first started in the parking lot which cannot accommodate the number of customers for the plaza. So show up early and expect to have parking wars. Took me close to 20 mins and settled for an illegal spot by the dumpster. We made a reservation for 7:30 and weren't seated until 8:30. Finally ate around 9. When we asked initially when we would be seated no one could give us a time and the manager dismissed our complaint. To top it off a bartender asked why the other was miffed and she said "it's nothing, just that bitch wants water" as I saw her to deliver it to my cousin. I confronted her about it and she tried to play it off saying "oh I wasn't talking about her", uh huh. Horrible horrible experience for overpriced okay teppanyaki

Restaurant name  Rock Springs Cafe & General Store
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Rock Springs Cafe has a pie worth driving for. Believe the hype because it's true. When you walk into the store, you will immediately smell the baked goodness from the massive pies they have on display. They have everything from blueberry and raspberry to lemon meringue and of course the infamous Jack Daniel's pecan pie. Before I touch more on the pies, I'll describe the rest of the property. Rock Springs Cafe and General Store is adorable. The property houses a saloon (with $.99 PBR specials), a cafe, general store and a huge picnic area that hosts a variety of events throughout the month. I saw several picnic tables, a spot for live music, area for horseshoe tosses and more. This is definitely a spot to host a party or host out of town guests for a southwestern experience. Now moving on to the pies. Yes, the pies are as delicious as the other reviews claimed. I have tried the lemon meringue and JD pecan pies. Both are unique and both are delicious in their own way. The lemon meringue is topped with the egg whites that have been whipped to be as light as a feather. The meringue is tangy but not overpowering and I could probably consume and entire pie in one sitting. The Jack Daniel's pecan pie definitely has the JD twist, but in a subtle enough way. It adds the perfect kick to the pie and is a nice unique twist on the common pecan pie. Yes Rock Springs is about 40 miles outside of Phoenix, but it's worth the drive. It's on the way to Flagstaff and Prescott so you can either stop by on your way out of town, or you can take a drive solely for a pie! The only reason why I removed a star from Rock Springs Cafe is because of the price. $18 for a pie and $4 for a slice? As amazing as the pie was, I think that it's a little overpriced and it seems like they increase the prices because they know that once people have made it to them, they aren't leaving without a pie so they can charge them whatever they want. If they ever lowered the prices, I'd add a 5th star.Stopped in for  a quick dinner at Rock Springs.Really great service, but the food was just ok. I know this place is known for its pie, so maybe I should have had that for dinner.Had the chicken fried steak, and it was ok, but wasn't exactly a taste sensation. I would be back, because the service was fast and charming.Never in my life did I think I'd be eating breakfast at RSC at 7:30 on a Monday morning. And how I got there involves spinning a wild yarn about driving to Chinle, Arizona on the Navajo Indian Resevervation via Winslow, Joesph City, and Holbrook that started at 1:30pm on Sunday afternoon. If you've never driven through "the res" at night, don't. It's terrifying. Honestly. Scared me to death. And I don't scare easily.After waking up at 5:30am in Flagstaff, common sense says stop in Flag for a bite to eat before heading down the hill. Common sense failed us at 8pm the night before. We got to Rock Springs, and I was expecting it to be busy. Hardly. 1 group of 4 eating breakfast. After perusing the menu, I was in that state between hungry, and "ready to vomit and drool all over myself". The server was nice enough, and the coffee was good enough to stave off the vomit and drooling. I was hoping for pancakes, but since there was no real Maple Syrup, no dice. HFCS syrup is THE WORST. No aunt I've ever met would condone that. I settled on the Western Omlet. It came with "Country Potatoes", and toast. The "Country Potatoes" were the freezer stored, bag type, precut.... OMG, there's that vomit feeling again. Seriously. No honest to goodness home cookin country diner served me frozen anything. That's blasphemy, honestly. No hash browns, either. They were "out". How do you run "out" of Hash Browns? Get a potato, get a grater, and get to work! Coffee cake? No dice because they "didn't feel like making it today." I can't make this stuff up. The eggs were so weakly average, that I left about a quarter of it uneaten. It was just flat, and bland. And we paid $35 for the privilege. No thanks, Rock Springs.   About the fruit pies.... They're canned. The filling is the canned stuff that you can buy at the store. Crusts are flour, water, graham cracker. I've seen them make the pies, and my teeth hit the floor when I saw them pour canned filling into a crust. It was the generic, Shamrock/Sysco/Southwest Foods canned filling. I can't speak on the Pecan Pie, but the fruit pies are canned. Lemon Merangue, canned. Rave about them all you want, but know it's possible to make the same thing at home for a fraction of the cost. We had been buying pies here for the last 15 years on our way up to the cabin. The day I saw them pour that filling into their fruit pies, that was it. 15 years of loyal patronage, all gone.  I'm all done with Rock Springs. Pies and all.In one of my favorite movies Michael (John Travolta & Andie MacDowell) it has one scene in it where they are at a café and Andie's character sings this fun song about Pies:Pie Pie Me oh my Nothing tastes sweet, wet, salty and dry all at once o well it's pie Apple! Pumpkin! Minced an' wet bottom. Come to your place everyday if you've got em' Pie Me oh my I love pieSo I was with friends headed up to Flagstaff for some shenanigans and one said hey we should stop at Rock Springs Café for some pie, mind you we only been on the road for 20 mins and it was barely 11, but hey its perfect PIE time right???? So I got that Pie song stuck in my head and was thinking of all the glorious pies I get to try! Peach, Apple, Cherry, Banana Cream, Coconut Cream, Pecan Pies, Chocolate Silk Pies!! Oh I was very happy to be making that stop and was singing Pie Pie Me Oh My!!! I was ready to get a table at the café and share some pies with my friends!When we got there, how quickly things changed. My excitement for being there was swiftly killed by the lack of customer service and rudeness of people who worked there. I went up to the hostess podium and said we are a party of 5, we were asked what our purpose was, I told her to try some of your famous pies, we were told that they did not want us taking up tables in the Café if we were just eating pies. (Gawd forbid we would want to stop at a place that has FAMOUS PIES and want to try said PIES) We were directed to a stand to order our pies. Now I didn't come to get a piece of pie in a plastic container as if I was ordering it from Burger King or something. I wanted to sit down and have my pie presented on a plate, after all they say there pies are world famous, present it like it is, instead of fast food plastic stuff. The pie of the month looked really interesting and I would have ordered, but nope they are out. I went with the Jack Daniels Pecan Pie, it was $4.50 for the slice, now to me, it tasted like regular pecan pie, which by the way is my favorite pie, it was perfectly sweet and the pecans had a good crunch on them, but couldn't tell it was made with JD. It just didn't wow me.  And I now felt like this stop was a waste of my time, I don't see me going 50 miles out of my way to order a plastic container of pie, they might as well just open up a drive through, the staff is already rude like most fast food places and if I want a pie that will wow me I can pick up a chocolate silk turtle pie in the freezer section at the local grocery store for under 5 bucks! (Edwards Turtle Pie, if you haven't tried, you should WOW!) The 2 stars was for the pecan pie, it was good, just didn't wow me like a world famous pie should.If you're in search of food, keep driving.  If you're in search of pie, drive to the Pie Hole in Phoenix.  I used to go to Rock Springs Cafe on a monthly basis with my grandparents when I was younger.  That was our thing - taking a Sunday drive and stopping by RSC on our way back home to grab food and a piece of  "Penny's Pies".   Penny was the gal that used to make all the pies in Black Canyon City.  I learned while we were waiting for our table that there are new owners, and oh my how things have changed.  From the appearance and layout to more importantly - the quality of the food.   Keep on drivin' if you're hungry and in this neck of the woods.  J, Baby C, and I stopped by Rock Springs to get an early supper on Sunday after a day trip up north.  I told him about how good the pies were and the food was in general.  He was on board when it came time to figure out what we were doing for supper.   J ordered the meatloaf dinner and I ordered the chicken.  Our plan was to feed Baby C off of both our plates.  Good idea in theory.  When we ordered, I stated I wanted a baked potato (which was on the menu) and the gal said that they don't serve baked potatoes until after 5pm.  Ummm...Its Sunday and a holiday weekend.  If one was going to sell a baked potato, 4pm on a Sunday would be the right time.  No where on the menu did it state that baked potatoes weren't available until after 5pm.  J gets the soup (chowder) and I get a side salad.  You really cant screw up either of those.  J said his soup was pretty good.  Our dinner comes out a few minutes later.  We were shocked to say the least.  We both dig in and J immediately is repulsed.  His meatloaf was lukewarm, greasy, and the gravy on top was congealed.  GAG.  My chicken was more like a Cornish game hen.  See photo for the worlds smallest chicken leg.  It looked more like a drumette, you know, the kind you'd get with an order of chicken wings.  The vegetables that came with out dinners, a half ear of waterlogged field corn.  An ear of corn (a bad ear at that) hardly constitutes as "vegetables".  I was thinking we'd get green beans, peas, carrots, or something.  The waitress came by and saw J was not pleased.  So she took his plate and asked if he wanted anything else. I told him to skip the regular food and to just get a piece of pie.  If he was hungry, we could get him something at the outlets in Anthem (which was where we were stopping by on our way home).  J liked this idea and ordered a slice of banana cream pie.  When the pie came out, he took a few bites and that was it.  He said it tasted like imitation banana and was not cold, but slightly warm.  I seriously doubt this was a true "Penny's Pie".  More like a bad knockoff.    The only positive thing out of the whole trip was the waitress took his dinner and pie off our bill, without us having to ask or talk to a manager.  We stopped by the general store, but the guy there didn't seem interested in helping us.  Or at least helping me.  But yet he yacked it up with J for a minute.  When I walked over to the counter to try a sample he was pushing J, did he acknowledge me?  Nope.  So we left.And we wont be returning.  If we're out for a drive, and are in need of food...we'll drive to Anthem.  And - If you really want a GOOD (more like AWESOME) piece of homemade pie, go to The Pie Hole in Phoenix.  :)My wife, our friend Kathy R.and I came here for Karaoke and dinner again. When we arrived there was only a few people in the saloon having dinner.We waited a long time before someone came to our table and took our beverage orders. There was only one waiter servicing the saloon. After what seemed an eternity he eventually returned with our drinks and asked if we were ready to order.  Our friend Kathy R. ordered the fish n' chips dinner, a side salad and a piece of pie. my wife Carol ordered the honey fried chicken and waffles for her entrée. It came with a side salad, backed potato and corn on the cob. She also ordered a slice of coconut cream pie. I ordered the grilled liver and onions dinner. It came with a side salad, baked potato and corn on the cob.  When our meals finally arrived they were either lukewarm or cold. Kathy's told us to try a bite of her fish. There looked to be two small pieces of fish that wouldn't satisfy a child so we declined. We did try the "home made" potato chips. They were a little above lukewarm. Kathy said the fish was bland and if it didn't come with tarter sauce it would have had no taste at all.  She said her dinner salad was better than the last time she was there. But her apple pie tasted like it came from a can. Certainly not like home made or something that would be famous.Carol's dinner (honey fried chicken and waffles) and a slice of coconut cream pie - The chicken was cold so were the waffles, baked potato and the corn. She offered me a piece of chicken to try and sure enough it was cold. It tasted awesome and I'm sure would have been enjoyable if it was hot like it should have been. She only ate one piece and the waffles before becoming so disgusted she had enough. She ate her salad, a bite from the corn and her pie. She said her pie was very good. My entrée (grilled liver and onions) when my dinner arrived the baked potato was so cold it wouldn't even melt the butter so I didn't eat it. The corn on the cob was the same way and I left that as well. I did eat most of the liver but didn't finish it because it wasn't hot.  there was also a small dinner salad that came with my meal which I ate.We were all going to send our dinners back but our waiter disappeared for so long and we were hungry we dug in. Like I said we were all hungry.Kathy R. ate her salad. Her fish dinner was two pieces of small fish and lots of "home made" chips. She ate the fish after smothering it in tarter sauce, her salad and some of the chips.I'm surprised when our waiter finally came back to our table he didn't ask how our meals were or comment about all the food that wasn't eaten. Nope he didn't even bother. Maybe he figured it was better not to ask. I don't know.FOOD: Portions are OK although our friends Kathy's fish looked like it came off the kids menu it was so small. SERVICE: Slow, slow, slow but it wasn't our waiters fault it is managements. Our waiter was actually hustling and doing his best. CONCLUSION:  We all decided everything considered when we return here for  Karaoke we would stop somewhere else for dinner. None of us wants to give this place another try. Especially in light of their prices. I don't mind spending my hard earned money at a restaurant if the food is good. This place does not deserve our continued support. If I could have rated this experience on a scale from one to ten, one being bad. I'd rate it a - minus 20!!!! RETURN FACTOR FOR FOOD: 0%************************* What does my OVERALL rating mean?*************************5 stars -Highly recommended.  I would be willing to drive out of my way to this business. It is that good. This place represents their industry or cuisine very well! 4 stars - Highly Recommended. I would frequent this business. 3 stars - Not that good but not that bad. Just average. I wouldn't mind going again. 2 stars - I would not recommend this establishment to friends or family. 1 stars - DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND DO NOT patronize this business. I would RUN AWAY from this place and you should too! DON'T WAST YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY AT THIS ESTABLISHMENTRolled up to the Rock Springs Café (RSC) on the way back to Phoenix after a long day up in Sedona. This place came highly recommended by my Yelp bud, Laz C, and my sister had also heard great things but, sadly, had never been. As we pulled up the first thing you notice is the full lot; Harley's next door at the Biker Bar; and the huge sign with a picture of a pie staring you in the face--the whole scene is a bit surreal and looks straight out of a Patrick Swayze movie. So we sashayed our purty lil' selves in there and began to look around. They sell the usual road side attraction tchotchkes and knick-knacks here at RSC -and they also have a Diner- but we came here with one objective: Pie. After much debate we settled on ordering two different ones: Peach Crumble and Coconut Cream--because some people preferred fruit and others preferred cream.Peach Crumble- The crust and filling on this was fabulous; you could really taste the Butter they use in the crust and the Peach flavor was really strong--almost enhanced in some way. Also, the pie wasn't ridiculously sweet either. 5*Coconut Cream- Usually on these types of pies I end up scooping off the Whipped Cream on top and just eating the filing and crust, but this was a different story; the Whipped Cream was 100% real and delicious. The filling and crust were also quite good but I felt the coconut flavor was a bit much. With that being said it's still maybe the best Coconut Cream Pie I've had. 4*Service & Ambiance- The girls behind the counter were very kind and patient and didn't rush us as we vacillated on what to order. As I mentioned before the ambiance is pretty great; your really do feel like you've warped back in time in places like this. 5*Value- The first thing you notice about these pies when you get them home is they're huge! RSC sells a slice as 1/6 of the pie, but realistically you can get 8-slices out of it. They're actually not a bad price at ±$18/each--I've seen homemade pies of this caliber go for nearly $30 back home in Cali. 4*RSC was a terrific ending to a great day in Sedona. I highly recommend stopping by if you're passing through the area as they're conveniently located right off the freeway. So, come on in and grab yourself a slice -à la mode- and enjoy the time warp. Highly recommended!I've been meaning to try Rock Springs Cafe for their World Famous Pies for years now on my trips to Flagstaff or Sedona. Last Sunday after our weekend of off roading, hiking and winery adventures, Dude and I decided to swing by for a slice of that supposedly amazing pie - Jack Daniels Pecan Pie as specifically mentioned by some of our pals! When we got in, the store had all of your typical Southwest souvenirs, a variety of jams, candies and other cooking goods. We saw the place to queue up for slices of pie. And man, I have to say the attitudes of the team here could use a major facelift. Getting snappy with customers asking basic questions about your product? Wow! Also, the attire of some of these gals was awful sloppy. I don't say this to be superficial or petty, but a proper fitting shirt that covers your midsection goes a long way in a customer-facing role. Have a little pride in your appearance! Anyway, at that point we were happy to pay and hit the road home. Once we finally tore into the pie, I was highly unimpressed. The pecan pie filling was unremarkable, and despite following Jason B.'s advice on waiting for that subtle JD taste after you swallow ... I just couldn't detect any. But the crust was quite excellent! My Mom said we should have stuck to the Lemon Meringue and Blueberry Pies. Good to know now, but based on the nasty customer service here and the unexciting pie, I won't be going out of my way to try it again. Perhaps on another trip up North.Stopped here again a couple of weeks ago on my way back down from Flagstaff.  This is becoming a normal stopping point on the I-17 for me.  It's just far enough away from Flagstaff that it gives you a great opportunity to stretch your legs or get a snack.Anyway, this time I had my 2 littles; the 9 year old and the 4 year old, and they both wanted slices of the chocolate pie and I wanted a piece of the Jack Daniels Pecan Pie.We got our pie to go and were back on the I-17 before my boyfriend, whom I'd been following down the mountain, had even realized we'd pulled off the road!  Back at home we had our pie, and it was glorious.  Of course my pie was delicious, no surprise there, that's why I always get it.  But this time I also snuck a taste of the kids chocolate pie...  Full disclosure: I am normally not a fan of chocolate pie.  I think I had one too many crappy chocolate pudding pies as a kid and it put me off of chocolate pie forever.  This chocolate pie on the other hand was amazing: the crust was buttery and flaky, and the chocolate filling was smooth and slightly sweet, but not cloyingly so, with a slightly dark chocolate aftertaste.  The whole pie was garnished with delicately sweetened whipped cream that added to the velvety creaminess of the chocolate filling.  I'm telling you, they knocked this one out of the park!  I'm still not a fan of chocolate pie, but I am a fan of THEIR chocolate pies.  I may be more than a fan....I may become a crazed stalker...

Review Text :
This club was really creepy. Aside from the impressive two story set-up with pool tables and  loungey space upstairs, I was not impressed. Our group was really out-of-place. Our ladies weren't dressed sleazy or tacky enough with cheapy slutty clothing. And our guys weren't dressed generically enough (think black/white mall-wear). Drinks were much weaker than the previous establishment we went to (Fox and Hound).Ahh, the things I will do for friends. Going to Mc Duffy's for a friend's birthday night out is one of those gestures. My McDuffy's good deed has me off the hook for another year I suppose. I was actually having more fun at Fox and Hound and wish we had stayed there.An extra star for the doorman knowing one of the girls in the group, letting the guys in our group bypass the $10 cover. $10 too much in my opinion.

Jolta Java. I've had you on my radar for a few months. I remember stopping by once a few years ago and had a pleasant experience. This time... Not so much.The coffee drink I got was tasty, and I'm very happy that they carry both almond milk AND soy milk for us lactose intolerant folk. This is where my happiness ends.This place needs a SERIOUS deep clean. The floor was covered in crumbs, the tables were littered with debris of various food and paper products. The fake plants were dusty and if you look up to their massive ceiling, all the huge pipes are COVERED in dust. It's an asthmatic nightmare. People would finish their beverage or food and then the table wouldn't be cleaned for a minimum of ten minutes.The staff were completely apathetic to all of this. It wasn't busy, so they stood around behind the counter either looking at their cellphones, chit chatting, or watching the Olympics. Sad customer service. The more I type out, the more I realize that this shop needs more than a cleaning. It needs an attitude and staff adjustment. I doubt I'll return.

Restaurant name  Joe's Crab Shack
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
We've always liked Joe's Crab shack and the one at the Mills is really loud so we decided to try this one. Anyways, it's the normal looking Joe's with merchandise to buy. The music isn't blasting so it was better and better atmosphere to eat at. The servers dance as usual for all the customers every once in awhile. To start off, we had the Classic Sampler which included fried calamari, Jalapeno balls, Tortilla chips with a Crab dip. The calamari was okay and the Jalapeño balls had a really nice kick to it and the crab dip was pretty good. Nothing great. Nothing to write home about. Also, my wife and son ordered the clam chowder. They always have to try everyone's chowder. This was probably the most disappointing chowder. I tried it and it didn't have a lot of taste plus it was luke warm. Not good. For dinner, I had the Artic Bay Steampot. It had Lobster, Crab legs, Shrimp, Sausage, potatoes, and corn on the cob. It was okay. Not a lot of taste. At the middle of my meal, everything was cold. Not a real fan. Seafood was okay. The sausage seemed like it had a hard skin and wasn't very tasty. The best part of the meal was the corn in the cob. My wife had the Spaghetti Lobster. It was served cold. So she didn't eat it. Wasn't at all impressed. The manager came by to ask us about our food and we told him that the clam chowder and spaghetti lobster was cold when we got it. He apologize and took it off our bill. Plus he gave use a few coupons for free appetizers. So as you can see, we didn't have a very pleasant experience today. Food was so so and cold. Not impressed at all. If we do ever come back, it probably won't be for a long time cause there's just too many place to try. Good Luck at this place.It was the 1st month of year and it was already kicking our ass so some coworkers wanted to get together for an happy hour/dinner and the place picked was Joe's Crab Shack, alright I'm in.I was lucky enough to work the early shift that day so another coworker and I headed off and got there around a quarter to 5, just in time for happy hour! 5 dollar drafts & apps! Hello!! So I ordered a blue moon or 2 or 4, whose counting lol and some crazy good crab dip.  The crab dip was loaded with crab meat in a melted cream cheese & parmesan mix, it was great! Went well with the Blue Moon!Everyone arrived around 6pm so off to a table we went, I knew I wanted crab and that's what I went for!A bucket of Queen Crab but in the Cajun flavoring, came with French fries and hushpuppies, it was 1 ¼ pound of crab, and it was good! I enjoyed my dinner!Service was great, food was good! Great times were had!

Restaurant name  Flo's

Review Text :
I've been to Flo's numerous times over the years, but there seems to be a downward trend.  It looks like I'll be finding a new Asian Fusion spot...The Man and I had a couple hours to kill and hungry bellies to feed, so we popped into Flo's for their (seemingly) amazing happy hour.  I ordered a froo-froo drink, which I'm pretty sure was half-price because it contained half the alcohol it normally does.  Tasty, but strong? Um, no.  We moved on to a bunch of appetizers: crab puffs, chicken satay, spring rolls, BBQ pork, and pot stickers.  The BBQ pork was yummy, but that is where our satisfaction ended.  All of the other items seemed no better than from-the-freezer snacks I can get at the grocery store.  Are they making any of these on site?  Maybe, but it sure didn't taste like it.  The crab puffs were the most disappointing.  So little crab, so much cream cheese.  They should definitely take a look at that ratio and either rename the dish or up the crab quantity.  Just a thought...Now I'm off on a journey for a new go-to Asian spot!2/28/14Called out sick from work, and I was craving for egg noodles with either beef, or chicken with ginger, so we ordered the Mongolian Beef (an entree I've already tried before), Thai-style Green Curry chicken (new to me!), and Shrimp with snow peas for Mom for pick-up.  Enjoyed the Mongolian beef (beef with onions, jalapeños, red pepper flakes, and something that looks like sweet potato leaves), but as always, I felt a little let-down when I bite into the pieces and did not find the satisfactory crunch of the caramelization of past Mongolian beef entrees I've had elsewhere.  I was looking forward to the ginger-hot spiciness of the green curry chicken, and while it was slightly underwhelming, which I'm sure is most likely from the fact that I'm suffering from a cold and could not taste all of the flavor notes, I was happy to be able to detect the ginger in the dish.  I loved the long beans in this entree, which also had basil, lemongrass, fresh chilies, shallots, galangal, garlic, and cilantro.  I had a taste of both dishes for lunch, and I would have to say that the beef was more flavorful- saltier, and definitely spicier!  The noodles were angel hair-thin and had not satisfied my dietary lust for stir-fried noodles I fancied while languishing in bed waiting for lunch time to roll around...  I offered to share my dishes with Mom, but she was too busy enjoying her Shrimp and snow peas!Dinner time came, and I enjoyed the noodles and green curry even more-- it tasted even better, or perhaps I was feeling better from the OTC medication and rest...   Wished this dish contained a LOT of long beans, as I find myself rationing the remaining amount...  Btw, each entree came with a side salad and the signature house dressing.

I'm no connoisseur based on living in a certain part of the country or anything like that, so I won't discuss regional styles or anything heady like that; I just know it's good when I taste it.Pulled pork sammy  on egg bread kaiser roll was really good.  Not too fatty, but enough for some juice and flavor.  Portion size that looked nicely 'good enough' to my extra hungry eyes, but quickly swelled into 'more than enough' once I was well into it.  Sauce was good - sweet and tangy - but I wished it were a little more smoky, since in it's current form it seemed to conjur in my mind the thought that it tastes a little bit reminiscent of McD's prepack nugget bbq sauce.  I stilll liked-ed it.I had to remind myself to put down the sandwich at about 2/3 finished with it, in order to eat some of my fries.  Putting down the large sized sammy was no small feat, since at this point in time my hand was basically the only thing holding it together!  I managed to put it down safely and get to the fries, which were thick cut and seasoned as if they were curly fries.  Okay, but not made here in the kitchen, that's for sure.It was important to finish the fries first, so that the tasty juicy pulled pork and sauce was to be the last flavor in my mouth, the one that would linger.  If you're like me, you put a lot of thought, as you eat a meal, into which flavor you'd like your last bite to be.  It's way more personally important than considering what your breath will smell like later to others.  If a part of the meal was good enough, and I know I want that flavor to be the last bite, it's worth it for me to skip dessert!Service was fast with not over the top, but subdued, friendliness.  Perfect tone for a solo late lunch diner.  I'm sure she would have bubbled right up for a family with kids.  All of today's daytime staff I encountered seemed to be experienced pros.Before tip and extras, the sandwiches are around 8 bucks.  The fact that I'm still full (satisfied, not uncomfortable) 4 hours later means it was certainly worth it.  The freaky decor will have you in pig-kitsch night-terrors.  Look for the flying pig attached to the pounded tin ceiling tiles, that is painted to look like a Hindu deity ~ bizarre even in this place.I really wanted to like this place knowing the owner is a world champion of bbq but obviously he isn't involved with managing the restaurant. The brisket was garbage, the corn bread was equivalent to a scotchpad and the beans were just ok. Their mac n cheese is kraft...??? Can't a bbq restaurant make their own? I thought they usually do.I did like the sauce. I may give them another chance and then edit this review after that but it may be awhile until I work up the courage to eat there again.A day after eating here, I nicknamed this place "Thee Pots" because that's where you will spend part of your day after eating here.Visited 6/2/12....So..... My quest for good BBQ in Arizona continues!!We actually took the time to drive across down just to visit this location.  My friend recommended it based on prior experiences from years ago.  And also because it made Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives.  Our hope was to find a better experience than our weekend prior. We were very disappointed!!  I had the meat combo.  It is a sampler of all the meats.  Brisket, Pulled Pork, Chicken pulled, Ribs - both Beef and Pork, Ham, and Chopped (a mix of chopped pork and ham?)  The meat had no appetizing appearance.  The taste was not much better.  The meat was dry on top and dry through out.   Ribs over cooked as the meat on pork ribs were falling off the bone. The available sauce on the table was basic. And when I asked for a hotter version of the BBQ sauce, I was brought another bottle that came cold (like out of the refrigerator) and it was not very spicy - even for my friend. The sides were disappointing.  The Baked Beans tasted much like they came out of a can.  The Cole Slaw was bad - like it went bad.  Tasted sour and bitter.  So bad that I sent it back..The only good thing were the Onion Rings.  These were very crispy and fresh.  We went in about an hour before closing.  There were very few people there.  But service was slow.  Took about 15 minutes just for the Onion Rings.  And another 15 minutes for the main dishes  Considering this is a BBQ meat that is supposedly slow cooking for hours, it seems like it would not take very long to prepare.  Unless you have to go back and reheat??  (Just thinking out loud here.)Over all this was a failure.  A wasted hour drive for BBQ that would have been better at some local chain locations. Maybe it was because we arrived close to the closing hour?  But then again, if you seat me, then serve me a good dish.  Otherwise, don't serve me!!Finally, would I return??  Maybe? For lunch and a quick sandwich.  Will I ever drive that far again.  NO.  Are there other choices in this area, YES.This place is gross their sauce taste like ketchup the food is alright but this is not award winning BBQ they must have stolen someone else's awards and put their name on them! We went here cause it was on DDD and boy were we disappointed not to mention our waitress was rude and took forever to bring anything to our table in the middle of the day the place was empty! If you want good BBQ don't come here because you won't get it!

Spaghetti... meat balls.  I stopped in here with a friend because we were both hungry and this place was convenient for us.  The service that I received was nice and I enjoyed my server very much.I was really sad that the place that advertises "Spaghetti ... meat balls" didn't nab at least 3 stars from me.  I suppose it is an uphill battle for any Italian restaurant because I don't eat pasta.  *gasp*  I know.  I just don't eat it.  I think pasta is a bunch of empty, tasteless calories.  Yikes.  So, when I go to Italian restaurants with friends, I always order any pasta dish w/o the pasta sub a veggie or lettuce.  I don't mind paying extra for what I want.  This is the first establishment that I've been told that wasn't an option.  I just don't see why not if you're making the ingredients to order to put OVER plain pasta or tossed with plain pasta.  Why can't I have it "OVER"/"with" anything I choose if I'm willing to pay?  I would have loved to have ordered the roasted asparagus with the Bolognese, I'd imagine if the Bolognese is half way decent, it would have been awesome with that bread.  IDK.  But, that's the way they choose to run their business and I was fine with that.  The server was kind enough to point me to some other options on the menu that did not have pasta in them. Great, I can work with that.  I went for the Asparagus Fra Diavolo with roasted chicken and the Mista Salad.  The Mista Salad was delicious.  I believe I had it with their house dressing.  YUMMY house dressing.  I also dipped their bread in the salad dressing.    Oh wait.  How could I forget the bread.  Wowzer!  Their bread that they serve prior to the meal is simply divine.  Warm, moist, soft and tasty.  Very good.  So, back to the Asparagus Fra Diavolo with roasted chicken.  I just simply didn't enjoy it.  It didn't taste good to me.  :-(  My friend ordered the Jambalaya and that tasted pretty good to him.  I have heard the east VAlley location was good, so maybe I can give that a try some day.Sadly, this was likely my first time and my last time here.  I didn't get to find out if Spaghetti enjoyed "meat'ing" Balls or not... So sad.BTW, they have a very nice patio dining space.

*** #200 ***Mamma Mia!  Judging from my recent experience, this is a super-fine ristorante that serves up superior Southern Italian cuisine.  Diane and I have the good fortune of being friends with several married couples who are always game to try out the cuisine of new dining venues.  On one such gustatory adventure four of us took over a table for six at Buon Gusto, and filled it to overflowing with various dishes.  I appreciated that shakers of grated Parmesan Cheese sat at both ends.  The owners and head chef were not even around, and yet the coordinated operation of the skilled culinary team on a very busy Thursday night still hummed along beautifully under its very able management.  Service was friendly and efficient, with our table checked on several times.  I just had to ask for one water refill twice.We began with a loaf of excellent baked Italian bread that was both complimentary and warm.  It was so good with butter or vinegar and oil that my party polished off this and another 1-1/2 loaves by meal's end.  Next for me was a good but barely hot small bowl of Italian Wedding Soup with tasty but tiny meatballs and only bits of spinach.  This was really the only low point of my meal.A generous side Caesar Salad with excellent creamy Caesar Dressing, fresh chopped Romaine Lettuce, and crunchy croutons was presented next.  Crab-stuffed Mushrooms were simply excellent, and lightly floured Calamari served with a Sicilian Sauce that tasted like a slightly amped up mild Marinara was very good--one of the best I have experienced in the Vegas valley.A long interval separated appetizers, soup, and salad from the entrees.  But this was understandable, since by this time (about 7:30 p.m.) the place was packed with patrons.  Now we really put the table to the test.  Soon it groaned under the weight of Shrimp Parmigiana with Alfredo Sauce, Veal Parmigiana, Manicotti, Penne with Meat Sauce, a Meatball, Fettucccini Alfredo, and Penne Pasta with Alfredo Sauce.  The tomatoey, cheesy, thinly pounded, and double folded Veal Parmigiana was great.  And so was the Fettuccini, nicely tossed with thick and tasty Alfredo Sauce.  Portions were quite large.  I barely finished mine, but everyone else took home leftovers to enjoy another day.  All dishes on the table looked and smelled great, as did a pizza just across the way.  Ahh, that will have to wait for another day!  One can only consume so much at a time!We still saved a little room for dessert though.  Homemade Tiramisu was light and airy.  And, we rounded out a memorable meal by sharing generous portions of rich Chocolate Gelato and refreshing Lemoncello Gelato.  As a final whimsical flourish, 8 wrapped Mini-Tootsie Rolls were placed on top of the bill.  Even they were good: fresh and soft!  I will most definitely be back--the sooner the better!Great Italian. Very friendly service. Owner seems to genuinely care about his staff and customers. Waitress was very attentive, made sure to refill our drinks often.  She also forgot to ring in something that we ordered, but immediately told us once she realized. I appreciate when service staff is honest, and it turned out we were stuffed, so we decided to just get it to go. It's a small place, but they seem to be always busy. (may have to wait for a table, but totally worth it) Now about the food:Meatballs are very flavorful (I recommend adding them to the top of the manicotti dish, which is now my favorite. The soup of the day was chicken pot pie, and it was seriously one of the best things I've ever put in my mouth. Sooo yummy. Other entrees I'd recommend are lasagna, baked Ziti and the gnocchi. I haven't tried the pizza, but I'll definitely be back.Excellent service. The service is probably what stuck with me more than the food. The restaurant is located in the corner of a shopping center on Horizon Ridge and Eastern -- pretty difficult to spot unless you are familiar with the area.Inside of the restaurant is compact, charming, and homely (in a comforting way). The male server that greeted us may have been the owner. He was interested in hearing how we heard of the place, made sure to explain the menu and offer suggestions based on some of his favorites, and checked in on us regularly throughout the meal.We opted for the calamari "best in town" as an appetizer ($8.95). It was fine, cooked tender but overkill on the batter.The food, or perhaps what I ordered, wasn't mind blowing or innovative. It was simple chicken marsala, and sure maybe it is partly my fault for going for the basic, unimaginative option, but to my credit the menu did claim "best marsala in town". Not sure that I will agree there. There really is only so much you can do with a straightforward dish like that, hence why I will not dock them more than a star for the food. The chicken was cooked well, marsala wine sauce was fine, and the mushrooms were...mushroomy? The meal did come with the option of soup or salad; I opted for the chicken and mushroom soup. The soup was really, really good. I also opted for a side of baked ziti in regular tomato sauce. That also was not very memorable. But the meal was a great value for $16.95.I love Italian food, it is the first type of food I learned how to cook and excel in, so maybe I should just not go out to eat at Italian places because my expectations are really really high. I go as far as making my own homemade pasta and sauce with as many natural and fresh ingredients as I can.  I have yet to be wowed by an Italian eatery with the exception of Scarpetta.I felt inclined to write this review after my experience last night.  My friend and I wanted some good pasta so I recommended we go to Buon Gusto. My friend had never been and I'd been to Buon Gusto several times and always had wonderful experiences there - except this time. It took 10-15 minutes just to be acknowledged upon arrival. No host/hostess was in sight.  After we were seated, they took our order quickly and returned with our salads and then we waited...and waited...and waited. They didn't even offer us bread while we were waiting until we asked. The bread was fresh and soft but the oil was an overkill. Imagine 95% oil, 5% vinegar. 35 minutes later as we waited, a cockroach decided to join the party. It ran across the wall under one of the paintings and attempted to hop in my friend's purse. We let our server know but by the time he returned with something to kill the cockroach, it disappeared. That should have been our cue to leave but instead we decided to relocate to the front dining area. One hour and 15 minutes later plus 2 and a half loaves of bread, our food arrived. I ordered the sausage and mushroom rigatoni, and my friend ordered the champagne chicken. The sausage and mushroom rigatoni was subpar. It was basically rigatoni drowning in a store bought vodka sauce garnished with a handful of mushrooms and cut up sausage. The champagne chicken was terrible. The texture of the chicken breast was like plastic and it was pale in color. Neither of the dishes were hot either. It was definitely not worth $20.00. To top it off, the server was rushing us to pay our bill. They didn't offer to give us a discount on our bill and a manager didn't even come to our table to apologize for the cockroach or the wait for our food. It wasn't even that busy! Honestly, we couldn't get out of there fast enough. The only positive things about our dining experience was the bread and the salad.After an afternoon of shopping, my friend and I were famished and decided to try Buon Gusto for dinner since we had a coupon. We walked in at 8pm and it took some time to get seated since it's a pretty small place. We were finally seated and our waitress took our drink order. I ordered the baked ziti Siciliano and the Italian wedding soup. Our order took a pretty long time coming out and after about 20 minutes of waiting the waitress came out to let us know that she was sorry for the wait since they had apparently closed down the kitchen without letting her know and that they had to start it all up again to cook our orders and that of another table that came in before us. I'm a little surprised and disappointed that they decided to close down the kitchen a good hour before they were scheduled to close. Seems like a bad business practice. If we had known that the kitchen was closed, we would have found another place to eat, but after waiting so long we figured we might as well wait it out. The soup was lukewarm, not surprising after hearing about the kitchen snafu. Our entrees finally came out and they were decent. My pasta was good and I enjoyed the sauce quite a bit. The eggplant was overcooked and had an unappealing texture.Our server was sweet and she kept an upbeat attitude despite all the shenanigans that seemed to be going on in he kitchen. The kitchen staff seemed to be playing around and more focused on wanting to leave for the evening, which made us uncomfortable and we ended up rushing through our meal to leave.I see this being a decent spot for take out, but try not to come by too close to closing time.Buon Gusto. I'm very much in like with you. Knowing this place gets packed on Saturday nights and the fact that they only boast eight or so tables, the GF and I decided to call-in our order, thinking this would be faster, that was not the case. We went with Italian style sub sandwiches, one chicken parm and one meatball with a side order of sausage and marinara, the very classic and basic of Italian deli style eats. Once ordered we were told it would be about 15 minutes, upon arrival we found out our food was still not ready, but we were reassured that everything would be done shortly. Another ten minutes later, still no sandwiches in my hand. After waiting another five minutes and noticing the place wasn't that busy, we asked how much longer, "they should be done very soon... what was your order again?". Excuse me, how do you know if the food will be done soon if you don't even remember what my order was? Hearing this response and realizing that the fella behind the counter didn't seem to care about the tardiness of our food, my GF got a little heated and exclaimed that we had been waiting over thirty minutes for two sandwiches. The fellas response, "thirty minutes, are you sure?". I was stunned at that response and thought my GF was going to jump over the counter. After this delightful interaction our food finally arrived and we headed home. After unwrapping everything we noticed it was piping hot, this was good sign. The cheese was still melting and everything looked and smelled fresh. The bread was super soft and the sauce was flavorful and had some heat to it. The meatball sub was a very heavy meal, but the meatballs were great and a little misshapen, which hopefully proves the fact that they make them in house. I only had a bite of the chicken parm, but the chicken was tender and the breading was crisp. After a rocky start at Buon Gusto, the food more than made up for the wait time. This isn't me saying I like waiting thirty minutes for food, but if you're going wait that stuff better be on point!We've been waiting to try this place for a while so we found an excuse to drive out to Henderson, after going to the movie theatre we decided to check this restaurant out. It's a very casual setting, kinda like a pizzeria back east, with the red and white checkered table cloths and all. As soon as we walked in we were told to sit anywhere and the server took our drink orders right away. I ordered the chicken francese with a side of penne with marinara sauce. My meal came with a small salad to start which was really good. The chicken was rather delicious just the right amount of lemon flavor in it, not to much. I thought the size was small, looked like a chicken breast pounded out and cut into 4 pieces. I scarfed it down rather fast then worked on the side of penne which tasted perfect, if you ask for bread they will bring it to you to scoop up any leftover sauce. My only complaint is that IMO it's not worth what they charge, it's not fine dining. $15.95 for my meal and they charge an extra $2.95 for the side of pasta, pasta is customarily included with the meal at Italian restaurants. Don't like the nickel and diming. If the lunch portion was this much I wonder how much the dinner portion is. Not stingy so just saying. Other than the quantity and price the food was still good and the service was equally good to. Servers were very friendly and kept checking out table for refills. I will definitely give this place another chance, maybe the portions are better at dinner. I wasn't full when I left.

Review Text :
A classic.Picture where players of the mobbed up Vegas (60's and 70's) met to eat and discuss "business" and you're picturing the Golden Steer.Don't let its location (the "bad lands" with its wedding chapels, strip clubs, sex shops) and dated exterior keep you from trying this  steakhouse.  Step inside and you're in another era.Table side preparation is a specialty and therefore a must try.  The Caesar's salad (traditionally made with the raw egg and anchovies) is as good as any.  The lobster bisque is sublime.  Classically prepared old school style.  The steaks are very good.  All of it is prime but unlike the top steakhouses on the Strip, the meat is not heavily trimmed.  There is a good amount of fat and grizzle on a perfectly cooked piece of beef.  Once again, classic and fitting for this restaurant.  The T-Bone is excellent as is the simply prepared prime rib.Do not pass up the banana foster.  It is prepared table side.  A great show and a great desert.Service is extremely friendly.  The highly knowledgeable servers make you feel like a returning guest.The wine list is OK.  Nowhere near as extensive as many of the other top steakhouses on the Strip but prices are very good.Only two visits so far but more to come.Recommended.OK so DON'T go here... it's that easy!!! There were so many things wrong with my dining experience it's hard to even figure out where to begin!1) SERVICE-- I went on a Sunday evening and sat at the bar so I could watch football. The poor bartender does everything here.  She had 9 people at the bar, was cleaning glasses, answering the phone,getting our food  AND she has to make all the drinks for the waiters. And when I say ALL the drinks, they come up to her for a COKE, they don't even have a fountain drink machine for the waiters to do it themselves.  Needless to say, it took her a while to get my food ordered. There also was a group of 3 guys that sat next to me that were ordering food and playing video poker too [hold that thought].2) DRINKS--They have video poker at the bar. Fine by me. THEY DON'T COMP your DRINKS at the bar. Unheard of in Vegas. I lost $40 bucks and still paid FULL price for my 2 glasses of wine.3) FOOD--Bread? They have bread here???? Based on the other reviews apparently they do. We didn't' see any bread at the bar- carb free for us! My meal came out before my salad. Noooo bueno.  Also, about 25 mins after I ordered my meal arrived. WHY so long you ask? Because the bartender has to leave the BAR and go get the food herself. I have never in my life seen a restaurant where the bartender goes and gets her own food.  The reasoning for my salad coming out late, the waiters were getting there before her, and since the Caesars are made to order I lucked out.  Let's talk about the food...I order the combination meal-petite fillet, salad, veggie, & shrimp scampi to the tune of $65. Outback has better steak then this place. It was really dry [see pix] there wasn't even any juice on the plate. When I think of shrimp scampi-garlic, white wine, shrimp, butter, and parsley comes to mind.  This was NOT that.  It was gelatinous kinda like shark fin soup & the tails were still on the 5 shrimp.  Side of broccoli extremely undercooked. It needed 2 or 3 more minutes in the microwave from where it came from.Guys next to me started laughing when my food arrived. Then I one upped them told them I bet their apps come out with their food....well I was sort of right. Their food came out, but there were no apps with it. So poor little bartender, now has to leave the bar, for about the 5th time [with 9 people at it PS-it only seats 12] and once again go get our food. PS- I complained about the order in which the food came out, hostess did come talk to me [she might have been the manager] instead of apologizing, offering me a dessert, taking off a glass of wine, she told the bartender if she starts to get behind let her know and she'll help out.  I mentioned to her too the same thing happened to the guys next to me. She offered no apologies and didn't even go speak with them.Mind you we are drinking, eating, AND playing at this place.  My meal cost me well over $125 and was worth about $30 in my opinion.Again STK or Botero are much better options. I also have no idea how anyone else had a GOOD experience here as this might be the worst experience I've had in Vegas and maybe in a restaurant period.I just received the worst service experience in my years of eating at high end steak houses. The food was good overall but I don't need to be disrespected and insulted on top of mediocre service when I'm dropping a grand in your establishment.We had a group of 8 get together for a post Viva Las Vegas dinner. Please note that while this is a rockabilly convention we all dressed up to the nines for a "classy" dinner experience at the Golden Steer. When we arrived we asked to have separate checks because as with many high end steakhouses, the items are served ala carte. Thus, it makes figuring the bill at the end a nightmare with this many people. The excuse was the computer system can't handle it..and apparently writing it down on paper is too hard as well for the 200 dollar tip. Our group was not loud nor over demanding yet had a lot of trouble getting service in general as others have mentioned in reviews recently. As expected, the chaos begins when it comes check time. We get handed one copy of the check and are basically told "you need to figure it out". After lots of asking we finally got multiple copies to try and make sense of the confusing bill. This whole process takes us 40 minutes of struggling with the staff to clarify the bill as if it just too much trouble for them despite the place being less than half full. We ended up missing a show in Vegas we wanted to attend dealing with this fiasco.As we start paying, the real fun begins. We are told by one of the servers in a very condescending and rude tone "well, maybe they do that at Denny's but we dont do it here" in regards to the poor service with the check. It seemed to be a personal shot based on being from the convention. Also, when asked why we are not being taken care of as is a servers job.. He replies "is it my job?" as if he would be doing as little as possible for the 20 percent tip. The older waiter over hearing the conversation was clearly embarrassed by his colleagues remarks.Sorry but there are too many other great steak houses in Vegas to deal with lazy and insulting staff. Perhaps he should not have been so judgmental. I work for a Fortune 100 company and like to take clients to dinner. I make a good living and I am highly educated, I dont eat at Denny's thanks.  I don't need this garbage. Guess who isn't taking any clients here anymore?P.S. Denny's probably has a spot on their overnight staff for your rude server. He obviously can't handle this gig.Now, I will admit; I am very generous when it comes to reviewing and rating, but I only write about things when true emotion and feeling are conjured up. It's not like I don't have the time, it's just that the inspiration is gone. Not within The Golden Steer.I will address the fact that I have been coming to and living in Las Vegas since the early 80s as a child. I have seen 90% (probably more) of the businesses come, flourish and then be gone. There are few places in Las Vegas that offer an AUTHENTIC old steakhouse, and even fewer near the Strip. Everything about this place, maître's d  and all. Other than Bally's, Circus Circus, Smith & Wollensky and Golden Steer, EVERY SINGLE other steakhouse (on the strip) doesn't pre-date 1989.I have been to ALL OF THEM. They all are 5 star worthy, But S&W can be a bit pricey... Golden Steer is far and away, my champion of Steak AND Service in Las Vegas. It sits in an inauspicious strip mall 1 block west of LVBLVD on Sahara. The best word to describe this place is Incognitus Majorus. It isn't pain-in-the-assedly normal "In the Rear of the Casino" Location, see: Circus Circus and Bally's. or tucked away in a location that is too crowded (everywhere downtown). Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr, Joey Bishop and Marilyn have their own booths. There is a Grand Piano in the front Lounge area. The décor looks as if it hasn't changed since 1957. It is reported that this was one of the frequents of aforementioned characters of yore. What a perfect spot, in close proximity to the Thunderbird, El Rancho and Riviera, and then later, Sahara.I came to dinner with the most obnoxious accessory to diners and servers alike: A BABY. They not only sat us immediately, but Our Hostess, Stephanie (?) offered a bowl of mashed potatoes before even handing us the menus for food or wine. That was incredible. Haven't seen that before, or since.It was my 5th time there overall and first time with my daughters. The prices were on par with every other steakhouse in town, so I don't mind. The food was not only phenomenal, but the service was incredible, and everyone was so polite about my baby girl. The same hostess even offered to hold her while we finished our last bites. The Crab Legs were huge, sweet and buttery. The steaks were cooked to perfection with the right amount of char and smokiness. The service was jaw droppingly amazing and we ended up tipping everyone that helped us. Not only was this my favorite steakhouse from this point on; but my favorite dining experience in Las Vegas. Hands Down. I hope that someone actually reads this from front to back. I am a local concierge and VIP Host in town, it is my job to report accurate findings out and about in Vegas. I pass over the mediocre and certifiable, I give Kudos to the businesses that inspire me. Golden Steer offered a dining experience that I will remember for the rest of my life. Not only that, they set the curve. I have eaten quite literally around the world, and experienced service at all levels of remuneration, but have NEVER experienced dinner like my 5th visit to Golden Steer.Spent our anniversary weekend in Vegas with another couple.  Husbands uncle is a local he says you gotta go to the Golden Steer forget about Gordon Ramseys place.  He says you get the same thing for $65 a person so we all gave it a try.  The atmosphere reminds me of an old time piano wine bar from the 70's/80's but a little run down in need of some updating.  Waiter was weird and had an attitude that kept growing throughout the night.  He told us how hed been there quite a long time but had left for a while and come back etc making a point I guess that most of them were there for 20+ years.  We got a bottle of wine and then ordered.  I had the filet which was nicely cooked and the twice cooked potato.  The potato was actually about the worst i have ever had because it was obvious that it had sat in the oven either all day or for hours.  It was completely burnt on the bottom but not in a good way.  You know how you can totally overdo a potato skin to complete crispy browness that its cracking apart but it still tastes good?  Ya well not like that this was BURNT.  Could not cut it with a fork burnt.  Had to use a steak knife to get through it sooo cuz our waiter was weird with attitude I wasnt going to say anything about my $10 potato.  The waiter came back at least 5 times aggressively asking if we wanted another bottle of wine.  It started to feel like it was a demand rather than a request which we all noticed.  At the end we all got dinner drinks/coffee and dessert.  The drinks came out right away and we had a nice conversation while we waited for dessert.  The restaurant only had 3 tables and I noticed 2 waiters and a couple bussers as well as the guy doing the salads and desserts so when we finished the drinks we asked where dessert was.  We were hoping to have it with the drinks but  its like 30 minutes or more later and the waiters response was really snotty that they only had one of those dessert trays and the guy was going to get to us.  We were there at 7 pm and the only people on dessert at the time.  We didnt understand the really negative reaction we were getting so we were doing our best to be respectful responding with yes sir etc.  Its almost as if he mistook our kindness for weakness which seems to be happening a whole lot these days when you go out.So I watched the dessert guy make our dessert and I noticed he was making cherries jubilee instead of the bananas foster we ordered so I said something about it in a very nice way LOL that doesnt seem to matter.  The response was almost like are you effing kidding me?  This bitch makes a mistake I gotta fix?  He didnt say that but his body language sure did.  The dessert guy went away the waiter comes back with more attitude and do you want another bottle of wine again.  He seemed pissed at us that the guy was making cherries and that we didnt want that as well.  They finally made it right and I tasted one bite and not good.  We make it better at home.  Everyone at table agreed we make it better so good thing I got the tiramisu because that was pretty good.This is the important part.  I would never have bothered writing any of this until this part happened!  The waiter brings the bill and most of the time my husband just takes care of it but this time I had a funny feeling about the waiter so I looked at it and thank the lord I did because that dude double charged us and charged us extra for stuff that already came with etc. For instance my husband ordered asparagus with Hollandaise sauce $11.  The waiter charged us for 2 of those $22 + Hollandaise sauce $5x 2 = $10 so his asparagus was $32.When we pointed out the errors to the waiter he seemed intensely aggravated.  He responded very quickly like he was expecting it.  I bet he was.  I bet they do that all night long.  He said oh when they put it in they must have made a mistake like someone else rang his order in and like it happens and he will have to go straighten "them" out.  Bill came back minus $150 but I am positive we still paid too much because that extra sauce crap didnt hit me til we got home that the asparagus already had Hollandaise on it and I just looked it up on the menu to be sure and yep sure enough.  Bottom line:  These people can cook a steak but so can the Keg and Firebirds etcDO NOT TRUST YOUR WAITER:  Go over your bill  -  They are looking for suckersFair restaurant prices on bottles of wineNONE of us would ever returnI love this fucking place.My buddies and I head to Sin City -- this is our spot.  Table for 8, bottles of Cab, cocktails, killer steaks, great sides . . . Old School Vegas.  Muhammad Ali celebrated his birthday here, the Rat Pack, Marilyn and Joltin Joe . . . LOVE IT!  You wanna know what I hate about Vegas?  How they import great restaurants from other parts of the country.  I don't want to eat at Nobu in Vegas.  I want to go to Malibu for that.  I don't want to eat at Carmine's in Vegas.  I want to eat at the one on 44th St in NYC with theatre tickets in hand.  I don't want the replica, I want the gawdamn original.  And that's what Golden Steer is.  Over 50 years.  est1958.  A Vegas original.For those complaining about the service, you've gotta understand where you are.  You don't trot your significant other or your family into Golden Steer on a Friday night and expect rush service.  If you do expect that, then go to Black Angus.  This isn't 'dinner,' it's an event.  Soak it in.  Chill for a couple hours.  Actually chew your food.  Order dessert.  Extend the evening.  Experience it.  I've found the cooler you treat the staff, the faster and more pleasantly they serve you.  We were joking with our servers, taking pics with one server who looked like De Niro, and tipped the shit out of em.  We were there for a couple hours.  We loved it.  It was incredible.  All 8 steaks cooked perfectly.  If it's overcooked, send it back and grab another drink.  Sure beats a ruined evening while you quietly bitch about an overcooked steak and tell your fellow diner(s) how you can't wait to get on Yelp and destroy them.Smile once in a while.  This legendary place rocks.Bon appetit, bitches.Going through the motions. Past its Prime. Simply awful. These are but a few of the things that cross my mind when I think back to what has to be one of the worst dining experiences we have had in some time. Having heard of the place from my father who had eaten there some time ago and having had a requirement for Prime Rib for my sons birthday, we thought we would give the Golden Steer a try. It was memorably bad, the kind of bad that has the whole table on edge and wanting to leave. Allow me to explain..... From top to bottom the whole experience was terrible. Service: BAD and got worse: . The waiter visited our table EXACTLY 3 times in the 90 minutes we were there. Since the wine list was spotty, I went for a beer. In this day and age it is not unreasonable to ask for the selection since no drink menu was placed on our table. More to the point don't roll your eyes at me either and look put out, how hard is it to say Bud, Bud Light, et al. (Seriously no local craft beers?).  The next and biggest sin in my book was not clearing the table between courses. When you see the appetizer plates, the salad plates sitting at the table, perhaps its time to clear before you try to WEDGE the next course in.  Clear the table BEFORE you ask about desert. If the service was bad the food bordered on edible. It was by far some of the worst food I have had in some time. The appetizers: Toasted Ravioli: Not only was it clearly a food service product (Sysco perhaps) it was not properly fried so the interior was not completely melted. (Food temp seems to be an issue with this place too) The marinara sauce had a canned quality to it and was pretty much lifeless. Shrimp Cocktail: Shrimp was decent and the cocktail sauce was just okay. I also appreciate the addition of horseradish which helped pump up the cocktail sauce. Bread: First basket was okay, the second clearly was old. I could have taken an at bat against Madison Baumgarner with it. Salad/SoupTable-side Ceasar: While they did prepare ours as part of the larger party next to us (and honestly I don't expect the poor guy doing it to make just two for us) it was dull and lifeless lacking much flavor. The croutons tasted like they were from a prior decade. Onion Soup: The broth was actually okay (more like an Au Jus) but again the issue of properly heating things reared its ugly head. The soup looked like it had been placed under the salamander and was never brought up to a proper temperature. The soup was just warm at service and that made the Swiss cheese clump within minutes into a curd like manner. MainsPrime Rib: Not a lot to say here but it was clearly NOT slow roasted but rather quick cooked. No seasoning and it was tough and quite chewy. The Jus had no taste either. No desert as we were thoroughly disgusted at this point. Its clear that this place is on its last legs and perhaps needs to a featured restaurant on Kitchen Nightmares or Restaurant Impossible.  Either that our closed to put and anybody who is thinking about eating there out of their miseryI've now been to Golden Steer twice. It seems like I'm being treated progressively worse. I live in the condo building next door so I try to support businesses in my neighborhood. I can honestly say I'll never be a patron at Golden Steer again. The first time I came to The restaurant the hostess tried to act like she couldn't seat me despite the restaurant literally being empty. There were literally 3 customers in the restaurant. I brushed it off. The servers were rude to me and practically ignored me and the prime rib was not good at all. I chalked it up to an isolated bad experience. I came back about 6 months later (today) and the hostess tells me there's a 1.5 hour wait. She later gets on the phone and tells another potential customer that they have space if they come now. I sat in the bar high tops area for about 25 minutes. Nobody brought me a menu or even acknowledged me. I literally had to go and find a server and place an order. This time I tried the ribeye. I asked for it medium rare +. They gave me a medium-medium well steak. When asked for another steak the server tried to blame it on the au jus. I eat at steakhouses weekly. Au jus had never made a steak more well done in my experience. As I type this I've been finished with my dinner for about 20 minutes and no one has come to offer me the check. I'm practically invisible. This is very disappointing. None of the other patrons are being treated like this. I'm the only Black patron in the restaurant. I hope this is merely a coincidence.Best steakhouse I've been to!  I've gone to other steakhouses on the strip, but wow, I was mind blown!  This is a hidden gem located on Sahara between Las Vegas Blvd and the I-15.  It doesn't look like much on the outside, but you feel like you're in a mobster movie and stepped back in time when you walk in.  This is the spot where Frank Sinatra and other famous people would go on the regular.  I've heard from others that Frank Sinatra has his own booth here.The servers were very friendly.  They definitely made sure we were taken care of.  At least 4-5 servers would come to our table just to make sure we were okay.  Their wine glasses are huge.  Their breads tasted like it was freshly made.  The steaks were juicy and cooked to perfection.  The whipped potatoes were light and fluffy.  We got the salad, 8 oz filet, 22 oz bone in ribeye, whipped mashed potatoes and creme brulee (with a hint of chocolate) for dessert.  Everything we tasted was purely amazing!This is my favorite steakhouse by far.  Can't wait to go back!A golden ex-steer-ience!The Golden Steer saved the happy hour day during the first trek at Rock N' Rio. After eating dinner at the SLS and finding that there were no happy hour specials on Fridays we wandered onto Las Vegas BLVD - I saw the Golden Steer in the distance and was drawn into the light. We walked in and were greeted by a tux with a furled brow. After explaining we just wanted few a drinks and we'd be out the door, he obliged and walked us over to the bar. This place is a true Vegas landmark with pictures of Mobsters, The Rat Pack, and Hollywood celebs adorning the walls. You get a real sense of old Vegas, where everyone knew your name and your drink. This place is so old school with the red vinyl seats and the golden accents everywhere; it makes the show "Mad Men" look like a modern day TV marvel. The bartenders Patty and Blake were awesome, very friendly and willing to chat with us about the place. We ordered vodka sodas and shots right off the bat and after our second round, I started eyeballing the happy hour menu... "One order of escargot please"... Yes. I'm a big fan of this land dwelling mollusk, and whenever I see it on a menu, I have to order it. The Golden Steer's versions of these are very good. Swimming in butter and garlic sauce and not too chewy either, the snails simply melted in your mouth. The only thing is, I wish they came in their shells. These snails were served pre-shelled for easy consumption, where's the fun in that?This was my first time here, but definitely not my last. It's time to make reservations and party like it's 1959!Impressive. There are a lot of great steak houses in Las Vegas. In fact there are a lot in this area... Resulting is stiff competition. This place definitely holds their weight. From the outside, it doesn't look like much, but the inside is nice enough. I called to see if a reservation was needed and the woman that answered the phone was a little punchy. She gave me the info but made me work for it. When we arrived we noticed a lot of the other customers were very casual. It was warm out so my companion was happy to leave his coat and tie in the car. I ordered the filet and crab legs. I think it came with a salad, or it was extra I'm not sure.... Either was the salad was over priced. Just a boring mix if basic lettuce and dressing. I will skip the salad next time. The filet was cooked perfectly and very tender. Crab legs were opened and very easy to eat. A lot of meat per leg. Steak fries were pretty good as were the asparagus. All and all a pretty nice meal, although slightly overpriced.Listen to me very carefully. There are three ways of doing things around here: the right way, the wrong way, and the way that "I" do it. You understand? - Ace RothsteinIt so happens that there are also three reasons to come here: 1. Old School Vegas (It's rightfully the most popular statement used to describe Golden Steer)2. Old School Steak...be it Steak & Potatoes or Steak & Lobster3. Old School Table-side Prepared Caesar SaladGolden Steer doesn't have the sophistication of a modern steakhouse. That's not necessarily good or bad, just a little more unique these days. They will tell you they let the food stand for itself. While, the're not serving the best cuts in town, they do serve a quality product. For me it is all about the atmosphere. The Golden Steer isn't the place I'm typically interested in settling down in to enjoy my dinner, but I can still appreciate the charm and appeal to others...It's Vegas Baby!...Old School Vegas...better days, when the Mob still ran The Strip and you were taken care of so long as you played by the rules. You are taken care of at Golden Steer as if you were an old mob boss. The staff is attentive and dressed to impress. The food is executed well. The bar tenders are lively and good for a story or joke if you're in off peak hours.

"Arizona's only Hipster Bar", or so the sign says.We discovered this place when they started doing a Tuesday night Drum'n'Bass night.  The bar is great.  Dark, nice round booths, good decore, tons of beers on tap, even more in bottles, great sound system with a stage.  They've got a few pool tables in a separate little area so you can still hear the music but still hear your friends.  Staff is friendly, courteous, and all in all pretty cool.I've eaten here once for breakfast where they screen movies on a bigscreen using a projector.  Omelet, Bloody Mary, Erin Brockovitch (ok, that part sucked) FTW.That being said, I will prob. never eat here again.  Last night we were chillin' wih friends enjoying music and they were enjoying some burgers when out of the corner of my eye I see a roach just waking along the top of the booth.  Cruising around from one side to the other, checking things out.  Now I'm not an idiot, I realize there are prob. roaches everywhere, but something psychological happens when you're two feet from a roach in a dining establishment.  Unfortunately, I'll never be able to eat there again, however I will return for beats and beers.  If you read this far you will prob. not eat there either but I encourage you to drink there (bottles).

I had a chance to just go out with my daughter today for a little father daughter time. So she likes the Good Egg and so it was. Walked in and it just reminds me of all those breakfast houses. Nothing really jumps out. Let's just say the decor is all breakfast(ie) like. Ordered the orange juicy and coffee with the Sun Devil omelette. The omelette had diced ham, peppers, and onions. Nothing special about this. All I really tasted was the eggs. Didn't have any flavor. Pretty disappointed. Hash browns and English muffin were the norm, but I did enjoy the OJ and coffee. My daughter had the Pineapple Upside Down pancakes. Two huge cakes taking up her whole plate with pineapples, grapes, and whip cream on top. I snuck a few bites and it was really good. Walnuts in the middle with a pretty good syrup. Pancakes were not dry at all and pretty filling. Our server was really good and very attentive to us. They gave us our own pitcher of water and coffee. So overall the food was okay with pretty good service. Not bad but I could find better breakfast joints to go to.

10/22/10Yesterday (10/21), I prepared my own honey-buttermilk pancakes w/ Ghirardelli choccy chips, sliced bananas, and a handful of those cinnamon-roasted almonds I found at Costco.  While those hotcakes made for an excellent meal, they weren't the protein pancakes from US Egg nor the custom-made ones from Good Egg I've been craving for the past two weeks.  So, I decided I'd stop at Good Egg and claim my free entree w/ the customer appreciation card I've been holding onto for more than a year now.My server Bailey was amiable and attentive.  She suggested I try adding dollar pancakes to my entree since I couldn't decide whether to go w/ some pancakes or something off of the lunch menu.  Thanks to the two Diners, Drive-ins, & Dives' episodes on breakfasts I'd seen during Monday's treadmill routine, I also had a craving for some corned beef hash (or those wonderful hash browns from Matt's in downtown Phx).  I decided to go w/ a full stack of pancakes ($7.50) and a side of corned beef hash ($3.95).  While having breakfast, I looked over the dollar menu wedged conveniently between the condiments and saw that for a $1 more, I could have "today's sweet deal."  Well, Bailey, what is today's deal?  A choice between an apple streusel bread pudding w/ caramel sauce or a strawberry shortcake w/ house-made strawberry fruit topping, you say?  Decisions, decisions!  Thankfully, the caramel contained corn syrup, so that made it easier for me to choose... So there I was, for weeks craving for some of those blueberry-almond-wheat germ whole wheat pancakes and what did you think I ordered?  A stack made w/ sliced bananas, candied slivered almonds, and Ghirardelli chips!  Silly me.  But they were very, very good!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-good-egg-chandler?select=0Wuwde1B28GdL1HXRxQUBQ#0Wuwde1B28GdL1HXRxQUBQ  The toasted slivered almonds added a different texture from those whole candied almonds I have at home, and the chips at GE didn't burn on the griddle like those I'd made myself.  (I'd skipped the secret step to making great choccy chip pancakes... you have to coat them w/ flour first to keep them from sinking to the bottom when you add them to the batter!  Yesterday, however, I just topped my cakes w/ some chips, so no wonder they charred when I flipped them over.)  Um, but I digress...  The corned beef hash, ordered on the crispy side, was crisped nice and salty.  It could've been a little crispier, but these were good enough.  Loved the salt-sweet contrast- what a great meal!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-good-egg-chandler?select=Ojm8b8LkvBVqJ4D3Jrer9A#Ojm8b8LkvBVqJ4D3Jrer9A  The coffee was freshly-brewed and strong, and I liked having a thermos on the table for me to pour myself another cuppa.  Last, but not least, the strawberry shortcake was just the perfect way to cap a terrific experience at GE.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-good-egg-chandler?select=N_Uofl8oX8l-RQMZ6i39Dw#N_Uofl8oX8l-RQMZ6i39Dw  Well, that and the large cup of coffee everyone gets to take on the way out.  Now that's a nice touch!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-good-egg-chandler?select=LsiGK7lm6zIoeyI_8-cFcw#LsiGK7lm6zIoeyI_8-cFcwIf you're a Good Egg fan, you may want to stop by and partake in their giftcard offer to expire on 12/24- get $5 off your ticket when you buy a giftcard worth $25 or more!  [I got a better deal, though... ;)]Traveling from Los Angeles to Arizona in about 5 hours not bad. Now we must get good in our belly!! Got the lumberjack skillet, filled with potatoes, bell peppers, mushrooms, bacon, cheese and topped with gravy, served with a biscuit. The combination of all the ingredients in the skillet was good but too much potatoes. It was flavorful and hit the spot. Service was good and the waitress made sure she always asked if we were ok and had everything we needed.

We had family visiting from out of State. So Rawhide is closed on Monday and Tuesday now days. I guess they are not doing to well lately.So instead we went somewhere that I have never been either. A Ghost town out in Apache Junction. I never knew ,but it is a real Gold mine.Anyway, back to the restaurant. This place was recommended to us by the Train conductor.  We were so glad that we listened.It was a very cool little place with an interesting history. They too claim that it is haunted by the past owner of an old Shell station that used to be there.That is a fun little story that you can read about while there.The menu has a lot to offer ,all sorts of different choices. They have something for everyone. The server comes to your table with chips and salsa and your drinks.We all got something a little different and all of it was really good.They have a full bar ,and even chocolate milk for the younging we had with us. (She was very happy).We had the Philly with steak, Hamburger, Cheeseburger, and Prime Rib. Everyone really liked all the food. They even have a child's menu.After the kids are through eating they bring them a Vanilla ice cream cone. AWESOME!The prices are very reasonable as well. Plenty of parking in the front and the back.Decorated with lots of cool old things and it is clean in there as well. A major plus for an older place.I would go back any time. In fact we are looking forward to it.

Saturday was a busy, busy day!There were so many moving parts to my day:* I rode my mountain bike to Tempe to see the Tour de Fat:)* I had to play Squash at the club:)* I had football on the TiVo that really needed my attention:)* Oh yeah, Carin had a pretty big photo shoot that she was managing, and she asked me to help her with "model wrangling" for a little while...(she didn't call it that...she's far more refined than I am...she asked me to help sign people in and make sure they got where they needed to be...but I call it "model wrangling":-)Where do I get the energy? :)After a busy day, it was time for a dinner party with the photographer, the owners of the business, and selected guests from the shoot...interesting people and a wonderful mix for great conversation...which makes for a great dinner party:)Hiro Sushi had been selected for the party and they did not disappoint:)Hiro San has been a sushi master since 1968 and knows his way around a sushi bar (as do all of his assistant chefs:)Hiro likes his boats, and all the sushi, sashimi and rolls were delivered to the table in traditional sushi boats...that's presenting your fish old school...and I approve (I have too...I went to an old school...back in olden days:)Fresh tasting and delicious, the food came in waves ebi, maguro, iki, ikura, uni and anago, along with Arizona Roll (vegetarian...not my favorite), Caterpillar Roll and Spider Roll while we all enjoyed Kirin and hot and cold sake:-)Hiro doesn't really have a party room, but they created a nice little spot for us all and we all laughed and talked and drank and ate and it was just a wonderful night.We've been to Hiro before and the food and service are always top notch:)The ambience in the restaurant is a little bit pedestrian...it kind of feels to me like a strip mall sushi bar (which it is, although the food is an order of magnitude better than most strip mall sushi:)And creativity isn't really Hiro's strong suit...good and fresh sushi always, but not always presented as art.Does that make a difference?...I don't know for sure...it can be an important part of the equation for me:)That said, I like Hiro's...a lot:)A lot better than I like model wrangling...it's really not my cup of dirty chai latte....it was like herding cats...pretty, pretty cats:)WoW!   So legit, the real Japanese sushi experience is at Hiro.  Without any special motif or hip Scottsdale decor, it's Japanese and sushi at it's BEST!  Chefs..Japanese, who greeted every person that was walking through the door. It's  pretty small place, like ones found in Japan, and has one of the longest sushi bars I've seen in Arizona.   With daily specials written on the wall including conch (From Florida) in miso to spicy scallop rolls that are sweet and spicy.  The seaweed salad is always a great way to being your meal, Hiro's tempura was crispy and light, and the sushi was very fresh.  It is so hard to find a REAL sushi house and this one that I will be going back again and again!  The service was great all in all from beginning to finish.  We walked in not knowing what to expect, the prices seemed reasonable for sushi and we walked out knowing this hidden gem, is the place to be for sushi !  P.S.First Asian restaurant I've seen in Scottsdale, that I've seen alot of Japanese go to, AWESOME cause I know it must be fresh and good! And it was.After a long afternoon lying by the pool, hungry, looking for happy hour deals, we found Hiro Sushi in N. Scottsdale.  No happy hour here, but they offer high quality Japanese food at an affordable price. My favorite was the tempura dish. It was perfectly fried and so crispy.  You can taste that they used clean oil to fry, not like other restaurants.  The sushi rolls were very fresh and well prepared. This is my new favorite Japanese restaurant in N. Scottsdale.Before I delve into my personal experience at Hiro, I will discuss the important factors of, what makes a good sushi restaurant, according to my criteria. For credibility I've eaten sushi my entire life, everywhere from Cali to NYC to Tokyo . I believe I can distinguish between the different levels of superb sushi grade fish. - Fish Quality    I ordered the dinner sashimi platter ($21), 2 orders of the spanish mackeral nigiri($11), 1 order of the giant clam nigiri ($11).              *The sashimi was average, and the tuna had a distinct "fishy" smell to it. The portions were of average size, and the layout was aesthetically pleasing. The Spanish Mackeral was OUT OF THIS WORLD GOOD! I highly recommend it, albeit the cuts are small, the fish is delicious. The giant clam was overpriced based on its size and freshness. - Rice Quality    This is pretty hard to mess up. The rice is perfectly balanced as it should be. The fish to rice ratio was good. I went into this restaurant with high expectations, first from the high reviews on Yelp, and second upon entering the restaurant you are overwhelmed by an abundance of Japanese celebrity pictures plastered all throughout the entrance. They are all somehow affiliated with the restaurant/owner. The pictures suggest that these Japanese celebrities have eaten at this restaurant and give their thumb of approval. 3 stars because this restaurant, in regards to nigiri and sashimi, were just average. The problem with sushi reviews on Yelp is that you get a lot of yelpers reviewing based on rolls and sake bombs. It's sad but true that so many people will judge a restaurant based on how good their rolls are when the true judgment of a sushi restaurant should be in the quality of their nigiri. I have given up on sushi in Phoenix. From now on I will get my sushi fix elsewhere.Hiro Sushi is a traditional sushi bar/restaurant in Scottsdale.  It's a popular place where you can get a true Japanese experience.My Overall Rating - 3 Stars (Atmosphere, Service, Food, Return)Atmosphere - You'll find a long, traditional sushi bar along with several tables & chairs.  Now, it's not a large restaurant, so you can expect it to be full of patrons.  It can be a bit cramped in certain areas.  You're best off in a party of 4 or at the sushi bar when it's crowded.   1/2 Star.Service - I like sushi restaurants where the server speaks Japanese.  It always makes me feel like getting authentic sushi.  Hiro Sushi passes this test.  Service was a bit slower when it got busy, but we were able to get all our orders in, order more, etc.  Great stuff here.  1 Star.Food - We ordered the Chirashi special, which provided us with a large assortment of sashimi.  Honestly, from the ratings we thought we would be blown away, but it was good.  Also ordered some Udon noodles which provided a nice broth.  We continued with several other rolls - again solid but nothing memorable.  The entire meal is good not great, which isn't a bad thing.  1 Star.Will I Return? - Only if I'm craving sushi in Scottsdale.  We made it here due to the high ratings, but honestly I didn't find anything so outstanding that I haven't had at many other Sushi restaurants.  There's no doubt Hiro has a loyal following, but I would only come back if sushi was the only type of cuisine I was craving.   1/2 Star.My Yelp Rating Scale (Sum of all parts):1 Star - Atmosphere - Is it a cool dive?  Perhaps an upscale place?  No matter the type, atmosphere plays a big part and I'll give a star if I like it or thinks it has great charm.1 Star - Service - You can have a great meal with bad service.  But that's also what can make a five star joint drop to four.  It's important to the dining experience that service is great and on point.2 Stars - Food - I'll award up to two stars for the food, since this is the main reason we dine out.  Sometimes the extra star is given for value, but it's really all about the food.1 Star - Will I come back? - If I know for a fact I'll return, I'll give this a star. A place has to make an impression for me to return. Each Category can be given up to 1 star except food (2 stars) because I consider all these categories important to the overall dining experience.  I will sum them up to provide my final Yelp score.

I've stopped by this Deli for lunch and breakfast.  When I came for lunch, I ordered a 10" Italian Sandwich ($6.79)http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/UkqdcwYv6_c-yW1JPCKlUA?select=FvhTfKVsGt5FXtfjL7dgEwhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/UkqdcwYv6_c-yW1JPCKlUA?select=qaOSRK-FMOUZgooSqY8R4wThe Sandwich was very difficult to eat because it was served open-faced with the Meat pushing the Bread open....very strange as it made it difficult to fold back over and hold.  Also, they douse the bread with the Oil/Vinegar, so it gets soggy and breaks apart....WTH?  The taste was pretty good, but the experience sucked.  You can see what I'm talking about in my pics.The 2nd time I stopped here, it was to try their Breakfast Burritos.....since the Max Burro was priced at $4.29, I only ordered 1 because I thought it would be huge....I was wrong, it was just a Med sized Burrito.  It was pretty good....Eggs, Bacon, Cheese, wrapped in a Tortilla.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/UkqdcwYv6_c-yW1JPCKlUA?select=8gpyTOcWz6BWYTxxTc-UnAI was disappointed with the size though.....I was still hungry after I finished it....bummer.  I didn't think the $4.29 was worth it...I think $3.50 would be a more appropriate price for a Med sized Breakfast Burrito.Overall, I think this place has potential....right now, it only gets 3 Stars from me.Return Factor - 67%This place is a little pricey, but I work in the area so its become my place for breakfast on Sunday mornings. So far I've had the bagel and locs with cream cheese which was delicious! They definitely don't skimp on the amount of salmon that they give you, its jammed pack! I've also had the turkey sandwich where I just added onions (extra) and avocado (obviously extra) and it was a little more than 9 dollars which I mean JEEEZZ! Is this sandwich coated in gold? Also if you want any other type of roll that isn't a Kaiser roll its extra money. When I got my sandwich at 8:15am (they open at 8 on Sundays)  my avocado was already browning which ..... Wth! You've been open 15 minutes and your avocados are already browning!! So that was a disappointing experience. I don't choose to dine here because I think the service isn't the best. Whenever I walk in there in the morning I get the vibe that I'm bothering the employees with me ordering food. I'm never greeted I just get a "what do you want to order?" No good morning, hello, how are you, etc. So, bleh. Order to go or delivery for the best experience.

Have to completely disagree with the first reviewer -- as a Southerner, this place is an insult -- a total sham -- 1) it's FILTHY  2) it's FILTHY and 3) it's totally overpriced...oh did I mention how dirty the joint is?Took some Southern co-workers all the way from UNLV for lunch -- won't do that EVER again.  The wait was 20 minutes for the gal to step out from behind a counter to bring us a menu... we were the only ones there....!    Hello?  The menus were sticky -- the place smelled bad -- they had cleaning chemicals out on the same counters where they serve food -- finally put them away about midway through lunch service.We were hoping for something authentic lunch-wise -- like a "meat and 3" plate -- in the South, it's easy to find about 20 mom and pops that offer this for oh, anywhere from $3 inclusive of tea and pie (!) -- to $6 (for a fancy joint) where tea and pie are extra...No meat & 3 here (all a la carte) -- so to replicate that, we're talking you're in for $20+ easy for lunch... I'm serious.  Bad fried chicken, bad mac & cheese, bad greens, bad canned beans, bad bad bad... tea that was so sweet my teeth still hurt.Shame on you, Kathy -- real Southeners know better...I would love to bring my Mama here when she's feeling homesick -- but this will just make her sick... and break her heart...this place truly has no soul.To add insult to injury, when it was time to pay the check, they have this ancient system that charges a set amount -- plus a service charge to run your card... it's such a scam. I really wanted to love this place -- as it stands now, it's probably tops on my list of places that I'll NEVER give a 2nd shot... Hope this saves you a trip!

"Are scallops rare?"                                     "Thai food is getting up there with                                        Chinese food for me!"                                     "I would give this 5 stars if it weren't for the price                                      versus the quantity."Service here was great, food was overall good quality and yummy.  I thought the seafood (panang curry) was overpriced and under quantitied with 3 shrimp and 3 large scallops and steamed rice for *drum roll* $16.95.I picked up some takeout here this evening.  I wondered if I had gone to a totally different restaurant than the 4 star Mint Thai I had visited several months ago.On the one hand maybe they are having an off night.On the other hand maybe they have dropped significantly in quality since my first dining experience.If you would kindly lend me yet another hand, I have run across restaurants where the take out food is like a totally different restaurant.  Maybe Mint Thai is one of those places.There is a trend down and to the right in the reviews...

I got a Groupon here in May and figured I would use it when traveling to Vegas. Driving here wasn't too bad and finding the place was pretty easy as it is located in a shopping center. Our Groupon was $10 for $25 so we got a medium Villa Special pizza for like $15, chicken wings for $6, fries for $3, and a drink for $3. Total was like $4 with the Groupon.The place was pretty clean and had a lot of seating area. The World Cup was showing at this location which was kind of cool. They have 3 TVs there to watch the game. I did see signs for beer specials that was 5 for $10.  The Chicken wings were the best. It was crunchy just the way I like it and very flavorful. The fries was good but nothing too special about that. The pizza was pretty good too. I like my pizza with flavors of the sauce that is tangy with a kick. The meat was good I think I must have ate 4 pieces since it was that good. All in all a good place to go to just eat or watch the game. I would definitely go back again for their wings.Favorite Villa Pizza in all of Vegas. I drive out of my way and pass another Villa next to my office to dine at this one. It's got the golden ticket.Why? Because when Carmine (the original owner of all the Villa Pizzas in Vegas) sold most of his Villa pizza shops they were not allowed to continue using his secret recipe which was the main reason Villa was so popular. Kim and Kanye should consider naming their love child Carmine after him because the sauce is THAT amazing. THIS location however was one of the only ones who were special enough to get to keep the recipe! Their sauce is money up in here! All of the other factors of the pie are high quality to make it one solid pizza.Also get their chicken fingers and ranch. It gets the job done. All white meat, crispy, humongous and just right.Prices and service are decent, too. They currently have coupons in the Entertainment book and also run specials. The restaurant is small, but I don't expect the Ritz when I'm grabbing a slice. It's clean and smells of garlic and red sauce and that's all I need to give me strength to return to my cube and face my never ending Inbox of work emails. If you are in the neighborhood or live on the Moon. I don't really care. Drive over here and try this mystic pizza. It's golden and just might make your day a little brighter.Needed some printer ink from Office Depot and was famished, so I popped into this pizza joint. Apparently I was there during happy hour #1, which is 2-5pm, and rocks $1.60 slices. Nice! I ended up getting a slice, salad and drink for $6. The salad was legit too. Roasted red peppers, olives, hot peppers, cukes... this wasn't your average pizza place salad (you know, when it's large chunks of unripe, random veggies). I was very, very happy with the slice as well. Def NY style aka very thin, cheesy, greasy and made to fold. It's my fave slice I've had in Vegas thus far (!). Not a greasy slice fan? Still come here, just rock the dab. No one will make fun of you. Well... Anyway, it's a heavy slice and will sag in the middle, so, take a few bites before you fully commit to the fold. Yea, I eat enough 'za to comment on that. Ah, can't forget, there's a TV on the wall if you're dining solo and comfy booths if you're in for an extended drinking session :)Was pleasantly surprised and I'm looking forward to returning. Other specials...*5 beers for $10 if you purchase any food (nice)*2 slices and a soda for $5*Sun-Thurs 4-9pm (happy hour #2) - $9 large pies and other specials.

All right.  It's come-to-Jesus time.  It's hard to watch a thriving business implode, but that's what is happening here.  I've been a regular at this Teakwoods for about 7 years now.  My husband and I liked the atmosphere, food and friendliness so much that it's safe to say we even considered this when we bought our house (within walking distance) back in 2007.  Everyone who worked there was welcoming and hard-working, from the bartenders to the servers to the bussers.  The wings (and other dishes) were great (especially as sports-bar food goes), beer selection was good, prices were reasonable.  We've seen staff (and management) come and go, but we've remained loyal, and actually have stayed good friends with many current and ex-employees, who have become like family to us.But things have been steadily going downhill, and now I think they've nearly reached rock bottom.  It started with cosmetic stuff.  Leaky ceilings, scruffy empty shelves behind the bar for a long time, mismatched and shabby (and some downright uncomfortable) furnishings, tatty bathrooms.Then, the food.  We used to look forward to the daily specials; now it seems management is finding ways to "repurpose" leftovers or overstocks in new and unappealing ways and, frankly, in weird combinations.  Sliced hot dogs on a lavosh? Really?  Even one of my previously favorite appetizers, the caprese (oh--now spelled "caprice" on the menu) tastes bland and worn out.  I used to LOVE the creamy, cheesy, meaty cheeseburger soup when it appeared on the menu, but I had it just a couple of days ago and was disappointed to find it watery, virtually tasteless, and sorely lacking in the meat department.Prices were raised (during the recent Arizona Beer Week; talk about opportunistic!), and a rash of regulars left in protest, and have stayed away.  But I and a dozen or so other regulars remained, largely because of the friendly and efficient service of a few remaining long-time servers there, along with a few awesome bartenders and wonderful bussers.  The service in general had also gone down over time, but management seems to want to drive it right into the dirt, as they decided this week to get rid of two of their best servers.  That was the last straw for pretty much all of the regulars who had remained.I feel like I'm going through a divorce.  It's sad and depressing to watch, slowly but surely, a decent business and a fun place run into the ground (going much the same direction, apparently, as the recently closed Maricopa and Phoenix locations of Teakwoods have gone) by bad management and poor decisions, who put "profits" over people.Why did I even give this place TWO stars? For the handful of wonderful staff who remain--AND for the wings, which are still great.  But if you MUST have them, I'd advise you to get them to go!Teakwoods is another great place for wings in this area. Seriously, if you're thinking about going to Wing Stop, turn around and go to Teaks. Come on. You're already in the area, right?Chill ambiance. Enjoy some peanuts and drop your shells on the floor if you please. Great spot for a casual workweek lunch, live music on the weekend, or just catching a game. Plenty of beers on tap for everyone's taste.I haven't ventured much beyond the wings, but with good reason: They're delicious!Two of my favorites are classic Hot, Suicide. Plenty of sauce and finished just crispy enough.Don't forget to check out their unique wing combinations! The Jess Jess is a combo of their Medium sauce and BLEU CHEESE cooked into the wings. And it will blow.your.mind. Since I carry the "Yelp Torch" in our relationship, Dude approves of this place. Not so sure if it's the wings, or the t-shirts with the Teakwoods Moose you can purchase that say, "Nice rack!" but know we'll be back -  Wings for sure; maybe I'll finally buy one of the shirts.Check out Teakwoods on your quest for great wings in Chandler.

What a great bar!  I have spent many an evening here drinking their inexpensive beer while watching drunk people dance.  This is not the "pretty people" bar, this has the feel of a neighborhood bar.  Everyone is mostly friendly and I've never seen the place packed to the gills.  The decor is sorta old west, meets Hawaii.  Very strange.On occasion they have cool theme parties (cool because of the FREE food) on the weekend.  I didn't see any happy hour specials the last time I was there but I didn't look.  There is easy access to the 101, but don't drive drunk, Snobsdale cops will catch you.This place has a lot of regulars, but after a few visits you could fit right in.I was up there last week with a group of friends and volunteered to be the designated driver for the night. It was a $5 cover to hear the house band, which was no biggy and then I asked for a diet coke which was another $3. Again, no problem paying for the diet coke. After about 30 minutes and some dancing, I went up to the bar for a refill of the diet coke expecting the refill to be free. The bartender told me it would be another $3. I mentioned that I was the responsible one for a table full of people drinking and that I thought the point was not to encourage drunk driving and to encourage people being responsible. Well that got me nowhere so I asked for a glass of water instead. I was told that the bartender couldn't give me water because it was a two drink minimum to get water.Now it's July in AZ and I had been dancing. We had a table full of people drinking and ordering their drinks from this same bartender who can't give me a glass of WATER. Really? I don't mind paying the cover and the cost of the first diet coke, Im not being cheap but the point is that most bars appreciate and take care of the designated driver. I was being responsible and they couldn't even give me a glass of water!Really?I came to Handlebar J tonight for the first time with one of my friends to take some line dancing classes that they host every Tuesday night for $5 per person. As we walked in and started making our way towards the dance floor, the owner stopped us and asked if we wanted a table. Not understanding her, she bluntly stated that the dance lessons are separate and if we want to join in, we have to sit down and order food (two drinks per person or a meal and a drink--mind you, it doesn't say this ANYWHERE on the website. A warning would have been nice. And, it's not to say that we wouldn't have ended up ordering a few drinks or getting some food at some point during the evening, but the way she told us was quite rude.) Since it seemed that we had no other choice, she showed us to a table in the dining room and gave us a couple menus. When our waitress arrived, she explained that these particular menus were only for the bar or patio areas, and that we couldn't order from them. But, once I told her the owner gave them to us, she reluctantly obliged and allowed us to order, ya know, because we are trying to give them our money, I didn't think it would be a problem. Once we got settled at our table and ordered, it was pointless for us to join the dance lesson as it had already started and we wanted to get our money's worth (I know it's only $5, that wasn't the issue--it was merely the principle of participating in the entire lesson and since we had an awkward start to the whole experience, we didn't even want to bother at this point), so we just watched the other folks enjoying some fun dancing and good music. After we had gotten our food and were halfway through our meal, our waitress asked us if she could move us to another table....um WHAT? As we are finally beginning to somewhat enjoy ourselves, you want us to get up and move because you have a party of 5 that needs this table? I don't think so...but since you're already picking up my drink and my food I guess I'll follow you. She seats us elsewhere and doesn't come back for another 30 minutes. We danced for a little bit and joined in on some of the line dances to try and brighten our situation, but we couldn't get the sour taste out of our mouths. We decided after an hour of nonsense it was time to leave. Our waitress finally gave us the check; I needed change, and had to hunt down the owner to take care of it for us. She ended up chatting with some guests and seemed to forget that I needed change back. Our waitress finally came to our table and couldn't find our check. She estimated the total of our bill and just handed me my change out of her pocket (definitely didn't give me exact change, but at this point I was so over it.) With a smirk she said, "here," and walked away. I took all of my change and we got the heck out of there. So extremely disappointed in this joint and it's such a shame because the ambiance and decor are quite nice, as well as the spunky gal who was teaching the lessons--those are about the only two things that Handlebar J has going for them.Friends of ours invited us to join them for dinner and a night out dancing.  We have never been to Handlebar-J, but heard it was a Scottsdale institution, so we were excited to give it a try.For dinner, we ordered:Steak and Enchiladas, $12.75Sliders, $8.95CoorsI had the Steak & Enchiladas and they were very good.  It exceeded my expectations.  Even though it wasn't a premium cut of Beef, it was cooked perfectly and had good flavor.  The Enchiladas were out of this world...wow!  All I can say is wow!The Better Half had the Sliders and she was very happy with them.  The portion comes with 2 Sliders, which is perfect for her.After dinner, the music started to play.  We then got our groove on and danced to country & classic rock songs.  The bar also filled up and there was a nice crowd there.  We all had a blast and worked off the calories we ate.We heard they have country dance lessons on Wednesdays, so we'll be back.Return Factor - 90%

Is attention to detail important? Apparently not during my visit :(Waitress: would you like fruit?Me: noWaitress: sausage or bacon? Me: baconWaitress: what to drink?Me: coffeeWhat I got: fruit, sausage & during my entire visit NOTHING to drink. When I asked about my coffee I was told it was brewing. No one remembered anything about it again until it was time to put it on my check... seriously. I asked it be removed since I never got it and she just laughed and said, "oh, I'm so sorry about that". Really? Because she didn't seem like she was. Especially when it took her almost 10 more minutes to get me my corrected check. I won't be visiting again.

Review Text :
Arrivederci, a southern Italian enclave in the midst of a strip mall in the desert, can boast the rare designation of a dining choice that was not a compromise candidate between members of my family. Granted, I might have just been weak from the travel, but I was enthusiastic to satiate a hunger difficult to address in my homeland.I was not disappointed with what we found. An owner who greets patrons with "buena sera!" in a thoroughly non-corporate, warm, mood-lit setting is always a good sign. Many patrons who respond back in Italian and conduct themselves like they're at their second home are an even better sign, even if the restaurant was a bit empty.The true test, of course, is the food. No amount of show or neighborhood family feel could compensate for a massive kitchen deficiency. Fortunately, it wasn't required:- Bread: Uninteresting... except I could drink the accompanying pesto and oil mix.- Minestrone (~$5): The lowlight. A case of nothing ventured, nothing gained. Skip it.- Gnocchi in pink vodka sauce with salmon (~$19): Let's just say I was highly looking forward to the leftovers as two separate snacks. - "Choco"misu (~$7): Much hullabaloo is made about the addition of the ingredient, but it really just came off as above average tiramisu.- Cannoli (~$5): Always ridiculously unhealthy, but here it's made properly with ricotta and the texture is spot on enough to justify it.Arrivederci is an excellent "corner" restaurant in a land lacking a bit in both deviance and corners. More importantly, it clearly passes the "would survive in NJ as-is" test. There is nothing left to say.Lobster Ravioli... I saw yelpers' check in and read reviews. I came here to try for lobster ravioli.  I studied the entire menu but can't find lobster ravioli on lunch menu.... I picked my backup dish... I asked the server about the lobster ravioli and she said that is on dinner's special but since they have them ready, they can serve during lunch too!I started my lunch with caprese salad, which I split with my friend.  They were kind enough to separate the plate after I told her I wanted to split the salad.  I enjoyed the fresh taste of mozzarella cheese.I also liked the pesto served with bread.  Bread was freshly baked and went really well with homemade pesto sauce.  I never though of using pesto for bread, but they went well together.Lobster Ravioli.... pasta was very good and enjoyed generous portion of lobster. Unfortunately sauce was a bit salty for my liking.  I still ate all of them as pasta tasted good, so I asked for the second bread and ate the sauce separately with my bread.Excellent service. We both had bags with us, and the server brought extra chairs for our bags next to our table.  When we ordered espresso, she brought one at a time as she wanted to serve the coffee hot.  I saw chocomisu on the desert menu, I would like to come back to order chocomisu (their menu said only one in the US to serve chocomisu, to the best of their knowledge).

Review Text :
NOTE** The Yelp map location is wrong.  Weiss Deli is in the shopping center on the South East Corner of Sunset and Green Valley, NOT the North East Corner.After trying all the famous delis (Carnegie, Stage, Canter's, etc...) in the big Casinos and noticing they are all a shadow of the originals that I love, I set out to find a real deli in Las Vegas.  Delis are best when they are being run by deli people.  And that's the problem with the casinos.  They are being run by people that don't know the difference between deli mustard and Dijon.  I'm dead serious, I once had someone at the Carnegie argue with me that grey poupon was a brown deli mustard, and my only choices were yellow and Dijon.  If they pulled that at the original Carnegie in New York , there would be a riot.  So although it's a little off the beat and path from the strip, Weiss Deli is well worth the trip.  Only in business since 2006, Owner Michael Weiss is using his Grandma's recipes.  Which explains why Weiss' tastes like it's been around for 60 years.  As I always do when trying a new deli, I went with pastrami on rye.  This is the best pastrami you'll get in Las Vegas folks.  Sure the Carnegie is starting off with a great product, but I've had it tough, cold, and sometimes they get lucky and make it right.  But from the first bite of this sandwich, I knew they were serious about how to prepare pastrami.  It was piping hot, it was perfectly steamed, it had plenty of fat on it (which adds to the flavor).  Even though it was my only time eating here, I can almost guarantee it's great every time.  The guy cures his own pastrami, enough said.  The flavor was perfect and while I might prefer Langer's in LA just a little better, this is a good 2nd.  Every bite of that sandwich was a joy to eat.  Also we need to talk about one of the most impressive rye breads that I've ever seen.  Each slice of rye is about 8 inches high and 10 inches wide.  Freshly baked on site, I'd love to see a whole loaf of that rye.  It had a nice crunchy crust, but with a rye bread that large, even with a huge pile of meat in it, the crust was almost a picture frame surrounding the delicious soft seeded rye.  Served with National Deli Mustard, I can't wait to enjoy this sandwich again.  Also not to be missed was the side of potato salad (which I couldn't keep my wife from eating - I think I only had like 2 bites of it before she claimed it as her own).  It's almost like a mashed potato salad since the potatoes are so soft and mashed together with egg and mayo.  It reminded me of the flavor of the famous Rascal House Potato Salad, and that's the highest compliment I can pay it.The wife had "The Remington".  It was hot roast beef, melted swiss & cheddar jack, grilled onions, on grilled rye bread.  It was supposed to come with horseradish sauce, but she isn't a fan of that, so we went with a side of brown gravy to dip it in.  Excellent sandwich.  They messed up a little bit, since we ordered it open face (which is usually how it comes) but it was still good as a sandwich.  The roast beef was very tasty and their brown gravy outstanding.  Her side of french fries were pretty boring however, but so what, the sandwich is so large, you don't need them.  Each sandwich was served with a half a pickle and half a pickled tomato.  I wouldn't be surprised if they pickled them on site.I also tried a combo appetizer of chopped liver and white fish salad.  What a great idea to be able to get a scoop of each right next to each other.  I was surprised it was only served on a large lettuce leaf with a black olive and a pickle spear.  It wasn't brought by our waitress, so when I asked her where all the veggies were, she was shocked that they sent it out like that.  So she rounded up some tomato and red onion.  I'm used to carrots, and cucumber, maybe bell peppers as well.  The presentation wasn't very good, but since it got messed up, I'm not sure how it's supposed to look, or what's supposed to be on it.    I preferred the white fish salad to the chopped liver.  Excellent whitefish salad!  Not too salty, nice and smokey with plenty of mayo.  The chopped liver was just ok, but still better than most places.And last but not least, the prices.  Only $10.95 for a huge Pastrami Sandwich.  I was shocked.  For that quality and size, that's $15 anywhere else.  And if you get one at a deli on the strip, maybe it will be $20. (Of course it will have even more meat than Weiss, but you'll most likely be throwing half of it away which is a shanda).Went in for breakfast today and forgot to check in cuz I was so busy eating.Got 2 eggs scrambled with egg beaters and they also offer egg white only for .95 extra. With country fried potatoes seasoned and they are extra tasty.Also comes with any bagel and huge cup of cream cheese. All for 4.95 + .95 Then it's mandatory to get a small bowl of the absolute BEST chicken noodle soup on the planet ( just don't say that to your mom ) but it rocks!Service is pretty good but don't expect gourmet because it's a deli style place.Always a good experience here. Food is always very good.I remember when a couple of other businesses occupied this location that Weiss Deli is at so I was skeptical about if Weiss was like them or not. The reviews and delicious pictures on yelp got my to finally try this Jewish deli. It is tucked in the corner of a shopping center. They have a decent amount of tables and chairs outside if eating outdoors is your thing. Inside is clean, but the decor is dated. The booth I sat at had gashes in the seat. The inside isn't very big so I imagine trying to eat here on the weekend is a zoo. When you walk inside towards the left they have bagels & pastries for sale. I took a look but the case was empty and I was told by our server that they sell out quick in the mornings. They have a board when you enter that tells you what specials are going on that day.They have a section on the menu that says "not so hungry" for those feeling like they can't tackle a whole sandwich themselves. You get 1/2 of a sandwich (your choice from the sandwich station area on the menu) and your choice of either a cup of soup, fries, coleslaw,  potato salad or fresh fruit on the side. I decided to order this priced at $9.95 and I can assure you that you do need to be hungry unlike the menu claims because the portions are generous. I decided to try the "Chicken Noodle Soup" and it was the best I have e-v-e-r had in my life! It was hardly a cup like the menu suggests and was filling all by itself. I could just sip on the broth for days! The soup had a couple bagel chips on the side that had such a nice garlic flavor. For my sandwich I went with the "Roast Turkey" on challah bread. The 1/2 sandwich was so big that I had to cut it in half just to eat it. The bread was seriously delicious!  I could only eat a portion of my sandwich and took the rest home for later. My hubby ordered a "Pastrami Burger" priced at $9.95 that came with a side of fries. He said the pastrami had good flavor. I saw on the menu they offer catering. The next time I stop in I will be trying out something from their tasty looking breakfast menu. I would stop in when working on this side of town just to get some of the soup to-go!Very taste. Many corn beef. Such amaze. Reuben sandwich is much wow. Very customer service. Much nice. So experience. Such New York.So early close in 7:30. Wow.The End.I like this place for a once in awhile go to for homemade matzah ball soup! You can get it without noodles and just enjoy the goodness of soup. Probably best in town. They try to give you that deli feel we get back home but they don't put pickles on the table anymore and it's gotten further away from a NY deli thru the years. The sandwiches however are nice and thick loaded with fresh meats. The bakery section is quite small compared to others and the challah is better other places. But the food is good and enjoyable, if you get deli food, not a burger.... (Like someone at our table did....)The customer service has been variable the times we have been there and the cleanliness has varied too. Not sure if because of how long they have been there or what but hasn't been remodeled. Depending on when you go, you can be waiting awhile too as the place is quite small. I like this place and the local business but overall it's changed a lot thru the years!Oh my lord- East coast Jewish delis are amazing, and this place can holds its own with the best of them. As soon as I saw the menu here, I started (favorably) comparing it to Miller's on Polk Street in SF, where I first had matzo ball soup.The soup here, which we started with, is just as legit. And the portions are just as huge, too- the one pictured is a cup. It could easily be a lunch, and is served with a couple of tasty-ass bagel chips too. Rye flavor, natch.BF opted for one of the most expensive (and largest) sandwiches ever, the JR Boucher, which is a triple-layer with pastrami and liver. Yeah, that didn't sound tasty to me at all, and it's $18. But we got it, and it's frickin' delicious: all the components work so well together, they harmonize like a choir of angels. Oh and one sandwich is easily like three meals. We shared it and still had half for dinner.And, because I'm a total glutton and never on this side of town, I had to get my own dish, too. I got the Ceily's stack- latkes stuffed with brisket, topped with two types of cheese and brown gravy. It's even more amazing than it sounds, priced at $12, and is also easily split into thirds. Just finished my order for lunch today.With two heavy take-out boxes in hand, we rolled ourselves out the door... And promptly axed any plans of looking for a rental property in Henderson, because I don't want to weigh 400 pounds and if this place were nearby, that might be a serious possibility.I've been wanting to take the bf here for quite some time. I used to eat here all the time several years ago, but for whatever reason it had been a while since I'd been back.  Food is exactly as I remembered it. Actually better. At first I was planning to order the pastrami burger, then the open face turkey sandwich.... But thank goodness I kept looking, because I found the open face brisket with mashed & gravy and immediately remembered why I love this place. This is totally a cheat meal for me, but who cares when it is this delicious! The bf also had difficulty deciding on one thing. He kept going back & forth between the sandwiches named after famous people. He ended up getting the pastrami sandwich with Russian dressing & liver pate/mouse (not exactly sure but that's what it looked/tasted like to me. *He's asleep so I can't ask him. Anyway whatever it was, the sandwich was ginormous. Crazy big. When I took my obligatory I have to try everything bite... I actually had to first bite the bottom pastrami part them go back for a second bite of the list pate. After I took the bite... The bf said it didn't even look like I had taken a bite. Seriously the sandwich was big. He also ordered a black/white shake, and I love a place that has fresh brewed ice tea.  I know it's common... But  I consider iced tea to be a treat for myself so I'm always sad when the place has that fake soda iced tea nonsense. Our service was quick & friendly. It took us longer than normal (which is usually typical for us) to order, but our server was very good. And came back right as we had just decided. Kept our drinks refilled & brought us to go boxes without us having to ask.Also the French fries (served with his sandwich) were quite good. I liked dipping them in my gravy.A taste of the old country! I love Eastern European goodies & we've been coming here for years to have some classics like potato latkes, matzo ball soup, chicken noodle soup (like grandmas), cheese blintzes, challah French toast, potato  knish, fresh bagels, amazing omelette's with anything you want (my favorite is ham & swiss) and the home fries are amazing! The food is excellent. The ambiance is pretty basic & maybe one day they'll improve upon it but I can let that slide because the food reminds me of home. The service is always friendly & it's a very casual spot. They also have a deli area for fresh breads, bagels, cold cuts & sweets. This place is worth the drive across town for me :)SERIOUS DINERS ONLYOrdered from "Bradley Beach Legends" section the following:Overstuffed combination sandwiches are served on triple decker rye:Mickey Ansell:  beef tongue, chopped liver, roast beef, lettuce, onion and horseradish sauce and cole slaw side ... served in three portions, while one is plenty filling ... 5.75/5 stars ... not a chopped liver endeavor.Clary Silver:  pastrami, corned beef, Swiss cheese, cole slaw and Russian dressing and French fries (crisp side ... this is a meat lovers dream come true). 5.65/5 stars. Just like eating dry aged filet mignon. Our sandwiches looked larger than anyone else's simply for one reason. We were the smallest diners in the restaurant.I know I can eat here everyday, but then I would have to change my name from Momo to SumoA few months back, my fella wanted for me to try pastrami for the first time. We asked for suggestions, and while the great sandwich debate of 2015 ACTUALLY ended in a showdown about homemade/vs restaurant sandwiches, and someone getting mad that we don't subscribe to the "Get in the kitchen and make me a sammich" mentality...we DID get some good restaurant suggestions, and Weiss was one of them.We found ourselves on this side of town on Saturday, after a movie, and even though we had eaten a HUGE breakfast AND popcorn...we had to stop in.When I was younger, my mom used to make "Jewish Penicillin"...aka Matzoh ball soup. I saw that this was on the menu, and I almost died.  We ordered a whole pastrami on rye, and a SMALL cup of the chicken noodle with matzoh balls.  Holy generous portions, Batman.  For real, this sandwich was as big as my head.  Fella and I split it, and I STILL couldn't eat the whole thing.  Huge, heaping portions of flavorful pastrami and delicious rye bread...they offered standard yellow mustard, and whole grain mustard (of course I used whole grain). This sandwich was perfection.The soup made me cry.  It tasted JUST like my Uncle Sherwin's recipe that my mom used to make when I was younger.  I haven't had matzoh ball soup in probably 20 years.  It was amazing. Service was super polite.  I will DEFINITELY be going back to try some other offerings!

Review Text :
I had wanted to try Bangkok Orchid. Trying different Chinese restaurants has been one of my interests as of late. So, this past Tuesday I took a break from errands to make this my Birthday lunch.   Bangkok Orchid is in the Mountain Vista Shopping Center, a mall that has seen some better days, with the large hobby shop and shops between Barley's and Smiths vacant. When I stepped inside Bangkok Orchid at 3:30 pm on Tuesday, it was vacant of customers.   The nice woman who was my waitress offered me the table of my choice then presented me with the menu. From going on Yelp, I knew all the $5.95 lunch specials. I'd order the chicken chow mein combination with hot tea. The tea was so delicious that I drank the tea kettle worth. It was worth the $1.50 extra. The egg drop soup that was included tasted different from the style I am accustomed to. I am aware that this is mostly a Vietnamese restaurant.  The presentation of the chicken chow mein luncheon was different from the way that restaurants have served it. It was served on a large black tray style plate with salad, a bowl of duck sauce to compliment the egg roll on the bottom left, a scoop of rice on the top right, and on the bottom right were two slices of oranges. The chicken chow mein took center stage on the black tray. It featured bean sprouts, nice chunks of white chicken, cabbage, carrots, and broccoli. The food was good. I appreciated the nice presentation at the same time I would have enjoyed more of the entree over the salad and oranges.   Dining here was a laid back experience. It was quiet. The soundtrack was instrumental versions of the classics including "How Deep is your Love"  and "Love on the Rocks."   Overall Bangkok Orchid is a good restaurant. I could see a possible return check-in if I am leaving the close by  Ethal M Cactus Gardens on an empty stomach.

The IN and OUT of mexican food.Gotta love Fausto's specially their breakfast burrito. You get your money's worth. This thing is HUGE and will make you full all for $4. If ever your on a budget and your craving mexican food go to Fausto's. Their prices are pretty decent and I assure you, you will not be disappointed . I also recommend getting the taquito's and the chicken quesedillia.  And of course for your drink the Horchata. It will satisfy your thirst.The atmosphere:  I wouldnt count on this place being a fancy sit down. Like i said its good for take outs just a quick grab and go type place.Location: The location i went to was in henderson and really convenient.I would highly reccomend this place for people that just want to grab quick mexican food. Don't expect anything fancy.

Restaurant name  Pita Jungle

Review Text :
I tried Pita Jungle for the first time and I am deeply disappointed that I was not greeted with: "Welcome to the jungle."What a missed opportunity! Seriously!I found the food to be pretty OK, not outstanding.  I had the chicken schwarma (aka Mediterranean chicken wrap on the menu) and it was no schwarma from Al Hana at Biaz Market, my friend.The chicken was plentiful, and cubed. The lettuce was fresh and plentiful.  The sauce was some kind of garlicky-tahini-hummus tasting concoction that was fine.  The portion was just fair for the nearly 8 dollar price tag.My server Valerie was a real treat so I would rate the service as 4 star even though that doesn't seem to jive with other reviews.The best time to go to this Pita Jungle is happy hour (3-6).  Their happy hour menu was larger than I have seen at other locations.  A small plate of three different hummus? $1.  Two falafel balls?  $1.  Garlic chicken? $2.  Streamed mussels? $2.  Plus tons of other options...you could easily eat an entire meal there for just a couple of bucks.The service was fine when we went - not even the slightest delay - but it was also in between meal times and not crowded.  However, the strip mall itself was packed.  It is always packed.  The parking lot stresses me out.  So, go at your own risk, and don't bother trying to park close.Food.......4 StarsTakeout service...... 1 StarPita Jungle has tasty fresh food, it's just getting to it at this location is a consistent challenge. Ordering over the phone is easy- but when you get there to pick it up- it's a total joke. Only once out of the last seven times was the experience timely. Last week I went there and after standing near the bar for five minutes I was finally acknowledged. Here's a pro tip- don't say "I'll be right with you" and then disappear.  Oddly- they are worse here when it's slow, which you would expect to be the opposite. I hope they can get it together soon, it's unacceptable and the food and takeout service are incongruent.

Restaurant name  Buca di Beppo Italian Restaurant
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Buca Di Beppo is literally, italian restaurant hell. You know how all big box chain restaurants throw junk up on the walls in an attempt to make the space feel vintage? Buca Di Beppo throws junk, and knick knacks and statues and anything else 'italian' they could find in the chinese warehouse where they loaded up these goods. It's a terrible horrible mess and you end up sitting in a yardsale of italian paraphenalia while eating your very bland pasta.It's embarassing how truly flavorless the food is here. Thin, flavorless alfredo sauce. Thick slabs of lasagna with less taste than what I can get out of the frozen section at Publix. I went with a large group and across the table, bland food.When they seat your party, they guide you through the kitchen area where the cooks play along and say a welcoming hello. Deep down you know they hate this. Why are we in the kitchen? Sure it's nice, but I'd rather have them concentrating on making the food, and making it good. Of course, the food at Buca Di Beppo seems to be far beyond any point of return to tasting good. It's just dead. Dead food. No life, no flavor, not emotion. I get more flavor from the $.99 Michelina's frozen lunch package.Far from claiming anything authentic Italian, Buca Di Beppo even pumps out bread with no taste. Eating at Buca is like eating food from an assisted living facility. No salt, no sugar, no butter, no fat, it's all gone along with anything resembling taste. Sure, Buca has huge portions, and the setup is nice for large parties and families - but they might as well just buy the family-size pasta packs from the frozen section and bake it at home, even that would be better, and they wouldn't have to the mandatory gratuity. Say what you will about other italian chains like Macaroni Grill, or Olive Garden - at least their food taste like something.Reviews are all over the scale for this demi-Italian joint, but my experience here puts it on my Mediocre List.Remember Leftover Night as a kid?  You'd ask your mom what's for dinner and she'd open the fridge and say, "Whatever you want -- we have spaghetti, salad, bread, there's a piece of fish, and some kind of meat.  Go to town."Buca is kind of like that.  The selection and portion sizes available to you are just wierd.  Plain and simple, I like getting what I want, not choosing from among the things that THEY want me to have.  I know all places have their menu's, but any illusion of getting something the way you want it is gone at Buca.That makes me change my mind.  Buca is more like "Leftover Night" at a friend's house, choosing from among that other mom's dishes, which while familiar to you, were prepared in a way that just "isn't like my mom makes it".The food is pretty good: hovering around average, but hearty.The service is the standard fake-friendly.  I can't be sure if the extra touch of douchebag that our server exhibited was a personal trait or something they train.The restaurant itself is oh so very annoying, with enough distracting wall decorations to paralyze a hard ADD case.  The layout is a bunch of ridiculous rooms, with doorways and stairways like a maze, and they march you through the kitchen to get to your seats -- an obnoxious bit of pretention that should be saved for an establishment that deserves it.

Review Text :
After reading fellow Yelpers praise this long-time pizza-making fixture in Henderson, I decided to give it a shot--which is a big deal for me, because to cut down on cholesterol, I generally limit my pizza eating to a pie every two months.  So, the pizza must be very good, or I will waste 1/6 of my annual allotment on an inferior product.  And, that I do not ever want to do.  So, you will never find me ordering pizza from a national chain.I was quite pleased with Enzo's pizza.  The whole dining experience did not knock it out of the park, but I found the pizza I sampled by and large to be excellent.  The interior of Enzo's is not really pretty, but it has functional, comfortable booths.  My foursome ordered Garlic Knots first.  The knots that arrived were hot and oily but contained very little taste of garlic.  The dough was tasty, but I believe Garlic Knots should feature garlic.  A small Iceberg Lettuce Dinner Salad, with Italian dressing, that included a few hard carrot chunks, cucumbers, and tomato slices, was tasty but fairly ordinary.Now it was time for the pizza!  I did not scrimp on ingredients or size, ordering entirely for myself a 16", four-topping Pizza Napolitana beauty.  My choices of toppings this night were sausage, pepperoni, mushrooms, and cooked sliced tomatoes.  The table groaned under the weight of this pie that somehow was fitted beside another all-cheese 16-incher for our friends, and a third 16" pie that sported sausage, ham, and extra cheese for Diane.  Besides their large pie, my friends also ordered Chicken Fingers.  We were a serious group of diners, intent on eating!  And, to my own shock, I ate three Garlic Knots and my whole 16" pizza in one sitting.  There were no leftovers for me.As for the pizza, the crust was perfect.  It was thin but not too thin, and did not resemble the cracker bread variety found in Italy.  The pizza slices were just saucy and cheesy enough; unusual crumbly mild sausage tasted good; and I found that the unusual-looking disks of mild pepperoni got along famously with my taste buds.  Pizza slices folded somewhat in the hand as is desirable.  I didn't mind that more sausage congregated in the center of the pie, so that the tips of slices were denser in sausage than other parts; I just moved some of the sausage over by hand.  I was prepared for this, because one Yelp reviewer had said that a trademark of Mr. Enzo, who was the pizza maker this night, was unevenly spread toppings, and advised to just accept it.  So, I did.  The only thing a bit displeasing was that a few cooked tomato slices on my pizza were orange rather than red.You would think that we ate enough.  But we were not through yet!  How is a meal complete without a fine dessert?  And, Enzo's had them available--in spades.  Diane and I enjoyed a Manhattan: merged Vanilla and Chocolate Ice Creams highlighted with chopped almonds and a cherry center, and dipped in a hard coating of dark chocolate, with some Chocolate Sauce ladled over that.  C'mon!  How could we pass this up?  The sweet concoction was decadent and luscious, and its taste a contrast of excellent creamy ice creams and delicious flaking sections of hard chocolate melded together with superior Chocolate Sauce having the thickness of hot fudge.My dining companions and I made this pizza night count!It sounds like the food here is spectacular and I wish I'd have been able to try it. Unfortunately, I'm not cool with being pointedly ignored when I walk in somewhere and say hello to the person behind the counter. Long story short I walked in, was ignored. Went to counter, was ignored. Got order taken, tried to use a coupon, the lady said "No." "I can't use it?" "No." Oh. Alright.I was ordering the daily special and wanted to use an Entertainment coupon. I'd have understood if she had been really nice and just let me know that she would be losing money on a coupon. Then I'd have pocketed the coupon and went about with the order. I just don't like being treated like a stupid jerk. I get ignored and given attitude like this when I wear a name badge, I don't need it when I enter an establishment to spend money. So I told her I'd just go somewhere else and she shrugged.No big loss for either of us, I suppose!I recently enjoyed two meals at Enzo's.  On the first occasion only Enzo and I were present after I asked at the door at 9:10 p.m. what time the restaurant closed and was told, "Ten minutes ago.  But come on in and I'll take care of you."  The second was for pizza with Diane and friends just a few days ago.On the first visit, after a Dinner Salad with Italian Dressing I enjoyed some complimentary Garlic Knots (since otherwise they would have been thrown out) and a filling meal of Sausage & Peppers.  Chef-owner Enzo does not scrimp on portions, and I had an ample amount of sausage lengths to devour, along with both Green and Red Peppers nicely enfolded together in a tasty Pomodoro Sauce.On the second stop, the Garlic Knots were big, freshly made, and chewy.  Another Dinner Salad with Italian Dressing, greens, and a few pieces of tomato and carrot was nothing special but a serviceable beginning.  The pizza, however, was sublime.  A great thin-crust Neapolitan pizza with supple dough, plenty of sauce and melted cheese, and this time five ingredients: tomato, mushroom, sausage, pepperoni, and cashews.  The cashews were brought in by Diane, and Enzo graciously accommodated our request to add them as a topping on our 16-inchers.  Our friends split an 18-inch pizza, so pizza was omnipresent on our table top.  The pizza was delicious, even though the sausage packed a spice that lingered in the mouth for awhile.  To offset the sausage's kick, the pepperoni was mild.Service was very good; our waiter somehow remembered me from a single stop over 3 years ago.  The ambiance inside our dining room was casual, and our booth seating was quite  comfortable.  Food came out quickly, too, even though the place was humming with several diners in our midst.4-1.2 stars overall for the Sausage & Peppers, Garlic Knots, and fine pizza!

Review Text :
My rating is based on this first review... not on the second.On my first visit to Z Tejas, I went at lunchtime with 2 guys from Boeing.  We had to sit at the bar since the restaurant was so crowded.  As I scanned the menu, the Grilled Green Chile Pork Enchiladas with green chile sauce and a tomato-avocado chopped salad caught my eye... and I'm glad it did.I dont necessarily consider myself an 'enchilada' type of guy, but this dish provided me with the best I've ever tasted.  I recommend this dish, with no reservations.Now for my second review.My boss and I headed to Z Tejas today.  I figured that I'd mix it up and try something new.  Bad choice.I was feeling a bit famished, so I ordered the more expensive menu item, which was Jack's Five-Cheese Macaroni Achiote.  The grilled chicken with bleu, Jack, cheddar, parmesan and romano cheeses and bacon gratin sounded like a complete winner.Where to begin?The dish incorporates real cheese, which I would normally find appetizing.  However, in this case, the entree was served piping hot, causing the cheese to string everywhere.  Kind of messy for a lunchtime meal.  So, I ate slow, in hopes that the threadlike curd would solidify some.  Well, it did, but it also left, what can only be depicted as an oily scramble, in the bottom of the bowl, due to separation.  Delectable!Well, I decided to ease up on the 'roni, and move on to the chicken, which was served with skin on.  Visually, the skin looked crispy... but I realized my peepers were punked when I chewed up on some rubbery epidermis.Swoop Says: skip the mac 'n cheeze, go for the whole enchilada!In other news, the server at the bar was top notch.  She refilled my palmer again and again, until my bladder shouted: 'Uncle!'.  When you need some pampering, saddle up to the bar.BIRTHDAY BONUS: Signup for their birthday club and get an annual $10 coupon in your email.~Swoop

Review Text :
Among the many nuances of American culture that I have yet to grasp is the fucking obsession with crab puffs.With the way people chomp at the bit for cream cheese and imitation crab you'd think it cured herpes (oh, btw, if you're reading this, I tested negative, so yay!).Like pringles and ritalin on a day "you really need to concentrate", people can't seem to pop just one. What initially appears to be [insert Chinese eatery]'s attempt at offering you a robust and well-rounded combo becomes a cruel and vicious taunt. Yeah, looks like you're getting a bag of those to go, champ. So much for your "Ethnic food is healthier than McDonald's" approach to dieting.Some people are willing to endure some pretty tedious inconveniences in the name of these morsels. Clarice W and I once waited for 25-30 minutes after our meal was finished for an order of puffs at Hope Kee, our brilliant plan to eat lunch at a supermarket and spare ourselves the lunch crowd thwarted by hordes of crab-craving take-out customers.Last week, my boss suggested we order lunch from Chung Ming, because, according to the coupon, if your order was over 15 dollars you got a free order of crab puffs.Three people ordering lunch barely put us at the 12 dollar mark.Let's get soup. No, fried wontons. No, bbq pork ribs.I got it. Let's get an order of crab puffs, so we'll get TWO orders of crab puffs.Yo dawg. I heard you like crab puffs so we put crab puffs in your bag of crab puffs so you can eat crab puffs while you eat crab puffs. The real zinger in this story is that the crab puffs at CM kinda suck.They aren't bad, but compared to the sweet tangy-ness of their orange/lemon chicken or the robust spice of their kung pao or their eggrolls that would make Chipotle blush, a gloop of cheese and crab doesn't really cut the wasabi.Still, it's a staple of Americanized Chinese cuisine and is helpful in getting your order to the right total cost so you don't have to pay a "delivery fee". So, come because the crab puffs lured you in, but for the love of Eris find a different reason to stay. Your nutritionist (i.e. bf/gf who took a nutrition class in college) will thank you.

Review Text :
In exchange for watching our little one, my in-laws proposed that we meet up at Crackers & Co to make the switch. A new breakfast place AND we get a date day? I'm game!When we first arrived, I was a little skeptical. The Cafe is located in a little strip mall behind the Home Depot, right next to a cabinet place. But, I'm learning to be adventurous, so I decided to not judge this place by its surroundings. Wise decision!We showed up during what I thought would be prime brunch time on a Sunday morning. Surprisingly, there was absolutely no wait. We were ushered to our table by the hostess, where we were greeted by, arguably, the most cheerful, interactive, and helpful waitress I've ever encountered. Thank you, Luana.We looked over the menu for a few minutes, it didn't really take us long to figure out what we wanted. My daughter got the kids pancakes, and my wife and I each ordered the Healthy Scram.  For the so called "kids" portion of pancakes, my daughter received three full grown pancakes. Of course, she couldn't finish them. If she had, I imagine she would have been in a coma for the next two days.As for my wife's and my meal...absolutely delicious. We each opted to have two extra egg whites scrambled in with our orders. Essentially, it ends up being an oversized egg white omelette. Couple that with a cup of fresh fruit and a dry English muffin, and you've got yourself an amazingly healthy and filling breakfast/brunch/dinner... whenever you decide to eat it, I assure you, it will be delicious.The three of us ended up spending about $40 for our meals. The price is a little bit inflated, though, as it does cost $1.00 extra per egg white added to our omelettes. But, whatever. you pay for what you get...and we got an awesome meal!If you're looking for a cozy breakfast place with a great menu with healthy options, awesome atmosphere, a patio, and (in our case), the greatest service we've experienced in QUITE some time, then you should definitely stop by!

Review Text :
I am removing my good rating. The kind of service I received this last time was OUTRAGEOUS!! We decided to order delivery this time. Locating a complete menu online was a HUGE pain. We knew they had combo plates though and knew that's what we wanted. My husband searched for at least thirty minutes for a menu listing the combos. When I was finally ready to call I couldn't understand what the lady said at first. So I responded that I wanted to place an order for delivery. She asked me what I wanted. I told her a number one and a number eighteen. The lady asked me "what?" so I repeated. Then she, clear as day, asked "what is that?" I responded the number one, it's the chicken and broccoli combo. Then the number eighteen the spicy honey shrimp. Then she asked me my cross streets, THREE TIMES! The third time I even asked her if she was listening that I had already told her twice. After that we discussed phone numbers and addresses. Then she asks if I want to pay by cash or card. I said card so she asked me for the card number. Worried she might have messed up the order I ask to know the total first. She told me it was $21. The number 1 is about $8 and the 18 about $10 so I thought that seemed right with taxes. I said ok and prepared to give her the card info and she hung up on me. I was angry by that point. She refused to listen the whole time and then hung up. So my husband called back and told them we needed to pay. She argued that I said I wanted to pay cash. He said "no she said card." THREE times she repeated him saying "oh you want to pay cash" and he had to yell to stop her from hanging up again before he could get her to understand we were paying by card. ONE HOUR later the food shows up and it's WRONG. Not combos at all but just the two meat dishes. So I called back AGAIN. I told her we ordered combos and they weren't  combos. She told me she repeated the order to me twice and I confirmed. She did not repeat the order even once! She proceeded to call me a liar and hung up!!So I took the food back to their shop. I told her I wanted my money back. She said why, I  told her it was because it was wrong and she has poor customer service. She then called me a liar and told me how I was trouble, to get out and never come back. I told her I wasn't going anywhere until I had my money back. She then told me she already voided it. Who's the liar now? She didn't want to give me a refund when I walked in. The delivery guy was visibly shocked when he heard her refuse to refund me. Then she says she already did it? BS. I told her I didn't believe her and I wanted proof. I argued in full view of all the customers for over fifteen minutes. She told me I was a liar over twenty times. Then it turns out she's not even the lady I was talking to on the phone! All of a sudden it slips out someone else does the phone. She's not even really 100% sure what was said! This was the business owner! And the business owner was the lady I talked to when I called about our missing food! The business owner lied about repeating the order to me twice on the phone. And the business owner is the one who called me a liar and hung up on me. She told me she's never had a problem in ten years and I was trouble and a liar over and over. Finally she printed me a receipt saying she had voided our transaction. As I walked out the door she was SCREAMING "You are a liar! Don't come back!"This lady is insane!! She has an elderly Asian woman answering the phones instead of someone more fluent in English. But if there is a mistake it's all the customer's fault. This only happened tonight so I will have to wait and see if we really are reimbursed for our food!! If we aren't I will be reporting then to the BBB.

I agree with the reviewer who said "no value at all." That statement pretty much sums up the food at this restaurant. I wanted to like this place. I thought the decor was very cute with a southwestern theme throughout. It felt cozy and quaint. The decor earns the one star. Our server was pleasant, but once bringing over our food didn't really ever come back to check if everything was ok. The food was average at best. The prices were ridiculous. My carnitas "platter" was $16.99 and it was a handful of meat, a tablespoon scoop of guacamole, a tablespoon of sour cream, some tasteless beans and rice. The pork was not dry, but it was very flavorless. And being limited on guac, sour cream or any type of sauce to add for flavoring due to the server never coming back around to check on us, my plate was left half eaten. While still a solid amount of food on my plate, another female server comes from behind and asks if I am done. I say yeah, probably....does she offer a box for three quarters of my meal? Nope. I, in nicest way possible, reclaim my plate and ask her for a box. She trots off and drops one off at our table.Boyfriend had a "macho burrito" which was $14.99...pretty standard, average burrito - in portion and taste. We didn't bother waiting for someone to come by to ask for another box, so we just piled it up in mine.We ordered a strawberry margarita to share..it was ok tasting..they of course use low quality tequila like cuervo in it, but the price was $11.99!A simple bean and cheese burrito was $10.99. Beans and cheese and a tortilla...$11 bucks.  They need to truly re evaluate their prices or really improve on their food if they plan on sticking around.

It's a shame I haven't eaten here in a while because the food is great!  It's a quaint cafe with excellent pizza and sandwiches. The interior is cozy with old album covers on the walls and the servers are super friendly.  They also have outdoor seating available.  It  can get crowded at lunch time so plan ahead.If you are in the area I highly recommend you trying it.~~~sticker shock~~~Three of us ate here and we all really enjoyed our sandwiches...in fact they were darn good!                                     ~~~sticker shock~~~We passed the sandwiches around and shared so we could all try each others.  The prime rib was very good (no sticker shock for a prime rib sandwich), the club was very good and the patty melt was very good.                                    ~~~sticker shock~~~The bread was very good and all the ingredients were high quality.                                   ~~~sticker shock~~~A soda is nearly $2.50 and we got nickeled and dimed a bit...leading to us trying to figure out how 3 sandwiches and 2 sodas came to nearly $40 bucks!~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~sticker shock~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~I have driven by Flancer's so many times and said "I need to try that place" to myself every time I do.  Well the time finally came!  My friend Robyn N. had a Groupon and invited me to luch. For some reason I was thinking it was a tad more upscale than it actually is but that's not a bad thing.  I only really say the front half of the restaurant because we were seated just inside the door. It's sort of a divey little place with the kitchen visable as you walk in. It could be a little cleaner for my taste. Don't get me wrong, we didn't stick to the table or the seats but I then I grew up with a mom who was a little OCD and our kitchen floor was so clean you could eat off of it.  The service was fast and friendly.  We had the goat cheese bruscheta and it was yummy!!!  There were 5 good size slices.  That was pleanty to share.  For lunch I tried the cheesesteak.  Oh so good!!  The bread was so fresh and yummy and the cheesesteak had great flavor.  The cheese was nicely melted and the meat was tender.  I also had sweet potato fries that were a lovely crispy treat!  Will I go back....you bet!  I won't be so apt to drive right by now.

Come on folks! How can you go wrong with affordable, healthy and quick! Oh and let's not forget to mention their addicting teriyaki sauce and low-fat egg rolls! This is a healthy fast-food shop and one that I would frequent much more if it was closer to my hood. But, I will say that it's worth the drive in my eyes because it's not everyday that you can find healthy food that fills you up and tastes unhealthy. It's a win win situation! Get the chicken teriyaki bowl with spicy teriyaki sauce and brown rice and make it a meal because those egg rolls are tasty!

Review Text :
Ninja has become, as of May 2012, the frequent haunt of my fiancé and I, and I probably should have posted this review looooong before now. However, I've also now experienced Ninja on pretty much every kind of night, so hopefully I'll be able to write a better overall review. Or at least a longer one. haha!To begin, my fiancé and I are drawn back again and again not only by the delicious offerings on their AYCE sushi menu (which they have recently updated to include a few more options), but also by the incredibly welcoming and always-helpful chefs and wait-staff. We now know everyone who works there by name, and I'm excited to go back to Ninja on our sushi nights not only because it's freaking yummy but because I'm excited to see everyone again!I'm actually very confused by all the negative reviews for Ninja on this site. I'm not going to deny that it gets incredibly busy on Friday (and some Saturday) nights lately, most likely due to the sale of an incredible number of Groupons, and that service slows down as a consequence. That IS a fact. However, the people that work here are hardly at fault for the fact that the majority of their customer traffic is concentrated on one or two nights per week. :P The last few Fridays, every single table in the place has been filled up at dinner time, with more and more people lining up at the door, and there are so many sushi menus stretched across the LOOOONG sushi bar that, once spread out, they need to be layered if they're gonna fit. Yes, it gets crazy, but the servers and the chefs really are working as fast as they can. Conversely, on week nights, the place is DEAD. As an additional note, my fiancé and I bring our own chopsticks when we come, and this is the first place where our waitress has ever washed them for us!oh, and another warning to keep in mind: sometimes the music does get a bit loud. However, if you express displeasure to a server, they're always prompt and ready to turn down the volume. My impression has always been that they honestly care about their customers, and they truly want them to be happy and comfortable.I've eaten a LOT of sushi in my time, and my fella and I have prowled loads of establishments in the Phoenix area, in Tucson, and in Washington state, and Ninja honestly reigns supreme. We've loved a couple enough to become regulars, but we honestly don't care to go anywhere but Ninja anymore. Tried polyamory and failed. Oh Ninja, you make an honest woman out of me. On the topic of the food, nigiri is my personal weakness, and the nigiri here at Ninja is exceptional. The amount of rice that they use is quite conservative, with a proportionally generous slice of melt-in-your-mouth sashimi on top. Further, the pieces are quite dainty compared to what I've been served elsewhere, which makes eating them a much more pleasant experience. And their albacore... They serve their albacore like I've never had it before, topped with minced garlic, scallions, and a light drizzle of ponzu sauce. It's absolutely spectacular, and you MUST order it if you go.As for maki, if you like spicy or fried, my fiancé swears by the calamari tempura roll. According to him, the spicy sauce is an amazing complement to the overall flavour, and MUCH better than the stuff we've been served at other restaurants. As for myself, my personal favourites are the rainbow roll and the alaskan roll (the latter is one that has been recently added to the AYCE menu, and is basically a california roll topped with salmon, masago, scallions, and ponzu). I personally order it sans masago. Speaking of ordering things special, the chefs and wait staff have always been incredibly accommodating when it comes to removing certain ingredients from the rolls. To cite an extreme example, I really enjoy salmon and avocado rolls, but there is unfortunately no such roll offered at Ninja. However, those ARE the ingredients in a Philly roll if you remove the cream cheese, so that's just what I do. It's a little ridiculous because a Philly roll gets its name from the cream cheese, but it doesn't matter: the staff at Ninja are happy to bend the laws of the universe for my sake, and I get my Philly roll without the Philly whenever I go. ;)We've brought scads of friends with us to dinner here, and everyone becomes an instant convert and starts bringing THEIR family and THEIR friends. Sure, I might be a bit biased in their favour, but I'm biased for a reason: they've earned my loyalty, over and over again. And besides that, AYCE sushi for $20 is a flipping AMAZING deal -- especially when you consider the quality that Ninja delivers. You don't have to sacrifice quality for quantity in this case.Can you see why I'm surprised that so many people have had unhappy experiences at Ninja? I really don't get it.Its funny how all-you-can-eat Sushi can sound so amazing when you just hiked 6 miles and are completely starving. 20 sashimis later, your perspective starts to change a bit.The main problem with Ninja isn't its sushi, its people's expectation of the sushi. Price is a key setter of expectations, so if you are paying $19.99 for all the sushi (AND sashimi) your hungry little stomach can provide, maybe you shouldn't be expecting the fish to taste like it just got sliced off the coast of japan by Shiro himself.That being said, 3 stars is an evening of satisfaction without completely flipping about the amazingness of the food. The price/food ratio is amazing, the service is good and the food itself is very decent. I was not fond of the volcano rolls but my friends swear by it. The classic philly, salmon and spicy tuna rolls were prepared well and some of their more inventive rolls (like the spicy New Mexico) were interesting and worth trying. My favorite part about all-you-can-eat at Ninja is when the server starts coming around to see if we want to order more... smiling hard because she can obviously see in our faces the look of defeat and gluttony. As we stare at the leftover rolls on the plate, we become incredibly strategic about our every move. "Okay man, you eat that one, I will eat this one over here and he can have those 2 because he ate less overall." "No man, I can't do the spicy one. I will trade you if I can poke the cucumber out" "Fine. Deal" *Gulp*. Ah, all done.You're the salmon to my sticky rice."You" as in the reader... not Ninja Japanese Restaurant.  Not gonna sugar-coat it, at first glance, this place looks seedy.  It's cluttered with neon lights, chinzy paper lanterns, and your typical Japanese decor like fans and umbrellas.  The ceiling is painted pink so everything that's served looks as suspect as the establishment itself.  Service is lacking and they badly need more servers and bussers.  I saw one waitress clear out a lone patron's spot at the sushi bar when he went to the bathroom but was still eating.  How rude.What can I say about the food?  The fish for sashimi and nigiri are sliced uneven and thin and the salmon skin hand roll looks like taco meat yet smells fishy.  I did like the Hipster Roll and the Shake-and-Bake seemed interesting until the over-powering garlic got to be too much.  I also found the color on the salmon nigiri to be startling.  Remember how I mentioned the pink ceilings casting a weird pink light to everything?  If it wasn't for the lights, I could almost swear that the salmon had no color to it.  The wait time for food is ridiculously long and the rolls are a bit small.What more can I say?  I don't think I'll be back.

After attending a meeting tonight nine of us went to the Golden Dragon for dinner. They serve  "American Chinese food". Everyone got something different and everyone agreed the food here was outstanding. Here is my take on this place....I always start my meal with the soup. If the soup is  is good usually the food is good as well. Tonight was no exception. The Wor Wonton soup was excellent!   In addition to my soup I got a vegetable dish. The sauce on it was superb. Everyone commented how their entrée had good flavors, was served hot and the ingredients used seemed fresh. No one was disappointed with what they got.     prepared perfectly. The food here is great and while it isn't 100% authentic it's very filling, not expensive, had large portions, was served fast and every dish was delicious. I can't emphasize enough how inexpensive it is! ************************* What does my OVERALL rating mean?*************************5 stars -Highly recommended.  I would be willing to drive out of my way to this business. It is that good. This place represents their industry or cuisine very well! 4 stars - Highly Recommended. I would frequent this business. 3 stars - Not that good but not that bad. Just average. I wouldn't mind going again if a friend or family member wanted to go. 2 stars - I would not recommend this establishment to friends or family. 1 stars - DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND DO NOT patronize this business. I would RUN AWAY from this place and you should too! DON'T WAST YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY AT THIS ESTABLISHMENT!

Mad props to Kyklos for giving me healthy and delicious mall food. They are my current crush. I am not a huge fan of the Galleria for several reasons starting with the temperature and the lighting. It's always way too warm and bright for my comfort level leaving me irritable and sweaty and hungry. Ugh. But, now there's hope in the form of a gyro. Kyklos had me at the picture menu and the enormous slice of  homemade Baklava on the counter. It's nothing new or revolutionary, but they serve all of my favorite, authentic Greek grub with quality ingredients. We ordered the chicken gyro with the yogurt sauce on the side, Greek salad with the dressing on the side, and chicken with rice with extra vegetables. Simply scrumdiddlyumptious! The homemade vinaigrette and the moist chicken made me fall in love. Every single item was full of flavor and cooked to perfection restoring my faith in mall food in general. Kyklos belongs in the Fashion Show Mall or Fashion Island in Cali. The food is above average and the service is pimp. How refreshing to not have a high, teeny bopper with braces and skinny jeans carelessly taking my order. At Kyklos they care and it shows. Lastly it is clean. I am always scared to eat in the food courts because without fail the food spots constantly get Health Department demerits. While we were ordering and eating I noticed the staff cleaning. Boom. This meal is part of what made yesterday magical to me and I already want more! The Golden Arches and all the other processed food choices at the mall can suck it. I'm all about the Golden Gyro!This is my "go-to" fast food. It is sooooo YUMMY! It is located in the food court at the Galleria mall.....I know...but don't let the screaming kids and crowds of people stop you for going there for your next meal! The food is amazing!This placed is owned by a group of brothers. The food is authentic and everything is homemade...including their baklava and tomato sauce. They will usually give you a sample of whatever they are currently grilling while you choose your meal.We always get either the gyro plate or a plain gyro. The food is so fresh and flavorful. I like mine with crisp, ripe tomatoes and yogurt. The pita bread is warm and chewy and holds the rice and homemade tomato sauce just perfect. HEAVEN. They are a bit on the pricey end. We usually spend almost $25 for two of us....a bit expensive for mall food....but it is still worth it. You get what you pay for. HINT: They have recently posted a groupon TWICE so keep your eyes out. We always buy the max each time. Yeah, that is how we roll!When it comes to mall food I am officially a GREEK geek....with baklava on the side yo!

Review Text :
Oh my god... I used to hate Chipotle. HATE! Hate. When asked why, I said, "Because they offer rice burritos to vegetarians." I thought the burritos were 90 percent rice, 10 percent goodness, even when I asked for light rice. I was, as it turns out, save-ably stupid. Because redemption is mine every time I eat here. They get it. They "Get It" get it. They GET IT with a capital GET IT. Oh, I shall explain. Worry ye not... I want the world to stop eating meat. In fact, it is my destiny, my very purpose, to rid the world of Fear (i.e., meat). It's true, all you're eating when you're eating meat is fear. 98 percent of you will have no idea what I mean when I say that but I can promise you it's true. But I don't want Chipotle to stop serving meat because people like you would stop going there and it'd go out of business and I would die because there would be nothing left for me to eat, because lately, it's all I eat. Yes. I ate twice today. Both times, Chipotle. If I lose weight, I'll become the next Jared. Gain. Ignominy. Whatevs...It's delicious.So here's what they get: The freshest ingredients.The meat, if you care, is straight up not injected with growth hormones or bull shit. Portions are huge. Almost too big. But the technology OOOOOHHHHHHH the technology! Like Chuck R said... YOU CAN ORDER ON YOUR iPhone! It's ridiculous.And our office orders as an office. ONLINE! Individually! Again, ridiculous! We can order exactly what we want, pay separately. The orders are prepared with love. They'll bring it out to your car. They'll even occasionally call you to make sure everything was amazing. It was! It always is. I love you. Smooch.Chipotle is the best business model of the 21st Century, and this location wholly embodies the Chipotle perfection.Chipotle uses naturally raised meats, hormone free dairy, no eggs or nuts, organic beans, seasonal produce, and promote recycling within the restaurants. This means that they care what you are putting into your body and what it is doing to the environment!! (score!)Their simple menu makes ordering easy, but still allows you variety (Burrito, Salad, Tacos, Bowls) and caters to a carnivore, vegetarian, or vegan. In fact, they are pretty "food-allergy" safe in general. (Believe me, I have experience)As if the food wasn't enough, they have two amazing ordering systems: Iphone App and Online Ordering. Let's talk about this online ordering system here for a minute, because it is what I think really sets the bar high for their competitors and other restaurants in general:I run a medium sized business and when lunch comes around, my Operations staff of ten has the WORST time executing something as simple as a lunch order. I know this sounds ridiculous, but believe me, it is as true as the day is long. This all changed when I discovered Chipotle Online Ordering. Anyway, I go online, login, and tell the system I want a group order. It then emails each of my employees giving them a link to order or a link to decline. If they choose to order, the link takes them right to an online order page with pictures, places for memos, etc. They select exactly what they want and it gets added to our group order.Once everyone has ordered, I hit submit, pay by credit card, and fifteen minutes later you arrive at Chipotle, give them a jingle, and they will actually bring the food right out to your car for you. They call this the "valet" service. Perfect if you can't find a spot or it is raining out!!Chipotle Executives must have sat down and thought of every pain a company could have in ordering lunch because I honestly cannot think of one thing that would improve this process. (Well, delivery would be nice... but that is what I have a receptionist for)I want to take a second to recognize this particular location, on 54th Street. Let me start by saying, I believe that you can taste the love in food... as in, if someone is cranky as shit, making your food, it is not as good as if they are smiling, enjoying their lives. I know this probably sounds crazy, but I swear on my right hand it is true. EVERY time I have ever eaten here (we are talking dozens of times) my food has been fabulous! I can taste the LOVE! Oh, and about two hours after pickup, someone calls to ask how everything was and to let you know that they took special care to pack it up and make sure everything was right. If there is a Best Chipotle award, this location deserves it!My final note: I get the salad with black beans, rice, tomato salsa, green tomatillo salsa, and guacamole. 100% vegan, 100% delicious. Under 500 calories, 17g of fat, and 14g of protein. And I am full. REAL full. Since I have started eating Chipotle 3-4 times a week, I have actually started losing weight. Perhaps I will be the next Jared!Eh, the food is okay.  I really like their carnitas and their cilantro lime rice.  The black beans were pretty damn flavorless though.  I think for what you get it's a bit too pricey.  About a buck and a half too much in fact.And for God's sake, why the hell does every Chipotle have to be so deafening??  Did the architect that designed Chipotle not consider acoustics when they designed the place?  My lunch was fine when I started eating at 11 AM, but by the time I was leaving and the lunch crowd had filtered in, the din of noise was like being verbally assaulted while underneath a tin pail in a hail storm.  There are no noise baffles anywhere and the corrugated tin walls and booths and concrete floors make the place uncomfortably loud.    This is not the first time I have noticed this in a Chipotle location either.  They are all like this. Decent, if over-priced, food in an awful setting.

3 Stars for the food, 5 Stars for the unique experience.....I stopped by this McDonald's location for a quick lunch one day and ordered 2 Double Cheeseburgers and Large Fries.  While I was waiting for my food, someone told me about a free car show they host in the parking lot every Saturday night.My food was ready and I had a decent lunch.  It's McDonalds, so my expectations are pretty low.  Not bad for a quick meal.I then returned the next Saturday night to check out the car show.....it was pretty cool!  There are probably close to 100 cars here....everything from old classics (Chevy's, Corvettes, Camaros, Mustangs) to newer rice rockets (Acuras, Hondas, Toyotas) to exotics (Ferrari's, Lambos).  I was amazed!  Best part....it's FREE!By the way.....the McDonalds was packed and making tons of money.....great idea!Return Factor - 100% (the Car show was a lot of fun, will definitely be back)This McDonald's venue is about as great as McDonald's can get.  The food is consistently quality, hot and yummy.I have eaten many a breakfast here and nurtured my coffee in the bar high to seating they have out front.  Their staff knows how to run a great show.  Fast service and super friendly and competent.  They do a great, great job. Little funky sometimes navigating the parking lot with the twists and turns when Las Vegans are feeling testy and pushy, but other than that, great place. On the extra points side, they have a PlayPlace!

Restaurant name  The Cheesecake Factory

Review Text :
1/12/10I try not to visit chain restaurants as much as possible, but when Mom texted that she could meet me somewhere for a bite to eat, it was much easier to tell her to meet me at The Cheesecake Factory at the mall than it was to give her directions to try a local place in downtown Phoenix or elsewhere.  (Believe me, I've tried.)Since we were there during happy hour, we decided to share the Spicy Ahi Tuna Tempura Roll and she wanted the HH caesar salad.  The ahi tuna roll and the salad came out fairly quick, and no wonder, since the roll only consisted of four tiny pieces!  We were hungry, and the pieces were so diminutive, that I didn't even get a chance to take a photo of the dish!  It was very tasty, but certainly not substantial, so I took another look at the HH menu and settled on the hummus.  While waiting for it to arrive, Mom and I shared the nicely-sized caesar salad, which was crisp-fresh and not overly-dressed.  We decided to hold off on the salad for awhile, so as not to fill ourselves up on it.  The hummus and grilled pita bread arrivedl, and they too were flavorful; We couldn't get enough!  While we normally would've stuck w/ the happy hour menu, Mom had caught sight of a neighboring table's two platters and admired one of them, so I decided to order not the one she thought looked appetizing (the menu description turned her off), but what I had originally wanted to order instead of the hummus plate- a chicken pasta dish from the seasonal menu.  Two chicken breasts, pounded thin, battered, then fried, sitting atop of spaghetti w/ a basil-pesto cream sauce.  On top of the chicken were slices of prosciutto and dressed arugula greens sprinkled w/ grated parmesan.  This dish tasted fabulous, and the different textures it offered made me swoon!  (I knew Mom enjoyed it as well, for she repeated at least two times how great the food was!)  However, I knew that the greasiness of this dish would haunt me after.  Still, a great savory dish, and next time, I'll just skip the happy hour menu (save the caesar salad, that's a must!) and order from the dinner menu, instead.Great service, as always, although I just remembered that the honey wheat bread I had asked for arrived stale.  Funny that the server had even bothered to serve it, as she did warn us that it wasn't as fresh as it could be and that a new batch was baking in the oven.  Why even bring stale, hardened bread to the table?  It's the reason why I downgraded from the previous four-star rating to a three..."Oh Ma, a Cheesecake factory gift card! You shouldn't have" no, seriously. She really shouldn't have."Nesto, take Helena out for a nice dinner" Mom says beaming.At the Cheesecake factory??! But I love her...Cheesecake factory is ok.  For the record I am not a cheesecake fan, so that being said...I took my mom out to lunch with the gift card, because she appreciated it, and Helena passed. LOL can't say that I really blame her.The place has issues with identity...and size. Basically Cheesecake factory is a bisexual man with a small penis, metaphorically speaking.I get the feeling that even their staff selection is based on this premise. All very nice folks, but somehow not decision makers in this world, so stuck in limbo. I had a Monte Cristo. It was very OK. My mom could make me better...hey there's an idea for next Christmas! Mom had the lettuce wraps and a gargantuan salad. I had Merlot, my mom had Gin and Tonic. It's a solid safe bet if you are from out of town and don't want to chance it on a better independant restaraunt--Although if you are on Yelp, there really is no excuse. We will steer you to a great restaurant. Other than that I can think of no real reason to frequent here. There are just too too many great restaurants that I want to try in the Phoenix area.I met a girlfriend here around 8pm on a Wednesday night. She was in need of a nosh and I was in need of an adult beverage. We knew CF was open later than a lot of places and I have typically had decent luck here. This location is better than some and not as good as others. I think it is probably hit or miss depending on what time of year and what time of day you come.It was during this visit that my friend and I realized we have been legal to drink for 20 years now but have had been "drinking" together since we were 15 or so(shshsh-don't tell my folks). I am a cheap drunk-or shall I say a lightweight. My friend ordered Vodka/Cranberry (aka-a Cape Cod) and I decided to join her but to make it a better vodka for both of us. The drinks were weak. Seriously weak. I am typically a 2 sip and buzzed gal and yes, I said something. Our waiter apologized, made sure my friend had extra goodies for her meal and for just a meager $2.00 extra, I added a shot (split between our cocktails) and voila, we were able to make a decent drink. Don't worry CF-I am sure I will be back though you are located in the same vicinity of nearly every chain restaurant. If only I could get Grandma to come here with me instead of Red Lobster...but CF doesn't do coupons!

Restaurant name  China A Go Go

Review Text :
Faster than you can say "a go go," China A Go Go will have your food on your table. Maybe I am exaggerating. However, based on my two recent experiences dining in a China Go Go, my food was delivered to my table at a remarkably fast rate. So fast that I now regard China A Go Go in the fast food Chinese food category where the Panda has dominated.    It was a sunny Sunday afternoon, and I was living the dream hiking on the windy and rolling pathways of the Seven Hills trail system. By the time I returned to my car I had built up an appetite for Chinese food. I cruised along the sinuous and hilly drives of Seven Hills to the Von's anchored shopping center off Eastern and Reunion. This is where Eastern Avenue changes from a linear city of shopping centers into a residential thoroughfare overlooking the Las Vegas valley. This China A Go Go is a familiar storefront. It has been here for years way back when the bakery was an It's A Grind.    The first thing that is striking when stepping inside this location is its tiny footprint. In comparison it is far smaller than the majority of the China Go Go's. Regardless there are a few tables.    I had made the daily lunch special when delicious Chinese food is in the same price level as fast food restaurants. Then again I regard China A Go Go as fast food. I handed over $9.32 for the shrimp Chop Suey lunch special with a fountain drink. This included fried rice, soft chow mein noodles, and soup of the day. Prior to February 6, 2011 on the day my Yelp profile was born, the soup of the day has been egg drop soup.    The egg drop soup served in a styrofoam bowl was decent. When the soup arrived on my table, I decided to take in the soup before checking in on Yelp. But it seemed that faster than I can say  "a go-go" my lunch arrived on the table. I appreciate speed of service at the exact time that my mind is questioning why is this food served so fast? In all honesty I don't want to know. The styrofoam box of Chinese food was good. But not GREAT like New York Chinese Restaurant to the east and China Tango Bistro to the south. I felt that there was a sufficient amount of shrimp to compliment the vegetables. The fried rice was likewise good as the filler soft chow mein noodles was.     In conclusion, China A Go Go is a China A So So in my book. When I am in the Seven Hills area, I will most likely concede future China A Go Go check-ins to New York Chinese Restaurant and other restaurants. Faster than I can say "A Go go," I say "3 stars."

Restaurant name  Pho So 1
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Pho So 1 has become one of my favorites for Vietnamese food in Vegas.  Our first visit, we stuck with the basics...* 10. Pho Dac Biet Xe Lua "Special Combo with Rare Slices of Steak, Well-Done Brisket, Flank, Tendon, and Tripe with Rice Noodle Soup" ($6.95) - A generous amount of food, one of the first times I ever had leftovers to take home from a regular order of pho.  * 40. Mi Bo Kho "Beef Stew with Egg Noodles" ($6.95) - The Husband was impressed with their version of one of his favorite dishes.Service was good too - tea comes out automatically, unlike some other restaurants we frequent and they are quick to take your order.  Food comes out promptly too.Within the past week, I've been back twice for this:* 85. Bo Tom Muc Nhung Dam "Beef, Shrimp and Squid dipped in Special Vinegar Sauce" ($25.95) - A platter of raw beef, shrimp, and squid and a pot of hot vinegar broth are presented before you, along with a plate of veggies (various greens, bean sprouts, cucumbers, and pickled daikon and carrots), a plate of rice noodles, rice paper, and a bowl of hot water.  For you first timers, you dip the rice paper in the hot water to get it soft, then you start to load it up with veggies, rice noodle and whatever you cooked up in the hot vinegary broth.  And of course, be sure to dip it in the tasty pineappley sauce thing they give you.  Oh so good!  It's another way for  me to enjoy hot pot - but Vietnamese-style!Last night we had this one:* 84B. Bo Tom Nhung Dam "Beef & Shrimp dipped in Special Vinegar Sauce" ($23.95) - Same thing, but without the squid.  I just love it because it's light, and you can ask for more veggies and rice paper if necessary.  That dipping sauce has a sweet and sour quick with a fruity twist and just good!* 89. Bo Luc Lac "Diced Beef Salad" ($9.50) - This was a semi-raw beef dish with lettuce, cucumbers, tomatoes, lettuce, limes, and peanuts.  Be sure to dip this in the fish sauce too for that extra tangy bite!  Yum!There are a bunch of other items in their Special Dishes section that I'm anxious to try.  It's a generous amount of food though, so it's better to go with a group of at least three.  (I think #s 84B and 85 are decent portions for a party of three, add some eggrolls if you're still hungry.)The first two times we went late at night, and they had a steady stream of customers.  But yesterday during dinnertime, it was packed!  They sure do get a lot of business here, from the Vietnamese community (always a good sign) and outside as well.  We did have to wave them down for more water, tea, extra condiments, etc.  But it was no big deal since it was busy.  Definitely one of my places to go for Vietnamese food beyond the basic pho.They are open late too!So you are craving pho after a night out and about all over lost wages... what are you going to do? go to chinatown (err asiatown???) and get some Pho...The pho is ok, the other stuff is ok also it seems a bit pricey on some items like an extra buck or two over So Cal prices, but it is vegas so yeah... Pro Tip: Make sure that the waitress completely understands your order, ours was wrong in 3-4 places out of a group of about 15... Since they do not speak english very well here be warned. The food is very average as well. I have had much better and much worse. None the less a bowl of pho in lost wages can be a very good thing, even when its very average...Also they dont take all credit cards, I think just Mastercard and Visa.OK AFTER MANY VISITS AND NUMEROUS AMOUNTS OF MOUTH WATERING PICS, I AM FINALLY DOING MY REVIEW ON THIS PLACE.Whenever I come here, I get one of 3 options.1. Pho (Beef Noodle Soup). I get the rare steak, flank, and brisket option. If you dont want your broth as greasy, minus the brisket. Just your basic pho with nothing but meat. No tendons or tripe. This would be a good choice for you first timers that dont wanna second guess what's in your soup. For you adventurers and seasoned vets, the combination has everything in it. Don't forget about the bean sprouts, cilantro, mint leaves, and sliced jalapenos that come on a separate plate for you to throw in there at your discretion.2. Rice Vermicelli. I usually get the Charbroiled Beef or Pork with Egg rolls and Vegetables. I get this because it comes with the crispy egg rolls that they make so good. So instead of ordering it as a side item, it already comes with it. They give you a small cup of sweet n sour fish sauce to mix in your bowl for that complete flavor.3. Rice Dish. I get the Diced Beef with Grilled Onions accompanied by Tomato Fried Rice. Very tender cuts of sirloin pan fried in oil and soy sauce. Very flavorful.I have also have tried their Seafood Barbeque Combination. When you order this they bring out a portable grill heated by a specific gel. On a separate plate they give you raw shrimp, beef, squid, and tripe. You cook these items yourself. So basically, this is their version of Korean Barbeque. It's pretty much guaranteed this is what you will be smelling when you walk in there. This is what parties of 3 or more usually get because for about 25 bucks you get a decent amount of food.Last but not least, I have heard great things about their Beef Salad. Eventually I will get it and it will probably be my fourth option.These guys are open until about 3 am 7 days a week 365 days a year. I know this because Christmas Day nobody wanted to cook so we went here. Their service is very efficient and they always seem to be fully staffed every time I go.The only negative thing that brings them to 4 instead of 5 stars is that the floor always seems to be littered with misc things. Not to the point where its piled up but if you look hard enough, you will see it. I will give them a pass because everything else makes up for it. Any questions? Message me and I will tell you everything I know! You can also check out their website: www.phoso1.comKeep in mind, not all they have on their physical menu is on their website menu.Probably the worst Vietnamese place, I have experienced! When it comes to costumer service this hits a all time low. After being seating at a booth for 15 minutes, I had to flag down a waiter for the menu (Minus a star)! It seems the like the waitress and waiter are all gathered around the cash register talking amongst themselves to care! We have to inform the waiter that we never got any cold water (Minus another star). The waiter decides to gives us an attitude when we was placing our order (Minus another star)!WARNING: The establishment itself is a OVEN!!!Lacking AC in this weather is not a welcoming place to dine. When I ask about the AC the waiter claim it is working (on) and the heat is cause by the weather outside! Sorry that was a load of crap! I posted a picture of the thermostat of the restaurant and it reads 90 Fahrenheit. I am not a high maintenance person but temperature that high ruins the dinning experience. The food is nothing to rave about! The chicken dish was dry! The grill pork and egg roll with vermicelli was decent! You could have gotten this in another Vietnamese restaurant. I could not imagine eating Pho here because of the heat! Personally with the lack of AC (Las Vegas being so hot) with bad costumer service, I would NOT RECOMMEND this place based on today experience!I used to come here very regularly, but it's been a minute since I've been back to Pho So 1 and I have to say they have remained consistent. The food wasn't as good as I remembered but it was still really solid and service was on par. We were served quickly and our server was friendly.I haven't tried their pho recently but the vermicelli bowl was good and had lots of fresh veggies, which made it all the better.UGH NO! Today I ordered  chicken pho and when I got to the bottom noticed something brown in  the tangle of noodles I put in my spoon and saw it was indeed a small roach. The BF didnt say anything ( he shouldve) while we were eating but he wasnt touching his water because something was in it as well.If it wasn't for ordering chicken, maybe I wouldnt have noticed the roach until it was in my mouth if it was with little  brown beef bits like well done brisket.  It was also filthy in there too. Sticky bottles, the floor a mess, etc. It was busy, but there was quite a bit of employees so downtime could be used to maintain cleanliness.NONONONONONONONONO. it sucks because they weren't taking our order for the longest time and I decided if they didn't come after this last order they were serving we were going to walk out as 10minutes just sitting there after it's clear we were looking around and put down the menus. I wish I didn't have decent patience today as I could have avoided roach soup.We didn't pay, but that is not the point. It's the cost of fucking fastfood so it doesn't mean a lot. It shouldn't be happening.If there was a possible zero, this place would get it. But, Yelp felt the need that all business deserve pity stars. From upon entering, we're greeted by an Asian fellow with glasses. There were two-three tables open for 10...he reluctantly seated us and was about to put us on a waiting list. If not mentioned, we would have wasted our time. Soup is less than mediocre, broth was bland and constumer service was blatantly disrespectful. We asked multiple times for simple sides like onion, and waiters would not acknowledge our requests. Just to top off the cake, there was curly hair in my #10 soup. The cashier was apologetic, but not by nature. She looked at my wife and I, trying to find out if the hair belong to one of us. The hair was curly and short, possibly armpit hair. For her to stare up and down at us, it was very offensive, we did not plan to eat someone else's pubes. For a restaurant that cries it is the number 1 soup restaurant, they sure treat us like we are the last people to come back."My mom just stomped on a roach in the bathroom and when I asked to speak to a manager about it.. They never brought one out to me and had me just tell a server.. Not coming back and telling my friends and all of yelp" - this being my most recent TIP posted for this establishment. Again, another establishment I hate to do this to since I was such a regular at this place, but in all honesty, when you see a cockroach in a place where you like to eat, it really does make you want to never come back. Last night 12/8/15 I was dining with a large group of friends (about 18 people) and a manager of some kind (he was not wearing restaurant uniform) made his way to even greet us and thank us for coming to their establishment. Everything was fine, until my mother and I decided we needed to use the restroom. My mom has said to me several times that she even though it's cheap and the food is decent, she doesn't like coming here because she always sees small cockroaches in the bathroom. I had personally never seen them before, so I would continue to come here whenever friends would want a pho run. This time on 12/8/15, it was a different story. My mother and I walked into a very dirty restroom and as she entered the handicap stall, she yelled at me on the other side, oh man.. see there goes one cockroach. and then I hear "stomp" and she goes, "I killed it." She allowed me to come and see for myself, and that is the pix I have recently posted. We even saw another small cockroach on the floor near the sink, but I wasn't in the mood to stomp on another one, because quite frankly that's not my responsibility. Seeing a cockroach in an eatery establishment, it does something to your stomach thats hard to describe. I enjoy the food here, and even my meal that night was delicious, which was number 71 btw, the diced beef with onions and tomato rice. I very politely asked to speak to a manager, and the server asked if everything was okay, and I kindly responded, "yes, it has nothing to do with the food or the service, that was fine, but there's an issue with the bathroom and I just wanted to discuss that with a manager" the server nodded his head and said okay. and while we were still packing our left overs and splitting our bill, I was waiting for a manager.. none came. I kept looking at the server I spoke to, and it's almost as if he was trying to ignore me/ avoid making eye contact. I finally after patiently waiting and still no manager came out, I approached the server and asked if he was going to get the manager, or if he just wanted me to tell him. So I ended up just telling the server, and he responded, "Oh well we sent someone to the bathroom already and they didn't see anything." and I responded, "oh really? because here is the photo proof. and I can tell you exactly where it's laying." What's really poor service and disappointing is that instead of just being like, "I sent someone back there and we didn't see anything, but we apologize for that experience and we will look into it more and making sure we better attend to our restrooms..." they kinda brushed it off like, "oh well, we didn't see one, so no there's no cockroaches here.." I insulted because it was like they were saying or making it seem like I was making it up. but no I have picture proof.. and I would post this kinda stuff unless it was true. I even said to the server, I like the food here and I like coming here, but I cannot continue to come back if you guys don't care about your bathrooms and the cockroaches. and honestly the lack of interest in fixing the issue is enough to make me want to never come back. There's plenty of good pho and Viet food in this city. This is the last time Pho So 1 will see me, my business, and those I associate with.3.5 starsPho So 1 is one of our two Pho spots when we visit Las Vegas. The restaurant is located in Chinatown - not too far off the strip. This particular pho restaurant is located inside a plaza with the Asian supermarket.Pho Tai Nam Gan Sach (7.99): Rare steak, well done flank, brisket, tendon, and tripe. Good amount of meat and soup inside my bowl. Broth wasn't as flavorful as it once used to be..Weekends are normally packed during peak times. We were seated right away but it took a while for our food to come out.

I don't know how people can eat here. The food is all grease and fat. The grease in which they deep fry everything is 'off' I think - like they haven't changed it out since the 1980s... everything tastes the same and not in a good way. In fact, everything about this place is like a blast from the past - it's like walking into a museum featuring restaurant cliches from 25 years ago.I felt dirty and greasy just walking into the joint. The entire place is covered in a layer of film that's neither sticky nor slimy, but truly disturbing. The smells emanating from this place both inside and out are all pretty offensive too. The quality of the ingredients used is all very low. I wouldn't ever recommend coming here to eat. We sampled quite a few different items and they were all vile and made me both regret their consumption and consider regurgitation. The sliders were a joke - how do you make greasy bread? Fries are made more of oil than potato. Pizza puffs are basically a twist on a mozzarella stick only wetter and less healthy (however healthy deep fried cheese could be).  There was one saving grace though - the salads seem to be decent. I won't be returning though.

I used to come here when I wanted a free meal, because they screw up your meal everytime. They literally comp meals left and right. I went there with friends they got an ore cart (which is a whole dried out carcass) and we got a chicken. They came out soo dry.I mean like dry dry. Like it was beef and chicken crackers. The waiter came over and said he would comp it and he could see how badly dry it was. Then he said free dessert.So we naturally each ordered our own personal dessert :)My mom went there and there was a waiter some how broke a glass on her lap. Dont ask how that happend but they tried to giver her a free Claim Jumper shirt!!!!My mom was like Wtf! you jus ruined an expensive shirt and I have glassshards in my arms and legs. So they gave her a free meal and a $100 gift card.The french onion soup was all I used to get there before I was aware what was in food. I cant vouch for whats in there, but it doesnt matter anyway the food is bad.They are really really accomodating but I think its because they are used to fucking up all the time. If you want a free mediocre meal, come here.

Restaurant name  Omelet House

Review Text :
What a refreshing change of pace. Have car, will travel and find more interesting food. The Omelet House reminded me of some of my favorite diners. Little hole-in-the-wall places that have been doing their thing for decades. Long list of omelets with silly names and unapologetically dated décor with knotty pine walls. Not far from the glitz of the Strip, we found people of all ages from bikers to college kids tucking into piles of food. It felt like a glimpse of the real Vegas.Their standard 'O-Boy Omelets' are made with SIX EGGS! Totally insane. We ordered 'Baby Omelets' made with three eggs for a little bit less money since there is no point having leftovers when you're on vacation. For choice of bread, my favorite was the pumpkin bread served piping hot. The thinly sliced side of potatoes were on the verge of being potato chips and just as addictive.I enjoyed The Guac, but had plate envy after I tasted Mr. K's Cowboy Special (chili, cheese and onions) and kept going back for more. This isn't the best place in the world, but I am tempted to give it five stars because it is just what the doctor ordered. But, the coffee is weak (even though the refills were plentiful) and I've had better versions of this style of cooking elsewhere. Still, damn fine.I just love this place! I have been eating here since I was a wee little girl. I love taking people here who haven't been which is usually someone who has moved here from somewhere else because what true native hasn't eaten here?! When family comes to town this is my go-to place to go out for breakfast.I can't go and not get an order of "Fried Zucchini Sticks". They are the best I have ever had! They come in a half or full order and you can get cheese sauce or ranch or both for dipping. If you haven't tried them yet please do! I always get the "Green Hornet". It has avocado and cheese and tomatoes. I am notorious for it and just can't change it but do take a bite off my families plates hehe!Just so you know, the omelets are made with 6 eggs so if you don't think you can eat that much you can just ask for a "baby" and they will make it with 3 eggs. They also give you a little off the cost for using less eggs I think it is like 75 cents or something. The spuds are so good too. I usually ask for them with no salt and love to dip them in ranch dressing.The lines can be long but you don't wait for long and the wait is more then worth it! This last visit we waited maybe 5 minutes. They are only open for breakfast & lunch. During the week it isn't as hectic as trying to eat at Omelet House on the weekends but still consistent.Our first visit to the Omelet House and I am sure happy we went! We were in the mood for breakfast so Omelets we got as that is what they are famous for! I decided on the "Mile High City" which is basically a Denver Omelet, ham, onions and bell pepper and it was delicious. The side I ordered that came with my meal was the fresh baked walnut banana cake, mmmm so hot and flavorful! I like that they have other choices than the typical option for toast.My boyfriend got the "Bugsy Siegel" which was very tasty, generous chunks of moist roast beef, Italian red sauce, sour cream and jack cheese! The Omelets are huge to say the least, I think the Server said 7 eggs? I took a bite of his Omelet not really sure if I would like that combination however it blew my mind it was so damn good!The portions are generous, the prices reasonable for what you get! They even have a coupon in the Entertainment book for $7.00 off. We love to eat out and save money so that was a nice added bonus, I am just shocked they have a discount coupon with how big their portions are! It did the job it got us to try a new breakfast place that really delighted our taste buds! We will be back for sure!My only dislike is that they pair their Omelets with homemade thin potato chips instead of hashed browns or Country style potatoes. The homemade chips I might like better paired with a sandwich for lunch rather than a breakfast omelet. That was just the opinion of my boyfriend and I. We will ask next time if there is a substitution option available instead of the chips. The service is Amazing, good old fashioned kindness at this restaurant and is very comfortable as it has a Country thrift store theme with all of the decorations on the walls.I woke from my Venetian slumber hungry and thought where can I get a good AM meal that will not leave me wanting throught the rest of the day. So I Yelped and  the Omlet House was the first to pop up on the radar that wasn't a new kid on the block.  If this were a truck stop the economy would seriously slow down to a crawl.This is the real deal. A local big boy breakfast establishment that has been dishing out the goods for almost 35 years.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Qc0l8rZ3nvrcERitgxu8XA?select=x0qFaEDDU9rjoIY0c8WQsw#6zAZ_w1PQ4sThfUhAH2ZLA   You are in Country royalty as Presidents and kings have dined here.  http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2003/Feb-18-Tue-2003/news/20702658.html   http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Qc0l8rZ3nvrcERitgxu8XA?select=x0qFaEDDU9rjoIY0c8WQsw#y2tBxR3WW0bxKh_zW0z3igThis is my kind of family run mom & pop shop.

It's tucked away in some tiny mall, out of the way, and completely unassuming.  Inside, the place is surprisingly HUGE, and very homey.  You can tell the place has been there for a while.For starters, we got hooked up with a nice slice of pumpkin bread.  It's not overly sweet, but it has a nice amount of spice to make it incredibly tasty.  Then the meal came.  The missus got chicken fried steak, and it was delicious.  I got lobster eggs benedict.  Honestly, I was expecting something lame and wimpy, as every restaurant thinks a few little sprinkles of shredded lobster here and there suffices in any related meal.What I got was CHUNKS.  Big, wonderful chunks of tasty sweet lobster on both parts, and the entire experience was just awesome.  I more than got what I paid for.Prices are great, service is fast, the staff is friendly, and the wait time to be seated was surprisingly short.  It was nice to eat in  place that had a little personality, and you could tell they've been around for a while.  After eating breakfast there, I could see why.This weekend, "whims" paid off, and I have a new place to frequent.  It's nice to know that I can still find "new" things in the neighborhood.Recommended.Omelet House rocks! Over 30 different and unique varieties on the menu, all with clever names, a gut-busting size, and crazy-low prices! Even the varieties with fancy fillings like asparagus and lobster are still around $11, and the sheer size makes them more than shareable!THE SPARTACUS: Asparagus, mushrooms, and cheddar, with cheese sauce on the side. You wouldn't think to combine a classy veggie like asparagus with the white trash favorite condiment of nacho cheese, but it works! Even without a protein this packs a punch, if you can eat the whole thing, it'll fill you up all day!CHILI VERDE OMELET: pork, green chile sauce, and jack cheese. It's just slightly spicy, super meaty, and full of flavor. The green sauce is done well here, and you can add on various hot sauces at the table if you need extra heat.SIDES: Omelets come with a bread choice and "Rip Taylor's favorite spuds", which are house-made potato chips, and they're pretty decent. Good mix of soggy and crisp potato slices to pick out the kind you prefer, but I wish they were seasoned better. Of your bread options, the Pumpkin Nut Bread is off the chain. Get it.Service was attentive throughout, the whole staff hustled to flip tables and help each other out. Interior is bigger than the exterior suggests, and it's decorated country-style with homey knick-knacks and antique furniture. Definitely coming back to this spot, gotta try their (current featured special) chicken fried steak omelet (with gravy inside!) on my next visit.Wack is the word that comes to mind from my experience here. Walking in this place is country cute and felt like an old grandmas home, I enjoyed the very cozy atmosphere. As we sat down we ordered two orange juices and as they were brought over by a young kid they both slipped out of his hands (maybe because he was attempting to carry 2 waters & 2 juices at the same time). All 4 drinks landed on my lap...down my legs and into my ballerina flats. What a way to start a Sunday morning off! FML!After basically washing my ass & legs in the bathroom and my ballerina flats now squishy from taking a full bath I was pretty bummed. I decided to stay because this place was bookmarked forever & I was really hungry for some great breakfast food. I need to also point out everyone apologized & the manager came over & said my breakfast was on him. That helped but now I'm sitting here soaking wet. We ordered banana nut & pumpkin bread which were both great. I ordered a Black Forest ham omelet & it was massive. Unfortunately I took a few bites & was over it. The entire thing was in a puddle of grease & butter and there must have been a pound of Swiss cheese on this thing. Just a bunch of thick wads of cheese everywhere. So gross and it felt like a heart attack on a plate, no thanks. My man did enjoy his polish sausage & eggs and luckily my plate was free because it would have really sucked to pay for that.Here's the worse part. After getting 4 cups spilled directly onto my lap they didn't charge me for my food however they charged my man for his and guess what, they also charged us for the drinks. What a joke. I could definitely get over the accident but to be known for the omelette's here and to have one of the shittiest omelette's I've ever had was too much. Next time when you spill anything on your customers, just a piece of advice DON'T CHARGE THEM for what was spilled on them. Common sense...

Review Text :
I'm gonna go against the grain here and recommend something on their menu no one seems to say anything about. The hot dogs.What's that you say? Why eat the hot dogs at a place called Giant Hamburger? Because they use the best all beef dogs around. I don't know where they get them from, and quite frankly, I don't care because they're big and delicious. This isn't a shriveled up little wiener you find as a side item at most places, it's a big juicy 1/4 lb dog. Pair that up with always crispy and tasty fries and you have yourself a meal. I've also had their hamburgers and they are as delicious as they say they are, but the home style breakfasts are a favorite for us. Eggs cooked to order, sausage, bacon, or ham, on the side with hash-browns, OJ, toast, and an orange wedge to sweeten the deal. A friend took me here 6 years ago and I have become a regular ever since. Oscar knows us by name and is a great guy. Highly recommended.It's cash only, and decent price for the amount you get. We usually get out of there for around $12-14 for the two of us. This place is built in the old diner style with booths, small tables in the aisles, and a counter lined with barstools. If you go in the off hours, it's generally easy to find a place to sit, but the place is usually packed during regular breakfast, lunch, and dinner hours. (Side note: they'll make breakfast anytime of the day you want it. I know this because my girl had a craving for their french fries and french toast at 8PM one night... yeah. And she's not even French. ;) )I love this place, and if you went there, you would love it too.One of the (many) things I miss about Southern California are the (usually)Charbroiled Burger spots that blanket the entire area from Ventura down to San Diego:  Legends like the o.g. Astro Burger, Galaxy Burger, Douglas Burger, Tam's, etc.   These burger joints served awesome burgers, great grilled sandwiches (Patty Melts, anybody?), and almost always, a great, greasy breakfast on the cheap.  Oh, and they made their food proper.... American Cheese on all burgers and sandwiches, thousand island on the burgers, no up charge for grilled onions, yadda-yadda-yadda, you get the point.  Sadly, AZ seriously lacks in these types of establishments.Enter Giant Hamburgers.  While their burgers aren't charbroiled, they're wonderful.  Their Grilled Ham and Cheese is out of this world (just remember to order it "plain" with only the ham and cheese on buttery, grilled sourdough... YUM!).  Try an open-faced chili burger, or maybe even a gardenburger, if you like retarded shit.  Their Chili-Cheese fries are a real treat, especially since they melt a few slices of American Cheese on top instead of that bullshit cheddar some places use.  Thirsty for something sweet?  Try a hand-made, uber thick shake.  Still hungry after all that?  Have a jumbo slice of homemade pie.Wait!  What if it's 9am and your stomach's not ready for Chili Cheese Fries?  No problem, their breakfasts will surely satisfy any cravings you might have.  Sold as a Single, Double, or Triple, their egg combos come with eggs, hash browns, toast, and your choice of chorizo, ham, sausage, hamburger patty, bacon, or steak for an additional charge.  Don't want eggs?  No problem, they've got pancakes and the best looking biscuit and gravy plate I've seen in years.You order at the counter and they bring the food out to you as you're chillin' in 50's-style booths enjoying the music and ambiance of an old school diner.  The place is always busy and the staff is always very friendly, but not in an overly friendly, obnoxious way.  A Triple breakfast plate will set you back about $8 with tax.  Burger, fries, and a drink will get you for about the same.  They are more than willing to substitute or customize your order however you want it, usually at no charge.  You will enjoy this place, trust me.Delicious burgers, great service, what else can you ask for??? Prices are fair, it's located on the corner of broadway and Lindsay tucked away in between a subway and a massage parlor. Thought I already reviewed this place before but here it goes...I ordered a double cheeseburger w/ onions, jalapeños and bacon. Delish! Everything worked together in a symphony of flavor. The meat to bun ratio was perfect, and the fries were crisp and fresh. My daughters got a hotdog each and both finished theirs in record time! Hubby got a plain double cheeseburger and he loves the charbroiled flavor. We called in our order and it was ready in 10 mins and no mistakes on our order. Thumbs up!!Giant Burger is a good+ hamburger.  I could never give it 5 stars, as it is a typical diner burger; but, for what it is, it is very good.When I saw the cook slap the patty down, I automatically thought this was going to be a cheap, frozen, ground beef patty.  Wow, I was definitely wrong.  I asked for the burger to be cooked med-rare, and although quite thin, it came out as ordered.  The meat was definitely not frozen, I could sure taste the freshness of the meat with the fist bite.Cheese options are limited (american / swiss).  Again, typical diner burger, just better quality. I recommend trying Giant Burger is you are in the mood for a standard, not fancy, high quality burger.

Review Text :
Organ Stop is like a trip down memory lane. Our family used to go a very looooong time ago, in the early 80's, when they were located in far West Mesa. As a child I  can remember this giant organ bursting out of the ground like magic. As it towered over the audience, complete with lights and sounds I was mesmerized by its beauty. It's a childhood memory that is seared into my brain. I'm sure many of the children that go will find it truly magical. The food is not what you go for, it is the entertainment and novelty of seeing this incredible organ being played, and the experience of enjoying something that you won't find many other places. *****PLEASE NOTE******They DO NOT accept credit cards!!! Cash or check only. There is an ATM on site if you forget this.This place really is quite special. It's a natural tourist trap, so expect to see plenty of pasty, obnoxious Canadians and so forth, but from what I hear it is a sort of local landmark. I went for my birthday this year at the recommendation of a few work friends, and I had an incredible time. The pizza gets alot of flack, apparently, but I enjoyed it just fine. It's not likely to be mistaken for gourmet brick-oven pizza that snobs in Sedona eat, but it's still rather good from what I remember.The organ was incredible. Gigantic. Played by a really good musician. The song selection is pretty universal, showtunes and the like, but just seeing the thing in action is remarkable. I highly recommend it. Now stop bashing the pizza!Such a fun bit of Americana! A friend had his birthday celebration here and  I must say that it was quite the entertaining experience. Food's OK and not too badly priced, considering the entertainment that comes with it; and, $2 mugs of beer on tap ... yes!The Wurlitzer was impressive: around 6000 pipes and 4 large turbine blowers make it one of the largest theater organs in the world. The pipes themselves, as well as accessory instruments - piano, percussion instruments, even a mechanical quacking duck - are scattered around the interior of the building and displayed and lit to become part of a grand light and sound show. I thoroughly enjoyed the organist's performance, which ranged from folk to pop (including adventure and sci-fi movie themes) to classical pieces. The performance ends with a sing-along.Pretty much all ages are represented in the customer demographic, from toddlers to seniors, but leaning heavily toward family groups. Kids definitely love the place, as I saw many of them break away from their families to go beside the organ platform and spontaneously dance to the music.CASH ONLY, PRICEY, LEAVE IT FOR THE TOURIST!Some friends wanted to eat here, because their senior parents love this place and would be dining with us. So we met friends and senior parents here for pizza. Let me just say this was not my thing. CRAZY setup, you wait in a line and order your pizza. Then you go wait in a second line to order your beverages (paying separately). Then go sit at school cafeteria tables, in a VERY crowded, VERY loud dining room. Can't talk to anyone, the music is deafening. Packed WALL TO WALL with senior citizens. Which explains the taste.Now I've had Chicago style, New York style, and even California style pizza. But this pizza is Nursing Home-Hospital style pizza; it's not good, taste a little better than a frozen Red Baron.Organ music is good, would be better if not SO loud. Would be better if you only waited in one line for food and drinks and paid for them together. If these two things were different, I'd say worth a trip in for nostalgic reasons. Oh and it's CASH ONLY. So stop by the atm and pull out plenty, it's also pricey!!!Stay with me, this might get confusing for ya, my daughter (3rd oldest) was in town for the weekend for a visit and my other daughter (2nd oldest) said we should go somewhere where it doesn't matter how loud the kids get, where it's fun and entertains them and allow us to visit and for others to join us, I told her I had my fill of Peter Piper Pizza for the year not going there, she said Mom lets go to Organ Stop Pizza, I laughed, no really I laughed, Organ Stop has never been on my list of places to go and its sort of a running joke on YT,  my daughter then told me that she has been before and my grandson loves it.  Come to find out, most of my kids (have 4 total and not so much on the kid side anymore ranging frm 22 to 17) have been to Organ Stop and do enjoy it. (I fully believe they live a secret life when my eyes were closed, I thought they were out running the streets, but nope it was hanging out at Organ Stop haha) So Organ Stop Pizza was the place picked, time to meet up was a Friday night at 6:30pm. Off we wentWe got there a little before 6:30 because wanted to make sure to get tables and set up for everyone, and damn the parking lot is FULL, Yep I was shocked! Didn't know it was such a hot spot to go to.  Prior to coming my (2nd oldest) daughter told me to find tables on the 1st floor (1st floor??? WTH this is a pizza joint right??? 2 floors?) And after walking in I saw what she meant. When you 1st walk in you are facing the menu board to order pizza, I'll get back to that, but if you go to your right you will see the dining room, and low and behold it has 2 floors of seating. 1st floor was completely filled up, so I went upstairs and found us 2 long tables.  Then I stopped and really looked around. 1st observation, DAMN THAT'S A HUGE ORGAN, and not so much a HUGE ORGAN, it's the pipes, they are in the walls, and all over, is this a sound proof building? Can you hear it on the street??  2nd, this must have been an old church, that's the feeling it gives from the 2 floors and seating arrangements.   I have to say hearing scores of the Phantom of the Opera played on that bad ass organ sounded amazing and the light show that went with it, I liked it. Ok like I said when you 1st walk in you are faced with ordering your pizza. This is where the place loses points, it's all scattered. In one place you order your pizza and pay for it, then get into another line, order your salad and pay for it, then get into another line for drinks and pay for it.  Why can't it be one stop shopping experience?  Oh and everything is CASH ONLY.  I ordered 1 large Hawaiian, 1 Large Combination, 1 medium Spicy Italian for 54 bucks, then ordered 3 pitchers of soda (MT Dew, Root beer, Sierra Mist) for 15 bucks. I tried the Hawaiian & Combination, the Hawaiian had chopped ham throughout the pizza and good amount of pineapple, the combo pizza wasn't lacking the bell peppers, for that's all I remember from it, but the pizza itself was not that great, it's like Little Creasers pizza but with a car dealership sticker price. Do I feel like I got my money's worth? No not really, but what I did get was a meal with all 4 of my kids, 3 of my grandkids, tons of family and friends, some laughter and smiles, and that right there is what counts.   Return factor though is really low.I finally know the irony behind "Phoenix's most romantic restaurant." If you've ever had the pleasure of asking Yelp Talkers for a suggestion on where to take a first date, second date, anniversary date, valentines date, or date of any type where romance is foremost on your list - you may have incidentally ended up here dressed in your best duds. I fortunately, didn't fall into that particular trap, I did however, show up here cause a friend had some family in town and invited us all out to dine with her.What fun, I thought, I'll finally get to see what all the hubbaloo is about, I finally get to experience romance at it's finest. Secretly, I never really checked the place out at all, I didn't read about it, I had no real clue as to what this place was. I always just assumed it was some weird mixture of pizza joint, strip club, and themed in hospital recovery room and left it at that. Boy was I wrong, and not necessarily in a good way. I will say that this is certainly an experience, one that you'll not have anywhere else, in town or out of town, except maybe unless there's another organ stop pizza somewhere. Touting the worlds largest Wurlitzer pipe organ, the name finally makes sense. Organ has nothing to do with the male organ, nothing to do with greasy pizza stopping your organs as you eat it, nothing to do with stripping, boy was I wrong, but I'm still not sure if I was wrong in a good way or bad.Either way you 'slice' it, the pizza here is less than mediocre, but the ambiance! The ambiance less than makes up for the mediocre pizza. The thrill of pipe organs lasts only so long, and I think I clocked it at about 3 minutes and 47 seconds, but the kids all seemed to love it. I guess if you've got kids, feel like seeing the worlds largest Wurlitzer in action and in all it's glory, then you know where to go this Friday.So Phoenix Yelpers, I hope I left you with some insight into Organ Stop Pizza and hopefully you don't get trapped in the age old Phoenix Yelp Talk question of "Where's the most romantic place to take your girl?" because unwittingly, you'll be sent here.Happy Yelping Phoenix!If you are into sitting inside of a giant pipe organ while being pounded with renditions of every show tune, movie soundtrack, patriotic song, service song or favorite from the past century, then this is the place for you.  You don't even need your hearing aids.Biggest organ in the world, only two dozen people on the planet capable of playing it, has every instrument sound known to mankind (and then some) and the organist takes requests.  This place seems to be a favorite with the elderly crowd for the reasons stated.For me it was loud.  And I'm hearing impaired.  I even took my hearing aids out and it was still loud.Oh, and they serve pizza, salad, beer, soda and have a sundae bar.  I had the pizza, it wasn't bad if you count frozen pizza as delicious.  The salad greens were fresh and industrial quality, the dressings were the big four, Blue Cheese, French, Ranch and Italian, all apparently coming from a jug.  maybe the same jug - as I tried the ranch and the blue cheese and there was no discernible difference other than the blue cheese had some soft lumps of something in it.  The iced tea was watery and instant, but made recently. If you have never eaten a tasteless salad and mediocre pizza washed down with watery beverages while being pounded by organ style show tunes sound, sitting at cafeteria-style tables, then you gotta try this place.  If you go back it's your own damn fault.

I love Goldies! Its like the "Cheers" of Scottsdale, but everybody doesn't know my name there yet.  Gotta try the Goldaritas. Great place for happy hour, and to watch a game. Can get crowded, hard to find a seat at the bar. Tip- pretty decent buffalo wings

Review Text :
I've become a fan of Sweet Tomatoes.  This location is the 2nd location I've dined at within the past 2 months.  I love the huge Salad Bar and the Bread station.  However, the discovery of the Froyo station was the find of the day!  AYCE Salad, Bread, and Froyo?!  I can deal with that!**Hint** - Google "Sweet Tomatoes Coupons" and you'll find a ton of coupons on the web to use for discounted prices.  I took the family here for dinner and we only paid $7.99 each with the coupon....awesome!Return Factor - 100%This place has not MOVED! It is just changed names back to Sweet Tomatoes again.OK, here is a word to the wise. If it is not broken ,do not fix it.This was one of our favorite Sweet Tomatoes to go to. We really liked it , plus it was close  by.Then they changed it to Test Kitchen or something, and it flopped big time.So now they have changed it all back to Sweet Tomatoes, or so they say!We came here last night for dinner. We were pretty excited because, we really liked Sweet Tomatoes.Well, now it looks very industrial. The lovely plants that are growing outside on the planters are all starting to die. This is an indication of what is going on inside.Everything is tin now. TIn strays and ice cream bowls and all the containers they put the soup and other items in to. Nothing looks like it used to. It all looks cheap, like they have changed the ingrediants.Because, it certainly tastes like they have.They have glass glasses now,which I do like better than the plastic.The Pasta looks aweful, we could not even try it. It just looked bad.The salad was good, but they have taken away things like the chickpeas and the kidney beans. In its place they have a 3 bean salad type thing.They did still have sunflower seeds and raisins  which  is good,as well as the Joan's Brocili dish.But, even the soup seems differant. The lemon Orzo tasted like fake flavors and hardly any chicken. The Chili was a little better with more meat. But, I have to say I was in no way impressed.They do not even have real Butter anymore. It is margarine and flavored Butter, I just want the real thing.  What they were presenting as Ice Cream was not, More like an Ice Milk that had an artificial taste to eat.No one ever came to clear a single dish away from our table. The staff used to be so good about that. Maybe most of them have left because, it has all changed and they are losing money as well. With no so much tipping.I can honestly say we will never be back to this location,if it stays as it is. I guess we will drive out to Phoenix, or Awahtukkee. We used to go to Sweet Toms once a week.But, not know. The have ruined it.Oh I forgot to mention that they now serveAlcohol. I just do not see why that is needed at all. This is suppose to be healthy dining.I went to Sweet Tomatoes last night at the Scottsdale location.  And it's not even worth reviewing that location because it is so normal.  There is nothing particularly good about it, nor bad about it.  But THIS location, THIS location has things worth mentioning. And so here I  go:1) They have a super soda machine that makes 100 flavors. I always do the diet mellow yellow grape.2) They have abnormally fancy plates.3) They have cottage cheese at the salad bar. I like cottage cheese.4) They have chocolate (or sometimes strawberry) mousse at the salad bar. Other Sweet Tomatoes have this as well, but they put it by the ice cream, alluding that it is a dessert.  Moving the mousse to the salad bar implies that it is meant to be eaten with your salad.  CHOCOLATE MOUSSE FOR DINNER. I should just end this review right here.5) They serve beer.6) They serve meat on wooden sticks (but you have to pay more).7) They changed their corn muffins into delicate little corn cakes.8) It is by a very interesting pond that has an abundance of turtles. One day, they make take over the world.4 Stars? Put down the bongs everyone, come back to reality and look at what you're giving 4 Stars to. Sweet Tomatoes is what  happens when a bean counter accountant looks at a Golden Corral or Sizzler type salad bar and says what if we could build a restaurant around just the salad bar with a few non-steak extras thrown in to spiff it up? Imagine the cash we'll rake in. Hello Sysco, I want your cheapest product line....If you haven't got my point by now you never will. Seriously, it's freakin cafeteria style food. I don't know about you but I have very bad memories of school cafeteria food. So handing me a tray and sending me down the line to pick out my choices brings not so good flashbacks. In this case of Sweet Tomatoes you get picked over greens, a bunch of Sysco cheapest product possible bulk food service toppings, more bulk food type salad dressing, and all set in a decor that is circa 2010 but yet would not feel out of place in 1982. This is a place where I had an OMG WTF was I thinking moment when I tried to be polite to the people I was with and choke it down.Toss in staff that are slow to clean the place up, screaming kids, and ho-hum bakery offerings and I see absolutely no reason to think of turning off Stephanie Street into a tight, usually packed parking lot to come here again. 4 Stars? Maybe if someone slipped me special brownies and I had the worst case of the munchies ever. Otherwise it's not only no but hell no. I love salad but every time I think it's a pain in the rear to round up all the ingredients I like for mine I just think of this place. I won't grumble when I go to the store and achieve a sneeze guard free salad experience after coming here. Oh and this is another place where you'll be glad to know there's CVS and Walgreens locations close by for all of your upset stomach needs.This location of sweet tomatoes is very favorable to me.  Located on the corner of Stephanie and Warm Springs, it's easy to find.   You'll notice there isn't a plenitude of parking but there isnt really any space to expand.  The restaurant has been newly updated.  New floors, paint, dishes and decor.  The salad bar is your first stop before paying.  Several pre-made salads are available if you don't want to build one.  The toppings are abundant in a clean buffet area.  After paying you can then visit the soup/pasta/bread area.  The specialties change from month to month depending on what is in season.  Leave room for dessert as well! Ice cream, pudding and dessert breads are there for your enjoyment! If you sign up on their email list, you can get pretty good coupons.  Otherwise just look one up on your phone before heading in.  They are more than happy to scan a coupon from your phone.  As far as buffets go, I don't feel as guilty for eating at this one.

Where do you go when you are extremely hungry, have a yen for asian food and only have $13 to spend?  As long as you don't mind the sparse and tacky feel of being in a place that looks like it used to be a dime store in it's prior life then The Great Wall could just be the place.Hey, ambience costs more.  The buffet is $9.95; drinks (soda, milk, tea) is extra.  The waitresses are very attentive and refill drinks without being asked at no additional charge.Come when they first open.  You may have to wait a few minutes for them to finish bringing out all the food but it's worth the wait.  At least you will have first pickings and it's all fresh.Lots of dim sum in addition to what you expect to see at Panda.  They throw in a little Japanese tempura and a little Thai just for good measure.  All the dishes are marked clearly and indicate whether it's hot or spicy.  Personally, I am partial to the baby octopuss, crab puffs and baos.  For the kiddies there is some "American" fare like salad, jello and egads, chicken nuggets.It's kinda funny really, but if you are not picky, what the heck.This is not gourmet by any means, but they won't try to chase you out and they are kid friendly.If buffet is not your "thing" they do have a regular menu, but why bother?

Review Text :
I have eaten at Guido's several times over the past few years and was always impressed with the food, but not so much with the service. Just recently, we visited again and we were so DISGUSTED with how bad the service was that we didn't even stay and eat this time.For example, the waitress never came to our table initially. We had to go the front of the restaurant to try and place an order. This did not work, as we were told to go back and sit down and wait some more. I must also say that as we were waiting in line, the owner, I  presume, ignored us and spoke with some customers behind us in line, putting their orders in immediately. So, in the end, we waited a bit more at our table and then got up and left. Even though the service has tended to be slow and rather inattentive in the past, we have never experienced this level of rudeness before. We will not be back.

Okay I know you aren't going to believe me but I had a tasty lunch at EL Paso Bar B QUe today..Yes, I know it's kind of a chain ...but I think I might go back. You still don't believe me ,do you? My  co-teacher friend and I went  out for lunch today during our first week back at school , before the kids start. Our school is close to El Paso  and BBQ sounded filling for lunch. We don't get to leave for lunch during the school year so it's kind of a last chance deal.We were greeted by a host who had a nice calm style and quickly seated us. The smell of smoked meats had me the minute we walked in .I  am a sucker for the smell of smoked meat . My previous dining experience  had been terrible here but I was reassured by the great host and the fabulous smell that this might be a better meal than last time.  Waitress was courteous , speedy and didn't mess around trying to be overly friendly which I liked.  She promptly brought us our drinks and corn bread muffins which tasted nice according to my friend. I ordered the Brisket lunch  which came with my choice of two sides. There were many choices but I settles on coleslaw and sweet potatoes fries. The portion of the brisket was way more than enough served with a sweet BBQ sauce. Lots of  good taste. Not earth shaking but solid and worth the money . Coleslaw was the way I like it not to greasy, lightly sweet and crunchy. The sweet potato fries were a nice extra, not highly seasoned but not greasy either. They were a good accompaniment  to the sweetness of the sauce. My friend had the turkey wrap which looked great and was grilled ,interesting... While this is not the best BBQ in the city , the strong points may be the good ,fast lunchtime service I experienced today . The food was tasty and not expensive considering the time it takes to smoke and cook brisket.  Great place to take mom and dad for BBQ or the family after church on Sunday.  Grandma nd Grandpa will love it! Considering its proximity to a Super Target and my work , I can see it being a place totake  the family for dinner when I have a busy day and have to go back to school at night for meetings.Also noted they had a large Patio like room  that would be great for large groups...It always seems like when you had something for along time you take it for granted , then it is taken away and you miss it. So it is with El Paso , I haven't always liked El Paso as much as the last two times I was there. The last two times great food and service.Great conversation with the Manager, then bam the doors are closed. Talked to a friend in the know who had done charity events with them and he says that the chain has been hurting and the two AZ locations were the only two left. They say there is a small chance they may reopen but it doesn't look good.  Fair thee well El Paso , I barely knew you.

You know that hole-in-the-wall Mexican/Chinese/Italian/Indian/Etc place you love that has pretty solid food and reasonable prices, the people are friendly and the decor is...hole-in-the-wall?Well, add Aloha Kitchen to the list as your hole-in-the-wall Hawaiian place.  The are friendly, relatively fast, priced for the beer budget and quite tasty indeed.Like a ripe pineapple ready to be eaten, Aloha Kitchen, um, Aloha Kitchen...I really have no idea where to go with the pineapple setup there.  The whole pineapple thing just seemed apropos to the Hawaiian theme and, oh well.Try it, you'll like it.

Review Text :
I am ashamed...ashamed to say I had the best carne asada fries last weekend, and it was NOT in San Diego. There are a lot of taco shops in Chandler. Apparently, word is they are not very good, except for Los Favoritos. I scoffed. My San-Diego-friends-now-residing-in-AZ kept trying to convince me how good it was. I scoffed again. HA! Finally, I decided to go, just to compare. What a snob.Looks like every other taco shop I've been to, maybe a little cleaner. Carne Asada fries is not on the menu, so you have to ask for it. I opened up that styrofoam box, and it was pretty. No, really. I haven't had carne asada fries that good...ever...so far...Recommendations:Chicken rolled tacos, quesadilla, pretty much carne asada anything.Sigh.  The taco plate was skimpy and bland.  I don't mind getting a small portion, but don't charge me $8.21 for it.Get ready to drench your flavor-challenged tacos in hot sauce.  Maybe try a burrito instead?One word: disappointing.This place is usually infested with high schoolers and that makes me stressed.  Have I become a bitter old lady?  Bah hambug!Anyways, I've been coming here for years.  I was introduced to this place some time during my ASU days by some guys I use to hang with.  While their food might not be traditional, I always enjoy my meal.  The place is decorated sparingly and the tables aren't the cleanliest [high school hangout, remember?], the portions are great for the price you pay.  I usually get the carne asada burrito combo,the California burrito combo, or the shrimp burrito.  You get moist fluffy rice, decent refried beans, and a giant [not Chipotle giant or anything but a good size] burrito for the combo.  I love how they don't pack their burritos with cheap "filler" ingredients.  They seriously stuff your burrito with a ton of flavorful meat!I'll probably keep coming back for many years to come when I need me some Americanized-Mexican eats although I rather take my food to-go because high schoolers are the bane of my existence.  Wee!  If only their red sauce was spicier...

Review Text :
I have to say that I fought going here tonight for dinner. I mean, I am in Arizona and there are Fleming's restaurants in California, so like any good yelper of course I'm going to want to experience the best and most unique restaurants that Arizona has to offer. However, this just so happens to be my brother's favorite restaurant so he won because this was our family's last supper, of sorts, before we leave him by his lonesome in Phoenix. Well off to Fleming's we went and it was fabulous. For a chain restaurant Fleming's does it right; nice decor, impeccable food, excellent service and over 100 different types of wine. Our server was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and the wine list and checked up on us at all the appropriate moments. The additional support wait staff was very attentive so much so that when (like the klutz that I am) spilled the last sip of wine all over myself, he quickly took my sweater to the bathroom where he blotted it with ice water and handed it back to me in a Fleming's handle bag and recommended that I take it to the dry cleaners and ask that they treat it with the spray that removes wine stains. What a sweetheart! We ordered the sweet chili calamari to start along with a bowl of roasted corn chowder soup with lobster, shrimp and potatoes. I ordered the petite fillet mignon cooked medium rare, my bro had the 20 oz steak and my mom had the Mahi Mahi. All of it was amazing. We finished it off with creme brule and our bill was about 2 bills. Overall it was a great experience and I'm glad my brother won this round.My 100th Review~ Dear Fleming's,Thank you for another unforgettable evening of being wined and dined.From the moment I walked in you gave me your undivided attention.In fact I don't think you ever left my side the whole time I was there.My glasses stayed full and the food was splayed out before me in perfect succession. My compliments to the Chef for the flawless preparation of my Sweet Chile Calamari, Corn Chowder with Lobster, Crab and Shrimp, The Mix Grill (Lemon Pepper Mahi Mahi, Poppy seed and Pepper encrusted seared Ahi and Lemon Pepper Scallops), 12oz Filet perfectly rare, the Chipotle Mac and Cheese,  your signature Fleming's potatoes and the cutest accompaniment of "F" shaped butter served with Hot bread.(see pics)Just when I though it couldn't get any better you end my feast with a dish of the most  heavenly creme brulee and chantilly cream I've ever put my lips to,complete with a candle to celebrate my Anniversary! You made me fall in love with you all over again. S.W.A.K!Once upon a time Fleming's was the place culinary dreams are made of, but alas things are a changin'! The last couple times I've visited I was increasingly unimpressed. Just last week I took my husband for his birthday dinner as we do every year. Boy what a let down. Lets start with the raggedy family wearing their beanies and Harley Davidson baseball caps that was seating right in front of me............ Hello Dress Code......Manners......Anyone?? Why did I bother dressing to the nines? I could have worn  my pajamas and nobody would have cared. That right there just made me feel I might as well have went to Black Angus. Now for the waiter who lacked the experience and training to be serving in a fine dining establishment. He was HORRIBLE!!! Unprofessional, Inattentive, and Careless to sum it up. He was so interested in my nationality that he had to ask me my heritage, then made a point to reference something Greek each time he returned to the table.......So Annoying! Not to mention bringing me dirty water and wine glasses, even the little wine decanter they bring your wine in was dirty. Now for my salad, I always order the Fresh Mozzarella and Tomato salad, this time it was apparent they improvised, the mozzarella was not near the quality it usually is and instead of sweet sliced tomatoes and fresh basil it came with chopped grape tomatoes on top of shaved cucumber. (see pics) I really should have complained, but being the Hubby's birthday I wanted to spare him the scene. For my entree I decided on the Chefs Mixed Grill, Petite fillet, Tempura Shrimp and Seared Scallops. Although as always I asked to replace the steak with an extra shrimp and scallop as I don't eat beef. I got a plate of SIX GIANT scallops and three shriveled shrimp. I had to send it back because I was told I was getting Tempura Shrimp and these shrimp were not. They returned it to me quickly but still was overkill on the scallops (see pics) in the pic you cant see the other side of the plate had 3 more scallops. I would have like another shrimp instead. My Hubby's steak was perfect for him, but he too was very disappointed in all the things I've stated above. Now for the biggest let down of all. Normally for Special Occasions they will bring out their signature Creme' Brulee and Chantilly Cream with a candle. NOT ANY MORE! BOO! We got a cheesy little gold box with four tiny, crappy chocolate covered strawberries....Not a Fan. After this experience I'm sorry to say that we will not be going back ever again. They are lucky to be getting these three stars.09/01/10My first, and (so far) only, visit to Fleming's.  I give it 2.5 stars...First thing I noticed was that it was very dark inside- a pet peeve of mine.  Second, the service looked either harried or aloof.  Where were the smiling faces?  It was 4:15 pm, which meant the doors had just opened 15 minutes ago, and there weren't many guests yet waiting to be seated.  (There were about eight people at the bar area.)  I soon met my server, whose cold gaze and unsmiling face already had me thinking maybe this place was not such a good idea.  After studying the menu, I decided I'd try the Prime Burger for $6. I also asked if I could sample a couple of red wines before ordering a glass of one.  I've been to many venues where this is not a problem, and sometimes, when I can't decide, even willingly offered!  This Fleming's location isn't one of these venues.  My query brought about a more negative change of attitude from my server, but I did get to try two very small samples before choosing a glass.While I waited for the burger to arrive, I began to boot up my laptop- thank goodness I brought it, bec. the burger took a long time...  The bar area was filling up fast, and the servers started to look even more agitated that I was starting to wonder what was all the fuss?  Finally, just under 20 minutes later, my beautiful burger arrived.  Huge patty, smothered w/ cheese and topped w/ thick-cut, peppered, and smoked bacon, tomato, onion, lettuce, and a pretzel bun.  The one huge onion ring was a nice touch.  The burger was juicy (cooked to my specified medium), quite substantial, and delicious w/ the cheddar, veggies, and bun.  The thick-cut bacon, however, was so salty, that I had to take the slices off!  I was a bit disappointed, since it was such a hearty portion of bacon.I wouldn't mind having another Prime burger, minus the bacon, for happy hour again, but I'd choose another location. BTW, as I was enjoying the burger, I finally figured out why all the harried faces and the servers' hustle and bustle-- it seemed like everyone in the bar area had chosen the burger!  The table of six in front of me all had burgers... At $6, it's a steal for diners, but perhaps not expensive enough to garner a nice tip?  Hmm... well, not if the servers' attitudes continue to be cold and distant!I came here recently for a special occasion dinner with my office staff and it was very nice.  The restaurant itself is well designed, with muted colors, dark woods and dimmed lighting.  The wait staff was neatly presented in crisp white shirts and clean, black service aprons.  We prearranged for a pre-printed dinner menu that was labeled as being for our party that night.  I thought that it was a nice touch, and I am well aware that it was also a clever cost containment measure since it also kept our staff from wildly ordering off of the regular Fleming's menu.Our servers were all very gracious and attentive and took very good care of our party of about 25.  Our food was all brought out at the same time, which was no small feat on the kitchen's part.  Everyone seemed genuinely happy with their food, I didn't see anyone complaining about anything.  I ordered the petite filet, medium rare, and it was absolutely perfect in every way.  The meat was cooked perfectly and was tender, moist and delicious.  There were various sides served 'family style' raging from buttered corn to asparagus, and they were all very good as well.  As a dessert I ordered crème brulee, and it was deliciously creamy with the perfectly sugar crust on top.  My only complaint about my food, and it is minor, was that the crème brulee wasn't the ice cold temperature that I usually prefer.  I like my crème brulee pre-fired so that it has time to cool off before I eat it.  I don't care for warm custard, but it's purely a personal preference and I still thought the dessert was fantastic.The only other thing I would point out is that many people aren't fans of the a la carte menu system, it can be annoying, and ridiculously expensive, to order every side dish seperately from the main entree.   That said, this was still a great experience in a wonderful restaurant.  I highly recommend it for any special occasion dinner as long as your budget will allow it.I came because AMEX gave me a $40 gift card, but I stayed because I was totes hungry.It was very fancy, from the moment I sashayed my pretty little self in, to the time I was escorted to my white linened table, with their newfangled iPad wine and dessert list.The parmesan crusty loaf was accompanied by both a feta and sundried tomato spreads, but I like Firebird's bolero loaf better.  The water tasted chlorinated though.  I could understand maybe bleach, ya know, for whiter teethOnce again, I chose the wrong venue to sport my lederhosen and ICP mesh half shirt.  This place was popping, at 9:30pm.  It's nice to see the older generation still having date nights... with what appears to be their granddaughters.  :/My waitress, Megan was an old soul and classy delight.  I am nearly transported to the days of old Hollywood, when people had nannies and rode elevators.  This is surely out of my element, but tonight, I'm self medicating, without the alcohol or Mexican quaaludes.The bone in ribeye was near sheer perfection, with a taste that eschewed my typical topping of gefilte fish with cream.  The Thai green beans were a lil spicy, and a lot of fun.  And I'm pretty sure my Spidey senses were tingling thanks to some green Chile in the taters.  You know... PO-TA-TOES... boil em, mash em, stick em in a stewIs it Five Star day or am I just in a good mood?PF Changs...PeiWei...Teneko's...Flemings?How does Fleming's fit in with the whole asian themed restaurant empire thingy that Peter Fleming put together?I don't know...more importantly, I don't care...Fleming's Steakhouse is the best of the lot by my lights:)Does Fleming's make the best steak in town? Well no, the best steak in town comes off my grill, when I'm in the mood to grill:)But I'm not always in the mood to grill my own steak and when I'm not, Flemings consistently puts a very solid medium rare Rib Eye ( with a little salad and a few string fries) right in front of me (along with a couple of well made Grey Goose marti's:)They do it in a friendly style with  exemplary and easy going service in a warm and welcoming atmosphere...lighter décor than some of the very low lit/dark wood/red velvet steakhouses (BTW...not enough light to read the menu doesn't make the steak taste any better:)Flemings has never done me wrong...I have never felt "optimized" like I do at Ruth's Chris...I haven't felt that I overpaid for mediocre food like I do at Morton's or Mastro's...I never feel that I'm out of place when I show up wearing my shorts, sandals and golf shirt (exquisitely tailored, highly expensive shorts, sandals and golf shirt, but nevertheless:)Flemings is a comfortable and pleasant place to grab a steak:)The Beautiful Carin and I wandered over the other evening, intending to take advantage of the current Happy Hour specials (5 items for $6...5 wines, 5 cocktails and five small plates, each priced at $6...all of which are phenomenal, BTW:)But after a couple of well crafted and astonishingly cold marti's, we decided we wanted dinner:)I had the bone in Rib Eye and Carin had the New York Strip (my girl likes her steak:)We split some shoestring potatoes and grilled asparagus:)Everything was essentially perfect...a little too much food, but we took it home and DeeDee continues to believe that we are The Best People Ever:)The next time you're in the mood for steak and you don't feel like heading out to your grill on a balmy 112 degree Scottsdale evening, put on your shorts and golf shirt, slide into your sandals, get comfy in a booth at Flemings and build yourself a $200 credit card bill.Hey, I never said they were cheap...just good!Courtesy of @Shwaag, I dined at Fleming's with @CaymusCabernet, @RussellOnSteak and @MarianOnWine.I should have written this sooner, but this is my 100th review, and I wanted to reserve that spot for this.I attended an Interactive Wine Dinner, which was an amazing event, and I highly recommend attending one.Our evening began with an amuse of Danish Bleu Cheese and Red Onion on Flatbread. The caramelized onion contrasted with the bleu cheese was phenomenal! I think I ate about 7 of them!This was paired with Caymus' 2008 Conundrum; a blend of Napa and central coast varietals. This was my first experience with a blended white, and I am a fan! Vanilla, melon, pear, mild acidity, really amazing.The combination of the sweet onions, and the vanilla and citrus of the Conundrum, made for a fantastic finish. Yumm!Out next course was an heirloom tomato salad with burrata cheese  (mozzarella), arugula, and diced beets.I'm not a fan of tomatoes by themselves, but these were delicious, hearty, and very fresh. And the spice of the arugula paired with the acid of the tomato, and the creaminess of the burrata, made for a delectable salad. I finished it off, even the beets.This was paired with the 2007 Mer Soleil Silver Unoaked Chardonnay. Very fruity, creamy, beautiful golden wine.Paired with the acid of the tomatoes, and the creaminess of the burrata highlights the richness of the wine wonderfully.For the main course we were served peppercorn-crusted New York Strip with Bordelaise Sauce, Sauteed Escarole and Fingerling Potatoes.The strip was what other cuts of beef aspire to be. The preparation is what other chefs aspire to accomplish.Simplistic, subtle, yet very powerful in both mouth feel, and flavor.The escarole was topped with shaved hard-boiled egg, which was unique, and definitely changed the impact of the escarole. (I'm not particularly fond of it myself)The fingerling potatoes were perfect.The bordelaise could have been delivered in a cup and I'd have happily drank it up.Paired with this course were two Cabernet Sauvignons; a 2000, and a 2008.The 2008 had far too many tannins for my liking. I don't want to pucker up like I've just eaten sand and have dry mouth.The 2000 was much more mild, and was rather delicious.Both paired wonderfully with the grilled meat, and the saltiness of the herbs on the potatoes meshed well with the reds.For dessert we were served Berry Trifle with sour cream pundcake and amaretto mascarpone Cream.OMG. I died and went to heaven. Which I don't believe in. But almost could have.Topped with toasted almond slivers, this dessert was pure bliss. The berries floating in the rich mascarpone, resting atop that delicious yet sinfully good pound cake.As if that wasn't enough to knock your socks off, they paired it with a 2004 Mer Soleil Late Viognier that alone could make you think you were drinking pure sugar, with great flavor.Apricot, honey, orange, balanced acid make for a lush and long finish.An amazing dinner and dessert, but in addition to the fantastic food, we were connected via videoconference with Chef Russell Skall; Fleming's Executive Chef, Chuck Wagner; owner of Caymus Vineyards, and Marian Jansen op de Haar; Fleming's Director of Wine. They fielded questions from several locations that were all conferenced in, making it feel a bit more personal. :)As if all that weren't enough, one of the servers mistakenly switched my tab with another party's. That didn't really bother me, as I understand that mistakes can happen.How it was handled made me want to reserve my 100th review for them; Mike Head, one of the Operating Partner's for the Fleming's in the Scottsdale Hilton, had introduced himself during the event, and had provided me his business card.I was expecting a deposit the night of the event, so the next morning I checked my account, which was how I noticed the disparity between my tab, and the amount my account was debited. (It was a triple digit charge)I emailed Mike, explaining the situation, and requested he contact me.Later in the day I hadn't heard from him, so I called him.Long story less long; he was going to contact my bank and, calling as a merchant, attempt to reverse the charge. He called me back to inform me that, rather than take a chance on there being any delay in me getting my funds back, he just went ahead and took cash to my bank, and deposited it in my account.Nobody does that. Ever.Mike Head of Fleming's did.He even returned my gratuity for the mistake having been made in the first place.And after all that, they still gave me a gift card to entice me to return.Mike Head, and Fleming's of Scottsdale, epitomize what customer service should alway be about.Thank you Fleming's, Caymus Vineyards, Chef Skall, Mike Head, and most importantly, Shwaag, for such an amazing evening.And thanks especially to my date, for being so beautiful. :)If you haven't been to Fleming's, do so at your earliest opportunity.I'd like to share a secret with you. Contrary to common belief, Fleming's is not just an option for a special night on the town! Believe it or not, they offer things like happy hour, prix fixe meals and specials all week long!One of my favorite things is the happy hour. Every weekday they offer five for $5. That means, they offer different appetizers for $5, the burger for $5 and several drinks for only $5. In addition, they have a specialty cocktail every month that has only 99 calories!Met some friends for Easter Dinner here.  I thought it would be packed, but it wasn't.  Since I hadn't had Meat for a while, I was looking forward to this dinner.After browsing the menu, I decided to go for the Porcini Rubbed Filet Mignon (center cut, grilled high country Asparagusspears, Gorgonzola Cream Sauce).  For a side dish, I selected the Chipotle Mac & Cheese.  My friends ordered a bottle of Wine and we were good to go!The Filet was soooo good!  The Gorgonzola Cream Sauce added a rich, creamy flavor to the succulent center cut Filet.  I requested it Medium and it was cooked to perfection.  The Chipotle Mac & Cheese was a perfect complement to the Filet.....I highly recommend it.The service was pretty good to.  Our glasses of Wine were never empty and we ordered a Chocolate Lava Cake w/Vanilla Ice Cream & Whipped Cream and split it between the 3 of us.  It was awesome!Overall, it was a great dinner with good friends.Return Factor - 100%Was at Flemings attending an event and even though the event had some amazing food and great wines, we were wanting something a little bit more, so we spoke to the manager (who was in the party) and told him we would like a table for 2 for dinner, and he was delighted and got us seated pretty quickly.Once we were seated our server came by, he introduced himself and offered us a glance at the wine list, but we had to let him know that we just came from the private party were the wine was flowing, but we did order a large bottle of Acqua Panna. If God were to cry, Acqua Panna would be his tears, it's just one of my favorite bottles of water. Some great tasting bread was offered as well.After checking out the menu I knew what I wanted. I ordered the main Filet Mignon with a steak companion of King Crab with Herb Butter topped with Caviar. We also ordering some sides, the Fleming's Potatoes & Grilled Asparagus. Let's talk about the steak, this was definitely the star of the plate, I like my steak still pink, and this was cooked perfectly, oh and it was so smooth like butter! The king crab was the perfect side to this great steak, it picked up the flavors of the herb butter very well, and who doesn't love some caviar! This was a great steak! The grilled asparagus was cooked just right, tender yet not too much so, can't believe I didn't like them as a child, now I can't get enough of it! The Fleming's potatoes oh they were a surprise, they are a potato au gratin style with cream, jalapenos & cheddar cheese, oh they were divine! I think potatoes should come like this all time. We had great service, excellent dishes, l look forward to my next visit!Just came over for HH on the patio.  First off the service was awesome.  My favorite of the four appetizers I ordered was the homemade burrata.  The prime burger is very filling and a popular choice for the night, at least one person from every table ordered one.  The calamari was soft and sweet but I think crispier may have been better.  The carpaccio was good but not as savory just creamier.   Regardless the red blend was a great pairing for the above appetizers.

I am completely and utterly confused about these reviews?!! For years I have heard about how great the food is and how people always by the salsa and chips. I ordered a burrito of some type and cut it open and then water yep..water poured out of this burrito. I was like WTF?I regretly tried a bite and it was dry flavorless and the little flavor it did have tasted like fish!!! The water must have been from it being premade and frozen, Or almost rotten and frozen to save it a few extra days.The chips were stale and thick gross had a strange flavor. The salsa was so gross it was unedible. What is wrong with you people, did you drop acid before you ate here?

My Son and I were in the area volunteering at Three Square and decided to stop by here during our lunch break.  The parking lot was packed and we had to wait around 10 min for our table....this was at 12:10 pm, the worst time to be heading to lunch.  The wait was worth it though.Once we were seated we browsed the menu and decided to order the Queso Fundido w/Chorizo appetizer ($6.95), Beef & Bean Chimichanga lunch special ($8.25), and Pollo Amador lunch special ($10.25).  I also asked the waiter if the cook could put together a really spicy Habanero Salsa for us....he said sure.  We were served complimentary Chips, Salsa, and Beans while we waited for our food....+1.  The Salsa reminded me of the Salsa at Lindo/Bonito Michoacan.  I read the menu that had the story of Zapata, but couldn't find any connection between the restaurants.....the Salsa was that close to one another.  Anyway, it was really good.....had a nice kick to it.  The Chips weren't as fresh as I like them to be....but they were good.After a short wait our Queso Fundido came out....again, it reminded me of the one at Lindo/Bonito Michoacan.  It was very delicious.  On top of the dish is an extremely hot Pepper....I think it's a grilled Jalapeno or Poblano (see pics)....whatever it is, I like it.I ordered the Beef & Bean Chimichanga and it came out a few minutes later....along with the Habanero Salsa.  The Beef was shredded and very delicious, not greasy.  Sometimes when you order a Beef Chimichanga it can be very greasy....not here.  It was a nice size too.....must be their lunch portion.  The Habanero Salsa was really spicy....just how I like it!  It added to the flavor.  My dish also came with Guacamole & Sour Cream and a side of Refried Beans & Rice.....all very good.My Son enjoyed his Pollo Amador.  He gave me a bite to try it out.  It is Chicken marinated in Amador Sauce (whatever that is).  The Sauce had a slightly sweet tomatoey flavor to it.....it was very good.Overall, it was a nice lunch.Will we return?  If we're in the area and in the mood for some Mexican Food....you can count on it.In Love again!I asked around for a good romantic place to take a date. The name Viva Zapata's kept coming up by friends recommending it. The name didn't sound very romantic, it sounded more revolutionary, but maybe that's what I needed some kind of revolution in my life since nothing else was working out, So I decided to give it a try.  We agreed to meet there at eight, but I got there at seven, I didn't want to be late  and I wanted to get a feel of the place and make sure it met my expectations. As i walked in i knew i would like the place, nice decor dim lighting and live music. I proceeded to the bar and ordered a margarita and listened to the guitar man play someone Else's life with his fingers.  it was a really good margarita it actually had tequila in it. The bartender brought some complimentary chips and salsa and some bean dip. I didn't want to start eating since my date hadn't arrived yet, but one chip loaded with bean dip wouldn't hurt. After two bowls of chips and bean dip and three margaritas I decided to order an appetizer, Something light, so I ordered the seviche and let me tell you, it was the best seviche I have tried this far from the ocean, it couldn't be any fresher or tastier. It was soo good I decided to stick with the mariscos (seafood) and ordered the camarones borrachos, (like me)  Shrimp sauteed with garlic, spices and tequila, the perfect combination. You just can't go wrong with that, It was out of this world goodness! All in all I had a wonderful time.  When you get caught between great food, a nice romantic ambiance and a guitar, you can't help  It but to fall in love. ....My date? Didn't make it.....But I fell in love nonetheless..... with the food at Viva Zapata's.                                                 PS.  Don't text and drive. You don't want to miss dinner!I came in for lunch and just barely beat the rush. It was just after 11 am and the parking lot filled up quickly. Inside the dining area there is an okay amount of room with options for a booth or table, but sometimes there is still a small wait to be seated since it gets so busy. There was a good amount of staff on hand to take care of the customers and during my visit our server checked on us often. We started with complimentary chips, salsa and bean dip. The salsa had a fresh taste, but I didn't care for it and it was think instead of thick which I personally prefer. Chips and bean dip were great. The beans really had a nice flavor. The menu has a lot of options. On the back of the menu there were over 30 different combinations for lunch specials. The specials run from 10 am - 5 pm Monday thru Friday with prices ranging from $8.95 - $11.95 and meals include rice, beans and drink. Priced at $9.95 I chose a beef taco and cheese enchilada. The taco was filled with a nice portion of shredded beef and had tons of freshly grated cheese. I loved the taste of the taco shell and all of the cheese, but the beef lacked flavor for me. The cheese enchilada was really good and they didn't skimp with cheese inside or out. The beans like the dip didn't disappoint however there could have been more cheese on the beans. The rice was a bit dry, so I'll just get all beans next time. I was stuffed at the end of my meal and satisfied. Solid spot for lunch or dinner and great for the whole family.

Review Text :
If this place were a bar by itself on a street somewhere, I'd probably be considering it for 4 stars.  Unfortunately, like many things in Las Vegas, it is tucked away in the corner of an obscenely large casino.  The casino in question is WAY off the strip.  The pub is up on the second or third floor and way off in the corner.    Our search for this place felt like an episode of  Lord of the Rings:  Following signs, backtracking, splitting up and meeting again, etc.  We had a great advantage over the hobbits in that we had our cell phones to keep in touch.  Furthermore, we could stop and rest along the way with booze, food, and of course craps.  Those poor little hobbits...Our 8 person party was escorted to a table through a labyrinth of small rooms/anterooms and seated for dinner.  We drank like fish, ate lots of fish and chips, and enjoyed the band.  It was for the most part a great bar band, the kind you often see in Vegas if you're just walking around.  It was a little jarring to have to leave the nice dark wood and dim lighting of the pub to go out into the casino and find the restroom, but we all survived.  Unless you're already out in Green Valley for some reason, I can't imagine any great reason to hit this place.  However if you are already in the building, it's a decent place to drink.  They also show lots of Rugby, Premier League, and other European/International sporting events at the usual early morning time if you're so inclined.

Not much for atmosphere, but there is a reason they have been here for so long. Fantastic Gyro meat, and their lunch special which includes a Gyro, fries and a drink for only $8.95.Glad I found this little lunch spot.

This is really good Mexican food on a budget. The decor is standard, the service is wonderful, and the food is amazing. I have been to this location several times and have been pleased with everything I have ever ordered. The tostadas and the chimichingas really stand out in my memory.Their chips and salsa are some of the best I have tasted.We were in the mood for some Mexican food and stumbled across this joint.  It's a casual dining place with 15 or so tables and a small bar.  Complimentary Chips & Salsa are included with your meal.  They give you 2 types of Salsa.....Mild and Spicy.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HTlsBAd9j1wlWDHxnYczBw?select=7TDycarU8SKS1PQzilc2_wThe Spicy Salsa is very good.....the Chips are very thin and break easily....so they got 1/2 of that right.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HTlsBAd9j1wlWDHxnYczBw?select=9NUxLme4YMrPXxSrw5vkHwFor dinner we ordered:Cheese Crisp Appetizer - $7.25http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HTlsBAd9j1wlWDHxnYczBw?select=W6kOQlY8S8ke97Of4UQkFg#11 Cheese Enchilada Combo (Enchilada, Beans, Rice) - $11.50http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HTlsBAd9j1wlWDHxnYczBw?select=UJEi2YPoYm73iJrXOdz1lACarnitas Burrito - $9http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HTlsBAd9j1wlWDHxnYczBw?select=1_A4f--rniKJFcd3UfGG5ASide of Sour Cream - $1.352 Glasses of House Cabernet - $6.75The Cheese Crisp was very good.  It's like an open faced Quesadilla with the Tortilla cooked nice and crispy.The Cheese Enchilada was OK....kind of salty.The Better Half enjoyed her Carnitas Burrito, but she said it wasn't anything special.  She only ate 1/2 of it....took the other 1/2 home.  The glasses of Wine was hers also....and thought it was ok, what could you expect from house Wine?Overall, it was an OK dinner....did not 'wow' us.Return Factor - 40%If La Fonda Del Sol existed in New York City, there would be a line around the block waiting to get seats. The irony, of course, is that Arizonans consider this to be perfectly passable Mexican food, but a far cry from palate-pleasing perfection. I suppose I find myself bitter knowing that such deliciousness could be viewed with such a blasé indifference by Phoenix's elite critics; in New York, we still seek out the one true answer to the Mexican food problem, yet in Phoenix, the answer is so abundant it produces disenchantment.Well, friends, we'd gladly take your La Fonda Del Sol. You get to keep the rest of those Mexican restaurants you love, so it's only a minor loss. In exchange, you may have a Rosa Mexicana and a Dos Caminos. Nay, don't thank me.So, La Fonda.... Truly spicy, homemade salsa; perfectly crisp chile rellenos bathed in cheese, crusty chimichangas battered in love and ambrosia, husk-wrapped tamales that taste homemade; huge portions, incredibly low prices. This is what it's all about.Yeah, the tacky pastel Mexican decorations are unnerving and the service is slow and often panicked, but these are minor gripes.When it's all said and done, these idiots forklift themselves into the waiting lines of NYPD Pizza (HA! HAHAHA!) and Oregano's (BAHH! HAHA!) while overlooking the real gem that sits in between them. Well, if you're a New Yorker like me, you're not gonna try either of those wrecks anyhow; go get some Mexican.

Review Text :
Technically, Roy's is outside the northern boundary of which I would drive for a meal, but since it was to be a free meal and I wouldn't be doing the driving, how could I say no?  It is a chain, but in Roy's defense, the majority of the menu items are created by the local chefs with only a portion of the menu available at all restaurants.  Roy's is billed as Hawaiian fusion, but my first thought was "oh no, there's sushi on the menu, I won't like this place."  I am happy to say I was wrong.  Don't let my husband read this.  He thinks I'm never wrong.My husband also always says I'm stuck in the 80's, so I ordered the 1988 cocktail (grapefruit and pomegranate with a grapefruit vodka and lychee liqueur).  Since I was the lone drinker, I stuck with one, but could have easily had 2 or 3 more of these, especially with a little Duran Duran background music.  We started with Roy's Canoe Appetizer for Two, adjusted for three.  It includes lobster potstickers and teppanyaki shrimp, both of which were really good.  Also on the boat were Thai beef satay and spicy tuna roll, neither of which I tried.  My husband vouched for the tuna roll, however.Next up was the grilled endive, apple, and bleu cheese salad with pomegranate vinaigrette.  If you're a salad lover, you would probably love it.  If you're a salad hater, you would probably love it, too.  For my entree, the pancetta crusted Alaskan halibut with tomatoes and chevre, mushroom ravioli.  This, too, was fantastic, although there was a little too much oil on the plate, maybe from the pancetta??  But the fish was nicely prepared and the ravioli was excellent.My husband insisted on the chocolate souffle which must be ordered at the start of your meal, but due to a glitch with our pregnant server needing a bathroom break, it didn't get put in early enough.  We waited and were given a starter dessert on the house, and both the server and the gal who forgot to put the order in both profusely apologized.  Hey, I would gladly welcome another screw up if a second dessert was involved.  The souffle was lick your plate good and the blueberry tart (I think that was the name of it) was incredibly good as well.  So good, I may have to break my driving rule and have dessert there again.Probably 4.5 stars, but I'm feeling stingy today.Every once in a while, I will be treated to a nice dinner and a medical talk - this was one of those times.....Let's just start with saying that rollin up to a JW Marriott in a Chevy Cobalt really makes all the Beemers and Benz's pop out. After non-valeting my ride and walking the mandatory 100 yards to get to the resort, my breath was already taken away by the sheer grandiosity of the resort and the colorful flowers. Roy's is on the first floor of the resort...which will throw you off because the ground floor is considered the 2nd level.Hostess and wait staff were super friendly, I wasn't sure what the reservation was under but they made the situation light and directed me to where I needed to go. Started off with the Crunchy Golden Lobster Potstickers in a Togarashi Miso Butter Sauce...Yeah, I don't know what togarashi is, but I think he was in the hot dog eating competition at coney island last year. Either way, it was good - the perfect amount of sauce to complement the lobster meat. Definitely a must try. Also had the Golden Coconut Shrimp that came with a Mustard Mango Sweet & Sour Sauce and that I could've done without. The shrimp tasted fresh, but overall I thought it may have been a little bland. I guess I like a little bit more spice or lemony kick to my shrimp. I probably would have like to try the calamari instead.The last appetizer I had was the Crispy Spicy Ahi Sushi Roll with Ginger Wasabi and I could have eaten this all day long. Hands down the number one appetizer to try. I never eat Ahi, but the wasabi kick did just enough for me to go back for 2nds and 3rds.For the actual dinner, I started off with what seemed like the house salad. For this salad, you will need a knife in addition to your fork. It's not often I get confused by food, but I literally had to slice each piece of lettuce because it comes as one big piece. The herb dressing was super good and made the salad. You only get a couple of tomatoes and cucumber slices, but hey - your salad isn't supposed to be filling, so I was okay with it.For the main entree, I got the Roy's Roasted Macadamia Nut Crusted Mahi Mahi....and with that I will make a qualifying statement that I don't eat much fish. I prefer beef and chicken over fish during every day of the week, but since the ahi sushi roll was so good, I decided to get a little fishy. I will also say that I've never had Mahi Mahi before, but for as much fun as it is to say Mahi Mahi, it tasted just as fun as it sounds. It has the perfect amount of "crusty-ness" and it just flaked and melted in my mouth. The Mahi Mahi comes layered on top of grilled asparagus, which is layered on top of medium sliced roasted potatoes. One bite - multiple tastes - and it all works. Usually I'm a little hesitant when chef's try to combine too much different flavors into one bite, but it really worked with this entree. Finished up with a dessert platter and the best one was the cheesecake, the crust was the best part. Pair it with the coffee and you've got a great ending.P.S. Just because it's a chain, doesn't always mean that the restaurant is bad!We have eaten at Roy's all over...IL, AZ, CA,  HI. Since Outback has bought them, the food has denigrated to average to below average to poor. And the waitstaff has become inattentive at best. Ate at the Roy's in Desert Ridge at the JW Marriott in Phoenix. Sat outside where it was a beautiful evening. Had to ask the waiter for any specials. Wife and aunt ordered seafood trio of butterfish, mahi mahi and salmon. Butterfish, their signature dish was mushy and tasteless, not dry and flaky. Mahi was dry. Salmon not cooked thoroughly.I had the scallops. Three sea scallops over something non-descript. Not even any rice or veggies. Delicious, but a small portion for over $30. Usually, midway during the meal the server asks if anyone wants a lava cake or upside down cake, as it takes time to prepare. This time nothing. After finishing the entrees, server comes over and asks if anyone wants dessert, then omits the upside down cake from the offerings. I had to remind him. Eaten at Roy's oodles of times before, but now its a very pricey Outback. Awful and won't be returning.

I tried the Friday buffet here with fellow yelpers Rand, Mike, and Robyn. There are just a little over a dozen items but all were really good, and the grilled chicken deserves special mention - it was fantastic, like no other grilled chicken I've tried anywhere else. The other items were mostly standard dishes found in other Mediterranean restaurants, but prepared very well here. Also, each person who partakes of the buffet is served a tender, very nicely seasoned lamb shank - that alone would already justify the price of the whole buffet!  In all it was a really delicious meal, and a really great deal at 10 bucks.This place has the greatest chicken kabobs ever, they are never burnt and always super juicy. The marinade is delicious! They say it takes 15 min because they are cooked to order, but I swear I have never waited more than 8 min for it to arrive. A plate comes with 3 sides and is usually always choose tabouli, hummus and baba. It's always served with just enough pita and the plate is filling for $9. It's really hard not to come here every day for lunch.  I crave the tabouli, they make it the best, just a little bit of bulgar wheat and lots of lemon juice and the onions and tomatoes are expertly diced. The service is unbelievably friendly and parking is adequate. The place is super close to asu and mcc so it's a great spot for lunch or study break food. I notice you can also call ahead and order pick up. They grocery also has great products and some fun frozen foods to try. Now if only I could just eat more I'd order the princess platter all for myself!

Restaurant name  Cyclo Vietnamese Cuisine

Review Text :
The food at Cyclo is entirely over-shadowed by its outrageous owner, Justina Duong.  If Justina was a gay man, she would make a great drag queen.  I think she's a hoot, but her outlandish behavior and brash comments do not work for everyone.  I have a very dear friend who lives in Chandler and she and I would go into Cyclo quite often.  My friend is married with three kids, but just she and I would go in.  She would always tell Justina about her family and show her pictures of the kids.  Justina really gets into teasing the customers and after a couple of years, she told my friend, "You crazy fag-hag.  You never bring your family in here.  You just come in with your gay friend.  You don't even have a family.  Crazy Lady, you just carry around those pictures to make your lonely self feel better."  Justina also plays up the Vietnamese accent.  She can be off-putting at first if you don't know what's up, but the floor show never disappoints if you're willing to play along.The food is good enough now, but it was better when the restaurant first opened.  The star dishes include Tom Rang Hat Tieu, an appetizer of shrimp on toasted baguette slices with a savory black pepper sauce that is plate lickin' good.  Another delicious starter is Banh Xeo.  It's a crispy rice crepe with shrimp, pork, sprouts, and lettuce leaves for wrapping the crepe slices before you eat them.  For entrees, Ca Ri Ga is a tasty chicken and pineapple curry and Com Tam is a mixed grill of a marinated pork chop, beef, shrimp, and egg over broken rice.  As a side dish, the Dau Xanh Xao Toi is a sublime preparation of spicy garlic green beans with chili and sweet soy.  However, the quality now varies.  The last time I went the pineapple curry was totally bland.  Even though I have eaten at this place many times, I didn't say anything because I didn't want to be bothered with Justina's reaction.  Instead, I haven't been back.  I have been into Cyclo when Justina was not there and the quality of the food was nowhere near the same in her absence.  My concern is that Justina has announced plans (yet again) to open a second Cyclo in the Valley.  This time it's supposed to be on Central Avenue south of Camelback and across from Brophy with a fall 2008 opening.  Once that place opens, I assume Justina will move her floor show to central Phoenix and I am left to wonder if the quality of the food will continue to slip in Chandler.Cyclo has a BYOB policy and some people are really into it.  For me, it's not a huge selling point.  I prefer not to schlep my own booze to a restaurant, but it's cool if you're into it.If you go to Cyclo, hope that Justina is there.  You're really going to Cyclo for Justina's antics rather than the food.What the pho, man?!The food is bland.  It tastes like they cater to the elderly.The prices are high for the type of food you are getting.  Nobody should have to bay over $5.75 for ANY type of pho.  I've gone there 2x and I don't know if it's just me, but the hostess there just rubbed me the wrong way both times.  She was cracking jokes and making comments that were borderline inappropriate.  They focus more on decor and trying to "entertain" their patrons rather than focusing on what's really important... the food.You want a really good, AUTHENTIC bowl of Pho?  Go to Saigon Pho on Alma School/Knox.  It's not as ritzy and refined, but the pho and other menu items there are less expensive, tastes better, and they serve you much larger portions.  Eat at Cyclo if you want to have a SEEMINGLY over-attentive hostess bothering you while you try to eat.  (I say "seemingly" because while you may think she's over-attentive, in reality, she hasn't even done as much as refill your water glass.)My family went here for dinner and I am 100% sure the staff, especially Justine, was prejudiced against us because we were Vietnamese.  The Pho was mediocre and all the food we ordered were overpriced.  While Justine made her rounds to chat, flirt, and engage all her Caucasian guests, we were ignored and forgotten.  And by "forgotten," I mean, they didn't bring out our food until we reminded them we existed.  Yes, the greens and food were fresh. However, calling this place a Vietnamese restaurant would be comparable to calling Taco Bell a Mexican restaurant.We didn't care so much about the price as long as the food was good. However, since both the food was sub-par and the service was terrible, this is one place we will not be returning to.

Wanda's is a basic Diner with a Mexican twist.  I've eaten here once and it was good enough that I'll be back.  The food was fresh, fast and good.  I had a very basic scrambled eggs with cheese, hash browns with onions, toast and bacon.  This breakfast for me is the yardstick for judging Diners.  The eggs were perfect-not firm and overdone, not the least bit runny.  Toast, bacon, potato's were just right as well.As Amy B said, the space is on the small side and seating is limited.A hands down winner over IHOP, Denny's or any other chain Diner.

If I didn't have a big pizza in front of my face, I would have thought I ordered a big serving of attitude with a side of screw you.Maybe it's because we came in with a coupon...but this place had more ego than a 15 minute celebrity.  Not to knock small, family owned places (usually I love going to places like that, because USUALLY you get a friendly family feel), but for a pizza joint located in a shopping center next to Albertson's, they sure wanted to make you think you were eating caviar.Things not so awesome:1.  Whomever answered the phone didn't know East from West to be able to give directions2.  Our waitress couldn't give any suggestions on the food3.  They can't do a half and half pizza unless you paid extra4.  You pay a charge if you want to split a plate of food5.  ATTITUDE, ATTITUDE, ATTITUDE6.  Tip was already included in our billI've never been to a family run pizzeria that can't do a half and half pizza, and the only restaurants I've ever been to that charge to split a plate of food are ones where you'd feel more comfortable wearing  a dress - definitely not one in a strip mall like this one.I swear if the two waitresses rolled their eyes or huffed any more than they already did, they probably would have fainted from lack of oxygen and vertigo.And last time I looked, I believe I was old enough to do my own math for your tip.  If you were so scared we were going to stiff you on your tip, maybe you should learn a little something called Cuss-toe-mer Sur-viss.Foodwise, the pizza was not the best I've ever had, in fact it was a bit on the dry side.   I can't say it was absolutely horrible, but neither can I say I was in heaven.  The wings were much better, in my opinion.For the pain of the drive and having to dodge eye daggers, this is a definite no-peat.RUDE OWNER!We have been going to Grimaldi's now Grazzianos for 10 years.  We are a family of 5 and My stepson who is 26, and husband are BIG eaters. They can easily eat enough food for a family of 6 all by themselves. Today, we walked out and vowed never to return because of the owners rude behavior. We love the wings and the happy hour specials and always support a family business over the big boys. Anyhoooo....If you order hot wings it must be in increments of at least 6 and you get a dressing. If you order in increments of 12, you still only get one dressing. So my stepson has 2 orders of 6, just so he can get his 2 dressings. Well when they refused to give him 2, without charging him the extra .59 cents. I mean the money won't break us, but the principal of it all is crazy. So he calls the owner over and asks her. As soon as she got to our table she was rude and told him in a tone "so basically your wanting to get out of paying the extra .59 cents. No" I have never seen a restaurant owner speak to someone like this. Then we called her back when the food arrived, and she struts over to our table and first thing out of her mouth was "Now what?!" Really? That left a bad taste in our mouth and he told her "forget it. Give me the check for the drinks and salad. We are leaving" She argues and says "over .59 cents?" He says "No. Over your attitude, I did not need to be talked to like that" She says "You don't understand how expensive ranch dressing is!" In her condescending tone. I was floored. She lost our weekly business for sure. Now, as a restaurant owner she should have written off the ranch dressing as we have been loyal customers for YEARS. The other people who work there are nice and I feel bad for them, if she treats her customers like this imagine how she treats them. I hope she sees this review and responds with her feedback. SHE has no one to blame  for lost business but herself.

Review Text :
Yet another decent hole in the wall/mom and pop type of place to check out if you're in the area! Before you come here, let be known that its CASH ONLY!Just like any new place I check out I usually go with the namesake of the place if it applies. So what I got was the Fish, Chicken, and Chips Combo ($8.25). You get two pieces of battered fish and chicken along with potato chips. The fish was tender and flaky. The chicken was bit chewy because it was a bit dry. The potato chips are comparable nilla wafers thicknesswise but were just a tad bigger. Im thinking if dude  makes it with some kind of seasoning, it would surely be a hit for it was already decent the way it was.If you refer to my pic, when the guy brings it out to you on a tray, it comes complete with ranch, ketchup, tartar sauce, and hot sauce. That's awesome! You have all the condiments you need!While I was eating, I noticed that other people that came in ordered Korean dishes mainly Bulgogi and Kim Chi Soup. Man, all it did was give me more incentive to come back and order those very same items. Oh, before I forget, this place is an American/Korean/Chinese type of cuisine. So basically, you can eat here every day for about 6 months and not have the same thing. Here are just some of the things that you would probably catch your eye after looking over the menu. Frog Legs, Oxtail Soup, Fried Pineapple, Kalbi Short Ribs, and Deep Fried Eggplant.Minus 1 star because of the cash only policy and the location. Quick story. As I park my car and get out, this guy comes out of nowhere asking me if I wanted to buy some weed from him. I said, no thanks, I am here for the fish and chips. He responded with oh yeah, the fish and chips are bomb here. Then off he went like nothing happened.In closing, food and service here is great. I just dont think coming here at night would be a good idea especially if you are alone. Which reminds me. The business hours are Monday thru Saturday 10:30 am to 8 pm. Closed sundays. These guys are located in a strip mall on the corner of Las Vegas Blvd and Cheyenne Ave. Check them out.Yelp 2014 365 Review Challenge #129 "Fish n Chips and other stuff"

Review Text :
A friend of mine introduced me to this place several years ago before I moved here.  Since I moved here, we've dined here three times.  It's a fun, casual place to take your family and enjoy bar food.  Here's a breakdown of what I've had:Philly Cheesesteak Sandwich (Whole, $14.95) - Really good.  The Bread is decent and the Whole sized portion is enough for 2 people.Uncle Sam's Special Pizza (18" Large, $23.95) - It has virtually every topping on it.  Because it's crammed with toppings, it tends to get a little soggy even if it's ordered well done, which is how I order it.  Flavor is pretty good.  We always take a few slices home and it heats up well for leftovers.Wings (Baker's Dozen, $7.95) - Our friends don't like the really spicy stuff, so we always order the Medium spice level and the Spicy on the side.  The Wings are really good.  Always served hot and they break away from the bone well.  The Spicy sauce isn't too Spicy....I like spicy food, so it's about average for me.Large basket of Fries $3.23 - Decent sized basket.  Can serve 2-3 people.  Average flavor, reminds me of Wendy's Fries in terms of size and style.Large basket of Fried Zucchini $4.95 - Can serve 2-3 people.  The flavor is average.  Always served hot and crispy.  I've never had soggy Zucchini here, which is a pet peeve.The restaurant has plenty of seating and can easily accommodate a large group.  During one visit we had 8 people and it was very comfortable.  The Happy Hour here is pretty good, but I've never been able to try it because I'm always working.  The wait staff is young and relatively inexperienced, so you have to stay on top of them...however, that's to be expected in a restaurant like this.Overall, we enjoy this place and will definitely return.Return Factor - 90%

If AMC, the $1 cinema and Denny's were able to birth a baby from a menage a trois, it'd be this. Farrelli's shows not so new yet not too old movies while serving mediocre food. It was very distracting to watch a movie while servers walked throughout the area serving Denny's quality food. I took a few bites of my food and left it. I've managed to repress the memory of what I ate so I'm sorry I can't warn you all about it. The concept of dinner & a movie, at the same time, is awesome, but unfortunately, they failed to deliver.

Went here last Friday night and was very impressed. The last time I had been out to this restaurant was about a year ago and it really didn't seem too great to me, hence the reason it took me a year to come back. Im not sure if they are under new management, have a new chef, or are just improving. Friday night was of course a busy night so we had to wait about 15 min for a table for 2, not too bad. Our server greeted us right away and we had our drinks and appetizer ordered with in minutes! I love fast service! We ordered the Firecracker Stuffed Jalapeños. I wasn't sure how different they would taste from original Jalapeño poppers, but I am so glad I ordered them! They were delicious! A mix of cheese, cream cheese and chicken stuffed in a jalapeño, then deep fried! Add the cheese dip they give you with the order and your mouth is in Jalapeño heaven! I decided on an appetizer as my main dish also, for I wanted a variety of food dishes, I ordered the Sampler Platter and SO glad I did. It comes with chicken flautas, chicken quesadillas and steak nachos. It's the sampler so it's a pretty large portion, you get a few of each item, the flautas are my favorite. The chicken had a great taste to it, mixed with the different seasoning, cheese and peppers. My bf ordered the chicken chimi, obviously you can tell we like our chicken. I tried a few bites of his dish and it was also pretty tasty. I like my chimis to be very crispy, so was a little disappointed that the tortilla on this chimi was semi crispy, when they aren't crispy they get a little soggy. It was stuffed with chicken, seasoning and peppers, not a bad combination with the rice and beans.The staff was very friendly, courteous and quick! We had a great evening!

Not long after I moved to Chandler I was looking for a good place for a salad.  I had been to the Wildflower in Tempe so I checked to see if there was a location closer and this is the one that came up.  I plugged the address into my trusty GPS and off I went.  This location is in the mall.  Yes there is a door that leads into it from the outside but if you didn't know that, you would never find it and that night I did not find it.  Flash forward to walking around the mall one day and VIOLA! there it is.  Boy did I feel dumb.  This location is clean, the staff is friendly and accomadating and the food is good.  The area in front of the counter is large so that you don't get in anyones way while looking at the menu or the baked goods.  They even have a few chairs there so you can sit and wait for your to go order.  There are plenty of tables and some booths.  I have never had a bad meal here.  I love the oriental chicken salad and the potato cream cheese soup.  I have purchased bread and other baked goods and they were always fresh and delicious.  If I had to choose between Wildflower and Paradise, it would be Wildflower hands down.11/17/10And yet, another WBC update- this time it's regarding the "Thanksgiving" sandwich, which was basically oven-roasted turkey, sage stuffing, and cranberry jam on delicious whole-grain bread.  Had the opportunity to try bite-sized samples at a Yelp event a few days before this visit and enjoyed it so much, I had to have a full sandwich soon after!  Well, OK, so I shared the other half w/ a petite cousin of mine-- she absolutely loved it! We swore that the next time, we'd get our own Thanksgiving sandwiches.  No sharing!12/23/10Doing last-minute Christmas shopping FOR MYSELF, I soon felt hunger pangs and WBC was calling my name!  (It's so nice to know that I can always count on WBC for a tasty meal for those times I don't feel like hauling across the valley in search for good eats!)  The aromas that permeated the air as I approached its warm and intimate setting told me that I made the right decision to eat here.  I quickly peruse the menu, thinking I'd have the Butternut squash ravioli that appeared in so many OYEs this year, but lo!  What do I see?  WBC's added a few new sandwiches, and one hot option jumped at me, and its name was "Braised Beef," ($7.99).  I'll try that one, please!The braised beef was TOPPED w/ rosemary-gorgonzola mashed potatoes, served on a grilled ciabatta roll, and accompanied w/ au jus and horseradish sauce, w/ a side of both regular and sweet potato chips.  Let me tell you, the beef and mashed potato combo was incredible!  I ate the whole sandwich!  (Well, all of the beef and potatoes and half of the ciabatta roll.  Gotta keep a svelte figure, y'know?  LOL.)  I'm going to have to order this again the next time I visit!I've only had breakfasts here, but they do a really nice job.  I love the ham and brie frittata.  So simple, but always tastes good.  Every time I eat one I think I could make one at home, but I never do!  The bacon breakfast sandwich is delicious as well with the fresh greens and fluffy bun.  My husband always gets the 2 egg breakfast and enjoys that as well.For the longest time I forgot they were over here in the mall and we would head to Chompie's.  But now if we feel like a quieter atmosphere in the morning we'll hit Wildflower.  I really need to come back and try the lunch stuff.  It all sounds really good and I love a good soup and sandwich combo.  The staff is really friendly and helpful here and they have good coffee that will pry my eyes open in the morning.  All in all, it's the simple things done well.  Definitely a fan.Dear Wildflower,Have I told you how much I love the Hot Cross Buns you sell only during Easter?  I was at work last night chatting among the guests, greeting them a happy holiday, when I realized that it was that time of the year again when those sweet hot cross buns (called that bec. of the white icing placed on top of each bun in the style of the cross to commemorate the holiday) are only available from WBC and I better find an open WBC (I get off at 8p) to buy them ASAP!  Sadly, I have to swipe off as much of the sweet icing, which makes the buns positively sinful, as I can before tasting because my immune system can't handle it*, but I've found an equally delicious new way to enjoy the buns-- pop 'em into the toaster oven for a few minutes, just enough to make them flaky on the outside, and very warm and aromatic on the inside (how else would they get with all of those dried cranberries, golden raisins, and figs in there?!?!) and slather on some organic sweet cream butter.  Mmm... incredible!Is it too early to place my order for Hot Cross Buns for next Easter?  :)*Could I suggest that the company create a granulated-sugar based icing for customers allergic to powdered sugar-based icing?  That way, not only would we be able to enjoy the hot cross buns as intended, but we could also try your wonderful-looking cupcakes, cakes, cookies, muffins, and other pastries!  Just a suggestion...03/13/13Got out of bed this morning specifically to go and pick up the special order I'd placed for Currant-caraway Irish soda bread, which was slated for 8a.  I arrived around at around 830a, but none of the bags already prepared had my name on it.  After checking and re-checking the bags for my name and not finding any, the mid-50s to early-60s' female clerk finally grabbed one out of the shelves.  She then asked if I wanted it sliced, and I said yes, but quickly asked if I could get half of the bread sliced up now.  She said she could cut the bread in half, and I thought that she would follow the instructions through.  When I saw her package the two halves together in one bag, I asked if she could take half of the bread and put it through the slicer, and she said "whatever you want."  To round out the transaction, I had a cranberry scone added to my order.I had a little sample of the bread while driving back home, and it was good, but not as great as those tiny rolls I tried at the Yelp party eleven days ago.  I much-prefer the smaller ratio of crust to tender bread.Here's to healthy eating!  As with most things in life, enjoy carbs with moderation!  :)

I ate here for a business meeting - I knew it was a nice restaurant but am ashamed to admit I did not know it was a AAA 5-diamond. I was a little taken aback but the decor is so simple so you would never know it when walking it. What you immediately notice is the service and attention to detail. The hand-painted menus, Pima language in your introduction, and courses representing life's journey. They had me at "would you like a slice of key lime, cucumber, lemon, tangerine, cucumber...for your water?" ....now that's attention to detail. The chef sent out a special amuse bouche of buffalo tartar - I don't remember .I had the heirloom tomato, goat cheese & marscapone tart - it was the size of a muffin tin but I could have eaten a pie plate full. It was a delightful layering of sweet, creamy and tangy and the "black ice" was black gold - sprinkled ice crystals of reduced balsamic magic. Another special chef treat was a palate cleanser of pomegranate and pepper sorbet served in a small metal bird's nest like dish. I skipped the rest of the journey and went straight for the buffalo tenderloin. I have never had buffalo like this...buttery medium-rare with local flavors of saguaro blossom and cholla buds. Coffee was served tableside in individual French presses - my favorite. (Maybe I'm not such a country girl after all)  3 hour dinner, too bad I didn't valet park and get the thank you gifts mentioned in other reviews!Most people probably can't get over the price - it was amusing to see different guests (ages, socioeconomic status, etc.) and their attitudes toward the experience.  All dress seems to be welcome - I had to laugh because there was a couple that totally looked like the Carl's Jr .steak sandwich commercial - she's in a bright blue spandex dress and he's in campshirt  and shorts....Arizona is casual but have some respect. My country upbringing and lack of exquisite dining experience was growing uneasy with the constant service, being called Ms. all night long, etc. but I slipped into the luxury quite easily...life is good, exceptional food is bliss and Kai should be a goal for everyone to splurge on.When I travel, I always try to eat as much native food as I can. Otherwise what's the point of travelling if you don't try to experience some of the local culture and cuisine. I was therefore excited to find a fine dining restaurant offering local native Indian cuisine rather than the ubiquitous tex mex of the southwest.Well, I enjoyed one of the best dining experiences of my life here, not just best native Indian dining experience.The restaurant is located on the Wild Horse Resort complex, which is a native Indian resort offering casino & golf as well as hotel facilities. My only problem was navigating the huge complex and my only criticism was that the signposting to the hotel/restaurant was poor, something which I mentioned to the staff and received a promise that the problem had already been identified and was being dealt with. Just in case it still hasn't, head for the golf clubhouse and keep going beyond that despite the lack of signage!There is valet parking available but self parking is no problem. The hotel itself is spacious and Kai is located on the ground floor. Kai is the Pima word for seed and there are many obvious native Indian influences, reflected in many aspects of  the design and architecture - this is all explained in the restaurant menu and is obviously an aspect of the experience that they're very rightly proud of here.The restaurant has been recently refurbished to a very high standard. The tables are well spaced out and everything reeks of top quality - for example, the menus are printed on embossed paper.I think the way to sum up this amazing restaurant is 'attention to detail'. I've been lucky to dine in 3 Michelin star establishments but nowhere in the whole world I've visited beats Kai for attention to detail. Everyone knew my name from my reservation. Cutlery restocked from different sides of the table. New napkins for every visit to the restroom. Crockery and cutlery warmed or chilled to appropriate temperature for every dish!!The service is also friendly and very informative. There is also great drama with the food and choreography to the service. Foie gras is bruleed at the tableside. Soups are decanted into bowls from pitchers. Multiple waiters coordinate simultaneous delivery of dishes to multiple diner tables.My server kindly arranged a fresh orange juice. Then came another moment which sums up this amazing restaurant - I was offered fruit accompaniments with my glass of regular water!Onto the food.  I went for the tasting menu with its interesting choice of ingedients and combinations. I was pleased to see that the choice of breads included local Indian flatbread - a local Indian chief came into the kitchen to show the chefs how to make it. This was served with a first rate fruity olive oil.1. Amuse of buffalo tartare with cornbread crisp, crisp microgreens and balsamic vinegar. The buffalo was more gamey than normal beef and the balsamic vinegar was an excellent foil.2. Avocado panna cota toped with shrimp ceviche. The server poured over a papaya and mango soup at the table. My first huge smile moment when I found my chilled spoon! This was a dish which intrigued me from its unlikely combination of such disparate ingredients and it worked!! The smooth avocado was a perfect base for the tangy ceviche and the fruit soup wasn't too sweet but the subtleties of the papaya and mango were definitely evident flavours.3. For a carnivore, I was amazed at the great salad which followed -  the menu told me that the lettuces had been picked by local farmers and children of the Gila Crossing School. The salad had a chilli dressing. It was accompanied by date cake with foie gras (yum!), Humboult Fog goat cheese and heirloom tomato with candied walnut.4. Baja scallop topped with dried mango and sandalwood dust. The sandalwood gave the dish a powerful aromatic introduction, which activated all my salivary glands. An unusual use of what is usually used in incense sticks. The giant sweet scallop was served with bean puree, fried salsify and fennel pollen.5. Seared foie gras with macerated huckleberry and a fig in filo pastry. If you've read my other reviews, you'll know that you can't go wrong with seared foie gras with me!6. Palate cleanser of guava with fennel sorbet and mango sauce.7. Grilled tenderloin of buffalo from the Cheyenne River Tribe. The meat was open and evenly textured, tender with a nice gamey flavour. The plate was completed with a chorizo and corn cake and a morel mushroom mix.8. Lamb with pecan crust with chocolate and chilli sauce. Chocoalte with chilli has become mainstream and I wonder if this is where it originated.9. Cheese. Belgian soft cheese and a Tasmanian cheddar.10. Medley of desserts. Corn creme brulee. Fig bread with chocolate ice cream inside. Italian meringue bruleed tableside with fruit.Also lovely to chat to chef de cuisine Jack Strong after the meal.THE FINEST THE SOUTHWEST HAS TO OFFER. A life-changing culinary and spiritual event. Redefines the southwestern style as the highest-of-high in haute cuisine. An adventure of detail down to the individual salt grains. (That's for the iPhoners... now for the Rest... of the story...)This review has been percolating in my head for six months, almost to the day. With the recent tighter link between Yelp and Facebook, I realize it is time to promulgate the News that is the New Gospel of Southwestern Cuisine as bestowed on us by Chef O'Dowd. You may have read his praises in the local media these past months. Just one week after I dined there, Mobil granted it five stars -- the only Arizona establishment in any category to have this rating at present, and one of only four restaurants in the USA given the designation this year.But my introduction to Kai was nothing so grand. It began as a destination to commemorate a friendship I hold dear to my heart and to celebrate her birthday. As is our custom, I called Maitre'D to make several special requests including one for our dessert. It was a night I shall remember for decades to come.I may say the evening began the moment I crossed the property line and made my sojourn along a mile-long road and through a manicured yet natural presentation of desert flora. When I arrived at the hotel building entrance and stepped out of my car, there was NO ONE anywhere to be found. No bellman, no valet, no guests. The dim light of the entrance welcomed me as I walked into the grand lobby. I could hear a waterfall but there was no one anywhere in sight. Then from nowhere a valet greeted me and took my name. After that introduction, Ritz-Carlton style, every staff person I met knew my name. TRIPLE BING!!This place celebrates the Story. It provides little spotlit nooks for two, three or more, or even seating in front of a fireplace. And that's just Kai's bar area! We waited over a round of drinks (including a perfectly made Sapphire martini) because we were told that a special table awaited us.The celebration continued with the most unique and moving presentation of a menu I have ever experienced. Covered in textured rose-fuchsia-colored fabric and inlaid with watercolor from an artist in residence, our captain placed the table candle in front of it and let its flickering shadows on the fabric backlight the story of the land and the history of this property all the way to the selection of locally-grown (yes he pointed in the direction of the gardens) vegetables and herbs. My eyes were welling up as he finished.Our pour of sparkling water was complimented with our choice of garnish including blood orange and peach among the "usual" lemon, lime or cucumber slices.(getting this out of the way) Sommelier was the only distraction. Clearly not at his best, his bumblings included improper pouring etiquette, coming back to ask which Duckhorn we wanted, Merlot or Chardonnay, leaving the Champagne bottle on the table after the pour, and not refilling our empty wine glasses when checking in on us. UM! OK, back to the bliss. Of course we had to order the 12 course tasting menu. Each course was a sublime tapestry of flavor sensations. Even the one-bite Amuse was a symphony of 15, all working in careful harmony. I got to have two courses of fois gras (DOUBLE BING!) and the duck was so perfect, mild and elegant that even the three salt crystals intruded on its divinity. Second time 'round I had no salt. Heaven on earth. (see my profile's last meal preference)The final blow was our dessert. Although it had the ingredients I requested, it was entirely new. The strawberries had been infused with a candy-like vinegar and must have been several hours in their preparation. The fresh mint with the presentation was merely a garnish; the strawberries were as full of mint as if they had spent their lives in the same soil -- maybe they had! The balsamic was carefully chosen and perfectly matched. Like the perfection in every other detail, small pepper grains lined one side of the rim and dared us to pull them down. The dish's coronation was the creme fraiche executed at the exact moment, seconds before the presentation. Chef had to have stayed all the way to the end to make that execution.With all my heart I thank Chef for sharing his talent and craft. These few words only vaguely illuminate the wonders that await you at Kai. I hope that you find your way there for a special meal; it'll be one you won't soon forget.Kai truly is an "experience" with the mini history and the indigenous menu; each explained by your waiter in limited detail. I highly recommend this as a destination with your out of town guests.  Fun place to show off Arizona's Indian culture.The menu had something for everyone unlike some five star restaurants. Bread: Great! Focaccia w/ corn & peppers, baguette w/ seeds and grains, scones and keep 'em coming.Salads & soup: Highly recommend the Heirloom Tomato Tarte-YUM! It had something called basil foam; sounds scary, but amazing!Did not care for the cold avocado/cucumber soup that had a fishy fish in it.   Lobster trio good.Amuse-bouche very tasty custard and lamb.The New York Strip was melt in your mouth tender!  Also at our table we ordered the grouper, buffalo tenderloin and lamb...no disappoints.The staff does make sure you have plenty of time between courses, maybe a little too much time, by the time the main course came we weren't hungry and they served big portions (hate to waste food!)  Also, when your on the patio and in the corner it's a little intimidating when 4 waiters converge on you all at once.  Maybe try 2 at a time or something different. Seriously though worth the trip and the money for great quality fresh food!We tried the 13 course tasting menu with extended wine selection. The service was wonderful and 100% spot on.The food however, was quite a let down. Some dishes really excelled in their taste and presentation, while many were just a puzzling question mark followed by a mediocre taste. A few memories include a shot of squeezed juice which is considered a course which is more suited as a canape. A salad which included a few leafs of lettuce with two small slivers of cheese. I appreciated the craftsmanship of the 30 year old cheese, but it in no way complimented the lettuce and left you wondering why it wasn't paired with something more suitable or to paraphrase, enjoyable.Out of the 13 courses, there were 3 or 4 that really shined.. the buffalo being one of these. When you average in the odd interior decor it's apparent that attention has not been paid to all the details.. and that's what a fine dining experience really should include. If you're aiming for multi-michelin star experience, detail detail detail. On another high note, the wine pairings were absolutely wonderful and the sommelier was both informative and wonderful in not only introducing each pairing, but being able to provide excellent alternatives when pairings didn't go quite well.The card which gave us a list of all the courses + pairings was a nice touch at the end.For Arizona this is a step up in experience and i'm happy to see restaurants of such caliber really offering alternatives to places such as Binkley's.It's worth trying, but for us there weren't many dishes we'd be craving on a return visit for. After reading other reviews, it may be an issue that Kai has invested a good amount of time in perfecting the smaller tasting menus and main entrees but struggled to fill the larger 13 plate experience.The first thing you will notice about this review is that I'm giving the highest rated restaurant in Arizona a 3/5. This place is the only 5 Diamond restaurant in Arizona. That's a pretty heavy distinction to live up to. I can't say they didn't live up to it, but I can't say "WooHoo" about my visit either.I want to point out that this place has what I can only imagine is a true 5 Diamond experience down to a well orchestrated and choreographed science. The menus came with a story - as did the food and everything we consumed. It was a little heavy-handed. Hand-painted menus and live pan flute music playing in the background along with a waiter/narrator/story teller coming to our table every few minutes to be our personal wikipedia for the evening.The food was good, but this is one of those places that has tiny portions presented on big plates. Most courses were mere bite-sized morsels. Many were complimentary as some of us ordered items with more courses than others. I wouldn't ever again go out of my way for the food here. Nothing spoke to me. In fact, I don't really remember much of what I ate. I know I had a steak at one point. A bone-in rib-eye that had quite a bit of gristle. The service was incredible. It was over the top. That was the biggest problem here really. There were four of us dining, and they kept referring to us by our last names - Mr. and Mrs. so and so and Mr. and Miss. such and such and whats her face. It was off-putting enough to all of us that we requested they knock it off. Every time they brought out a drink or a course, there was a brigade of waiters carrying shit. Six people serving four. It was too much. I guess I'm just not the type of person who needs that much pampering. It makes me feel uncomfortable. Maybe I need to seek therapy for it - they'll tell me I don't love myself enough and make me cry about my dad because I don't feel like I deserve that kind of service. But seriously, it's overkill. This is the sort of think that people with too much money and not enough self-esteem need to do to feel powerful and important. I've heard that sometimes rich billionaire oil barons just shit in the bed instead of going to the bathroom and they have people who clean up after them. They apparently keep these habits when they stay at hotels sometimes as well. It just all reminds me of the gap between the super-rich and the rest of us... the elimination of the middle class. The whole thing is overpriced if you're not all about every bit of it. You have to like the pampering, the stories, the food, and the special imported drinks. If you appreciate all of that, then you will enjoy yourself. Most of it just made me feel like a pretentious asshole.For me, I'm happy if you don't spit on my food, make sure I have my refills on my drink, and that you don't seat me next to the bathroom. The food is why I go out to eat - not to have someone serve or entertain me. The food here just wasn't strong enough on its own to warrant a return.I will say this though - the view is amazing and the place is beautiful, tranquil, and classy.Decided to take the drive out to Kai and try out what many consider the best restaurant in in the State.We arrived a little early for our 9pm reservation and were greeted first by the valet, then by the 2 hostesses at the entrance. We requested a window table, popped into the bar for a couple of very interesting and delicious cocktails, and were promptly seated at our requested window table. We thought it was really weird that they assumed my date and I were married by calling us Mr. and Misses (insert last name here) - this happened all throughout the evening, despite the fact that neither of us were wearing wedding rings. We never bothered to correct them but we both thought it was unusual to make such an assumption.DECORE: After reading so many negative reviews of the decore, I had been prepared for the worst. It did have a "cafeteria like" feel to it, but overall not as bad as I expected after reading the reviews. Probably helped we were placed next to the window in one of the few window tables available.SERVICE: The service was absolutely outstanding. At least 3 Native American waiters doting on your every need, ever present yet not intrusive. Our waiter took the time to explain the philosophy of the restaurant, it's history and ingredients.At the end of the day we're really here to EAT - after studying the two tasting menus we decided that the mains and appetizers of the tasting menu were probably the best bet for a-la-carte so we started with the tomato gazpacho and a lump crab appetizer. We preferred the lump crab concoction to the gazpacho.Second course- we had the escargot, mushroom and caramel goat cheese. Totally about 4 escargots here, not a lot of food, but very tasty with the escargot's cooked to a perfect texture.For the mains she had the butter basted Potpourri of lobster/scallops/shrimp over a black squid pasta. This was delicious but small from a portion standpoint.I had, of course, the Tenderloin of Tribal buffalo- now I'm not sure how many buffalo are running around on the tribe these days so I would guess that's a stretch. What I can say is it was tender, delicious, not too gamey. Probably about 8oz in total.VALET: It was VERY cool to see my car already waiting at the valet, with chocolates and waters in the car. Great service.BOTTOM LINE: Been there, done it, not sure if I will be back. Total check was $270 including a $65 bottle of Cotes Du Rhone

It's a chicken bowl from Ross J's!Ross J's is hella cheap, hella tasty and the service is hella friendly. Total island vibe I am feelin' up in here.  I could roll up all sweaty from the gym (which I have), roll out of bed with drool crust on my face (which I haven't) and I think the people would still be cool to me. They treat everyone like family. Hell, half the people there probably are related!GRUB ON THIS: It's all about the Spicy Korean Chicken Bowl for $3.65. No, it's not that spicy, but it's moist and action packed with Hawaii 5-O flavor. Yes, the chicken has skin so I try to pick most of it off. The portion sizes are for sumo wrestlers and circus elephants so it can no joke feed me for 2.5 meals. Do add extra veggies for $1.10 more. I've also had the lumpia and although it is fried to perfection the guts just seem flavorless and not worth the extra fat and calories in my opinion. The chicken bowl alone is a mouthwatering meal not worth missing.PEEP THIS:http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/SueEpC916vd8Lo3Lyl9_pQ?select=ZcrwnR6ltufG0cOoIfwGew#SsckYmGiLl6vAjmFl0kLLAFYI: Take it from me. Takeout can be REALLY messy. The savory sauce MAY leak onto your leather car seat. Since it is 198 degrees outside here in Africa, Nevada you may want to keep an extra beach towel and swimsuit in your car. The towel will come in REAL handy about now. (The swimsuit is for spontaneous pool parties and/or mud wrestling.)  Ross J's is saving lives one bowl at a time, people. If you can't afford to take DA PLANE DA PLANE to the islands to get your Aloha on well whip out your board shorts and flip-flops and roll up here. It doesn't get cooler than this.I know that Ross J's has been around for quite some time.  Shame on me, that it took me this long to eat here. I'm in the area from time to time and have been to Blue Fin and Sumo, but never here until recent.  The food at Ross J's is comfort island food to me.  Here, you can get pretty much the same dishes that the rest of the Hawaiian joints have.  But here, the prices are cheap and the portions are huge. We arrived one early evening for a quick dinner with friends.  I ended up getting their Loco Moco and Portuguese Sausage Masubi.  Total came to about $7, which is a steal.  Both were full of favor and did I mention the servings?  My Loco Moco had enough rice that was drenched in gravy, topped with eggs, and complimented with two hamburger patties.  If I'm in the area, specifically in this side of Henderson, I now know where to go if I'm craving some comfort food at a great deal. Loco Moco:  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=7S7rzrgGKlbyeW9aTEjyiA&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQPortuguese Sausage Masubi:  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=bsDfORivIAUj9CIkPL5FyQ&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQAfter seeing all the tips and pics of the Spicy Korean Chicken, I was more than intrigued to come here. So when I jus happened to be in the area, there was no doubt what I was gonna have for lunch.Came here at 11:30 and there was a little line forming already. Ordered my Spicy Korean Chicken with Mushrooms and onions. Threw some sriracha on there (which was on every table) and enjoyed how crispy the chicken was. The onions and mushrooms were the cherry on top. All of this was sittin on top of steamed white rice. I love the teriyaki sauce they put on top. It was just the right amount to bring all the flavors together like a very good orchestral symphony. Service was surprisingly fast based off of the customers that ordered before me. Im actually glad I got in at the time I did because around 12, the place got packed quick! That's always a good sign of a good establishment.Prices are really good for the portions that you get. What I got was supposedly one of the bowl options. Seemed more like a stretched out oblong plate. Mind you they have actual plate combos that give you even more food.Since all I had was the chicken, I know I have way more reasons to come back here to try out the other great items. 4 solid stars.Ross J's Hawaiian Barbecue is where the ninth island meets the sunset and mountain Vista. Las Vegas is referred to as the ninth island. The Las Vegas valley is interspersed with outstanding restaurants serving Hawaiin barbecue. At the northwest corner of Sunset Road and Mountain Vista Boulevard in the Smith's - Galaxy Theater anchored shopping center, Ross J's Hawaiian Barbecue has built a reputation for their plate lunch Hawaiin barbecue dishes.    A plate lunch consists of two scoops of rice (usually white), macaroni salad, and an entrée. The plate lunch tradition dates back to the 1800s when the Plantation workers sustained on leftover rice with food such as canned meat, teriyaki, and cold meat. In 1999, L&L made the plate lunch popular on the mainland. In 2015, I developed a taste for the plate lunch thanks to L&L Hawaiian Barbecue. It is this taste for Hawaiian barbecue that has led me into Ross J's a few times recently.     Everytime that I stepped inside, it has been abuzz with people. Ross J's obviously has a good name in the valley.     In contrast to L&L and Island Flavor, the Ross J's system is different. Here you order the food and pay. From the point that you pick up your beverage cup, you seat yourself and they deliver the food to your table. Plus they will bus your table. The delicious food that they deliver to your table is presented on a plate instead of a styraphon box. Every table features condiments that include chili sauce, soy sauce, Sriracha sauce, salt, and pepper.     The restaurant itself is nothing beautiful. The shopping center could use a remodel. The restaurant interior with its sufficient seating is ordinary. Many times in life it's not the beauty on the outside that counts but the beauty on the inside that counts. The beautiful taste of the abundant portions of good food is what counts with me.     On my first visit, I enjoyed the mixed plate. In plate lunch terminology a mixed plate is a plate lunch with more than one entrée. This mixed plate featured teriyaki steak, chicken, Machi, lots of white rice, and macaroni salad. I enjoyed it so much that I'd return to Ross J's a second time. This time I experienced the mochiko chicken plate lunch. Six pieces of chicken occupied a good portion of the plate, white rice nearly half, and macaroni salad a quarter of it. Following this visit, some of my Yelp friends boasted about how great the Spicy Korean chicken was. In Yelp friends I trust, and made a third visit for the spicy Korean chicken. These Yelp friends were right on the mark because the spicy chicken with some Sriracha sauce over it was my favorite.     Ross J's Hawaiian Barbecue lives up to its name. I see myself returning, especially since I frequently shop at Smith's. The next time I will most likely take out a plate lunch to enjoy across the street in the Ethal M Cactus Gardens. Before I return I give Ross J's Hawaiian Barbecue my stamp of approval with this four star rating.

Review Text :
FINALLY! A Chinese place that doesn't suck in Henderson, and they offer Thai food too! With a house full of hungry people wanting Chinese food and not wanting another lame experience I turned to Yelp! (of course) but the reviews for Little Dumpling left me unsure. But I took a chance and ordered. Sometimes you swing and miss, but once in a while you can knock one out of the park and Little Dumpling was a home run with everyone. In depth details....here we go. Straight from the Eat24 online order receipt which made ordering a breeze! 22. Chicken Lo Mein  - My 2 year old loved it. So much so that when we took his plate away thinking he was done he asked me to bring it back. That's ultra rare.  35. Sweet and Sour Chicken  - Premium chicken, great flavor, no skimpy food here.  79. Vegetable Egg Foo Young  - When this gets compared to our gold standard Chinese place we used to love in Denver, and is ranked even better than that...what else can I say about it? They loved it!  92 Thai Tea   - The nice lady at the counter almost forgot this until I asked her to double check the order. I'm sure glad she did...it was pretty dang good if I do say so.  42. Kung Pao Chicken  - Good, but not great. Why? It needed a bit more spice. Every dish seen here was medium spiced...but Kung Pao needs to be hot. Fiery hot. This one...was just good. Still loved it enough that I'll order it again.  38. General Tso's Chicken  - My wife puts me to shame when it comes to being a critic and when she says it doesn't suck and she smiles from ear to ear...yeah, this one made my house happy let me tell ya.  8. Pot Sticker  - OMG. These ain't the crappy potstickers other places try and stick you with. These are premium meat hand made masterpieces with a little kick of spice that slapped my tongue around.  3. Crab Rangoon - Holy crap, they put the crab into the crab rangoons and you can taste it. This ain't the cream cheese wontons that other places call crab rangoon. This is the good stuff.  9. Chicken Teriyaki on a Stick -  Good, enjoyable, will order again, but not my personal favorite. If you've read this far know this. They are hidden in behind Starbucks and tucked in behind Walgreens. If you can't find it go to Walgreens and use their driveup pharmacy lanes. When you are at the window for Walgreens your headlights would shine right into Little Dumpling. Will I go back? Heck yes. I dropped almost $70 on Chinese food here and this is the first time I've finished eating with everyone and nobody said it sucked. That's ultra rare as I seem to live with a lot of critics. And when they compare it to our all time favorite places...enough said. For a first impression Little Dumpling made one heck of a good impression. Add on Service with a Smile, and they boxed everything up and it was easy to carry it all out...oh and one last thing. Their spicy Chinese mustard will sneak up on you and kick your ass. Sorry for the profanity but you've been warned. 4 Stars...don't want to jinx them with a 5, I'll save that last star for a review of their Thai offerings. If they nail the Thai food...that 5th Star will be posted.The lunch specials are great here! I had the "Pineapple Chicken" lunch special priced at just $5.95 and it came with soup and fried rice. The "Egg Drop Soup" was fantastic! It was a comforting soup on a chilly day. The amount of chicken surprised me. It tasted very good. The outside was crispy and the center tender. The rice was cooked perfectly and there was a good amount of that too. I had a coupon that gave me 2 free "Egg Rolls" with a purchase of $15 or more. The egg rolls (veggie) were a bit on the greasy side, but tasted good. I was having lunch with friends and stopped in to order the food to-go. When we were about to have lunch and the food was getting set out, we noticed some "Fried Wontons" with our food that I didn't order. I have no idea what was in them, but they were greasy and good! Everybody enjoyed them so it was a nice and unexpected bonus!They deliver and lunch specials are from 11am - 4 pm.Dumpling is in their name and I didn't try one! Darn it... next time! I did try their Kung Pao Triple lunch special. For $6.25 I got a combination of beef, pork & shrimp along with fried rice and soup. Not bad! It tasted good too. I felt my wife got a bigger portion in her lunch special that was mere .30 less than mine but I had a nice combo of meats. I have eaten at another little Dumpling location across town and have no idea if they are connected but this location is much better. This is a great place for lunch.I have a yelpy resolution to dine at several Chinese restaurants in the Las Vegas Valley. As 2014 transitions into the New Year, my Chinese restaurants list will grow. I aim to review fifty Chinese restaurants by 2016. This review of Little Dumpling Chinese Restaurant is my most recent fulfillment of this yelpy resolution. It is based on my recent visit during lunch before Acacia Demonstration Gardens.   Little Dumpling is actually the Hidden Dumpling. It is buried in the small Starbuck's strip mall on the Northeast corner of Horizon Ridge Parkway at Stephanie Street  by Walgreen's.   The parking lot is too cramped that there is a greater risk of a car dent. Just as I do when I visit the Starbuck's here, I walk a short distance further to park by Walgreen's.   This is essentially a take-out setting with a handful of tables and unadorned walls. The silverware and plates is throwaway paper and plastic. This is the quintessential setting for a Chinese restaurant lunch special.   The lunch specials that end at 4 PM cost between $5.95 and $6.25. The shrimp based entrees cost $6.25. The lunch specials include chow mein noodles or fried rice with the soup of the day. Of course the soup of the day is egg drop soup. With the addition of a beverage, the lunch special comes out to $8 and change. I ordered the shrimp chop suey. It was okay. I have tasted better, that is for sure. They did give a fair amount of shrimp.   There is a flaw in the design of the restaurant. That is that the restroom is too close for comfort to the tables. Little Dumpling ought to invest in a louder vent or something to block out noises that are not conducive to the customer enjoying their meal.   In my opinion Little Dumpling is an okay Dumpling. I have no urgency to return.

Review Text :
I have a Love/Hate Relationship with Jason's.I LOVE that:~They have a Huge Menu of sandwiches, salads, soups, pasta etc.~They have baked potatoes bigger than my head~Their simple but perfect salad bar~The ginger bread muffins at the salad bar * 1 reason alone to go*~The assortment of wrapped crackers at the salad bar~Everything  looks so good and is so big~They always have some new "special" when I go in~If you have room after lunch you can help your self to a soft serve ice cream coneI HATE that:~They are always packed liked sardines~They aren't very clean~They serve a pile of greasy broken ruffles with the sandwiches~The Tuna isn't good~There is barely room to walk between the tables~The sandwiches aren't ever as good as I want them to be, but are OK nonetheless (see pics)***3.5 starsI routinely order Jason's Deli sandwich and wrap trays for working lunches at my office.  Ordering from their online site is a cinch and delivery is always a few minutes early, or on time to the minute.  Their delivery drivers are also professional and friendly as well.  The food is always fresh and delicious each and every time, and it always comes with all the plates, napkins, utensils, ice, cups and other accoutrements needed to serve it too.  Among my personal favorite items from Jason's are their wraps, and in particular their vegetarian wrap with mushrooms, Asiago cheese, bell peppers and Romaine lettuce).  Their Chicken Alfredo pasta is just amazing for lunch on a cold day and another favorite item for a cold day is their Tomato Basil soup which is absolutely delicious and served with a side of soft bread.  Another big plus about catering from Jason's Deli for work lunches is that you accumulate 'Deli Dollars' with each order and over the course of a year's worth of office lunches I had accumulated enough Deli Dollars to pay for all the food for my teenage daughter's 15th birthday party.  Then by the next year I had accumulated enough Deli Dollars once again to cater the food my baby daughter's 1st birthday.  It was wonderful to be able to hold each birthday party for the girls and not have to worry at all about preparing the food.I had Jason's Deli catered in today and the only thing wrong with today's lunch was that the pasta salad was very oily (which isn't normal for them) but aside from that I have absolutely no complaints about today's lunch delivery...Rock on Jason's, rock on.Met Rand H and Mike C and Jackie C here for lunch today.  For a chain they do a pretty good job of making sandwiches, salads and soups.  And in the American tradition almost anything you order is more than you really need.  But it is good and you keep eating! :)Jason's Deli never disappoints..One of my go-to's when choosing a place to eat for lunch!Items I choose are : Soups - Tortilla Soup, Broccoli Cheddar or Tomato BasilSandwiches - Tuna Melt, Reuben, Beefeater (roast beef on French bread to be dipped in a cup of au jus), or Wild Salmon-wichPasta - Zucchine Garden PastaMixed Fruit - served with their creamy, fruit dipThey do a half-half deal.. Half sandwich & cup of soup OR half sandwich with side salad! And they also do a build-your-own sandwich! Most of the menu items come with a side of chips and/or fruit! Good price for quality and quantity you get!

This was really good! I have passed by here a 100 times and never been in. I was missing out! I love the cheesy decor that others have talked about in their reviews. I like it, gives it some charm and family feel for a chain. Almost feels like you are outdoors. Lets start with the Sangria. Mmmmm. That was some good stuff! The chips come out with three differnt salsa's. I loved 2 of the 3 and there was nothing wrong with the 3rd, just not my cup of tea. I had a shredded beef burrito smothered in cheese with guacamole. It was really good. Very flavorful and I would get it again in a second. The rice and beans were very good as well but next time I want to try the potatoes with chili. I had a bite of someone elses plate and they were fantastic, I was very jealous! Server was very friendly, fast, and kept our water filled and checked on us. Prices were reasonable and they have an email club that you get buy one get one free for your birthday. I will be back to try more menu items soon.Typical suburbanite "Mexican" food with no fresh ingredients. If you're looking for something like Macayo's, but less tasty, this is your spot. It was very crowded today, which was a good sign. I saw tons of seniors here (that makes sense, given the name), and it's because they have a huge senior menu for them. They come from a time where food was not nearly this fake, so I refuse to believe they actually think this is good stuff.Let's get the good stuff out of the way--the bar. $3 margaritas made with 1800 tequila? Perfectly blended in a 12 oz.. cup? Yes, please! It's awesome seeing a happy hour on Sunday afternoon, so this was a pleasant surprise. They also had the "cerveza rita", served in a goblet with a coronita (7 oz. corona bottle) stuck in it. Outside of the blended drinks, it looked like nothing special. You're out of your mind if you think I'm paying $17 for a bottle of Sutter Homes. Most of their wine list is the swill I'd use for wine pong, but that's another story.The chips and salsa were decent. The hot stuff is one of the better salsas I've had in the valley, perhaps it was made with smoked poblano? I want to buy a bottle for myself. The seven layer dip was tolerable since I was so hungry. refried beans, ground beef, sliced green chili, sour cream, guac, and of course, cheese sauce. Perhaps the seventh layer was the suspicious film on the dip when it was brought to our table. Questionable.My entree arrived, and I was disappointed just by looking at it. Why did the beans already look dry? Perhaps they were overcooked? It was as if they were sitting under a heat lamp for quite some time. The rice was decent, but also dry. My fajita chicken chimi looked a bit...narrow, and the tortilla didn't look properly fried. I freaking love chimichungas, so I had to dig in post haste! Most disappointing chimi I've ever had. Once during finals week, I was so busy that I bought some fajita chicken in a bag, complete with the fake grill marks. I recognized the taste right away, and proceeded to dissect my meal. There were cubes and 'strips' of chicken...and eureka! The fake grill marks. At home, this is tolerable in a pinch. For $11 at arrowhead? This is a piece of shit!If you EVER see me check in here, it's for the tapas and margaritas during happy hour. I'll be sitting at the swank bar, flirting with some octogenarian's daughter who came here against her will. Outside of that, Abuelo's ain't up to snuffBar-3.5Food-1I had a date with Mama Jo last night and she chose Abuelo's. Though she pronounced it Aruba's. And the Ablegos. We finallly figured it out and arrived to a very bustling restaurant.It definitely has the look of a medium end Vegas casino restaurant meets Macayo's...but all in all, I liked the decor, very bright and "atrium" like. We were greeted & seated, immediately and with kindness and professionalism. As we were being escorted to our table, I'm taking in the ambience, VERY busy and a HUGE crowd of SMALL little girls, half dressed in tu tu's. I kid you not. I thought it was teen drag night at a gay bar for a moment. As we nestled into our booth away from the screaming tweens, our delightful, delightful server, Ashley, informed us they were on the way to the Justin Beiber concert. How cute is that? Cuter that they were finished and leaving, but I digress.I have to say, I truly appreciate a lot of chain restaurant requirements of the service staff. I like being asked if I've been in before. The specials. Soups of the day. Etc., etc. As long as they are not robotic and comfortable and smiling, I'm all ears. Five stars for Ashley.Mom & I hadn't been out in awhile as we've (aka, ME) have been busy packing up for our move to Minneapolis. But she is as charming as she is lovely and it was nice to spend time with her outside of the house. We started with chips, three kinds of salsa (all explained, which I really appreciated) and an order of guacamole. I loved the THIN, crispy and fresh chips though they struggled to pick up the yummy, chunky guacamole without breaking. Oh, the problems we have!!!We both ordered enchiladas, mom had ground beef and I went for cheese and a carnitas. Carnitas was sad and dry. Much like my Aunt Helen towards her final years. But the sauce was pretty flavorful. A big plus for the frijoles which had a great pork flavor infused and Papas Chiles...amazing, mashed taters with cheese. Carb city!We finished with the obligatory chain chocolate lava cake. All in all for a chain restaurant, it was dang good. Ashley checked in when appropriate. I noticed two other nearby servers and their demeanor with guests and was most impressed.So, Aruba's, er um Ablegos or wait Abuelo's, I might see ya before I move!

The salad bar is legit! Fresh, crisp veggies, variety of cheeses, egg, grilled chicken, homemade dressings AND they have brick oven cheese pizza, soups and a baked potato section. All you can eat for $5 plus drink purchase. Why do I choose this place over the "Sweet Round Red Things" place? -No wait usually. Great service.-No screaming, coughing maniac kids rubbing boogers on the booths-It's dark, but light enough to read-If I am with someone who doesn't do salad bars they can order a burger and I can steal their fries:)It's nothing fancy, but it's just right for me when I am eating clean.What's the best beer? Cold beer.Now and then after a 1 star day at work I visit Barley's to enjoy a cold microbrew draft beer and Caveman Keno. The atmosphere and beer elevates a 1 star day to at least 3 stars.  Barley's is an institution at Sunset and Mountain Vista that dates back to the late 90s. Barley's website alleges that it is the Valley's oldest and Henderson's only microbrewery. Barley's attraction is its microbrewery. It is a microbrewery that produces Black Mountain Beer, Boulder Gold Hefeweizen, Blue Diamond Beer, and Red Rock Original. For the record my favorite is the Blue Diamond Beer. The bartenders or mixotoligists serving the beer have been friendly, going so far as to introduce themselves. The upshot of this popular institution, is that the bar is often filled-to-capacity.   In similar fashion to several small businesses, Barley's sold out to a bigger company. Today Station Casinos owns Barley's. The Station preferred card is as good as gold in Barley's. Not only does Barley's gaming machines accept the Station preffered card, they also grant players a "get out of paying for a drink pass" when you put money in the machine. In my case, it works out. I put $5 in the Caveman Keno machine and when all is said and done, I break even because the $5 really paid for the open beer that is elevating a 1 star day to a 3 or above star day.   Gaming is fun in Barley's. This is not one of those bars that only offers video poker. This is a bar that features the gaming machines with a spectacular selection of Keno games. And these machines are not stiff. The last time I played at Barley's, Lady Luck struck and I won $100s. That is about the equivalent of 50 Happy Hour Barley drafts. So, sometimes Barley's has the power to elevate a 1 star day to a 5 star day.  Currently,  Barley's Happy Hour is Monday through Friday at the hours of 4 to 7. $2 drafts are the stars of Happy Hour. The Station Preferred card is the star of Barley's. If your gambling, the drinks are on the house.  Barley's is more than a casino, bar, and microbrewery. It is also a restaurant. In recent times I dined there once. To put it nicely their beer is better tasting and a better value than their BLT. A glance away from the restaurant is the brick oven pizza. Although I never tried it, the scent from the brick oven adds a nice scent over the bar.  When you visit Barley's you will come out a winner. That's unless you drink and drive. If the Red Rocks and Blue Diamonds are so good that you've had way too many, there are a few nearby sobering up opportunities. Nextstore is the Galaxy Theaters. Nearby are some decent restaurants including Olive Garden. There is a Smith's. And the CAT bus travels along Sunset Road to Town Square and the Galleria.Hate to give this place 2 stars. In actuality, the service here definitely deserves 5. But unfortunately, the food here was not up to par with the great service that I had received.This cafe is inside of the Barleys casino, a legendary ol school mini casino which brews its own beers. It's a very simple place and its serves a fairly basic menu. The waitress that took my order was great, she was helpful and friendly.The first thing I ordered were the shrimp cocktail. The shrimp were either undercooked or just the frozen ready-to-eat ones, but they were sorta slimy and not sweet at all. The cocktail sauce was gross, it tasted basically like bottled ketchup.The next thing that came up were the chili fries. It was canned chili beans on not-so-crispy shoestring fries. I had about 3 bites, and I was done. One of the hardest things I've ever had to eat.The Reuben was next. Ok, so it wasn't that bad. I thought that the rye bread could have been crispier, but the flavor was pretty good. The corned beef tasted like it was premade, and so did the dressing. I was thankful that they had at least rinsed the sauerkraut, because it wasn't too sour. The coleslaw didn't taste like anything at all, probably came from a jar.The food tasted like it was all made a while ago, and probably came from a can. I prefer things that are made fresh. But the food is nostalgic in a way. And it reminds us how far we have gotten since then. Too bad that the food couldn't hold a candle to the amazing front of the house staff that works there. But as I always say "Que sera, sera".

Hidden in the shopping center just north of Via De Ventura on the West side of Hayden is Buster's.  Buster's, along with a Chipotle, a flower shop, and some other businesses that I hope to make a better mental note of next visit... I could easily have gone along with my life and not noticed Buster's although I drive by the area all of the time.  But, when my friend Allyson suggested it as a central spot for a few girlfriends to meet for dinner one Tuesday night, I went along with the plan.  I'm always up for trying some place new!Buster's offers traditional bar food along with some seafood, steak, and specialty items.  We chose to sit in the bar although none of us partook in their happy hour (which goes until 7).  Aside from the waitstaff, we were the youngest people in the place (by a decade or two).Nothing really stood out, and the food was fine.  Not amazing.  Not bad.  Just fine.  I had a Greek Salad with chicken and my two friends each ordered 1/2 portions of the lavosh pizza and side salads.  They seemed happier with their orders than I was.  I will point out that the lavosh pizzas do not come with any kind of sauce on them but marinara is available for dipping upon request.The bill was under $20 a person out the door but then again, we didn't order much.  I wouldn't choose Buster's as a 'go-to' place again, but I wouldn't be opposed to giving it another shot sometime either.  PS - I didn't notice the musty and damp carpet smell (maybe they replaced it, Natalie!)Some colleagues invited me for lunch the other day and decided to pick this place.  It was my first visit.  After browsing the menu for a few minutes, I decided to order the California Wrap (Spinach, Tomatoes, Avocado, Feta Cheese, Sun-Dried Tomato Vinaigrette Dressing, Tomato Basil Tortilla, $8.95) with a side of Cole Slaw & Iced Tea.I took one bite out of the California Wrap and was in Heaven!!!  The sweet flavor of Sun-Dried Tomato Vinaigrette Dressing was a perfect compliment to the Feta Cheese & Avocado....the Cole Slaw was amazing too!  What a great combo!The only knock on this experience is that the service was kind of slow.  We had to constantly look for our waiter....to order.....to ask for extra napkins.....to get refills....to get our check.  Maybe we caught him on a bad day?  Because I enjoyed my meal so much, I'll give him the benefit of the doubt.Return Factor - 92%

Review Text :
After a day of climbing Tom's Thumb at the McDowell Mountains, we decided to sit our butts down here and have some beer.  Taylor, Travis and I were bellying up to the bar, and there wasn't another patron there.  Still, it took the bartender 5 minutes to come over and say hello.  We asked for menus and said that we were hoping for delicious beer.  He then walked away.  %&$*@?  Why?  He was the only one and he was making drinks for the entire restaurant.  This was a Saturday evening at 7pm.  Again, WTF?   It took another 10 minutes before we could order food.  Beer was good, food was good, not going to bother with the details though because this is where it gets odd.We asked for the check and I went to the bathroom.  When I returned, (5-10 min later), he then TELLS us that we owe $33.50.  No check printed or presented.  Then we hand him 2 $20's and get $3.50 in change back.  I'm no accounting wiz, but he is WAY off.  This guy was judging us by the time we sat down.  I will never return to this place.  It is a shame that dress dictates service.Another tourist spot. This place is not about the food as much as it is about the novelty and character. Fun spot for kids and families!And, even if you've been there a million times, SOMEONE ought to wear a tie just for giggles.How can you not love a Phoenix classic? Yes, this is a tourist establishment. Yes this place can get pretty cheesy with a huge play on western life. And yes, it's not five star dining. But here's why Pinnacle Peak Patio will always hold a special place in my heart. It's a Phoenix right of passage for anyone who remembers Phoenix when there was nothing but desert past Frank Lloyd Wright Road, driving to Pinnacle Peak Road felt like going on a road trip to the middle of nowhere and the only restaurants to choose from were spots like Durant's, Pink Pony and the Sugar Bowl. Yes, Pinnacle Peak Patio is a tourist spot, but it's always a great family spot and even just a fun spot to make it a night out and act like a tourist in your own city.So what's Pinnacle Peak Patio all about? Well, there's a faux western village, there are hay rides, there's a "pretend like your a saloon girl/cowboy" photo opportunity, they have saw dust on the floors, live country bands and picnic tables/benches for seating. Oh and definitely wear a tie when you go. Just do it, make sure it's not your favorite tie and enjoy the ride. The food is sub par and exactly what you would expect from a place like this...one or two steps above your backyard BBQ food. It's lively, you can be casual, you can bring as many kids as you want and whether you admit it or not, you'll have a good time as long as you walk in knowing what to expect. Yeehaw, I'm out!

The snowbirds are back to the Sun Lakes area in force and the inept and overwhelmed staff at this Burger King couldn't handle it.  Not that they were that busy but these guys needed about 20 minutes per order and were only hitting accuracy at about 40% or so.I haven't been to a BK in a long time so my FFF radar was down (Fast Food Fubar).  A buy one get one coupon lured us in.I actually felt bad for one guy that seemed to be in charge.  My daughter and I stood back and watched the carnage for the first fifteen minutes waiting for our order.  Then we received our sandwiches that were not the right sandwiches.  Then we returned them and waited some more.  Then we just got a refund and left.But during that time we watched the cashier wander around and attempt to help in a hesitant fashion as if she had never been behind the counter before.  The one guy in the kitchen seemed overwhelmed, easily confused and uncertain what the difference was between say bacon, sausage and eggs.  And the guy I felt bad for kept flitting from the drive up "Oh my God that guy has been waiting 14 minutes!" to the kitchen "No, this goes here.  We're out of biscuits!  Totally!" to bagging orders "Sir, you still haven't gotten your food?  Really?"

However, I'm glad I trusted my gut (not the hungry part, the sensible part)!When I walked in, the dining room was absolutely packed! Obviously, it's a popular destination. So, I took a minute to see what looked best to me. After a few minutes perusing their menu, I opted for the Shrimp Burrito. The young lady behind the counter informed me that it would take about five minutes for my order to be ready. So, I took my drink to the dining room and waited.As I was waiting, I passed by their full bar. I wasn't really in the market for an alcoholic beverage during lunch, so I didn't really price anything. The fact that this bar exists, though...that's the important thing! The self-serve chips and salsa bar was really cool! It's similar to ones that you would find at Baja Fresh, except for the endless chips. That's a pretty nice touch, in my opinion.After about five minutes (a touch longer, but I wasn't in a hurry), my burrito was ready. Size wise, my burrito was comparable to ones that you find at Chipotle or Qdoba. However, the difference maker for me was the actual content. I made sure to pay extra close attention to the amount of shrimp contained in my burrito. I've been burned at places before when they skimped on contents. Not here. EVERY single bite I took was accompanied by a full shrimp...and I don't take small bites. For $8.85, I was definitely impressed. If you're in the market for a sort of change of pace with regards to your Mexican food, you should check out Blue Burrito Grille. If you need more incentive, they do have a couple of televisions, free Wi-Fi, and a nice patio. The patio is covered by umbrellas, but it doesn't have misters or anything like that. So, if you want to sit outside, make sure you get in on the action before it gets hot!

This place is the rip off of all rip offs. My boyfriend and I decided to go there for lunch over the summer. We ordered drinks from the bar, ridiculously priced for a restaurant during the day, $9.50 for some mojitos? Come on. They weren't that good. Now we were starving when we arrived, I ordered the tilapia and asparagus and he order the meatloaf and potatoes. We received our food and he dug in right away. I just sat and looked at mine. "Fourteen dollars for this? How much was yours, eleven dollars?" My boyfriend looks at my plate and could only say, "That's it?" He received a FULL plate of meatloaf and the other half of mashed potatoes. I had six stalks of asparagus and a piece of fish the size of a child's hand. That was it. I called the waiter over and asked him if all the fish were this size and he said he thought so and there was nothing wrong with my meal. I asked him if this was worth $14 to him and he said he thought so. I told him, "I'm not from Scottsdale, I would like to see the manager." The manager walks over and proceeds to actually argue with me about the food saying that it is perfectly fine. I said, "It may be fine, it may taste great, but I'm still going to be hungry after this $14 meal. I would at least like another piece of fish." He tells me for $6 he could get me one more piece of fish and I tell him I'm not paying that for another piece this size. At this point my boyfriend is offering me his food, but that's not what I wanted. Finally I tell the manager just take it back, I'm sorry to see you toss that but you are doing nothing to satisfy this customer. He literally did nothing but argue with me. I wasn't trying to get a free meal, I just wanted to get what I was paying for. Rude people, overpriced food, crappy bar. Take your business somewhere else.Damn I failed my own suggestions. We had some drinks here... the billreflected it too. I had a burger, which was perfect. Baked spud. 1 Captain and Coke which seemed a little lacking, so I asked the waitress to have them make it a little stronger the next time. Yep... charged for a double. So MY drink tab was almost 20 for two drinks. My beautiful wife had a killer salad, added chicken and split a bottle of wine with a BFF. $34 for the bottle. Some how the bill was $95 including tip. WTF 95-20-17=58 For a salad and a burger??? I am calling the manager.The daughter and I made another trip to Phoenix last week and we did what we always do while in AZ:  we tend to frequent a lot of chain restaurants and this is a chain that we had yet to try.We came here with my Mom for a late lunch (after being picked up from the airport) around 2pm to a fairly empty restaurant. This place is land locked in between PF Chang's, Cheesecake Factory, Buco De Peppo, Elephant Bar, Red Robin and a slew of other fast and non fast food chains. Our waitress was really nice and we were all glad we brought in sweatshirts because like all AZ restaurants, it was freezing inside. The menu had a lot of great offerings and my Mom and I both chose wood-fired grilled salmon served with perfectly al dente veggies and for me, Parmesan mashed potatoes and Mom's with a baked potato. Daughter opted for some kind of salad with stinky cheese and a cup of their tortilla soup. We were also served fresh baked sourdough bread with cornmeal crust that had Kevin been with us, would have been replenished many many times. The bread was AWESOME. My salmon was cooked perfectly and was delicious. I was super pleased with my meal (it was huge for lunch and at $14.00 including the large helping of fresh vegetable was better than my favorite chain salmon that only comes with rice and 5 or 6 snow peas). The daughter LOVED her salad (I didn't taste it due to the stinky cheese) and the soup was flavorful but thick like the kind Chili's serves and not in a good way. I would come back here in a heartbeat and avoid some of the other monstrosities  around.

Review Text :
I agree with Dani. This Einsteins Bagels is slow! I went here this morning just to pick up a Hate to Wait Basket and I had to wait for the Hate to Wait Basket. First,  I had to wait in a long line until the Bagel Man decided to take the guy's order 3 people ahead of me. Before than he was dilly dallying around throwing bagels in the slicer. Second, it seemed that they were preparing a big order, because I had to wait again until the manager was free to pick the bagels to throw in the basket. Does it really take 3 people out of 5 to prepare one order. To top it off, the cashier was making small talk to the police officer in front of me. He was telling him his woes of ringing up the order and how sometimes how he needs to be creative in typing in the order. PLEASE, shut up and let the man pay for his grub!! Don't get me wrong. I like small talk, but not when folks are trying to get their day started.Bagels are great. We love this location. My child goes crazy as soon as we pull up. Super helpful and cheerful employees. Overall great store.

Restaurant name  Tokyo Lobby Sushi and Grill

Review Text :
Lali J. and I took a road trip to Tokyo Lobby last night. We'd heard about it through excellent reviews in the New Times and the Republic (a positive review in the Republic is often a neon sign that says "stay away," but we decided to risk it). As a transplanted New Yorker/San Franciscan/Los Angeleno, I have to say Tokyo Lobby has been my favorite sushi experience in the valley. If you're used to Ra or any of the other McSushi places, it's worth the schlep up to North Glendale (which is almost as far as the Yukon from where we live) to check this place out.T.L. is a small, 10 table joint, but it's crowded in a vibrant, fun way. Service is fast and friendly. It's in a strip mall, but if you keep your eyes left of center as you approach from the parking lot, you won't see the WalMart on your right. The usual/traditional suspects are brilliant -- stunning unagi, maguro, tobiko, etc. The sides and appetizers were fab, too: great seaweed salad and gyoza. Tokyo Lobby is creative with the specialty rolls -- the Marilyn Mon-Roll (not kidding) was terrific: a spicy tuna roll wrapped in albacore with an elegant topping of crispy/crunchy onion.There's also a full menu of earthbound flesh and assorted other goodies. Everything looked great. Really -- check this place out!"I've cut a bitch for less..."This is the response I received from my Partner in Culinary Crime after demonstrating my mad chopstick skills to scoop up a wayward spicy scallop.   You see, the creations at Tokyo Lobby are worth fighting for.  Every last morsel.  Of course I am going to risk life and limb!!   :)Before moving AZ, I was told by friends who were familiar with my sushi-loving ways that I had to try Tokyo Lobby.  Nearly two years later, it was finally time to take their advice - we headed west into the uncharted territory of... Glendale!That first visit was spectacular, and since then we have been back multiple times for both lunch and dinner.  Sometimes twice in the same week - it is really that good. We have tried a variety of items, but so far the favorites are:- Hamachi Toro - yellowtail belly sashimi- Spicy Scallops- Chicago Roll - salmon on spicy crab and scallops- What the Heck Roll - I can only describe this as spicy tuna heaven, with some jalapeno tossed in just because it is fun...Try any and all of these with their fresh wasabi and citrus-infused ponzu.  Amazing!!Top this off with a large beer (Ichiban, please!) and hot sake for only $5.From the fresh and perfectly prepared fish to the friendly and attentive owners and staff, a visit to Tokyo Lobby is really a pleasure.  If Glendale is not what immediately comes to mind when you think of sushi, it will be soon!  Tanoshinde!!Craving some sushi, I got a chance to go to Tokyo Lobby for the first time the other night.  After reading a few of my fellow Yelper's reviews on this place I was excited to find good sushi and sashimi on the West Side ~ in Glendale of all places!To my amazement and bewilderment Tokyo Lobby serves some of the freshest and most delicious sushi I've had in the Phoenix metro including Scottsdale!  Wowsers! Why did it take me so long to find this place? Well it's a tiny place joined to a shoe store located in front of the "super-duper-take-your-money-and-run-Walmart-center" at 57th & Bell.  Since I hate shopping at "wally world" I have been driving past them for months not knowing about this little gem of a sushi restaurant. I sat at the sushi bar where I could have a better view of the sushi maestro Kelvin Kim create the most wonderful sushi concoctions. The restaurant is very clean and nicely decorated with Asian art and a few TV's to watch the games. The sushi bar is the main attraction with Chef Kim and another sushi master working their magic.  The service was top notch, very accommodating and eager to please their customers.Food: Started with Hamachi Belly sashimi ~ very tasty, sweetest tasting tuna ever.  I ordered some fresh wasabi and ponzu sauce to go with my sushi rolls. I ordered the "what the heck" ~ nice punch of heat with great texture from the tuna and jalapeños and the Chicago roll ~ great blend of spicy crab/scallops with salmon.  Both were unique and outstanding!  Topped it all with a $5 sake bomb special ~ large Ichiban beer with hot sake.  "make it a double sake bomb pleeeeaaasseee!" Huge THANKS to my fellow Yelper's for recommending this little sushi gem! I am looking forward to my next visit and trying another one of Chef Kim's sushi creations. I recommend you try Tokyo Lobby next time your craving for sushi and hope to see you there!

Fanny's has some BOMB food and Bomb service. Actually everything about them is BOMB. (I'm using the word bomb because I'm currently obsessed with Bomb Pops.)Mom & Pop locally owned sandwich shop/deli doing everything right from the minute you walk in to the second you walk out the door.Walk in, sit down. Boom. The menu is on the table waiting for your hungry eyes. If you are smart you will order the Soup of the Day. My favorite is the homemade Chicken Noodle Soup. A cup is $2.99. My favorite sandwich is the California Club which has Turkey, Bacon, Avocado, Tomato, Swiss Cheese and Mayo. I always substitute the Swiss for Cheddar. You get your choice of bread for every sandwich. They have Rye, Sourdough, White, Wheat, Baguettes and Hoagies for you to choose from. The sliced breads which are INSANELY DELICIOUS are from Bon Bread Bakery. The hoagies and baguettes are from Great Buns and y'all already know how much love I have for that place. I go with the Rye toasted. It's sandwich perfection. Meats are Boar's Head and with that good bread this is a win-win situation for me every time. Sides are homemade Pasta Salad which I love or homemade Potato Salad which I haven't had yet. I also have to add I am in love with their strong Brawny style napkins. The food alone is worth five stars to me, but throw in friendly, fast service and they fall under Henderson All-Stars to me. Jill is the owner/waitress and you can tell she's been doing this for a white hot minute. She does the extra things such as putting your check face down to pay when you are ready. She also OFFERS you a To Go cup of your beverage without you even having to ask. Who does that? Jill the greatest waitress ever. That's who.Overall I am always, always impressed and satisfied when dining at Fanny's. If you ever happen to be in the neighborhood at the right time (Mon-Fri. 10-5p I think) make sure to stop in here for a bite. You won't regret it. Unless you are a weak person with no soul. Then you might regret it.

Review Text :
I had the opportunity to try out the Red Lobster Lobsterfest the other night, my server was Jeanne! And she is amazing! Loved her and the great service she provided!Started the night out with lobster, crab & seafood stuffed mushrooms, Lobster pizza and Sweet Chili Shrimp, now everything tasted great but I have to say my favorite of those where the Sweet Chili Shrimp, holy cow those are great! Stop ordering the coconut shrimp (don't worry I love those too) and get these Sweet Chili Shrimp.For the entrees, get ready for this, we tried: Lobster In Paradise, Ultimate Surf & Turf, Dueling Lobster Tails, Lobster Lovers Dream, Seaport Lobster & Shrimp, Bar Harbor Lobster Bake   Everything was amazing!   Lobster in Paradise is split Maine Lobster tail fried in coconut batter, spicy grilled shrimp & lobster & shrimp bake topped with toasted crushed macadamia nutsUltimate Surf & Turf  is a Maine lobster tail stuffed a crab stuffing & baked with a peppercorn grilled sirloin topped with Maine lobster meat in a citrus hollandaise sauce comes with mashed potatoes roasted tomatoes & green beansDueling Lobster Tails are 2 Maine lobster tails, one topped with tender shrimp in a creamy garlic sauce and one stuffed with crab & seafood stuffing and comes with mashed potatoes, roasted tomatoes and green beans.Lobster Lovers Dream is Rock Lobster tail & a split Maine Lobster tail, roasted with lobster & shrimp linguini alfredoSeaport Lobster & Shrimp is wood grilled split Maine Lobster Tail, shrimp scampi, and skewered garlic grilled shrimp on a bed of wild rice pilafBar Harbor Lobster Bake is split Maine lobster tail, shrimp, scallops, mussels & linguini in a garlic & white wine brothWhile all these dishes are amazing, and every dish had something unique that set them aside from the other dish, my personal favorites where the skewered garlic shrimp, the Maine lobster tail, didn't matter if it was stuffed, baked, sauced, grilled it was DELISH! I also learned that I prefer the Maine Lobster over the Rock Lobster (Rock rock Rock Lobster Down down! B52's Rock Lobster)  I had lobster for days, and I still am craving the sweet Maine lobster & sweet chili shrimp!  And if you love the coconut shrimp you should for sure try the Lobster in Paradise, omg the lobster in the coconut batter was amazing!! To end the meal I tried the Red Velvet Cake in a Jar that was the perfect ending to a delicious feast! Also was able to meet the Manager Carrie and many other staff members including the chefs! It was a wonderful night and had fun trying so many dishes! I cannot wait to go back!Treated aunt to a belated birthday dinner (three other adults and two children dining; I only had a cocktail and two teensy flakes off of the top of a cheddar biscuit.  BE AWARE that EACH biscuit contains 8 grams of fat, 2.5 grams saturated, and a total of 150 calories.  They ordered *Berry-Mango daiquiris http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/red-lobster-chandler-2?select=d3bUfGn-UZ1bEq99wODlTg#d3bUfGn-UZ1bEq99wODlTg and I a *classic mojito. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/red-lobster-chandler-2?select=iNV2KvaH87Oqi9k_JefLFA#iNV2KvaH87Oqi9k_JefLFA  I heard that the berry-mango was a balanced mixture of fruit flavors, but the alcohol was hardly-detectable.  The alcohol flavor wasn't missed at all, though.  Everyone who had them "ooh"ed and "ahh"ed.  I wished a simple mango version was available, but I'm also glad it wasn't, or else I would never have found out that RL, or more specifically the bartender working that shift, served a TERRIFIC mojito!  My first sip disappointed, but once I swirled everything a few times with the straw, the drink actually turned out to be one of the best mojitos I've ever had!  It's a classic version, made with Bacardi Superior rum, muddled mint, pure cane sugar (don't like ones made with simple syrup-- too sweet), freshly-squeezed lime juice, and club soda.I would never be able to dine here (aversion to farm-raised fish, intolerance/allergy to whitefish, shellfish allergies, and Blue Bunny ice cream choices contain corn syrup), but I wouldn't mind enjoying a mojito while everyone else dines!  :)*Berry-mango daiquiri = 350 calories*Mojito = 190 caloriesI have to upgrade this place a star due to dealing with the Sun City crowd, let alone my Grandmother! This RL location is close to where both my Mom and Grandma live and as far as chain restaurants go, is pretty consistent where everyone can find something they like to eat. When we stayed a couple of nights in August, we came here as a family (husband, daughter, mom, G-ma and one other) and my Grandma arrived with the other party and lo and behold, she had forgotten her teeth at home! Our waitress was very understanding and suggested a couple of soft things for my Grandma to try. Needless to say, no one left hungry and Grandma like the lobster stuffed mushrooms she ordered and some of the shrimp pasta that came with my meal. Just recently, I was in Phoenix for a couple of nights before heading to Tucson for my cousin's wedding. Since my mom was working on my first night there, I asked my Grandma where she wanted to go for dinner letting her know I was not interested in her other "favorite" Elephant Bar, so this is where she chose to go. It was a Thursday night around 5:30 (late for her) and we were seated right away(there was a huge wait by the time we left). I made sure Grandma had everything she needed before leaving (including her teeth which we now joke about) and after debating the menu choices, decided that I would order the "Endless Shrimp" (knowing she would eat the salad and some of the shrimp that came with it) and she ordered  the lobster pizza. The rolls of course are the main draw for me at RL, and I was good and only devoured one! Grandma took one bite of the lobster pizza and decided she didn't like it and sent it back and ordered the lobster mushrooms she had enjoyed in August. While waiting for those, she ate the salad and some of my fried shrimp and some really tasty and very fattening shrimp pasta thing. When her mushrooms arrived, she decided she was no longer really hungry, took one bite and sent those back too! Our waiter was great. I mean super great. When she advised it was her 87th birthday (her actual b-day was about a week away) he asked what dessert she would like "on the house". He ended up comping us a dessert and took both the pizza and mushrooms off the bill. I tipped him HUGE for all of his patience and accommodations and seriously wanted to hug him for being so great. All in all, this must be my favorite RL location and I am grateful for the times I get to spend with my Grandma!

Review Text :
ALWAYS PAY CASH HERE.This review is not about the food at Filibertos. I love their food and have had many meals from different locations--I need my Filibertos Fix at least once every couple of weeks. Their portions are big and grossly delicious. This review is rather about a shady credit card charge at this particular location.I drove through, ordered my usual #16 (2 fish tacos with rice and beans), and pulled up to pay. $7.26, as always, awesome. I gave them my card, they swiped, I signed a receipt, got one back, drove off, life is wonderful.2 days later, I'm checking my credit card charges and I see a charge for $9.26 from Filibertos. WTF? Thankfully, I found my receipt from that purchase. Oddly enough, the receipt they gave me listed that I had paid with $7.26 in "Cash"--it wasn't a credit card charge slip. I should have looked at what they gave me, but who really does? I just assumed it was a credit card charge slip, crammed it into some orifice in my car and drove off. I don't really feel like printing out my credit card statement and arguing with them over $2, especially since this is the closest Filibertos to where I live and I don't want them spitting in my food if they see that it's me in the drive-thru. So the bastards will get away with overcharging my card this time. But I definitely did just want to warn you all about this shady business. I know I will definitely be paying cash for my meals here now. And counting my change.

Restaurant name  Florencia Pizza Bistro
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
With as many good pizzas as there are in Phoenix you would think that we share a border with the wrong country.  Florencia is another great example of the good pies that are adorning our eateries.  While not quite in the same league as Bianco, LGO, or Humble Pie they still make the trip to Ahwatukee worth it.  The crust is light and very tasty.  It holds up very well against the big boys with their coal or wood fired ovens.  The margherita is simple and allows the crust to shine.  My only complaint would be that the sauce can really make the end of the piece very soggy.  We've tried several combination's and they all pass muster.One of the better spots to eat in that part of town.How amazing was the Bravo, a no sauce, chevre, sausage, and fennel on a medium thin-crust ($16.25)?  Well, have a look at the photos and see just how much I had!  Florencia's thin-crust pizzas normally contain cornmeal, but I was able to specially-request one without.  Fabulous!  The bruschetta was oh, so very good-- the tangy-sweet balsamic vinegar is key in making it so tasty.  :)  Liked the fact that it had a lot of garlic, too!  The only downside, so far, was that the desserts I inquired about were all pre-made [cannoli shells came dusted w/ powdered sugar from the supplier (Kim wasn't sure that the pastry cream had powdered sugar in it, but w/ the shells being pre-dusted, the point was already moot!), the caramelized walnuts, for the Apples and walnuts w/ ice cream dessert,   didn't come w/ nutritional info (were they made w/ granulated or powdered sugar?), and ice cream wasn't homemade...  I wonder if Florencia makes its own cookie batter for its chocolate chip cookies (freshly-baked and then topped w/ ice cream)?  Again, w/ the ice cream not being homemade, this scratched out another dessert option for me.  With desserts being a non-issue, I'm able to eat more crusty pizza to my heart's content!  A very glittery silver-lining, which you'll soon agree with!  :DVery patient and fast service- ask for Kim.  Nice, non-intrusive music playing in the background, but the restaurant got a lot noisier as the room slowly filled w/ dinner traffic, so come in early to avoid it.  Restroom was clean and very spacious-- there were two stalls when three would've easily fit!  I dare anyone to feel claustrophobic in there; Not gonna happen.I'll definitely be back!I've been eating food from Florencia Pizza Bistro for over 10 years now, and not once have I actually dined in! *gasp* Every single order has been pick-up. Never have met any employee here with a bad attitude, on the phone or at the bar. I will say though, inside the decor is cute. Various wall hangings, somewhat dark for mood. So yeah, my suggestion will be pretty simple. If you're here for pizza and you order anything but the Putanesca Pizza: You're doing it wrong! Garlic and olive oil instead of traditional sauce, chicken, a generous scattering of capers and kalamata olives, red onion and sliced tomatoes.  It's the perfect combination of savory and salty flavors. The crust is melt in your mouth status. What more could you ask for? Oh wine, duh. Pizza and Netflix night is incomplete without my old friend Pinot Noir. Check it out for consistently delicious pizza! Hope Florencia stays open for a long time. Maybe we'll finally dine-in one of these days we're paying a visit to the ol' 'Tuke.

Restaurant name  Aloha Kitchen & Bar
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
So "Aloha" means both hello and goodbye -- now how can I work that into my review?Here goes:To begin with it, I've never seen a combination bar and Hawaiian fast food place.Aloha (Hello) Kitchen reminds me of a typical Hawaiian fast food place: well lit with a lot of cheesy decor.Besides having the basic plates, they also carried some unique stuff. I tried the Adobo Fried Rice and the wife tried the Saimin soup.  The food wasn't really anything to yelp about, but since it is a chain kinda place, you shouldn't expectation too much.I'd be willing to go back just because they serve poke (one of the items I don't find at a fast food place) on Friday and Saturday.So until then, Aloha (Goodbye) Kitchen.Aloha (Hello) Bar is right next door to the Kitchen but is a 180 from the Kitchen: dark with a dive feel to it.  But it still gave off the laid back Island life vibe.Bartender was cool and even spoke to me in dakine.  Thanks.She stopped though when my face went blank and didn't respond.  Sorry.The music had the kinda beats I could groove to for a couple hours, and the crowd was chill.After a some drinks and a couple games of pool, I was saying Aloha (Goodbye) Bar.  Good thing since they just fired up the karaoke machine.Overall, I'll be saying Aloha (Hello) sooner to the Bar than the Kitchen.A special aloha to all the Vegas Yelpers from Hawaii.There are a bunch.Late night munchies after you hit the clubs? This is the place to be! Along with the good food, there is also an annex type kareoke bar you can enjoy after the food! Please do not come in intoxicated and annoying though, because you will get kicked out!! No soliciting please!My gal pal and I stopped by for a quick bite while in the neighborhood. We placed our order at the counter, our first time so my friend asked how did they do their macaroni salad. My friend is from Hawaii originally and has had macaroni salad many different ways. She was curious so asked as she did not want to regret a double order of a style of mac salad she may not like...you catch my drift.The clerk replied that she had no clue, however she added she "thinks" it may have chopped cucumber in it? She also stated she had never tasted it before. Ok so being the type we are, we go for it, and wield the consequences later...so double order of the "Mystery" mac salad it is.It was a bit bland, not made with best foods, most likely store brand mayo. Not sweet, not very flavorful, however if mixed in with every other item on your plate, it does the trick.We ordered the the Pork Lau-lau, served with Rice and Macaroni Salad.This dish was good, the lau-lau was a great presentation, very tender, juicy and tasty. It was a nice portion indeed. The sticky rice was good as well.I also ordered a side of lumpia shanghai w/sweet chile sauce the way I like it. Mmmmmm yummy.I make chicken lumpia at home, I will come here for my pork lumpia!All in all was an ok meal, some goodness balanced with some blandness rates this review with a 3 Star.Suggestion is have your employees know the food, questions about their menu is something they should be prepared for. Just saying...I hate to do this -- but here goes . . . . I was totally craving local food (aka Mom's cooking) and thought I'd get my fix at Aloha Kitchen.  I'm from Maui, so . . . there's nothing quite like Mom's, but I thought this might come close. Our group had the chicken katsu, teriyaki chicken and teri beef plates with the rice and mac salad.  I can't say any of the above was worth a repeat visit. The katsu - I make better katsu myself and with that being said, I think L&L's katsu is better and . . . that's still L&L, not Mom's.  This was very garlicy, small strips of thin chicken with more crunch than chicken.  The sauce was ok, not best ever, but ok. Honestly could not finish it, I threw 1/2 of it away and I never do that. It was THAT bad.  And for the record, I had the bubbly stomach (gas) effect all afternoon.  Gross.I think I have a problem with their teriyaki sauce.  The chicken was average and teri beef was chewy.  Sauce was ok, but like a 2-star says . . . "Meh. I've experienced better".  I was most disappointed with the hard, dry rice - it's not hard to cook rice!!  Even my 8 year old makes better rice - cmon now!!  And then came the mac salad which again, L&L does better.  It wasn't awful, but it wasn't great either.  And it certainly wasn't Mom's.  Would I go back?  Nope.  It's close to my work and I'd love to say I would.  But nope.  Place was pretty crowded though and I've been told to "order breakfast next time", but I wasn't feeling breakfast at 12:00 Noon.Good grubbing of the island kine.We had a quick breakfast pick up here during a recent visit in Vegas with friends and ordered up a lot of food.Breakfast spread http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/aloha-kitchen-and-bar-las-vegas?select=_A6eqibhsvixKCuL55KR6g#zJ1UnVQ_qWLwg_wxRC-UXA  We got the basics Portugese sausage and eggs, lots of Spam musubi!  You cant go to a place called aloha kitchen and not get musubi's!  These were of good size and a nice thick cut of spam unlike same places there the ratio is more rice than spam.Adobo fried rice http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/aloha-kitchen-and-bar-las-vegas?select=_A6eqibhsvixKCuL55KR6g#7HB73c6cPjKml2mVyEt2kw  This was a pretty tasty omelette with lots of adobo inside.  Def a must get!I didn't actually go to pick up the order so I cant speak to how the place is.Eyes ~ Wow that is a spread!Nose ~ Smells Yum!.Ear ~ Everyone happy with the food.Mouth ~ These are all pretty ono!.Tummy ~ Full and ready for the day!

Restaurant name  Micky's Hot Dogs
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
This place is the SHIT. I just recently found it driving through Mesa, went home and yelped it  And found out they were making sonoran hot dogs ( ***Lord, please let these be good so I don't have to drive 220 miles roundtrip once every 2 or 3 months by myself just to have a proper sonoran hot dog and drive straight back***) and these things called caramelos.These sonoran hot dogs were just as good if not better than el guero canelo down in tucson. In fact I would say they were better. I never had a caramelo before, and I still don't know what the technical difference between them and a quesadilla is, but after eating one I will now be naming my first child Caramelo, boy or girl. Eating these two food items were far and above more satisfying than having sex with a chick who is a 10. In fact I almost busted a nutt after my first bite of the caramelo. Which ironically will end up saving me a trip to the doctor because I was beginning to think I needed Viagra as of recently. Oh, and this place is cheap as fuck. If our currency ends up experiencing hyper-inflation and losing almost all its value, this place will probably still be affordable.The reviewers below, geoff, kelly, and gary who gave this place only 3 stars must have brain damage.Located in a colorful Small Shack on side of the road in a sadly depressed industrial area of Mesa. You may see people pushing a cart with their belongings or scrap metals at a slow pace while humming a cosmic tune or talking to an invisible companion from outside this realm.Inside this small wonder they offer an assortment of tasty Tacos, Burritos, Tortas, Quesadillas, and Sonoran Hot dogs. Fresh Salsas are made daily and displayed along with pickled red onions, radishes, and other yummies at the Salsa bar.I had to try the bacon wrapped Sonoran Hot dogs loaded with everything and some Tacos al Pastor on the side just to see if I was missing anything. I really liked the Mexican style hot dog bun that was used. It was sweeter than your normal grocery bun. Very simple and tasty. Don't forget a trip to the salsa bar to dress up you dog or tacos which helps kick the flavors up a notch. Service was friendly and quick and inside was clean and tidy.Definitively A-OK and then some. Worth the drive when you need a Mexican Style Hot Dog. CASH ONLY. Delicioso!

Restaurant name  The Keg Steakhouse + Bar
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
I just had one of the best dining experiences I've had in a LONG time. We went to the Keg with their birthday club coupon (see instructions below) and had a great meal for a steal of a price. I feel like I got away with something to good to be true, so much so, that I want to go back to make a deposit in my karma bank. First of all, Keg has a great happy hour that I always seem to forget about until I go there for dinner. This time, we remembered right as we were walking in and decided to sit in the bar for dinner (good decision #2, #1 was going there in the first place). Briana was our server and she was great! Very friendly, the perfect balance of attentive but not overly so. Never seemed like we were annoying her with our "one more minute" or "on the side" requests. Nor, did she seemed bothered by the fact that we had the email birthday coupon for a free prime rib dinner ($23 value). The best part is you don't even have to get the prime rib, you can get anything you want want and they credit your check for the $23. Happy hour is M-F 4-7 with a few $5 appetizers, half price wines by the glass, draft beers, and $3.75 Orange Crush Martinis (one of the best martinis ever!). The only thing is that HH is only in the bar or the patio. So, if you'll take a moment to connect the dots with me, I can have dinner in the dining area and pay full price for glass of wine, or I can eat dinner in the bar and get the wine for half price. Um, I think the answer is obvious. Dinner was great. We both ordered from the seasonal crab menu. I got the mushroom and crab crusted sirloin and the birthday boy got the sirloin topped with crab and roasted red pepper sauce. Both came with a potato side (baked for me, mashed for him). Everything was cooked perfectly to our request and so delish! Toward the end of my meal, I reached what I like to call the "point of no return." This is where there is not enough to take home, but just enough to push me over the edge of way too full if I eat it all. While I was just about to go in for it and stuff myself, Briana showed up to check on us. She easily made the decision for me and said "Take it home!" Maybe three to four bites of my sirloin left and she not only didn't make me feel like an idiot for wanting to save it, but she encouraged it. I heart her! Added half of the baked potato, a piece of the delicious soft bread, and the thick tomato slice garnish from the boys plate.  Plenty for lunch tomorrow!Oh, and one more thing I love about the Keg; Keg size glasses of wine. A nine ounce pour at a great price. Perfect for two people to each get one when they want a little more than one glass, but not quite enough to finish a whole bottle! And with the 1/2 price wines by the glass during happy hour, it's AMAZING!! OK, here is what I think you need to do. 1 - go to kegsteakhouse.com and sign up for their newsletter (birthday club). 2 - check your email at the beginning of the month of your birthday. 3 - go to the Keg (with the coupon, if you can wait that long, or when ever you just want a good meal) 4 - sit in the bar, M-F, from 4-7, for happy hour drinks and appetizers. 5 - if you're still hungry, order dinner and eat in the bar area, getting the best of both worlds! 6 - don't forget about the draft beers for $3, the Keg size wine pours, and the ultimate Orange Crush Martini!!! 7 - rinse and repeat, I mean go back again and again . . . I'm going to!Came here for my Birthday dinner. They do have the greatest Birthday deal in town for sure. If you sign up on their website, they will send you a certificate for $25.00 off one of the best dinners you will ever have.So we got the full works, starters, dinners, a bottle of wine and dessert.French onion soup to start. Fantastic, we have been here a few times before and knew this was a winner.Next I had the steak and Crab legs, and T the Filet mingon and lobster. Also wonderful. The bread was even good at this place.After a wonderful dinner,we thought we would have dessert. Major dissapointment!I got the chocolate Brownie with Ice Cream. It was a cheap Ice Cream, almost like an Ice milk, and the Brownie had no flavor. T got the Key lime pie. She said it tasted like she made it herself from a keebler pie crust.She gave me a taste and it was awfully sweet,Both came with canned whipped cream.It was a wonderful dinner just spoiled by the dessert.Next time eat everything just not the dessert portion of it. Just skip it.Our experiance was good other wise. Our server was a little pre occupied with the table next to us. She knew them( one of them worked there or used to). So she was busy talking to them. luckily we were not in a hurry. Still a good place, been here a few times and will come back for sure.

Review Text :
I originally wanted to get some pizza from the competitors by this Hawaiian BBQ place nearby but Mr. W. wanted to try Barro's.  Driving by numerous times, I had always assumed Barro's was the same as the mall food-court place "Sbarro."  If only!We had ordered their special of an XL one-topping pizza with 24 wings for $28.  We ended up with a pepperoni pizza, 12 fire wings, and 12 BBQ wings.  I don't know if I was experiencing a lost of taste but everything tasted bland to me.  It had a good amount of cheese and pepperoni but there seemed to be a lack of seasoning.  The crust was almost a punishment in itself.  Although it was a chewy crust, it ended up being something to mindlessly gnaw on while staring at the television.  I do enjoy the portion size for the price and they weren't stingy with the ranch [although I wanted blue cheese sauce].  Mr. W. said the fire wings were outrageous but he also said the pizza was pretty good so I'm not sure what to say to that.  The BBQ wings did taste better cold out of the fridge the next day though. All in all, I'm not sure we'll be back again as there are many more options around that delivers more bang [and flavor] for the buck.Before reaming these guys, I will start by saying I really appreciated the Friday night quick delivery and thought the wings were good.  With that said...If you like thick doughy pizza, defrosted translucent-wilted salad, and rude customer service from a manager by the name of Kendra, then BOY do we have a pizza place for you.Pretty much, everyone knows that salad is one of the riskiest items on any menu, being one of the biggest bacteria carriers.  Our disappointment with this order began with what we found in the garden salad container.My wife, being ServSafe certified, noticed a significant portion of lettuce (which seemed to have been frozen and thawed) which was translucent and visually unappealing.   We've posted the photos so you can see for yourself, but unfortunately Yelp removed them on 12/14/12 because "...your photos looked more like they captured your personal experience".  Umm k.My wife phoned to bring this to the attention of a manager.  She politely explained that they may want to check their salad, to keep other customers safe, and requested a refund (for the price of the salad only).  I listened in, and can confirm how polite she was.  The manager, Kendra, wanted to give us credit instead.My wife explained that we don't plan on ordering from Barro's in the future, and would just like the salad price refunded.  The obviously annoyed Kendra replied "OK!" and then hung the phone up.  No apology, no thanks for reporting potentially out of temperature food.  Nothing but the echo of a dial tone in our receiver.The pizza tasted good, but the texture is accommodating to those who prefer a thick and doughy crust.There are too many other pizza places to put up with potentially tainted food and substandard customer service.  No thanks Barro's.Barro's is the best pizza in the valley, and a local chain that made good!This is a newer and cleaner Barro's than i've been used to going to, so points for that.The fake brick walls kind of close in on you, so I advise not to ingest any hallucinogens prior to your coming in.

So, I love happy hours. Beyond explanation. You can imagine my excitement to find out that happy hour is from 7 to close. Needless to say, we ordered. A lot. Too much. BUT, in my defense...it was like impulse shopping - impulse dining. Anyways. I ordered a bloody mary, to get my tummy prepared for the onslaught of food that it was about to receive. Also, the artichoke dip, sliders and tacos. Clock ticking. Excitement fading. Tummy growling. Irritation growing. Finally, the bloody mary arrives! Or should I say tomato juice. No celery salt, hot sauce, worcestershire sauce, ANYTHING. Except for a whole fucking celery tree that was engulfing the glass. Boo hiss. The rest I shall summarize: Artichoke dip = large jar of mayo. Again no flavor. Tacos = soaked in "sauce" (aka mayo)...couldn't taste much besides that. Sliders = ok. Just ok. Meat reminded me of what I imagine wet dog food to taste like. So, why the two stars you ask? Well..I added one star for the cheap drink prices during happy hour (stick to beer, maybe). Now I shall find my giraffe and ride off in the sunset, in search of some good food.Yelpers, If you don't read only one review this year, don't read this one; the service was bland, but so was the food - this review can't be much better.Quick tip, Phoenix in the summer months is not ALWAYS hot, carry a light jacket or sweater in your car, sometimes it's coooold, brrrr. Why some establishments think that 100+ degrees outside means it should be 65- degrees inside is byeond me. We visited on a Saturday before a movie and they seated us just under what seemed to be an ice vent, I was glad I had that sweater in the car.My first impression of the Elephant Bar was "What type of food do they serve here?" Are they Mexi-merican, Italian, American, BBQ, sandwich, Asian Fusion? I'm not sure, and neither does their 30+ page menu. They've got the most confusing menu I've seen from just about any restaurant. I think I saw the same menu item on three separate pages with at least two separate items, why? Don't ask me.I FINALLY, after about 25 minutes, ordered a barbecue glazed chicken sandwich with the macaroni and cheese side - which they touted all over the menu and table top flyers (the mac n cheese that is). By the way, turns out that their idea of barbecue glazed is a bland piece of chicken with barbecue sauce added after it's put on your sandwich. I could have sworn that barbecue glazed means it's cooked in a fire roaster / oven with the sauce.I ended up sending the macoroni and cheese back after 4 or 5 bites, the noodles were way over cooked and the cheese was bland, I guess I could have added salt, but didn't really feel like paying for mediocre macoroni. I also requested them to add jalepenos to my chicken sandwich, and they sent out basically an entire jalepeno pepper on the side not peeled, not chopped, not diced, but sliced about 5 times - I ended up cutting it into smaller pieces myself with the butter knife they supplied me so I could actually add it to my sandwich.The chicken wasn't pink, so I THINK it was cooked, but it was walking the line of cooked and not cooked. After about one fifth of the chicken sandwich I decided the flavor wasn't going to get much better and ended up sending that back also. The bill arrived and to my surprise the chicken sandwich was still on there. I asked the waitress "are you really going to charge me for that meal?". She went and found the manager to which I had to explain again all the reasons I didn't want to eat the food they provided and why I didn't want to order something else instead.My wife's hambruger was good though. If you're here, hungry, and confused at what to order, get a burger; I think it's the best thing on the menu and difficult to get wrong. Who knows, maybe they can. :-/Run. Not to, but away from this Elephant. Pretend it's a real elephant and it's scary and chasing you. That's how fast you should run. While I've had friendly, if not efficient service. It's the lame food. I've seriously had better things from Stouffer's. Sauces are thick and sugary. Drinks are overly sweet and not nearly enough booze to shmooze. After the Jordin Sparks party at SKYE we met some friends who said they would be here. I sighed. Or did I cry. I forget. But we gave it a shot. It was 10:00 pm and the place was an elephant morgue. Seriously the only guests were our friends. We were immediately told we could have no food and only one drink. Ahhh! Really? How hospitable! A quick shot of Patron and a visit to the elephant pottie and we split.Extremely noisey, undercooked rice, chicken very salty and dry, just not a good experience! Plus, we had 7 adults and a 1 yr old and they squeezed us all in a booth! Unbelievable! On a positive note, the ice water was very good!

I've been looking online for the last hour trying to find a menu for Market Café at the Buttes. All I can find on the Marriott Buttes website is information regarding their flagship restaurant, Top of the Rock.So, that's annoying and perhaps should be fixed.Anyway, the review...The Market Café has an impressive environment inside with the massive indoor waterfall and the view from the dining room is spectacular. Although they serve breakfast and lunch, the real deal is the all-you-can-eat breakfast buffet. Unfortunately, the breakfast buffet lacks the splendor the environment/ view has. The buffet is good, but not great. The buffet has all of the usual breakfast items:eggs, French toast, cereals, muffins, bagels, fruits, sausage, bacon and the price is very reasonable.They also serve mimosas, which always makes me very happy. The staff was extremely helpful. In fact, our table had 4-5 servers making sure we had everything we needed.Overall, I 4/5 highly recommend the Market Café.

I've never been to Surprise Arizona before so I had no idea where to go eat when we were out here for a Rangers spring training, so as always I relied on Yelp to help me and my co-workers find a spot! We were searching for Mexican food, so as soon as I found the reviews for Las Cazuelas, we immediately headed that way. It's located in a strip mall next to a gun store but don't let this deter you. Once we entered the place we saw that it was packed, which is a really good sign. It seems as if the locals as well as all of the out of towners frequent this place. The restaurant is divided into two sections so we took a seat in the rear in ne of the booths. I looked at the very large menu and ordered the vegetable fajitas. When I asked for no cheese or sour cream, they said it wouldn't be a problem at all. They brought out my plate of fajitas along with a side of cheese covered beans. The portions were huge and real good too. I hate the fact that they bring you a basket of only three tortillas, yet you have a whole plate full of food to fill them with! The grilled onions and peppers were good, the only problem that I had with it was that they included tomatoes as well. This kind of made the plate runny and soggy. I really wish that they would have given me a little more guacamole as well. But overall it was a good meal and I'm glad that we found this spot.Great food, great service, what more can you ask for? I definitely recommend Las Cazuelas if you're in the Surprise area. Venture a couple of blocks off of Bell and the tourist area and try it out, you won't be upset that you did

I've eaten here at Saigon a few good times but never by choice.  Mr. W.'s family loves it here but I really don't care for the place. The servers [and owner too I believe] are all Chinese who love to stand around and gossip about their patrons.  Don't be fooled by their friendly smiles.  They talk a lot of smack.  I ran into my mom's hair stylist friend whom I've known since birth once and who is also my grandmother's god-daughter when a nosy waitress walks up to me as soon as she left and asks me if her ring was real with the snobbiest attitude.  Okay, excuse you.  Go away you rude old woman.  The food is mediocre at best but it's super cheap eats.  You get a lot of noodles for your pho and plenty of herbs and condiments but the broth is bland.  The spring rolls are served a bit warmer than I feel safe but their egg rolls are delicious.  I'll probably be stuck coming here again and again because of Mr. W.'s family but I'll always eat it with a pained smile.

Restaurant name  Costa Del Sol At Sunset Station

Review Text :
This place is the Oyster Bar inside Sunset Station. Alot of parking outside and inside garage.Service was fast and got great service from Julian at the bar. Anthony is them man. Sit at the bar just say how you want it and magic happens. Food was great on this visit and portions were right on. Plus cocktails right there no wait.Reasonable prices and great portions of food with great quality and taste.Have fun and enjoy.What a nice surprise! We wanted something other than the ordinary and seafood was on the radar. Thanks to my MIL being a "degenerate gambler" (as my wife likes to call her) we decided on Costa Del Sol in Sunset Station to accomodate her bingo addiction.Having been to Palace Station and believing the hype about their pan roast being "the best", and withstanding a near 2 hour wait for it, I must say with sheer delight that the pan roast at Costa Del Sol is just as good...WITHOUT the 2 hour wait in an old smoke filled dump. The location is ultra convenient, and the venue itself allows children to sit anywhere, including the bar area. There was no wait and very friendly service. The menu is the same for all the Station Casinos with variances lying on the different chef preparations, which they will also admit. Table seating is available, but note that the booth near the entrance behind the waterfall will get you a little wet.Bingo Betty and I ordered the Lobster Pan Roast, and my wife the Linguini with White Clam Sauce.The fact that our orders took about 20 minutes to bring out gave us hope the chef was doing the dishes justice. The Lobster Pan Roast was delicious! We couldn't believe the large chunks of lobster in generous amounts in both our dishes. The broth was perfect and spicy, the way I like it. You can order 3 levels of spiciness, and I chose #3 which is a 10 on the heat meter. It comes with 2 generous scoops of white rice and will fill you up. I don't like filling up on rice when there is more important seafood to devour first, so I didn't mix mine into the pan roast.The White Clam Sauce Linguini was also perfect. Al dente linguini in a delicious lemony broth with a good amount of clams...both shucked and a few unshucked clams for presentation with enough leftover broth to sop up with bread. Despite cleaning our bowls, we couldnt resist getting their Bananas Foster dessert. Vanilla ice cream with warmed bananas that didn't look good in its presentation served in a melted mess. It was ok, but still a nice way to top off our meal.If you happen to have a "degenerate gambler" of your own who has a Station Card, make sure you have them scan it for points to use towards dinner, which can save you off your bill or even get your meal comped :)

Minus one star for not yet naming a smoothie after me. Minus another star for charging me four bucks if I order a peanut butter and jelly sandwich off of the kids menu for myself. This same PB&J would be only three dollars if it was, in fact, for my kid. And ... AND it would come with a bag of Sun Chips and a juice box! So not only am I paying a dollar more, but I am rendered chipless and juice boxless! "Why?" I ask. WHHHHHYYYYYY!?!?!?!  Are those of without offspring and who crave pre- or post-workout PB&J's being discriminated against simply because we've chosen not to spread our seed just yet? Seems cruel.The dollar (as well as the Sun Chips and the Juicy Juice) is important to me. On more than one occasion, I have considered borrowing a toddler from elsewhere in the fitness club so as to get the "good deal" on the samich, but I can never make it past the gals working the front desk in the playroom. Those of you with small children may find comfort in knowing that they take their jobs - and your little ones - very seriously at the child care center at Lifetime Fitness (a review of which is likely forthcoming). But back to the café ...I'm pretty bent about the PB&J deal, and I've yet to find a work-around. But I'm giving a star back because the people working the joint are always very nice and the place is well done for a café in a fitness club. It really is. Great overall selection, including smoothies, burritos, salads, pizzas, wraps and, of course, a kids menu. They make most everything to order, but also have some grab-and-go items if you're in a hurry.In short, Life Café is all that and a bag of chips. (As long as you're 12 or under).

If I could afford it, I would come here every day and order their blackened salmon salad.  Roasted Corn & Red Bell Pepper Salsa, Edamame Beans, Tomatoes & Multigrain Tortilla Chips with a balsamic dressing.  My absolute favorite, hands down, and it pairs well with their arnold palmer.

I hang out on restaurant patios as much as possible this time of year. This place has a huge covered patio, which is always a plus in AZ. The restaurant is located in a high traffic area, but I really didn't hear any of the noise from the traffic. I came here for happy hour and it was busy. They have lots of high tops outside, but they quickly fill up if you come around five o'clock. The crowds dwindled down outside by about 6-6:30 pm, which is great if you want to sit on the patio and take advantage of their happy hour.  They have discounts on drinks and apps are 25% off from 3-7 pm  Mon-Fri. They also have other drinks specials that change everyday.It started getting a little chilly once the sun set, but they started a fire in the outdoor fireplace which was surrounded by some pretty comfortable chairs and a love seat, another plus. Didn't try any food, but the menu looked pretty good (standard American food) and the prices looked reasonable. Looks like a great lunch spot. I'll have to come back and have something to eat next time.Was looking for a place that delivers Pizza and found this joint on Yelp.  I ordered a small Pepperoni & Sausage Pizza w/Jalapenos on 1/2 ($10.95 plus $1.75 for each topping).The Pizza was delivered pretty quickly.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wEc4JE2NYQr1RnGjGr4q7w?select=YteH1pH5LJEpwG07ZX3N9Ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wEc4JE2NYQr1RnGjGr4q7w?select=HlzLd9Q8thIf0PZ33AgRuwhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wEc4JE2NYQr1RnGjGr4q7w?select=-8ecQVJPSRa3WlsKLsTbIQI took one bite out of a slice and instantly became a fan!  The Sausage had a nice balance of flavors...slightly sweet, but very good.  The Jalapenos are on the spicy side, which is how I like it.....for some people, it may be too much.Overall, it was a solid Pizza.Return Factor - 100%Terrible drinks and mediocre food. Was not impressed at all!  It was pretty empty too so I must not be the only one with this opinion.Please tell Candace not to give customers their check prior to asking for it. Thanks for cutting my night short.I've been here a couple time and every time I go, I always get charged extra for things. One time the waiter dropped my friend's burger on the floor and charged us for a new one, another time I ordered cornbread as my side with my meal and it was an extra $5 that they didn't even mention or state on the menu. Food isn't that good and way too expensive to add extra charges to things without warning. I won't be coming back unless someone else is paying!Horrible service. Felt rushed. Gave us a check before we finished eating and before asking if we wanted anything.An unhappy "Happy Hour"...  The food was good and the beer cold so what went wrong?   Staffing or management unfortunately impacted our fun.  We came in with 6 ( our usual Friday group) and wanted to sit at  the high rise table by the front door.  We would have sat outside but the smokers are so bad out there, it's not even an option.  GO SOMEWHERE ELSE FOR OUTSIDE SMOKE FREE ENJOYMENT.   A waitress seated us and the manager came up and said the table was "reserved".  There was no sign and apparently even the staff didn't know this.  She made no apology, no offer to try to accommodate else elsewhere.  We wandered and then the same waitress offered to push two small low tables together.  It was difficult to get continued service as our poor waitress had two large groups and 3-side tables she was responsible for.  One or our couples are pretty influential community members and he was quite put out.  I was embarrassed that I had selected O'Donnells.  I thought it's not the waitress's fault.  I finally told him I was sorry.  By the way, we are in our early 60's, well dressed, normally a fun group.Why have a Happy Hour if you cannot staff and take care of your customers?  Happy Hour in Scottsdale is pretty competitive .  Oh, and that reserved table?  We left after two (2) hours, still no sign on it - and no people at it.  Four of us have been regulars for the past 5-years with many out of town guests.Time to move elsewhere...  And K O'Donnells - smelling that stinky smoke and burned holes in the cushions outside is more like the old days in Reno.Jennifer, thanks for your reply but unfortunately, you were not given good information.  The misters were not dripping, as I have witnessed when it is too humid, and they were turned off earlier in the evening, only to have the patio erupt in disappointment, and then subsequently turned back on.  The second time it happened, the temperature was still 102 degrees.  As your father walked around the patio the second time, the vote was 50/50 to turn them back on so he made the call.  His words; "there was no consensus, so they stay off".  We were never the only table complaining about the heat, as your servers can tell you.  There was no flipping off of staff, as you mentioned, in fact, we had great service and received free drinks as our server felt bad for the entire situation.  I would have let it go, however, the poor attitude we got when we made the complaint was not good customer service and the table of cold men actually turned their chairs to face us and stared us down with their arms crossed until we could pay our checks and leave.  It was an unfortunate situation for all but poorly handled by your manager, hence the Yelp review below.  Such a nice patio but the men are freezing so the misters are off so time to go. Poor customer service. It's 102 degrees people!I had really high expectations for this sports bar. All the reviews are pretty positive. I am reviewing for my first visit because, to be honest, I'm not sure we will go back and we were hoping to utilize this bar as our game watching location for football and hockey. It's a great size, close to home, and has a great looking food and special drinks menu and decent taps for the beer boys. I was out doing errands and stopped in for a late lunch. I sat at the bar. I ordered the wings because I am a wing fiend and these sounded interesting and tasty. They first fry the wings like normal, then sauce them, and then grill them. I LOVE spicy foods, so I ordered volcano. The wings arrived with bleu cheese, carrots and celery. Some of them were maybe a little overdone, but not enough to complain about and as you will see below, I don't think that would have been a good idea. The wings were very good, but definitely not spicy. Not even a little bit. I asked the bartender for a side of the volcano sauce to dip them in and that helped. So, the food was good. Not fantastic as many others have experienced, but good. So, why three stars instead of four? The atmosphere in the bar was just...off. Granted, it was 2:30ish on a Thursday, before happy hour, so I'm sure that had something to do with it. There were regulars and staff and they were definitely taking advantage of the slow time. I didn't get a friendly vibe from most of them and they pretty much stuck to themselves. It wasn't nasty or anything, just "off". I just had wings and no drinks, so maybe that was the problem. When I asked for the sauce after receiving the wings, I felt like I was interupting. I've been a server and a bartender and my FAVORITE part was getting to visit and build a rapport with all my patrons, newbies and familiar faces. After all, that's how you get regulars! If we go back as a group to watch a game, eat, and order drinks, I'll let you all know. :/As a Constitutionalist, I believe in private property rights. A business has the right to control the conversation in their restaurants. Just like any of us have the right to do so in our own homes. Anyone has the right to remove someone from their private property for any reason. You do not pay the rent payment every month, don't tell them what to do with their property. This storm will blow over K O'Donnell's... stay strong! No one will remember this in a couple of weeks.

Review Text :
It's not that I don't like burgers. I just need to be in the mood for a burger. Last night when I went to Red Robin I wasn't. Why the hell did you go to Red Robin you say? I had a left-over gift card to use, ok? So I went with a veggie burger prepared like one of their "signature" burgers. It had melted cheese, bourbon sauce and onion straws. Of course it came with fries. I didn't finish the veggie burger and it didn't sit well with me. Oh well. Good try. The service was outstanding and garnered a nice tip by the way. So for this visit, 2 stars. I did have a burger here several months ago and it was pretty good. 3 stars for that visit.Well, damn.Until tonight, all of our experiences at Red Robin had been positive. Even at this location, our past meals had been enjoyable.Tonight, though...tonight left a sour taste in my mouth. That's not to say that the food was bad...it was actually pretty good. But the service was atrocious.We thought it was our lucky day when we walked right in on a Saturday night and sat right down at 7:00. We ordered our appetizer and drinks. The waiter, Cameron, came back and took our order a few moments later.Our appetizer came out in record time! We had hardly taken a few bites of our hummus plate, and then our food came out! Like I said...the food was good.So, where was the horrible service? The food was there fast, hot, and it was good. What could have bothered me so much?Well, I don't think the waiter said more than a dozen words to us. It seemed like he was late for something very important, and we were his last obstacle to overcome before he was able to free himself from the self-imposed bonds of servitude to Red Robin.Customarily, the waiter comes around after the food arrives and asks how things tasted. This guy didn't show up until our food was gone, our drinks were gone, and we were ready for the check and couple of to-go boxes.He begrudgingly gave me a refill on my drink before he dropped off the check. Now, granted, we don't ever get desert in a restaurant...but this guy didn't even give us the satisfaction of turning down his delicious sounding proposal.The whole process felt like we were imposing on this kid. We were in and out of the restaurant in less than 30 minutes.  This guy robbed us of the entire restaurant experience.If you can't enjoy the experience, then why go?It will definitely be a while (if ever) before I visit this location again. But I can promise that I'll avoid this kid like the plague if he's still "working against his will" at this location.Apparently, when I say I hate Red Robin, people react as though I'm saying I hate Disneyland. I just can't get into the jar of mayonnaise, shredded lettuce and tasteless meat they put into their burgers.Gourmet burgers my ass.Fries were great, spinach and artichoke dip was great. I guess I'll eat vegetarian here.We were seated at a table quickly.We were given a highchair, and I of course, whipped out our daughter's baby wipes, to wipe down the table. (she is teething, so anything she sees, and she's like a bottom fish)I wish I would have taken a picture, because after I was done wiping, there was my hand print, a dark grey out line on the baby wipe........Are you kidding me?The girl came around and took our order, we ordered, wedge salad, a prime rib dip, and a burger.salad came out, it was good. Manager walks around (or at least attempts to) in pretty woman looking boots...Making her rounds, but mostly joking around with staff.We wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, and wait for our food.Booties (manager) comes over and asks how we enjoyed our dinner...We then informed her that we hadn't eaten yet.She goes back and "checks". Waitress, and booties (manager) tell us separately that it will be "one minute", or that it's "next up".Whatever that means.Food comes, and it's decent, worth the wait I suppose.PLEASE, CLEAN YOUR TABLES PROPERLY!I usually have decent meals here at Red Robin.  The location is easy to find at the Galleria Mall.   It's located right off of Sunset and you can see their restaurant sign from the parking lot.  Since it's at the mall, it's usually pretty busy from open to close but I can usually get seated fairly quickly.   They do have tables in the bar area so you don't have to wait if you don't want to.   The menu is pretty huge with so much to choose from.  They have such a great selection of different burgers!  I always order medium rare and they do a good job with getting that right.  I have a love/hate relationship with their french fries.   I love them and hate that they are unlimited!  On my last visit I tried their sweet potato fries.  They bought out a huge side of them.  Unfortunately they weren't cooked long enough and almost like I was eating raw potatoes.  Strange.   I had to ask them to cook more.  Hopefully that doesn't happen on a consistent basis.  I will note that their kitchen seems to take longer than most places to prepare your meals.  Maybe that's why I get appetizers since I'm waiting a while.  Customer service here is really hit and miss.  You can get a really upbeat waiter/waitress one day but the next they are a downer.  I do, however, realize on a regular basis the servers don't really come back to the tables as often as they should.  Drinks do go empty and I'm always looking around for them to get the check.  In my opinion there are better places for burgers with better service.  I keep holding out hope they will improve.We gave this place one more shot, but now we will never come back.  Reasons why as follows:1. 15 minutes before the waitress (Lisa) took our drink order.2. 20 minutes before she brought them back and took our food order.3. After an additional 20 minutes we flagged down a passing hostess to ask her to get our waitress.4. 10 minutes later....no Lisa, so we left.5. The manager did chase us down when we were almost to Macy's but it was too little too late.Wow. I can't believe people eat this stuff on the regular. This was my first time ever at a Red Robin and it was pretty much what I thought it would be... cookie cutter food, mundane vibe, and terrible service. Normally, I save the bad reviews for my second visit, purely to be fair. I mean everyone has a bad day, but I don't ever foresee myself coming back here.When you're with the parents, sometimes you're just too hung-over to fight for a better place to eat, hello Red Robin. After waiting fifteen minutes for a table into a partly filled dining room, we were escorted to our seats. As we walked past the miles of screaming kids and sad looking overwhelmed parents. I noticed that not only was the place was relatively empty, but the empty tables were covered in dirty plates and old food scraps. Yummy. We sat down and were literally passed by three different servers for about ten minutes until finally a served stopped before walking by us and asked if we had been helped, "No, not yet", "oh man, well you're not even my table, so I'll be right back", wow. He did come back to take our order, but you have to realize at this point we have been in this place for almost twenty five minutes and haven't even received a glass of water. The food was a strong meh. I ordered the Ensenada Chicken Platter, with a side salad, pre-seasoned bagged frozen food, limp salad, and tons of dressing, because what do you do to mask bad food? Drown it in sauces and salt-based spices. I know this pace is known for it's burgers, but I wasn't feeling it, sorry Red Robin. The beer menu also confused me. They have the Stone and I believe Lagunitas logos on their beer menu, but when I asked, what kind of Stone they had on tap, the server said they didn't have any, wait what? It was all Sam Adams and Miller brands, so I ordered Iced Tea. Why add this logo to permanent, laminated alcohol menu and not even have it in stock? Beyond the bad service, lack of good beer, and questionable food. Our bill was still pretty pricey, over sixty dollars for three people at chain restaurant? Note-to-self, don't let anyone else choose the lunch spots from now on. RED ROBIN... No, Not Yum.

This place is ok...I was with a friend and we were out shopping and got hungry so we stopped in here.  The service was really good, they seated us quickly, came to take our drink orders and then came back to take the food order.The food was not bad, everything was prepared the way we desired and staff was very friendly and helpful.We had 3 different dishes and based on those 3 I would venture to say just about anything you get here will be pretty decent.  I would definitely go back to this place again when in the area as I love Chinese, Thai Food and just cannot seem to get enough of it but all places are not the same.This place is one of the better one's at least based on this experience, we will see next time, I hope they continue to please.

This place is AWFUL. I'm sorry, there's just no nice way of saying it. I picked up my food and while waiting for it, there was a man complaining about his meal and asking for his money back. This should have thwarted me but I ended up paying 30 dollars for this crappy food. We order the sweet and sour chicken. The sauce has a strange flavor, unlike the traditional red sauce, this was orange and bland. Almost like jello. We also ordered the egg drop soup, which was very thick and had an odd taste to it, seemed old. And also ordered the crab puffs which were bland, room temp, and just tasteless. Way too expensive, I paid 30 bucks for food we ended up just throwing away. Do not recommend for those who love a good Chinese spot.

I wouldn't say this place is bad, but its not great, either. Here are the items you should order on the AYCE (15.95): Steamed Egg, Pork Belly, Beef Brisket. Also, they have pretty good side dishes, but in particular, I didn't like the broccoli that they made. In the end, it's all a pretty good price for what they give you, but those are the best items, in my opinion. Service was good for me. There wasn't a long line or a ton of people eating here. It was very private and bright inside. Plus, they have a great window view of..Chinatown haha! I feel like they did make our grill way too hot. It was burning my face and my food and I had to ask them to turn it down! I'd probably come here again because it's cheap and good, plus there are no extremely long lines! Next time, I'm just gonna turn the grill down and keep that brisket comin'!!!!MY FIRST REVIEW AS AN ELITE MEMBER! WISH IT WAS A 5 STAR REVIEW BUT...I have never been to a more disgusting place ever. I do not want to go into the sanitary and cleanliness of this restaurant due to Yelp rules but I will say that "Dirty Dining" should definitely investigate. Honestly not a big fan of Korean BBQ but family wanted to eat here. It's a All You Can Eat BBQ. You pick 1 out of the 3 menus they have which is of course 3 different prices. We went with the Vegas menu which was about $20 per person. You get to choose the meats that is on that menu. We went with Bulgogi, spicy pork, spicy chicken, and the family had cow intestines. Yes, INTESTINES! you already know I did not touch that at all. We also got an order of shrimp for the kids that is not included in the Vegas menu so it was an extra $25. They bring out little small plates, kind of like appetizers in the beginning. There was fish cakes, spicy broccoli, kim chi, jalapeños, mashed potatoes, horse radish, house salad, and soup. When the meats come out, There is a stove on the table and you actually cook it yourself. we had a few different waitresses assigned to our table because we were a party of 14. One of them pulled the table without acknowledging my phone was on there and dropped it. Good thing it didn't break or else I would have went crazy on her. Our drinks came after we got the food which was pretty unacceptable. I was thirsty! So we were eating spicy food without any waters for a good 10 minutes. Never will come back & I do not recommend this place to anybody!

Restaurant name  Capriotti's Sandwich Shop

Review Text :
I'm a Capriotti's fan. I eat at one 1-2 times a week. This is one location I love because not only is it tasty but it is near a Home Depot I frequent. The store is clean. The dining area isn't very big so I usually phone my order in and pick it up to go. During lunch hours this location is a mad house and can get cramped but obviously worth it!I like that Capriotti's has been giving a $3 coupon on some receipts I get. Not sure how long it will last but as long as it is around I will be appreciative! Pay attention to your receipt you might have one on there. You do have to go to a website and fill out a brief survey but it is quick and worth the discount.I'm a sucker for a "Capastrami". It has Pastrami, Swiss, Cole Slaw, and Russian Dressing on a hoagie roll. It is pure heaven with each bite.They have a variety of sandwiches to choose from.Should you be a fan of the "tastykake" brand they carry a variety of their snacks. The "Wise" brand chips are my fav.Sandwich sizes are as follows:-Small is 9 inches-Medium is 12 inches-Large is 20 inchesthis place has been voted by lv review journal readers as the best sandwich year after year.i've eaten at nearly every location in las vegas and would say without a doubt they are the best. My wife loves this place so much one time she bit into a hair-tie in the middle of a sandwich-spit it out and kept on chowing down.The Capistrami & Bobbie are my favorites.The capistrami is hot pastrami with their special cole slaw & russian dressing on a fresh roll 12 or 20 inch. The bobbie is a thanksgiving delight. everything on a roll. turkey,stuffing and cranberry sauce with or without mayo!!the service is always fast & friendly. the atmosphere is that of a small-town deli/sandwich shoppe and the food is always consistent & great. a little more $$ than others but always worth itI don't think i can go to Vegas again and be satisfied without stopping by this great sandwhich shop (and Sonics) . I'd never used to go somewhere just for their pastrami- i was never a huge fan of the Hat, Top etc, even though it's good. but now good is not enough, since i know out there, there's a whole better sandwhich. The thanksgiving dinner in a bun (their turkey sandwhich) is awesome as well. too bad there aren't any in California. - drives me crazy! Just like how there's only ONE Sonic's within an hour and a half drive and they bombard us with those commercials.Great great great!!  Amazing sandwiches and service!  Small but sufficient shared parking lot, close to the strip (2 blocks-ish) without the craziness of the strip, and the service is fun and busy -- large staff to fully support the orders (not 1-2 people, but 8 or more!).First, you have to know, the secret to a good sandwich is the bread.  Here, at Capriotti's, they know HOW TO DO IT RIGHT!Randy's Top 4 Capriotti Sandwiches:#1 "The Bobbie" - (to die for) - moist and tender shredded turkey, cranberry sauce, and STUFFING #2 Meatball - (thats'a Italian to you) - great and meaty balls, super good, great sauce#3 Roast Beef - (so dang good!) - cooked right there in the shop, super moist and tender, and shredded#4 Chicken cheesesteak - (The Pope would say "holy moly") - tender chicken cuts, get the works with cheese, mushrooms, peppers, and onions!Capriotti's is my favorite sandwich shop!!  There are many locations, find one nearest you (or move closer to one!)Just sayin'......... if you're rating "sandwiches in Vegas"....... and for both taste and value..... this is my current 5-star winner.You only have to look at the 170+ reviews, with an average 4-1/2 star rating, to feel comfortable in anticipating a decent sandwich. What put this over the top for my business associate and me was both sandwiches and service.We were both wasted after another trade show day, standing on our feet, "gratefully" (I should qualify), talking to clients from around the US and World that visited our booth. By 5pm, we both agreed on "something simple" that we could take back to our off-strip condo's. Ironically, I'd never tried any Capriotti's location ever!? My loss. We order two hot sandwiches and two cold. Their "small" is 9", which is really a large in the typcial fresh-off-the-grill sandwich world. And this is a "sandwich kitchen" with a "hot-top grill", plenty of fresh onions, sweet bell peppers, mushrooms and plenty of Provalone... ready to join your grilled meats in a super "comfort food sandwich experience!" (I'd recommend you ask for "extra Provalone"... just because you can!)My personal thanks for the three person crew that cooked and served us that early evening! It was a pleasure stopping by, and the positive food and customer service experience will now make this particular location a "Must Add" to my "Vegas Black Book of Fooderies."Love this hole in wall place! =) Veggie Cheese Steak: 5 starsToasty & delicious, so tasty  =) The veggie chicken they had inside tasted so close to chicken that I couldn't believe it & the melted provolone cheese just gave it a delicious finish to it. Service: AGreat friendly service & they were so helpful too. Decor & Ambiance: AClean & chill place..great for groups/ families. Food: AOne of the best yummy Sandwiches that I've tasted in a long time!  =)This place beats Subway & Quiznos outta the water! ;)

Restaurant name  Baja Fresh Mexican Grill
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
After having some Baja Fresh at the San Diego Airport on a recent trip, I was in the mood to have it again, so I stopped by this location.  After browsing the menu, I decided to try something new and ordered a Nacho Burrito (Chicken, Jack & Cheddar cheese, Pinto Beans, Rice, Smoky Queso Fundido, Jalapenos, Salsa, $6.79).http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/UMDYX0_C9TWxkANMoXBxGg?select=AqQo_Yxp0xhQO5owbgCVowWhile I was waiting for my food, I got some of the Spicy Salsa from the Salsa Bar.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/UMDYX0_C9TWxkANMoXBxGg?select=2raPMLrsrXO_6CSOdqgmpwhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/UMDYX0_C9TWxkANMoXBxGg?select=8eIvV0n0FRIh3yvggahHwAThe Nacho Burrito was OK, not great.  I wasn't too impressed with it.  It has a lot of potential, but just didn't seem to be as tasty as I had imagined.  The Salsa, which was supposed to be Spicy, was mild....bummer.Overall, it was an average visit for Baja Fresh.Return Factor - 65%
Sushi On Shea=We magically landed at this sushi place about two weeks ago, so happy we did!! We loved the location ( Corner of Shea Blvd and Scottsdale) and the amazing Blue lighted fish tanks!! Great entertainment while eating!! We came in close to closing time and they still treated us like royalty!! Much appreciated!! We then decided for the Eel Roll as well as their Cali roll, Teriyaki Bento Box and some Chicken Yakisoba noodles!! It was all delicious, especially the eel roll and chicken yakisoba!!! Yum :) We honestly had an amazing time and satisfying conquer from this place. The reason for the four stars is their early closing time!! Oh well :)
Schlotzsky's=so everyone was talking about these carvel cakes and asking about locations. I always drive by this schlotzkys and see the little carvel sign. I had a bad experience with the beyond disgusting carvel cakes from the grocery store and pretty much decided that it was just a nasty, poor quality product. well, i got over myself and decided to try it, and oh man it was good!!! it was thicker than frozen yogurt but not as solid as ice cream and the flavors were rich. I had the small swirl in the waffle cone and it was huge! the waffle cone was not as good as cold stone but it was sweet and crunchy and still totally delicious. i am totally a fan. i will just have to stay away from the gross grocery store cakes. try it!and as far as schlotzkys? i like the original w no mustard and their pizzas.
Hot Rod Grille=Well my last visit here to get the Iowa Pork tenderloin Sandwich was a total disaster so I planned ahead and brought the phone number with me so when I was in the area I could call in a takeout order.I ordered the Pork Tenderloin Sandwich with onion,pickles and mustard $8.99+taxThey said 10 minutes I was there in 5 it was hot & ready.Just like I remember- years ago in Iowa when I last had one.Crispy and juicy, larger than life. I hardly had 2 bites and my son was so enticed he had to "have a go" at it and he couldnt stop himself he wanted his own so we sat in the parking lot eating one while waiting on another for the road.Cool fun atmosphere but the service is suspect, even with my takeout it was 6pm on a Saturday night -NFL playoffs -the bar was dead and only 1 small group in the diner.Open 24 hours a day.Great hard to find sandwich, a little pricy but HHAGG wants $14 for a pork tenderloin sandwich. Next on the list.
Charleston's=Charleston's... Where to begin. We happened upon this place mostly by accident. It shares a parking lot with Texas Roadhouse which is a great steakhouse but because of that fact, at any given time it's extremely crowded. We had planned on hitting Texas Roadhouse for dinner before catching a movie at the nearby Mesa Grand AMC Theater. However, as is always the case it was packed, and we were told it was a 45 minute wait. Seeing Charleston's across the way, we said why not? Upon entering the place we were surprised to see how well done the interior was. Classy, with dark wood and stone accents and lit just well enough to maintain an intimate atmosphere. Each table is lit by candles and soft overhead lighting. Up until recently it had some real smooth Jazz playing in the background (which has regrettably been replaced with easy listening/pop fare in an effort to attract a younger crowd).All of the wait staff male or female is dressed in black slacks and black shirts which may sound pretentious but only adds to the ambiance in practice. They are, in general, extraordinarily attentive and quick to serve. On most weekends, the management helps bring out food, refill drinks and make sure everything is satisfactory. Nice touch. Now on to the food... oh the food! I have yet to eat a meal that was less than excellent no matter what I order but my favorite is the Baby Back Ribs and Herb Chicken combo. It's a huge plate of food, and it comes complete with garlic mashed potatoes and I opt out on the bbq beans in exchange for the glazed carrots. You MUST eat the glazed carrots if nothing else... I do not like carrots at all mind you, but these I could eat all day until my skin turned orange.Aside from the carrots, the herb chicken is actually a half a chicken seasoned perfectly and very succulent. I've scoured the internets trying to find the recipe for this bird and it's nowhere to be found. I'm considering a part time stint at this place just long enough to poach the recipe or at least watch the chef do it. Delicious. Sub out the potatoes for the fries (they're crispy, and salt & peppered) and you won't be disappointed either. It's never as crowded as the neighboring Roadhouse, but to me that's a good reason to check it out. It's great.Tip: Check out their menu on the web before you go. It'll give you an idea of the kind of food they have in store for you.We had been wanting to come to this location and try it for quite awhile.Too bad we came the night we did, because, we were not impressed at all. Food was not hot when it came out, our Server did not know any thing about the Tea that they carried. ,She had to be asked to refill our drinks more than once.It just was not a pleasant experience. We so like the one in Chandler so much better.I do not think that we will return to this location. Maybe it was not a good day for them. But, now that I have tried it ,I cannot ever see a reason to return.Had a late lunch in Mesa, AZ at Charleston's. It was about 3:15 pm when we walked in. There was only two other occupied  tables in the dinning room. The decor is much like Hillstone / Houstons / Bandera. The menu and food is much like them too. Our table ordered the Baby Back Ribs and the Prime Rib. The food was excellent. The 10 oz Prime Rib ordered medium rare was so good and for only $23. The two orders of Baby Back Ribs were gone in no time. Plenty of parking in the shopping center. Service was excellent.
Toh Zan Nagasaki Grill=Absolutely the most authentic, delicious Japanese food in the valley. Having lived in Japan and grown to love their cuisine, this is the only restaurant I have tried in the valley to duplicate the flavors and presentation I experienced while over there. The place itself isn't much to look at, as it used to be a Dunkin Donuts back in the day, but don't let that turn you off as you would be missing out. Unlike many "Japanese" food establishments it is actually owned and operated by a Japanese couple who make and prepare all of the food themselves right when you order it. From the mouthwatering Sukiyaki and Tanin, to my girl's favorite, the Oyako Domburi, you can't go wrong with Nagasaki Grill. I can't recommend this place enough.If you want the real thing, there is no other place even close.The BEST Japanese food in Arizona... I've been coming here when it was Happy Bowl Samurai back in the 80's! These guys have been around for over 20 years...Same owners, Yoshi and Yuko... plus, they do catering for the Japanese baseball teams that come each year for sping training!!! and it's hard to find authentic, Kyushu-style food out here! My favorite is the Nagasaki chanpon and fuotmaki the owner's wife makes on the weekends! Plus, they make awesome donburi dishes that cannot be beat out here.I was born in Japan and know quality Japanese food and this place is it!Let me tell ya...I have been going to this area of the valley over the past 5 years hundreds of times, and everytime I do, for some reason I don't have the time to stop in...or when I do, it looks like they are closed.  But I finally made it in this past week and boy am I glad I did!!!I am really picky when it comes to asian food, some might even call me a food snob:)  I have tried so many different kinds and different restaurants that there is a lot  to compare to.This Japanese restaurant is by far one of my very favorites...Just looking at the little stand alone building this restaurant sits in reminds you of little tokyo in downtown LA.  Walking in you realize IT IS very authentic.  Its owned by a older japanese couple that do all the cooking and servicing themselves!  Its soooo cute!!Looking at the menu, its no none sense.  It is simple and to the point.  There are some items that are catered to the american crowd but the execution on the dishes I ordered is strictly Japanese.Miso Soup was piping hot- love it!The Japanese curry with chicken katsu was probably the best I have tasted here in AZ.I also had the Cold Somen noodles and perfection it was.  The  tsuyu, dipping sauce was flavorful..umami style!This is homestyle japanse cooking at its best!  I will make time for this place everytime I am in the area from now on....I can not believe I almost missed out on this place:)
Cafe Noodle & Chinese Barbeque=A three hour walking exploration of Las Vegas' Chinatown culminated with a large and delicious lunch here.  Relying once again on the ratings of Las Vegas Yelpers I decided to check out this spacious restaurant along Spring Mountain Road.It was like stepping into a restaurant back home again as a lady greeted me in Cantonese and asked me how many.  A single index finger answered that question as I was escorted to my table.  Judging by their conversation two gentlemen seated beside me on their lunch break seemed to really like this place.  Honestly I don't eavesdrop but sometimes when you're sitting there reading your cell phone you hear things.The menu being clumsy and tattered was definitely a symbol as to the popularity of the place.  The prices on the other hand were about double what I would pay in San Francisco, but I usually keep an open mind on that being that things are rarely as good as they are at home.Noodles or Chinese barbecue?  Not having steamed rice for nearly a week the Chinese in me went with the latter in selecting the rice plate with two BBQ meats.  Roast Duck was definitely going to be my first choice, but it was the recent review of a San Francisco Yelp friend who wrote about a San Francisco deli with very good Soy Sauce Chicken that influenced me into trying my second choice.  I hadn't had soy sauce chicken all year so that's what I picked to go beside my duck.Not sure about portion size I selected the Crispy Fried Tofu appetizer as well.The tofu (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/L6qd3x0bHymyxub9dF7lIA?select=2qOeThevkuoRKc9Enk6mSQ) arrived first.  The eight squares of crispy, golden fried silken tofu on a bed of shredded lettuce served with a simple soy sauce infused with chopped, fresh jalapeno was simple and fabulous.  The taste was very clean and very fresh without a hint of frying oil.When I saw my rice plate (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/L6qd3x0bHymyxub9dF7lIA?select=8UiNNR3cVaxzUVHi3UoCDw) I knew right away I couldn't finish it.  Not only was the steamed rice piled high, but so were the meats.  I knew I'd end up concentrating on the meat since I wasn't about to carry leftovers back to my hotel room.  The drippings from the roast duck mixed into the rice was so good though it was hard not to eat all the rice.  Both of the meats were cooked well.  The chicken had good flavor but the meat was a bit thin and a bit chewy.  The duck was actually meatier than the chicken, and I definitely enjoyed the flavor more.My sensitivity to MSG didn't come into play.  It's hard to imagine Chinese style BBQ without MSG, but since I couldn't detect any I'd have to say this place did it right.  The health score of "A" was quite reassuring too.  That's something I don't see that often in San Francisco!It's so sad when you discover that long time favorites suck now... Cafe noodle's duck, won ton, egg noodle soup was always an old fav on cold nights, but I haven't done it in a while due to all the great ramen places that keep popping up. Today was the first time in 10 years of coming here that everything about it was pretty crappy. Salty, but otherwise flavorless duck, won ton is missing the chunks of shrimp that have always been there. Add to that some pretty bland broth, and you have a good sized bowl of sadness and disappointment. Quality of our other usuals have also gone down in the past year or so - beef chow fun, Singapore noodles, salt & pepper pork chops and the whole friend chicken. Hate to say it, but I'm almost ready to give up on this placeLunch (11am-5pm) & Late Night Specials (for $4.95, and the portions are generous, definitely the right spot to hit up for decent hot meal on a glacial global economic recovery budget.  That was how I felt about the economy back in 2011. Vegas has definitely recovered a lot from the dismal lows, but not really back to what it was before the crash.  So I continue to seek out decent restaurants that is budget friendly, and Café Noodle & Chinese Barbeque continues to be near the top of my list for curing hunger on a tight budget.Like many other Yelpers have mentioned, the restaurant is not the cleanest.  Even after clearing a recently vacated table and sanitizing it, it still feels not quite clean. Maybe it is that lingering thin film of grease or they simply needed to use a cleaner rag to clean the tables.  Well, at least the utensils and tea cups are clean.Anyway, I ended up here at Cafe Noodle and Chinese Barbeque, a restaurant that I have walked past numerous times to other businesses in this super busy plaza with the ridiculously inadequate parking spaces. However, the American name is completely foreign to me, and to locate it I had to look up the driving direction.  The place was relatively crowded at 11pm on a Tuesday night, and pretty much every patron was Asians.  I immediately sensed a good vibe that this place must be at least decent.After looking over the menu, I opted for the Salt & Pepper Chicken Wings appetizer (tasty but on the greasy side, occasionally not very flavorful due to insufficient amount of "salt & pepper") and the Pan Fried Noodles with Beef and Vegetable (very large portion and pretty flavorful).  The food is not high end, but for the prices they are charging you, it is well worth it.  That was from my very first visit back in 2011, and the incomplete review draft sat and sat and sat some more until now.So two years have gone by and several visits later (both dine-in and take-out), my impression remained roughly the same.  Service for the most part is their weak point.  Not the friendliest or most attentive, but occasionally you will get a waiter that stepped up his game (a refreshing change). Then there are times when you end up standing there for 5 minutes wanting to place an order and be completely ignored by the lady behind the counter and ultimately walk out and head across the street to another near 24/7 Chinese restaurant that is just as good, if not better.The food at great value is what keeps me coming back once I get over their latest service mishaps. What I do recommend here:* 2 BBQ Items Combo on Rice (I usually get their BBQ Duck and Soya Chicken) - it will set up back $8.75* Spicy Eggplant Hot Pot - one of my favorites* Salted Fish & Chicken Fried Rice - I usually get this to go plus something else. Slightly adventurous due to the salted fish.* Any of their Pan Fried Flat Rice Noodle dishes - but sometimes it is a little greasy, so drink plenty of hot tea!* Crispy Fried Chicken (all day special dine-in only offer for $5.95 each) - that is a very sweet and filling deal!From 3PM to 5PM, they have a limited "High Tea" menu, customers get a free HK style milk tea or coffee (hot or cold) along with your order. Not an awesome promo, but if you have to pay for said complimentary beverage it will cost you $2.50.  NOTE: In their recent Chinese newspaper ads, they have all day specials from $4.95 to $7.95, but I have never tested that during normal dinner time.Minimum for credit card use is $15, so order enough or bring cash.Review #1 of 2014. Checked!What I thought would be a nice lunch with a few of my friends, actually turned out to be a nightmare of an experience. The staff is blatantly rude and did not give a warm welcome when my party and I first entered. It continued to go downhill from there because our waitress was curt, and she didn't even seem to care about our table. When she came to take our order, she approached us with a harsh tone. It sounded like she was annoyed, but our party just got there and the restaurant wasn't filled up with people... She then proceeded to cut me and my friends off a few times while we were trying to say what we wanted from the menu. She also kept stopping in the middle of taking our order to have conversations with people in her language, which is okay, but I didn't see it appropriate to have full-on conversations while writing our order down... There was another employee who was refilling our drinks and also brought the food out to our table. He wasn't friendly either, and whenever he'd pick up our glasses to refill with water, he would smack it back down so water droplets came out of the cups. Same thing happened with the food. Even with us saying "thank you" with a smile and a happy tone, there was no response from him. Way to make your customers feel even more unwelcome...We ordered the salt and pepper pork chop, BBQ pork with soft noodles, the crispy noodle dish, beef chow fun, and the garlic and onion pork. The salt and pepper pork chops were small bits of pan-fried pork ribs. They were a bit salty, but nothing too harsh. They actually were quite good.The BBQ Pork with soft noodles is just your average "lo-mein" type of dish. It wasn't anything amazing, but it was good enough for us to chow down on.The crispy noodle dish was alright as well; it's crispy until the sauce makes the noodles soggy. The veggies they put in it were green and tasted fresh. The chow fun and the crispy noodle dish both looked slimy from the sauce, and the meat in it looked like unidentifiable protein. Anyway, it was good for what we came in for (to eat a bunch of Chinese dishes), but definitely not worth the sit-down experience. The presentation of the food wasn't too appealing, either. It looked like they just slapped it on the plate and expedited it to our table.Overall, they have a wide selection of different dishes on their menu, but the horrible service was unforgivable. Honestly, I've never been to a restaurant where the workers were this rude to their patrons. A good business should cater to customers to build customer loyalty, but I guess giving out acceptable customer service is just not one of their priorities. Sigh... I don't mean to sound like I'm ranting (and typically I'm easy to please), but save yourself from giving your money to a place that doesn't care about your business. If you do decide to try their fare, heed my warning -- you'll get subpar quality food paired with awful service.
Cousins Subs=Stopped by for lunch around 11:30 and it wasn't too busy yet.  Looked at the menu and ordered:Big Daddy Sandwich (Cappacolla Ham, Coteghino Bologna, Genoa Salami, Ham, Pepperoni, Provolone, Black Olives, Pepperoncinis, Lettuce, Onions, Tomatoes, Parmesan Asiago, Oregano, Oil, Red Wine Vinegar, Mayo), $7.49http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cousins-subs-scottsdale-2?select=5a58W9LHNH6AWP912YWjyg#5a58W9LHNH6AWP912YWjyghttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cousins-subs-scottsdale-2?select=kumKHw5gR7_Spho1gQjaBw#kumKHw5gR7_Spho1gQjaBwChips & Drink, $2.59http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cousins-subs-scottsdale-2?select=JuQo7zFEAoR4DhL8dk35NA#JuQo7zFEAoR4DhL8dk35NAThe old guy working the register was super nice and suggested that I get the Sandwich cut in half to make it easier to eat.  I followed his advice and it paid off.  The Sandwich is stuffed full of the ingredients and is quite messy to handle.  If it wasn't cut in half, it would've been even messier.The Sandwich tasted pretty good and the Bread was also above average.  Their house brand Chips were also above average and had a unique taste to them...to me they were almost like Sour Cream & Onion more than Jalapeno.Overall, a good lunch experience.Return Factor - 80%
Hot Bagels & Deli=ROLF ~ I hate to give any business a 1 star rating especially when it's a locally owned but after two different visits to Hot Bagels & Deli in Surprise, I view them as a potential health hazard.  Our last visited started off on the wrong foot with the owners having a conversation between themselves and ignoring their customers.  We ordered two bagel sandwiches for lunch ~ asiago cheese bagel with ham & cheese and a side of chips and drink.  They only offered two choices of cheese, Swiss and American which I don't like either... My friend ordered a turkey & swiss (only choice) on a jalapeno bagel.  Half way through our bagel sandwiches I noticed little blue dots on bottom of his bagel and they were not jalapeno's, ROLF!  The bagels were old, chewy and came with a bit if penicillin apparently.This was my second bad visit and don't plan to go back.  I tried to tell the owners about our experience and she turned away and walked off! wowsers!
Adar Kosher Pizza=i really did not enjoy my short time in this awful restaurant. The only reason i came here is because a friend of mine keeps kosher and we couldnt really find anywhere else to eat, so we came here. The service was crap. The waiter acted like a freaking diva, and the food was terrible. We were a party of 5 people, so we pushed 2 tables together. The retard waiter came up to our group and said we cant push tables together, so 5 people were stuffed on a table that was meant for 2 people ( un-freaking-believable).There were no prices on the menu nor on the large overhead lighted up menu next to the register, so we ordered an XL pizza assuming it would be $13-17ish. We then helped ourselves to some snapples which we later found out were $3.50...!!! wtf! who charges $3.50 for a little bottles of snapple?!After we finish eating our nasty pizza ( even microwave pizza is better then their pizza) on our tiny table with a party of 5 we ask for the bill.The waiter comes to our table, throws the bill on the table as if hes doing us a favor and walks away...The bill came out to $45!!!! FOR ONE XL PIZZA?!!!!!! ARE YOU FREAKING KIDDING ME?! IM NOT AT SOME FANCY RESTAURANT!This restaurant is seriously this little ugly 550 square foot room with a tiny kitchen in an ugly area off the strip. Who on earth do you think you are charging us $45 for a pizza. Freaking retards.We left $1 for tip. I even considered that too much.You give us jews a bad name, shame on you idiots.
Manuel's Mexican Food=2.5 stars, but I'll round it up for our first visit.Mom's choice after seeing it featured on Check, Please! Arizona.  We were looking forward to trying the Tres Amigos, for it looked so good on TV.  I thought I heard one of the guests say it was made with flour tortillas, and since I'm allergic to corn, I was happy to hear this.  I didn't even bother to confirm with the server, since I'm tired of asking so many questions.  Well, at least two of the enchiladas were made with corn, so I left that entree for Mom to enjoy.  She favored the chicken tomatillo most.  It was also the only one she found cooked perfectly.  The other two (spinach and shredded beef) had tortillas that were partially-cooked.  We both tried the side of refried beans and liked it.  She thought the rice was terrible and didn't even bother to include it in the leftovers. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/manuels-mexican-food-scottsdale?select=Ra5FvYBankc_ub_K1HrytQ#Ra5FvYBankc_ub_K1HrytQI ordered a spinach enchilada in a flour tortilla a la carte. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/manuels-mexican-food-scottsdale?select=aoxX8QUR6l3n4HuOL4dFYw#aoxX8QUR6l3n4HuOL4dFYw  I enjoyed it, even though it's just a tortilla filled with sautéed spinach and onions, with chopped lettuce and tomatoes on the side.  Would I order it again?  Probably not.  We may return for Mom to try a seafood entree, and I will have to try the beef and chicken enchiladas, but not anytime soon.The flan was good.  Not the best, as Mom makes the best flan, but we both appreciated this flan's texture.  I actually prefer its flavors the day after. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/manuels-mexican-food-scottsdale?select=LFppwbhhjs4-oTzkyYNesA#LFppwbhhjs4-oTzkyYNesA
Whataburger=My 1st memory of Whataburger was in the early 80's in Southern California sometime before I was 10 yrs old.  We had one on the main drag of the city I grew up in.  It was gone by the time I was a teenager.....however, I remember the distinct orange & white striped building and the Burgers.I was excited to finally give it a try as an adult.  I ordered a Whataburger ($2.64) w/Bacon ($1.17) & Cheese ($.49)....and the cashier suggested I add Jalapenos ($.49)....http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/93E1eOQ2bQG0OyIMqdcTvg?select=YKkzLz967qEgfA5eqyqLdAyes, it's really a la carte pricing, LOL!http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/93E1eOQ2bQG0OyIMqdcTvg?select=Wb0gZDFFQxcuphBQ9eHCsQI was really hungry, so I also ordered a Honey BBQ Chicken Strip Sandwich ($4.64) & Sm Fries ($1.39).http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/93E1eOQ2bQG0OyIMqdcTvg?select=MJOS72B9ZlfsPbsNsznntghttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/93E1eOQ2bQG0OyIMqdcTvg?select=rjwgNh2n7fSapWGco38MoQThe Burger was OK, nothing special.....it did taste just how I remember it.  The distinct flavor of the Onions & Mustard in the Burger brought back memories.  The Chicken Strip Sandwich was above average, which surprised me.  The Chicken is real, White Meat Chicken Breast, and the BBQ Sauce was decent.  The Fries were just OK.Overall, it was an OK meal for a fast food joint.Return Factor - 71%
La Famiglia=I was out and about running errands in Chandler. I really needed to eat something. So driving along to my next appt. I just thought I would stop at the next place I saw. This was it. Italian food is always good right!When I first walked in, it smelled wonderful. I decided on a Slice , Cheese with mushrooms. I need to  wash my hands so into the bathroom. It was very clean and nicely stocked. Which was good considering the lunch rush had just ended.I had brought lemon water with me and I do not drink soda so I just got the slice.I got a side of sauce which was free. Can I just say wow!!! I have now found the best Pizza in the Valley!I have never really found too many places here in Phoenix and surrounding area that have good Pizza, so I am very happy.I also noticed they Ariancini Balls( something you do not find very often). I asked the girl if they were for Dinner or a special order. No you can get them any time!! I told Mario that night and we are going to go there for dinner the next night. I do not know how they taste, but, the Pizza and sauce were really good.I looked up the website and they are a family owned and operated business from New York. Real Italians!! Real Food. Just shows how you can stumble on something really good without expecting it.I did notice that they had free WIFI also, lots of parking in the lot.They do have delivery during certain hours and some great lunch specials for pick up and dine in. The lunch specials are from 11-2 Monday thru Friday.
Four Peaks Grill & Tap=Looking for a laid back place to go enjoy a brewski with friends, family, on a date, or even solo?  Four Peaks Brewery is your place.  Not only is the staff extremely attentive, but the atmosphere is awesome, and the food is pretty impressive as well!I've been to this Scottsdale location a couple of times and had really great experiences.  The spinach salad with salmon is delicious - made with fresh spinach, goat cheese, veggies, and perfectly cooked salmon... get it with the raspberry dressing - it rocks!  The spinach artichoke dip and the beer bread sandwiches are tasty also - and guess what?  Their entire menu goes well with beer.  Imagine that?!I've enjoyed their Peach Ale and Sun Brew, but I imagine you can't go wrong with whatever beer you're in the mood for... An extra bonus is that this location is walking distance to the Regal Sonoran 10 movie theater, so you can go enjoy a beer and/or a meal before or after a movie no problem - it makes for my favorite kind of night!Joined up with some folks here for happy hour before a movie on Thursday.  The spinach/artichoke dip appetizer was great and really could suffice for two of me for a dinner.  The was my first taste of Kiltlifter and I am a fan!The address shows Pima Rd and I spent 15 minutes cruising the parking lot before I figured out it faces Hayden.Four Peaks Brewery never fails to bring back fond memories of many many things.. Old friends, early 20's, scandalous bathroom "breaks", the "patio of illegal behavior", exes, birthday celebrations, drunken debauchery, peeing my pants.... among many other things. It's always the same too, so for a place that brings pleasant reminiscent thoughts and consistency, who can complain? Great menu options, I'd say its your typical above average bar type cuisine, but none of it has ever been crap. I would be the first to list a list of crap if needed. On top of that they have Kiltlifer, so seriously, what is better? To put the whipped cream on top of all of these wonderful things, I swear the only other person in Phoenix who has ever lived in (or even visited) Cape Cod works here.. makes for good conversation about things Phoenicians could give a shit less about. Like sailboats, sea glass and lobstahs. Perfection comes in all shapes and sizes, and luckily, Four Peaks is one of them for me. No complaints here, I have and always will love Four Peaks.I've passed this place several times and it's always jam packed and difficult to find parking, so I when I saw that it wasn't too busy one night, I stopped by.  After browsing the menu, I decided to get a Popper Burger (Sauteed Jalapenos, Onion Straws, Cream Cheese, $9.50) and to wash it down a Four Peaks IPA.The Burger didn't disappoint, it was very good!  The combination of Jalapenos & Cream Cheese made this Burger unique and tasty.....with a little *kick*, just how I like it.  The Four Peaks IPA was a perfect match for it as well....yum!I sat at the bar and the bartender/server was very friendly and helpful.  Can't wait to come back.Return Factor - 97%7/15/12Wow, this location is SMALL!  My first taste of Four Peaks was at the cavernous Tempe location, which I found to be too large, too loud, and too busy for my taste (plus there's not enough parking spaces!).  This one in Scottsdale is more to my liking.  Intimate and not too dark inside (outside, however, I couldn't tell if there was patio seating since it was so dark), open sight lines from most points in the restaurant, the women's restroom looked and smelled clean, AND parking isn't a problem.Came in to order a pint of peach ale, knowing that I can't buy it at stores.*  I inquired about the possibility of taking some home and was told that I may purchase a growler.**  A pint costs around $4, but during happy hours costs $3.25 (pitchers $14/$12).  Reverse happy hour starts at 10p.  Please note that their register's clock runs slow, so you may have to wait a few minutes longer before you can start getting happy.***FYI, if you've misplaced your driver license, you may use a passport to get past the I.D. checker at the door.*Whole Foods sells growlers now, and most keep peach ale on stock.**Growlers are pressurized receptacles that hold 64 oz. of whatever beverage you want to take with you.  A new growler costs $14 and can be refilled for $10.  It is recommended that people finish the 64 oz. within 24 hours of opening, but I was told that the beverage will stay fresh for longer than that.  BTW, peach ale is offered for takeout AND isn't a seasonal variety like I thought it was.  FYI, I didn't enjoy the ale here as much, since it wasn't ice-cold, like the one I had at Tempe's Lucky Break.  I'll have to remember to ask for a frosted glass, if it's available.***Drink because you are happy, but never because you are miserable.- G.K. Chesterton, Heretics.Ya know how people say "I really wanted to like this place" or "I want to like this place more than I do"? It's such a stupid thing to say, because obviously you want to like a place, you don't go somewhere and say "I really want to hate spending my money here and eating their food." Well anyway, rant aside. I do actually want to like this place and I come here pretty regularly, but the service is so annoying. My work buddies and I like to come in after work for a few beers and some food. The food is pretty good, I love their spicy Thai hummus, and the beers are obviously great, the patio is comfortable with heaters in the winter as well. But the service just irks the crap out of me. The girls usually are swamped no matter how many people are there. Most of the time, we don't even know who our server actually is because two or three people come over and take our orders. Sometimes the first girl leaves and trades us off to someone new, or the girl just flat out disappears.Most of the time, our drinks sit empty until someone finally sees us and takes another order, other times our drinks aren't even halfway empty and theyre trying to get us another round. They're friendly and nice, but being nice isn't really the only way to do things. Meh, maybe I'm too critical, but I shouldn't have to ask the food runner for plates, napkins and silverware. Or glasses of water like three or four times. I'll keep coming here because the alternative options suck even more :ahem Twin Peaks ahem Skeptical Chymist ahem:04/30/13Love the burgers and sandwiches (sometimes the kitchen forgets to add one or two key ingredients, say the anaheim chili I ask for instead of jalapeno pepper, or the onion strings) and the dinner specials I've tried at the restaurant hardly disappoint (!), but I really must stop ordering the pasta dinner specials to go.  I've enjoyed the fettucine alfredo that arrived with garlic bread (terrific bread!), but other pasta varieties have left me shaking my head and wanting for more.  Take into consideration the latest special I ordered, the Green Chile penne with grilled chicken.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/four-peaks-brewery-scottsdale-2?select=6gAA2123ljhlmZl2SqKgOA#6gAA2123ljhlmZl2SqKgOA  Photo was taken before I had a bite.  At $15 plus tax, I felt gypped.  What do you think?  The flavors weren't bad, though.  Rich and cheesy, and the green chiles added a lot of heat (!)-- more so than other cheesy green chile pasta dishes I've had elsewhere.  The grilled chicken was pretty good, too-- I don't eat a lot of chicken anymore, so when I do order it, I appreciate when it's done right.  I will keep an eye out for this special to appear on the dinner specials' rotation again, but I will order it for dining-in.  As I've said, I've rarely been disappointed with the dinner specials when dining on, so maybe that's the secret?  We shall see.I have a lot of love for this Four Peaks location.  It all started when I moved to Arizona 7 years ago and lived right down the street from Four Peaks and a few years after that it was the first place that I met Paul V. (my fiance).  This was a usual place for my friends and I to come for some food and drinks.  Some of my favorite foods here include the 5 Layer Nacho Dip with Chicken, Spinach Artichoke Dip (spicy), Grilled Chicken Beer Bread with french fries (my favorite item), Portabella Veggie Beer Bread, and the Reuben.  I really like the atmosphere and the service is usually pretty good.  Once in awhile the service can get slow, but overall it's OK.  My favorite beer here is the 8th Street Ale, but the Hefeweizen comes in pretty close too.  If you are coming here to watch a game, come early because it gets packed.If you're looking for a chill place to have some beer or even food, I'd check it out!
Las Pupusas Restaurant=Good pupusas are always found in seedy-looking areas, but the interior here is surprisingly well-appointed. Pricing is super-low, $2/ea is a bargain for the size of the 'pusas here- they're filling, cheesy, and served with the perfect coleslaw and tomato sauce.Added on an order of yucca frita, not realizing it was an entrée plate including chicharrones but the order was good- I prefer my yucca super salty and garlicky, and this wasn't quite that, but it was still a good portion size and very crispy.Service is friendly- don't be afraid to make a phone in order, even if they answer in spanish the phone is quickly passed to someone who can take your order and fill it correctly.
Popeye's Chicken & Biscuits=Popeye's has always been one of my favorite chicken places in general. The lieutenant colonel and the one with the church name are somewhat on the bland side and are not my first choices for tasty chicken. This location has a few things to complain about. The neighborhood is not the best and it shares the same building with the Circle jerk guys next door. Usually find myself trying to get in and out rather quickly. The customers are always pretty loud and obnoxious and the place is not very clean. You might even be asked for money in the parking lot.Service is basically poor and trying to communicate is difficult and a bit tricky. Normally have to repeat myself a few times to get the order correct. On my last visit experienced a triple sneeze by the cook right on my meal. Gesundheit!Usually order the Spicy Chicken with a side of Beans and Rice. Can't resist getting several jalapenos to give the meal some additional kick. Sometimes I'll even go crazy and order one of the specials. Tried the Catfish on my last visit and was surprised how small it looked. Maybe they should just call it kitten fish?Definitely recommend going to one of their full service restaurants that do not commingle with one of those fast trip places. Once had the occasion to eat in a really industrial part of Baton Rouge and enjoyed the meal so much more than this place. WHAT THE CLUCK?2.25 STARS
Del Taco=What can one say about a single location of a chain restaurant like Del Taco besides:a. They always get my order right (which they do)b. The employees have a great grasp of the English language (which they do)Well, I can testify that this particular Del Taco made one of my wildest pubescent dreams come true.It's like this... what teenage boy hasn't mused that if he had a pair of ta-tas, he'd keep himself amused for hours.  I was no different.Then somewhere in my twenties, Del Taco came strolling into my life, with their thick and creamy strawberry shakes, made with a generous helping of real fruit!  The key to my youthful desire lied within this sweet polar potion... it was called lipids... aka milk fat.Let me tell you friends, the grass isn't always greener.  I'm not amused... not at all.  There's nothing alluring about a tufted teat.  They bounce; they sag; and they can percolate perspiration like Michael Vick at a PETA rally in Death Valley... on a really hot day.And no one seems to care.  Seinfeld conceptualized the 'manzier', but I've yet to see one for sale.I'd have to say my lowest point came while at a water park with friends, one of which brought their new baby.  While relaxing in a lounge chair under the awning by the wave pool, they asked if I wanted to hold little Abigail.  Sure, I love kids.As I was sitting there with this little cutie, I noticed other people were gawking at me.  When I looked down to check on Abby, I noticed that her mouth was firmly latched on to my right mammary.That's right children, come suckle daddy's sugarball.My nonchalant extrication efforts didn't pan out, and the worst part was that I thought I felt seepage.  With pretty much nothing left to lose, I wedged my left index finger between my swollen nip and lil-miss-hoover's mouth until I heard decompression.Baby-go-back-to-Mama.In conclusion, I'd like to think there's a lesson here we can all learn from.  Yeah.~SwoopDel Taco is a fast food chain that serves American style Mexican cuisine. It has been serving delicious American style Mexican cuisine since Ed Hackbarth opened the first Del Taco in Yermo, California just east of Barstow on September 16, 1964. Fifty years later, if you were to drive approximately 140 miles from the first Del Taco up I-15, then east on I-215, and north on Pecos Road there is a Del Taco that keeps the name going strong. I will share my experiences at this location.    This Del Taco is located at the busy Green Valley crossroads of Pecos Road and Windmill Parkway. I often drive by it. However, it was hiking that led me inside the building. This very Del Taco is also a hop and a skip from the Pittman Wash Trail. As a matter of fact, the large parking lot it shares with other businesses is where I separated from my car for a couple of hours. After hiking the Pittman Wash Trail I thanked Del Taco for the complimentary trailhead parking by making it my choice for the post-hike dinner.    Del Taco is more than just tacos. They serve a fantastic cheeseburger that is severely underrated. I walked inside the building expecting to order their mutant cheeseburger, take a picture then spread the word about it in my Yelp review. That didn't happen. If I had visited on any day but Taco Tuesday this would be a different review. There on the door was the advertisement announcing three tacos for $1.29 on Tuesday from 3 to 11 P.M. I'd celebrate Taco Tuesday and add a small Coke and medium fries that added up to less than a $5 bill.    The man working at the counter was friendly. He greeted me and was the first impression of this location. My second impression was the cleanliness of the large restaurant. This is the first Del Taco where I saw the Taco sauces and ketchup packets stored on little plates on every table.   Immediately after ordering I took my small soda cup to the Coke fountain. The deal with Del Taco drink sizes is they are Big. Here small means medium and large means super sized. This isn't one of the fast food restaurants where a small cup is a step above a water cup. The fountains where you fill the cups are Coke products including Coke Zero.   Around five minutes later, I'd pick up the food. The three hard shell tacos were tasty and filling. I topped them off with the Del Inferno sauce. As far as spiciness 2  stars. With the three tacos, I'd enjoy the crinkle cut fries. The fries were good, however, in my opinion Nathan's Famous is the King of crinkle cut fries.   I enjoyed Taco Tuesday so much that I returned to this location a couple of Tuesdays later. It's that good that I just might return here at a later Taco Tuesday.
PT's=After a night of bowling, my friends and I decided we needed food in our systems! Thank goodness we came during happy hour!HAPPY HOUR: Half off all drinks and pizza from 4-7pm & 12-3am!WHAT: Since our favorite pizza wasn't on the menu (The Gilroy), we all came to a consensus on what we wanted on our pizza! The pizza was definitely half off, but since we added several toppings, each topping was 75cents additional- SO WORTH IT!! We created a monster pizza (all meats minus ground beef, and topped it off with jalapenos to create that neede ZING).  The only missing ingredients were tomatoes & mushrooms! BOOOHOOO!!We also had a bucket of sliders, which were pretty legit!! Also, garlic parmesan twister fries, which I always get at the local PT pubs!! Gotta love me some curly fries!!& lastly, had to top it off with the Pear Cider!! This has become my new found favorite drink!! I know, it's girly, but I LOVE IT!!*NOTE: The service was great!! The bartender made it so easy for us to order, and had a great sense of humor! I love people with a good sense of humor. It just brightens my day! =D
Ichiza=this is by far one of my most favorite restaurants in las vegas.  Ever since discovering this place about 3-4 years ago, i have always been coming back.  this isn't your high end japanese restaurant.   the decor is simple, the prices are very reasonable, the food is extensive and excellent, and the place is great place to be merry.  right when you walk in you are greeted in japanese and when you leave your thanked in japanese.  the workers there all seem to be young students.  there are so many dishes to choose from.  the only thing i can do is tell you about what i always order: 1) menu items:  kushi-katsu - crunchy breaded pork w/lemony teriyaki dip; ika yaki - broiled squid;  ichiza ramen noodles - yummy; seaweed salad; beef tataki - rare beef slice to dip in a ponzu-dailkon radish mixture (sublime); kim chee fried rice; and a sashimi plate w/ tuna, albacore, mackerel, yellow tail, salmon, octopus, and squid. 2) non-menu items (sheets of paper that have daily/common specials are posted over the walls)  monk fish liver, fried smelt (my most favorite b/c the eggs are cooked in the belly), and beef cubes in ponzu sauce.  yeah, there are a lot of dishes that i like, but im so impressed that ichiza's has not disappointed me for the many times i've been there.  They have large group seating areas, which i've enjoyed many times with friends and family eating and drinking up cold sake, sake bombs, and japanese beer.  i really recommend their house cold sake, so much better and smoother than drinking it warm.  i've been there a many nights till closing leaving with my belly full and ridiculously buzzed from all the sake we drank.   i always have to put this on the itinerary of any of my visiting friends and family that come to las vegas.  that's how much i love and trust this place.  anybody who knows me, can back me up for whatever say about this restaurant b/c most likely i've taken them there....additional note...don't think that this restaurant is one of those upscale dress up places b/c of the amount of stars i gave it.  it gets five stars b/c all around it's hella awesome!!!My Vegas go to man brought me here - it's on the top of his list, so he has to always bring us out-of-towners there! I've been there a couple of times already and can definitely tell you this is one of those joints for only the locals.  No tourists would be venturing out over here.  All that much better!  When looking at the bar and all the special menu items posted on the wall, it can be quite difficult when deciding what to order.  So, when in doubt, let the expert go at it.I fondly remember the fried smelt (less than $3 for three fish).  These plump babies are loaded up 'cuz their eggs are still sitting inside of them.  And with a little bit of salt and some fresh lemon juice, yum yum!  And who doesn't love ankimo?!  Monkfish liver that melts in your mouth...ahhhh...I love ankimo!  I've tried a bunch of other things there like the red snapper carpaccio with ikura, ramen noodles, the beef tataki w/ lemon juice, fresh oysters on the half shell w/ ponzu sauce (2 for $4.25), seaweed salad, and the beef cubes.  I don't remember anything bad about the place, but just good food with good company.The first time I went, they had those fancy Japanese toilets with all those buttons to try out.  I attempted to use it but had no luck.  On my last visit, their special toilet was no longer there!  =(  I guess too many people were having way too much fun with it and it went into retirement.  If possible, go with a large group and sit in the back where you have to take your shoes off to swing your feet under the table.  And this way, you can also order a lot more random things and share them with everyone.  It makes it all that much merrier.  Overall, pretty extensive menu...I think I want some of that fried smelt roe just about now!  Bring it!Updated: 10/10/06 - They also offer a FREE membership card.  You get 5% off whenever you dine there when you bring this card and it eventually adds up to 10-15% off your bill for next time.I also like getting the Agedashi Tofu soup.  It's light and delicate without being overly infused with the bonito flakes.  Yum yum!The salmon skin salad was okay.  The dressing overpowers the salmon skin, so you can't taste a whole lot.  I wouldn't bother getting it again.  The deep fried crabs are a plate of baby crabs with an aioli type dipping sauce.  An interesting taste and a nice crunch! Side note: They give you a wet towelette thing and that will be your napkin for the entire meal.  Don't bother looking around for regular paper napkins here!Updated: 11/27/06 - I recently tried the okra with natto (less than $3).  First off, the idea of natto grosses me out.  The texture alone is nasty, and the smell...geez, that's a whole other subject.  Since it was my dining partner's first time w/ the stuff, I suggested he give it a go at some a cheap price.  It comes with thin slices of fresh okra, seaweed slivers, and hot mustard on the side.  Overall, I would not recommend it unless you're a fan of this stuff.  I definitely am not one. Blah.  Also, the last two times I went, they were out of the lovely ankimo!  Argh!Updated: 01/24/07 - I changed my ratings from four stars to five because I find myself craving the fried smelt roe more often than not.  And Ichiza has apparently become my comfort restaurant to turn to when I can't decide where else to go.  I have only been to one other izakaya, and that was Musha in Torrance, CA.  How can this place not be special?Updated: 06/12/07 - Went back the past weekend after a few month hiatus.  They were out of uni and ankimo!  Argh!  But we had the beef tongue - tasty, and gotta eat it when it's hot; minced spanish mackerel on cucumber - fresh, lots of flavors on your palatte, fried garlic - put salt on it instead of the miso, and oh-so good!, tartar yellowtail - with avocado, crisp things, and salsa - refreshing flavors and light, and honey toast - they need more bread chunks, but yummy!  (They had a few new dishes that were listed in Japanese.  If you ask the waitresses or owner to translate, they'll try their best!  Be daring and give it a go!)Update! 08/06/07 - Out of ankimo again!  Argh!  But they do have a soft shell crab appetizer that comes with a ponzu dipping sauce and Japanese mayonnaise.  It's a fatty crab with lots of meat!  Yum!  Their red snapper carpaccio is a bit different, it comes with olive oil, tomatoes, and mozzarella!  Update! 10/09/07 - Where the heck is all the ankimo?!  Argh!  Brought some out-of-town guests to Ichiza to experience where the locals eat.  Ate all the standard stuff, of course.  New thing tried here - live scallop.  I warn you now, don't sniff the squiggly things...it may turn you off!  But the scallop slices dipped in ponzu sauce is oh so tasty.  Also shared a ramen bowl.  I'm personally not a big fan of ramen (it's a filler), so I'll pass on it.  Everyone else seemed to swallow it down without any problems! =)(I added some photos of my eats above!)OK guys! This is a solid Yelp-recommended kappo place. I really loved the overall experience, up until the very end, when suddenly I got one unexpected & unfortunate issue with it. When we finished dinner (we had ordered a huge load of food and paid about $57 per person, for 2 people, incl. a good 18% tip) we exited the restaurant and the predominantly Japanese staff didn't say a simple thank you. The Japanese host (manager?) saw us leaving, turned a blind eye and continued chatting with the waitress as if we didn't exist.I regret giving you a lower rating (I initially intended a 5) but I am an emotional and spoiled client- I got upset... I'm half Japanese... I know it is not written on my (Caucasian) face, but I am. My appearance is not an excuse for anyone to forget to say a simple "thank you" especially when it's part of the Japanese cultural code. As we all know. Even a Korean-owned Japanese restaurant in LA area is trying to always say "Arigato Gozaimasu" (with a heavy accent, but still, polite and respectful). I never had an experience where Japanese nationals operating a restaurant- in the US or in Japan- disregarded this centuries-old cultural rule.OK... the tantrum is over now, guys- sorry. Yelp is all about being subjective and emotional about our experiences- and it is exactly what I am doing. I wish that I had the desire to write more about the food rather than freaking out regarding a cultural issue...In spite of the "shitsurei"- hopefully an isolated incident without any mean attitude or intentions behind it- I DO RECOMMEND this restaurant as one of the good Nihon-ryori restaurants in Las Vegas. Also, conveniently, it is open quite late. Maybe other Yelpers who are less spoiled or less familiar with Japanese customs (not expecting as much from their experience) will really have a blast.UPDATED 12-27-07: Came here again and this time it wasn't as good as before. I don't know what it is. This time, even though it was good, it just didn't blow me away like last time. So one star off.---------------------------------THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU to all the yelpers who rated this place highly. That was the main reason why we bookmarked it and decided to check it out. I wasn't sure how late they were open but we arrived pretty late, around 10pm and crossed our fingers as we entered. Man, it was bustling! Turns out they were open until 3am Mon-Sat, until 2.30am on Sundays. However, last call is 45 mins before closing so make sure you arrive on time.So there were 2 guys waiting for a table and the hostess asked if we wanted to sit at the counter. Lil guy was all for it. So, counter it was. I was just fascinated by the atmosphere in here. There were 2 tatami tables with very drunk people singing and carrying on. They were obviously having a good time.We were given menus but it was the posted items above our heads which interested me. Hubby left the ordering to me. I ordered an udon ($6.35) for little guy with his usual edamame ($3) and agedashi tofu ($4.35). Then, I proceeded to order a bunch of items for us adults.Uni pon ($5.50) arrived first. It was 4 plump pieces of uni sitting on thinly sliced cucumbers nestled on daikon spaghetti wading in a pool of ponzu sauce. OMG it was fantastic. The uni was soooooo fresh and flavorful. I could've eaten 3 of these.Then came the salmon skin salad ($5). This was no ordinary salmon skin salad. This was the emperor of all salmon skin salads I've ever had. Crunchy slivers of carrot, shreds of lettuce, grape tomatoes, daikon sprouts, perfectly cooked salmon skin, grated daikon, topped with a dollop of roe. Hubby and I shared this but were fighting over who got the last morsel. Taramiso, otherwise known as miso butterfish ($5.50) is something I've been craving since leaving Hawaii. I used to eat it at least once a week. After a year of missing it and seeing it on the menu here was enough for me to kiss the ground of this izakaya. The taramiso did not disappoint. In fact, it was so perfect hubby and I again commented on how much we've missed this dish.All the while, lil guy was enjoying his udon, edamame and agedashi tofu while watching his portable DVD player oblivious of all the ongoings around him. Tofu salad with tuna sashimi ($7.50) was interesting yet refreshingly delicious. Romaine lettuce, followed by mashed tofu, topped with diced avocado and cubed tuna sashimi, toss in a few daikon sprouts and a pinch of bonito flakes and voila, a masterpiece. The grape tomatoes complete this both in color and texture.Of course an izakaya meal isn't complete without some sort of alcohol. We had 2 large bottles of Asahi draft ($5.50/bottle) and then we finished by sharing a bowl of miso chasu ramen with extra chasu ($10). I'm sorry, but Santouka Ramen does not measure up to the ramen here and it was the last item we ate. The broth was perfect, not too salty and not under flavored. The chasu had just the right amount of fat interspersed with the lean bits. It looked like pancetta. Hubby was a bit skeptical but I assured him he would like it, and guess what? He did.This is definitely bookmarked for our next visit to Vegas, and let me tell you this, I'm reliving my meal right now just by writing this review and the bad part is, I'm not eating the food as I'm writing this. BUMMER!400th review... I think we'll turn the corner with Ichiza.  After reading the reviews for this place, I bookmarked it for a must stop.  After the first time, I had to go again on the weekend as well.  Killer eats to be had here.First time in, it was Halloween Eve so everyone was decked out in funky costumes.  Oddly, even if it wasn't Halloween, it wouldn't have seemed out of place.  There were only two of us so we sat at the counter and ordered up a pitcher of Kirin, Beef Tongue, Buta Kim (stirfried pork with kimchee), Chicken Gizzard, Shishamo (smelt fish), fried chicken, spicy tuna roll, ramen, bacon wrapped mochi, ume chazuke (green tea over rice with pickled plum), and probably a few other things that aren't coming to mind.  Everything was excellent, and it was fun tricking my cousin into eating some "weird" stuff.  =)Second time in was saturday night, this time with Emily and my mom-in-law joining us as well.  Pretty much ordered all the above plus shishito (twist pepper), sushi chazuke (it was basically a shishamo roll with a dip sauce), the chicken wings, chawanmushi, gyudon (beef bowl), oyakodonburi (chicken omelet rice bowl), natto okra (delicious!), kushi katsu (bite sized pork cutlet on a skewer with onion), and I'm sure I'm missing a few again.  Had a great time both times, and I'm sure to be back again next time I'm in town.  Pics are posted.  =)I enjoyed my meal here. The atmosphere was fun and everyone seemed to be genuinely having a good time. The service was decent considering how late and busy it was. Salmon Skin Salad- tangy, crunchy, and tasty. I'd order this again.Buta Kimchi- The kimchi wasn't fermented at all and the pork was sweet. I think I was expecting something more along the lines of the Korean version of this dish so I was disappointed. But even if I hadn't had some sort of idea of what I thought the dish was supposed to taste like, I don't think I would've liked it because it was too sweet for me.Udon- They were out of Ramen and it being a cold night, I wanted something soupy and hot. I opted for the Udon and was pleased that the noodles were soft without being too soggy and the broth was hot and soothing. Yum.I rarely get off the strip to eat when I go to Vegas so this was a nice change. Definitely good eats.Heard about Ichiza from my roommate on her last trip to Vegas, and decided to check it out with the family on our annual Vegas trip. I have to give this place extra props because my parents actually liked it. What was I doing bringing my totally unhip Vietnamese parents to a pretty hipster izakaya in Vegas? Well, they don't like sushi, and wanted to taste other Japanese food. And because I'm such an accomodating daughter, I figured this would be a good opportunity. But it didn't occur to me that the place had pretty much all bar food and young patrons. So when we stepped in, I felt so uncool at first, but with my mom being so cute and my dad being so genteel to the waitresses, I was reminded that they have been in this country long enough to know how to deal with non-viet-traditional people. My mom ordered a TOFU STEAK (I guess that sounded appetizing to her), and out came a huge square of lightly marinated tofu on a bed of boiled bean sprouts. My parents pretty much devoured that whole dish, bean sprouts and all. Dad ordered the ika-yaki (grilled squid) and loved how it was seasoned. I was happy he ordered it because I got to eat it, too. I got the soft shell crab and sis got the soba noodles. We had a few more dishes (chicken gizzard, more tofu, etc.) and all them were pretty tasty. All the food came out fresh and light. We all felt full enough with our 10 or so dishes and no one had indigestion or that gross feeling of super grease afterward. My parents, being so polite, thanked the manager and the waitresses in their accented English and said that they hope to see them again. And for a moment I felt that my parents were pretty hip...Way to live up to the hype.  After reading all the Yelp reviews and remembering my last attempt to try great ethnic cuisine in Vegas (see Lotus of Siam review), I was a bit apprehensive about hailing a taxi to Ichiza.  But after a 1 hour wait, I left, both very full and very satisfied.1) Location - Ichiza is located on the second floor of a strip mall in the area of Las Vegas that most call "Chinatown."  For those familiar with the area, it's the next strip mall adjacent to the large Sam Woo/Ranch 99 mall.2) Decor - typical of izakaya, the place is tiny and crowded.  Signs are everywhere about all the available dishes and alcohol is plentiful.  The one thing I did notice, amazingly given it's Vegas, is that this place is smoke-free.  All patrons go outside to smoke.  Good riddance.3) Food - the food is greasy, delicious, and prepared fast.  Whether you choose skewered chicken wings and gizzards or bonito sashimi with ponzu sauce, the key is to order a lot of items to go with your sake.  I'm sad I didn't feel well enough to eat the mochi bacon skewer, but I did partake in the Honey Toast.  4) Service - for a crowded and small place, service is amazingly good.  The patrons tend to stay forever, but the staff does it's best to keep you up to date on how long you have to wait.  Beyond that, they did a great job in calling a cab and even going downstairs and waiting with the cab so that someone wouldn't take it.  Thumbs up.I'm starting to hate yelp.70ish reviews on how awesome this place is.There was a cockroach on my table.  We hung out.  It crept onto my plate for a ponzu sauce nightcap.  I honestly was grossed out but not completely.  I know good places are often dirty places.  I understand.  But when I pointed it out to the waitress, she just made a feeble attempt to kill my new little friend, after some manic missed squashings all over my table.Shortly after Mr. Roach was laid to rest, we were offered free mochi ice cream.  Wow.  A fricking roach just joined me for dinner and you're offering me a 20 cent consolation dessert?  Fuck you.To be fair, the food was mediocre.  2 stars for that and minus 5 stars for the roach and minus 1000 stars for their generous compensation and apology for the mackerel that worked its way back into my mouth as vomit.Are... you.... kidding?   Folks, this is why I started Yelping.  To bring truth to the masses - to expose restaurants for what they really are.  I'm in Las Vegas for Halloween and I wanted some good sushi.  So I searched on Yelp.com for "sushi" in Las Vegas.  I filtered the results by "Highest Rated" and guess what showed up?   Ichiza.   Sighhhhhhh  This is proof that you can't always trust what 123 reviewers think about a place.  For those of you familiar with my reviews, you should know how big of a sushi snob I am.  You should also know how much I appreciate stumbling across "hole in the wall" sushi joints.  I love finding a diamond in the rough.  Ichiza, however, is not one.   Not even close.  For starters, let's talk about the menu.  Why do they have a menu?  I looked over this menu and there were THREE sushi rolls.  ONLY THREE?  How can you only have three sushi rolls???  One of them was a California Roll, which doesn't count.  The other was a tempura roll, which also is not real sushi.   The third was the Spider Roll, fried soft shell crab in a roll.   I asked the waitress if they had another menu for sushi - surely, this can't be it.  She explained, the rest of the menu is on the walls.  What?  You mean all those random pieces of paper taped to the walls of the restaurant?  That's the full menu?  So... do you want me to get up and walk around the entire restaurant and try to find and memorize what i want to eat?  This is EFFING RIDICULOUS!  So after I browsed the "menu wall", I found two other rolls.  One was called the Natto Roll, which was soybean and okra in a roll that's deep fried and topped with tuna.   The other was called the Eel-Kara-age Roll, which has baked eel and fried chicken in a roll.   God help me, this was the worst crap I've eaten in so long.  The Natto Roll was FUNKY.  I love okra and I love soybeans, but mix the two together and add spongy rice and deep-fry it and suddenly it's disgusting.   The Eel-Kara-age didn't taste as bad, but was poorly created.  It's just rice stacked with a piece of fried chicken and a piece of eel on top.  That's it.  Sigh.   The Spider Roll, the only roll that I recognized from other sushi places, was not made like any Spider Roll I've ever had.  Yeah, they deep-fried the soft shell crab, but what's up with rolling it up with lettuce, carrots and cucumber?  LETTUCE, CARROTS and CUCUMBER???  In a sushi roll???? WHAT THE HELL IS HAPPENING?  IS THIS A SICK AND TWISTED HALLOWEEN PRANK??  My friends were wiser than I was and decided to order the ramen instead.  They thought it was awful.  Noodles were not cooked enough and were hard. The broth was not good, either.  I've posted a picture of them - check it out.Ok, enough about the baffling menu and utterly worthless food.  Lets talk service.  The waitress was quick enough coming over to take our order, but it took awhile because I had to run around the restaurant and tell her what I wanted.  Once she gave me my food though, she was hard to find.  I had to track another waitress down twice to get refills on my Diet Coke.  Btw, they don't have soft drinks on tap - only by the can and they charge you $5 per can.  Be warned.  If you're staying on the Strip, like most people are, then this place is a little hard to get to unless you take a cab.  I would definitely not recommend walking to it.  It's also in a pretty ghetto part of town - be careful walking back at night.  Just take a cab both ways.   The only REAL positive about this place?  I'm not sure how the waitresses dress during every other day of the year, but on Halloween they went all out.   There was a slutty bee, a slutty nurse, a slutty angel, and a slutty cabaret girl.  They were HOT.  If you're into hot asian chicks (I married one. Hot asian chicks ftw), then you'll find them working here.  Is it worth eating here though?  Sadly...... no.  Maybe you can come in right before closing and ask them if they wanna have a drink somewhere else.. far away.Our table for 8 quickly morphed to 9 on a Saturday night but the good folks at Ichiza didn't bat an eye. Our party (read: my family) included multiple picky eaters including a person who doesn't eat seafood and two people who have never eaten Japanese food. Unfathomable, I know. . .Still, with Ichiza's extensive menu I managed to get an array of plates to please every palette. Even the seafood hater seemed genuinely pleased with his sizzling steak while the rest of us sampled the sushi. This visit to Ichiza was much like a reunion, where the food took a bit of a backseat to catching up with everyone. But one thing I'll never forget about the meal was the honey toast: a half loaf of bread toasted and hollowed out to accommodate vanilla ice cream with honey on the bottom. Do not leave Ichiza without ordering it!I was thinking about how much I've missed real Izakaya food. And then i realized I haven't reviewed Ichiza. Let me tell you how much we loved this place when we live in Sin City...we'd come here at least once a week...sometimes two for a few months straight. We'd filled up the frequent diner card so quickly that we were getting the max. discount within 2 months. Since we've moved back to So Cal, I have yet to find another Izakaya that is as good and inexpensive as Ichiza. Yes...inexpensive is the keyword in this economy!! So...in a nutshell this is the main reason I miss Vegas...sad huh?What a hidden gem off the strip :) Great authentic Japanese tapas restaurant offering all sorts of Japanese dishes you wouldn't be able to find ANYWHERE else.Off thier regular menu, we ordered the spicy tuna roll ($5.75). You get 8 solid pieces of spicy tuna! What a freaking deal!!! Fish was really fresh too!After seeing so many pictures of the "Tar Tar Yellow Tail" ($6.95) we had to get this. And this was definitely one of our favorite dishes. Rice, avocado, tomato, lettuce, and chopped yellow tail layered between fried  biscuits. SO unique!!! Nice summer dish!Another item off thier special menu, we got the "Eel, Kakiage, Tempura Roll" ($6.95). This was a california roll (avocado, crab, cucumber) topped with tempura, sashimi, and eel. There was NO way you can get this all in one bite so we ended up taking it apart to eat. Very good! The sweet sauce on the eel went nicely with the creamy avocado of the california roll.Next we 1/2 an order of the "Tom Yum Roll" ($6.95). This had tempura shrimp, avocado inside and another piece of cooked shrimp and cilantro was placed on top of the roll. Then this combination was wrapped in a spring roll wrap. Honestly? Nothing special. and not really worth $7 for 4 pieces. But a nice light taste especially after squeezing the lime juice on top.Again, after seeing so many yelpers post a picture of this Honey Toast ($7.95) dessert, I had to have it! The thing is HUGE. It is literally half a loaf of bread. NO JOKE. Topped with a scoop and vanilla ice cream and drizzled with honey. I would say 80% of the people here got the dessert. And to my surprise the bread is so light and fluffy that we almost killed this thing between the2 of us! crazy!!! The toast is REALLY soft in the inside and toasted on the outside. A simple and light dessert! A must try here!Warning - food comes out really slow and it would be wise to make a reservation. There were tons of people waiting outside even when we left at 8pm. They did take reservations for us on a Sunday night and we were seated right away :)What a unique experience and truly a hidden gem away from the strip!Las Vegas is a city filled to the brim with addictions of every kind, so why not an addiction to one of the very best places you can find in Vegas? Ichiza would gladly satiate my thirst for off-the-strip, reasonably priced dining. It is located on the second floor of a strip mall in Chinatown, which is a small drive from the strip. Completely unassuming and unpretentious, Ichiza is an izakaya - complete with different types of seating - at the Japanese bar/counter, normal tables, and on tatami mats on raised ground.I'm not going to name the 12+ dishes that my fellow diners and I ordered. That would be a little ridiculous. I will leave you with this piece of advice: order off the walls and off the menu. Get the waitress' or hostess' suggestions and go with them (unless you're a rather unadventurous eater). They have all the standard izakaya-type food here including one of my favorites - octopus balls.And most importantly: order the Honey Toast for dessert. Do not forgo this step! This honey toast had all of my dining group a-flutter, and you can guarantee that it is one of their most popular dishes. A block of bread is hollowed out, toasted, slathered in honey (but not too much honey), and placed on a plate. Then a huge scoop of ice cream nestles itself inside of that sweet piece of toast. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/j5nPiTwWEFr-VsePew7Sjg?select=5MBjtf85537l3Q44V97BYA) It tasted like pure heaven. If you do everything else wrong - order from the menu, actually order soda, etc. - at least do this one thing correctly. Order the honey toast. You'll thank me later.remember Angelina Jolie when she was married to Billy Bob?  It's been a long time because the now refined philanthropist/mother-of-Jolie Pitt-clan/paparazzi-shy-actress does not at all resemble the Angelina of those times: controversial, grungy, and FUN.  Ichiza is like that old Angelina, plus delicious!Atmosphere is not for the timid eater, you are likely to share tables with strangers, you may even have to share tables with strangers as well as be shoes-less with them.  But if you like making friends over sake and exotic meats & fish, then come on in, order a drink and start staring... not at other people - at the strips of paper glued to the walls on which much of the menu is written (most of them are far away, so you will end up seeming like you're staring at other patrons anyways)!  Did I mention this restaurant was not for the shy?  The current Angelina does not seem to eat, but the old one did, and she probably devoured things like chicken gizzards (skewered and stir-fried), beef liver, & beef tongue, all of which are tasty at Ichiza.  My personal favorites are the buttery beef tongue and the chewy skewered gizzards.  If the present Ms. Jolie did eat, she'd probably enjoy the tofu and sashimi salad: refreshing cold tofu and top quality fish over fresh romaine and avocado, with zesty sesame vinagrette, it's approved for anorexic starlets.Okay, all Angelina talk aside, I love Ichiza the most because of the grain epiphany that happened to me at this hole-in-the-wall Japanese treasure: the broiled rice balls - the best thing to have happened to anyone that's a fan of slightly-burned crispy rice.  It was these balls (not the Angelina fantasy - sorry to disappoint some of you) that made me an Ichiza convert.I love this place! It is so great to find a true Japanese Izakaya anywhere outside Japan, and to find it in the "Chinatown" (really, Asiantown) part of Las Vegas was a real treat! I was smiling the whole time eating here! Izakayas serve a lot of little dishes and comfort foods like in a Japanese home. They are not Sushiyas, so don't expect that, although they may serve some sushi items. Originally, they were drinking places, where salarymen in Japan would go and unwind, drinking a lot of booze, bond with co-workers, and even complain about or insult their bosses to their faces (to let off steam; and then they could always blame it on being drunk, because if they talked-back or disrespected at work, they would be fired or severely reprimanded). So it was sort of a social safety valve place to relax in a strict culture of respect, protocol and obligation to the group and superiors. The little food items were snacks to help the drinking.But then, many places became very popular for their tasty snacks. And now, it is a whole category of dining. It is starting to become more popular in major cities in the US. Los Angeles has some good ones, like Musha in Santa Monica and Torrance, or Raku in LA. An Izakaya is different than a "Snack" or "Hostess" bar, which in many Asian countries, involves little in the way of food, but a lot in booze and pretty girls to make you feel like a big shot. Izakaya in the US are usually family run, and down home, good for families and even kids.(Pronunciation tip: do not accent any syllable, they are all even in intonation and emphasis: I-Za-Ka-Ya! NOT iza KAYa!) This one has a million little dishes to choose from, listed on the menu, and many of the same selections taped all along the walls, mostly in Japanese! The youthful waitresses and hostess here are all Japanese, so it is a delight, especially if you know a little of the language, because they will scurry around and respond promptly to your requests, as in Japan, with enthusiasm and energy. If they were lazy or lackadaisical in their service in Japan, they would be severely reprimanded or fired. Too bad that doesn't translate to Denny's here! So this place serves what I like to call, Japa Tapas. The two of us had Agedashi Tofu, Ikkayaki (whole broiled squid, chopped up), grilled Black Cod (like butter!) , Sake Ochazuke (Salmon over rice mixed with green tea and flavorings) and for dessert, green tea ice cream and 2 flavors of Mochi ice cream, and finally their signature dessert, which is 1/3 a loaf of bread crust filled with honey and vanilla ice cream that we shared with our tablemates. We also had a small cold Kurosawa Junmai Sake.  All delish! We sat at a community table and met another nice young Filipino couple enjoying their Izakaya experience, and shared stories and dessert with them.  I am coming back here every time I go to Las Vegas! You should, too!Forget those fancy faux Asian places on the strip! OIshikatta! Tanoshikatta!DON'T BE SCURRED TO WALK AROUND TO LOOK AT THE SPECIALS POSTED ON THE WALLSMy sister brought me here a few years ago and I've been a fan ever since. She was in town this week and we stopped by here after I picked her up from the airport. She was already tipsy from drinks at SFO cause her flight was delayed so we didn't order bottles of Nigori like usual. This is what we ordered: Asahi - large bottleMackerel w/miso sauceIka-yaki Stir fried garlic chicken gizzardsWagyu beef carpaccioTako wasabi - they forgot to give this to usKimchi fried riceSalmon w/mozzarella tempuraThey were out Black Cod w/miso sause so we tried the Mackerel. The Markerel is a little salty. The Ika-yaki is another dish that we always get. Tako wasabi is also another dish we always order, but they forgot to give it to us this time. Stir fried garlic chicken gizzards are a must. We tried to order the Butter Clams, but they ran out.OPEN LATE AND 10% DISCOUNT CARDHONEY TOAST!!!  Its plain and delish!  It had been 3 yrs since I last had one here and was eager to stuff my face with some yummy goodness.But first we decided to get a little bit of good in the tummy.  It was 11pm when we got here so we tried to keep it light.Wasabi Ika (squid) ~ it was fresh squid in a wasabi sauce garnished with pickled daikon.  It was very refreshing!Agedashi tofu ~ I luv this dish and luv making it at home!Ika butter ~ Sauteed squid in butter and onions.Asparagus bacon and Gizzards (sunagimo) ~ Two yakitori that I often get when its available.Okra Natto ~ 2 of my fave slimy food hell yeah!!!Sake flight ~ From Ginjo, Junmai, Daiginjo all were pretty good tasting. Honey Toast ~ Hmm what can I say...... Its damn good so you have to try it.  Toast, Honey and Ice Cream!  Yum Yum!This place is way off the strip but worth going to to.  Its open late so you can get some good grub here!  I still like the izakaya in my hood but this place is a good spot in sin city!Eyes ~ My eyes are on the Honey toast!Nose ~ I smell yummyness!Ear ~ Its a late night but still pretty busy and lively!Mouth ~ Everything is tasty but I want some honey!Tummy ~ Ahhh finally some honey toast!Late night is not my best time. I'm not sure how I wrangled myself a job that requires me to work until the wee hours of the morning (12:15 is wee hours for me--quit judging my Golden Girl sensibilities). But late night is okay when it means amazing ramen at Ichiza after work.They only had one ramen left, but luckily my friend and I wanted each a half order. Yummmmm. I'm not sure what they do to their pork belly, but it is full of deliciousness. I think fairies sprinkle it with happy dust before they plop it in your bowl. It melts in your mouth with fairy dust deliciousness.It's really tiny in here, only seating about 50-60 people, but it's well worth it...especially after you get done working and just want to unwind with a bowl of broth and noodles and bean sprouts. Late night happens for me so infrequently, but Ichiza makes staying up past 10 p.m. worth it.Went here for the first time tonight, and I love it!I actually hate fried rice, or thought I did, since the only kind I've ever had is the shitty Panda Express crap. I know, I'm a deprived child. Anyway, I figured out that it doesn't taste like that at all and now I am officially in love with this shinanigans!I forgot the name of the type I had, someone else ordered it for me, but I believe it was the seafood one. A little spice to it and was perfect in every way. Now if only I could figure out the use of chopsticks without looking like an idiot!Also had some tofu, which was super soft, so it was also a little hard for me to manage to eat, but I liked it all the same.The great grand finale, was the honey bread. OH MER GERD! It's not even like, a slice of bread, its this huge square loaf that is drizzled in honey and icecream, and was sooooo good. It hurt to eat cause I was so full but I couldn't stop. If you come here, get the honey bread, and your life will be complete and all voids in your soul will be filled. That is all.Honey toast the size of your head!! Need I say more? Oh and it tastes really good too :) This is a pretty darn good izakaya and one of my go-to places to eat when I'm in town. I wish that they could stay open later than 3, but I would totally ditch the club early to eat here.A couple of my favs include beef tataki (a must), beef bowl (when they don't run out for the day), karaage, spicy tuna rolls, and sometimes ramen. I'm even a sucker for that peach sparkling sake thing that I can't seem to find anywhere else! Service is always attentive even when we come during the busy times. Don't forget to end your meal with an order of the honey toast!!The clubs weren't that hot that night, and my friends and I were hungry for some grub.  "ICHIZA!" we proclaimed.  Of course, there could be no other choice.This place always ends up being one of our go-to spots in Vegas after the clubs.  They're not open 24 hours, but they're still open pretty late.  If we know we can make it in time, this is what we crave.There's really only one thing we want.  The hamburger steak.  It's not even on the menu, but it's so delicious.  The patty is moist and seasoned very well.  Then just a little bit of gravy to top it.  We can't resist.Add some fried rice to order to complete this meal, and at 2am in the morning, we are happy campers.ICHIZA!  My happy after clubbing place in Vegas.Ah, Ichiza. I gotta give it up, yo. It's most certainly always a good time when I roll through and I have no problem bringing friends to enjoy in your delectable delights. As some of my good friends know, I have this love-love relationship with  Japanese food and anytime the option presents itself to get my grub on, I am sure to follow through. Ichiza is one of those spots that I usually don't frequent too often like I do other Japanese establishments but if I have a pretty good sized group gathered willing to drink some beer or sake and have some small plates to accompany, this is usually my go to.  As far as food goes, I usually hit up the specials menu to start off the night.  Last time I stopped in, they had shigoku oysters, chu-toro, and kohada (as you can tell, I love me some SEAFOOD!.. or if you don't, google it heehee) on the special menu for the day and I delightfully ordered it up. The special menu rotates daily (?) so be sure to check it out whenever you stop in as it changes and presents some new stuff upon each visit.  From the regular menu, I am always happy to suggest the oyako don chicken bowl, ikayaki whole grilled squid, and the uni in ponzu sauce (if they still have any in stock).  I always round it out with some sunomono cucumber or wakame seaweed salad to make my meal somewhat complete and to my definite satisfaction.  Not a big dessert guy but gotta give a shoutout to the honey toast here; definitely a fan favorite.Tip: look at the menu posted on the wall as some of it is not mentioned in the menu; if you have a big group, go early to get a table in before your patrons fully arrive to grub; and be sure to check out some of the bottled stuff aside from the house sake and beer as they have some tasty items chillin' in the backEnjoy!!BEWARE!Ichiza was shut down by the South Nevada Health Department on June 30, 2014, for the fourth time in four years.  That is unacceptable.  They were tagged with 38 demerits from 10 different violations ranging from handwashing issues to proper temperature for stored foods.  Beware, especially since they are serving uncooked food.  As far as the food and service goes, the okra-natto was interesting, albeit slimy (but it's supposed to be), the sushi was good and the service was good.  But if I had read about their sanitary issues, I wouldn't have gone.  You can Google it, if you want to read for yourself.We resorted here 'cause Raku was way too packed and we didn't have reservations there. We only had a couple hours to eat before rushing off to EDC! It was super busy at night here, but luckily the wait wasn't too bad.The interior reminds me a lot of Kappo Honda back home in OC. We sat at a table and had to take our shoes off, which was nice in a way. My group ordered a bunch of food and all shared, but I can't remember each dish so I'll write about the most memorableKobe beef tataki - A MUST, good fresh meat flavorSashimi - I can't remember which fishes we got, but they were all pretty damn fresh for being in Vegas. It's also pretty damn cheap! I believe it was hamachi, yellowtail, and salmonI also got some grilled stuff, the tongue was pretty good as well as gizzard. The chicken meatballs weren't as good as Torihei in Torrance so you can skip on that.Service was fast and drinks were always refilled. Food came out fast as well so if you're on a time crunch, come here!
Red Robin=It's a Wednesday night and I didn't feel like cooking. What's a hungry guy suppose to do? You guessed it... Go out! I check around to see who's available for some good cheap  eats. A friend of mine gets back to me saying she received a free birthday burger email from Red Robin's. Why not I say. I don't mind being the buy one (thats me) get one free (thats her) person in this deal.We get there around 7:30. The place is huge. Busy? It was normal I guess for a Wednesday night. Workers? Tons. "Table for two please" I tell the young male host. "Just a moment" he replies. He then goes around the half empty restaurant talking to the different servers. He comes back and says "Please have a seat in the waiting area. I will seat you when the next table is available."I might of been a little tipsy from drinking before hand... But seriously... "When the next table is available?" I might not have the powers like Haley Joel Osment, from Sixth Sense, to see people in the empty tables, but what I can see is about 30 tables which I could be sitting at. So we do what we can do... Wait.About 5 minutes later, we ask the host if we can sit in that empty table next to the nice people who seem to be enjoying their meal. "I'll have to check with the server of that area" says the host.About 8 minutes later... The manager comes out and asks us if we have been helped... Since we're the only people waiting for a table, I assume he's talking to us. "Yes sir. We're waiting for a table. Apparently its standing room only in here tonight." I smirked. "Come with me", he says. We walk across the restaurant and he seats us in a booth. Sweet. We go to the only table in the restaurant where the lamp over the table is out. "I dont mind the mood lighting... But can we sit someplace where I can see my friends face?" I requested. I know... I know... I'm just asking for something to "happen" to my food but i'm pretty much past that point.The nice waitress moves us over a few tables and everything seems to be at peace in the universe now. We crack open the menu's and decided on two good looking burgers. Our order goes in... And we wait.... And wait... And wait...The family next to us, who appeared to be waiting for a long long time, finally tires of the wait and gets up to leave. The manager quickly catches them and asks if he could do anything for them. The father explains that they have been waiting for like 30 mins for their food and their kids are hungry and they are leaving to get food. The manager offers to pick up their tab if they agree to sit and eat. The family leaves. Great... I'm stoked.Eventually... Our food comes out. After a careful inspection, we eat. We pay. We leave. Oh and my burger was alright. I got the A1 Peppercorn burger. The description says "Sizzling, hickory-smoked bacon, melted Pepper-Jack cheese, A.1.® peppercorn spread, crispy onion straws, onions and tomatoes on an onion bun. It's a taste explosion!"I was upset that I couldnt give this place ZERO stars but I guess the burger was good enough for me to give them one star. I also thought it was cool that if you sign up on their website they send you a free burger coupon on your birthday. FYI, I read somewhere that the Peppercorn burger is one of the unhealthiest ones you can order there. Great. It just keeps getting better!To see the yummy burger, check out the pics!IF  you read my last review you know I love this place.I havent been to any of those high-end burger joints like Burger Bar,BLT Burger ,LBS or any of those, I am of meager means.So I remembered I get a FREE Burger from Red Robin just by signing up for the Bday Club online, they email me a coupon for a FREE burger. So I did it. And you can do it under different names & email addresses for more FREE burgers as well.http://apps.fishbowl.com/a/redrobin/eclub/agegate.aspxI decided to order takeout since I also Had 2 coupons my son received from school for FREE shakes-we decided on Raspberry & Strawberry.Then I ordered the NEW Blackened Bayou Burger.Blackened burger topped with roasted red peppers, Angry Onions,® Pepper-Jack cheese, Creole mustard sauce and cabbage-carrot mix on a jalapeño-cornmeal Kaiser roll. Add a splash of Tabasco® for even more spice. $9.59-Not today-FREEAs always the burger was delicious great burger,very spicy and left me wanting another.The  steak fries were crispy and hot with just a tad too much salt just the way I like em.The shakes were fantastic as well with fresh fruit used and super cold ice cream. Raspberry was better than Strawberry.I will eventually try the "other" burger places trying to imitate but as far as I am concerned the bar has been set pretty high here at Red Robin
Applebee's=blah... it was just blaah... ugh - our server was tired and wasn't that attentative... she tried to apologize but she kinda just trailed off... lol. But I guess its okay, but THEN... there came in a white couple and all of a sudden our waitress sprang to life!!Uhhh... okaaaay??At first I thought, great now she'll be attentative... ummmm... no. no she wasn't. I know that the East side of town is racist... ugh, I don't wanna talk about the ASU Bookstore Incident... Good grief!! This chick, I WISH I caught her name... was all smiles and giggles and then came to our table (which was only about 6 feet away) and was all frowns and excuses. It was sickening.She failed to bring us our drinks, she only refiled them once and ignored us twice when we tried to ask for more water... okay the Iced Tea was too much for you... how impossible is water?? We had enough and were ready to walk out on the check when; I guessed she sensed our frustration and brought it to the table early! *harsh sigh* We paid in cash and got about $8 in change... which she brought to us in all ones!! omg, is she for real?? lol, I just laughed when I saw it... and I chose to leave a yelp card instead of any cash!
Osaka Japanese Bistro=Looking for a late night sushi place that offers happy hour specials, we were referred to Osaka's in Henderson.Walking into this pretty big and established restaurant, we're given three menus to peruse!  There's seating available at the sushi bar, the tables, and even tatami rooms!  The menus are quite extensive and you have to spend a great deal of time doing the matching game.  One menu offers the happy hour specials, but in order to find out what's in each roll, you have to read through their regular menu.  It takes a good while!  A large selection of rolls and thank goodness for pictures.  They all start to sound the same though and many of them overlap.  They also offer this Buy 10 Get One Free from their special roll menu.    You can also do Shabu Shabu, Sukiyaki, or Yosenabe here if you'd like!  We finally decided on a few things from their happy hour menu, and surprisingly, we didn't end up with much sushi!  777 Roll ($9.95 HH price, $12.95 reg.) - "Shrimp, scallop, miki, tobiko, cream cheese; topped with avocado, albacore and served with garlic and yumyum sauce."  It's a pretty good roll, but fatty as hell because that yumyum sauce is a mayonnaise-based sauce.  You can tell how bad it is for you once you take the first bite!  Deep Fried Tofu ($3.50 HH price, $4.95 reg.) - Also known as Agedashi tofu.  It was a bit tough, not easy to break apart.  I prefer my agedashi a little softer so my spoon can gently cut into it.Tonkatsu ($3.50 HH price) - I'm not a particular big fan of the pork cutlet, but the BF is.  He thought it was pretty good and such a great value that he ordered another!Shishamo ($2.80 HH price, $3.80 reg.) - Grilled smelt fish with smelt eggs - it was okay here.  I've had better.  A bit tough and on the smaller end.Osaka Rice ($4.95 HH price, $6.95 reg.) - "Mixture of sushi rice, crab, masago, yum yum sauce, sesame oil and siracha sauce."  My friend was eating this as she's ordered it before.  It was okay, there wasn't enough taste going on for my preference.  Seafood Salad ($6.95 HH price, $14.95 reg.) - Lots more sunomono in it than I would have preferred.  I usually like my seafood salad to have a more seafood than anything else.If you sit facing the sushi bar, they have a slide show on the computer screens with their different rolls and dishes presented.    Overall, the food here is a bit more expensive than other Japanese restaurants. They are obviously doing okay since this is their second location Late night happy hour is good until 1:45 am!  You can find a 10% coupon on their website too!(Food pics can be found in the business profile!)
Napoli Pizza=I am a fan of pizza. However, I am a bigger fan of eggplant parmesan. When I visit a pizzeria, and an eggplant parmesan hero or eggplant parmesan special is on the menu, forget about the pizza. This has always been the case with Metro Pizza.   A few Sundays ago, after living in Henderson for like ten years, I finally caught Napoli's act. It just so happened that I was up to something different for lunch when quite a few restaurants were closed on Sunday. I thought this is Las Vegas, a City that never sleeps. Anyways, recently I wanted to try Napoli's despite some negative reviews by reputable Yelper's. I was in an adventurous mood. What's the worst that could of happened?    The negative reviews wouldn't pertain to my experience. The majority of those reviews pertain to the pizza and wait time. As soon as I looked at the menu and read eggplant parmesan hero, I was ecstatic. I have been looking for restaurants nearby that make the eggplant parmesan hero, a sandwich that I have fond memories of in New York. I had my choice of over 100 Coke beverages to compliment the eggplant parmesan. Napoli's has the Coke Freestyle machine. I love these machines because they feature my favorite soft drink in the World: strawberry soda. How can I not appreciate a marriage of my favorite soft drink and one of my dearest foods? I paid at the counter, consequently the woman I paid the money to would serve the food and drink on the red and white patterned tablecloth. The eggplant parmesan on toasted bread was out of this World delicious. The French fries weren't bad either. The wait between order and the food was around 15 minutes. I'd wait a far longer amount of time for this.   What is better than an eggplant parmesan hero is eggplant parmesan with spaghetti and garlic bread. What is best is when it only costs $8.99 with a Coke beverage in a large glass. Napoli's is far more than pizza. Up til 3 p.m., on weekdays the lunch specials menu are fantastic. There are so many choices. I have been decided on the eggplant parmesan with spaghetti. The three times that I have delighted in this dish, I have left satisfied and wanting to return. The eggplant parmesan with the mouth watering mozzarella cheese is hot. It's served with the eggplant parmesan on the top of spaghetti. The portion is generous. The wait times ranged between 20 to 25 minutes on the last three visits. While I waited, I enjoyed the uptempo music and Fanta strawberry soda. Most of all I really enjoyed eating the eggplant parmesan with spaghetti and drinking the Strawberry Fanta.   Owing to the fact that I am a lover of eggplant parmesan and can never ever get enough of it, I am a fan of Napoli's. The fact that right now I'm getting hungry thinking about their eggplant parmesan means I  will be returning.If I could give 0 stars I would. Me and coworkers split the same meal today around 3. By 8 we have all been sick. Throwing up, stomachs pains and sweating profusely. I called and spoke with the not so polite manager "Harry" whom stated that there is no way we are sick from his food. Harry said "I know the food I put out, getting sick from food takes at least 24 hours to happen." We did not argue at first just asked for a refund as we obviously did not enjoy our food and felt ill. He said he would not refund us as he knows his food is good and then disconnected the call.Worst food and service I have had at a family owned business. I work in an office near this location and we order food often I will be sure to send a company email advising the over 100 on staff to not eat here, that the food was less than satisfactory and the customer service is horrendous.
RA Sushi Bar Restaurant=Ra. Is BlahAnd the peeps. Give me the creeps. Service? Makes me nervous. The vibe. Just don't jibe. Just not my scene. I'm a picky queen. Don't like the snotties. Acting all haughty.Sake bombers cheap and good. Only reason I would.Go to Ra.Blah Blah Blah.So, after the assplosion, I think I'd better write my review!Sucked as soon as we walked in.  Party of 5.  Approximately 1pm.  Not busy.  2 four-top and one 2-top tables empty, plus the sushi bar.  They said it would be a 20-minute wait for us to get a bigger table.  We suggested just taking a 4-top.  Ended up that the co-owner of my company pushed two tables together and Voila!  We were seated.  Drink order got taken quickly.  Our waitress, Sarah, hated us from moment one.  Got our drinks, placed our orders.  I've never waited so long for sushi!I had the tempura box lunch special, and everyone got a bunch of sushi dishes to taste.  One girl is allergic to gluten, so ordered hers wrapped in soy paper.  It came wrapped in rice.  The waitress also claimed that they don't wrap their sushi in cucumber.  Huh?  I've never been anywhere that DOESN'T wrap in cucumber instead of rice.  Luckily, we took the plate to the sushi chef and he re-did it with the soy paper.  It was a WAY smaller serving than the original.She was great about refilling our drinks, but just wasn't as friendly (meaning not at ALL) as any other server I've ever had.This place sucks ball and I won't be back.Now, Back to the assplosion...Their Viva Las Vegas Roll is always good, but the service always leaves you with a bittersweet taste. We don't plan on going back!!
The Good Egg - Carefree=Good eggs.Good french toast.Good chorizo n' egg scramble.Good cinnamon roll.Good service.Good patio shade.Good price.Good choice.
Port of Subs=I called in a phone order for the 2 foot ($11.99 plus tax) cold sub special and was told it would be ready in 10 minutes or less. When I arrived there were no customers inside and no employees in sight. Finally a guy came from the back and said he'd be right with me. Inside was clean, but the veggies and other selections to choose from weren't looking so fresh. Had I walked in and placed the order in person instead of over the phone, I wouldn't have ordered honestly after seeing that. I let the guy know I placed a phone order and gave him my name. He rung me up and gave me the order. They don't have the stamp card here anymore and wouldn't accept the one I had, so keep that in mind of you have a one. The guy was though nice and friendly.Classic Sub #1 - I chose white bread and this sandwich comes with ham, salami, capicolla, pepperoni and provolone cheese. Sounds great right? Well my sandwich looked skimpy for the description of the sandwich. I remember POS tasting much better and getting a bigger portion back in the day. The bread seemed like it might have been from the day before and wasn't so fresh. The lettuce had a nasty "bag mix" taste and the meat and cheese tasted just so-so. I've definitely had better from other sandwich spots.What the hell happened to POS? Hmmm maybe those initials mean something other that Port of Subs these days or at least that's how I feel. I remember when I first moved to Vegas and the sandwich scene was really lacking. POS was a place where you could get a sandwich on bread that was freshly baked and held the sandwich together and the fillings inside the sandwich were plentiful . Subway was a joke compared to POS but for the last few years Subway has nothing to worry about. Very sad for a Nevada based sandwich shop that and such a following and lines out the door at one time. Not the case anymore this POS was dead inside and is hardly noticeable tucked away in the corner of a shopping center that used to thrive at one time and has since changed a lot. I had the 2 foot sub deal and the bread tasted like it was old and not fresh. The veggies looked sad. I had the number 1 sub and it has 4 types of meat and 1 type of cheese on it. This sandwich looked so skinny and where was the 4 types of meat? More like 4 paper thin slices of who knows what meat and stake bread. I'll stick with Jersey Mike's from now on.
Outback Steakhouse=This place has really gone down hill in the last year. I cannot say I know why either.They used to be very good.They are not open for lunch which is a bummer in my mind. We like to go out to a big meal at lunch at times reather than dinner. Because, then you have time to let it digest.Anyway, this place is very busy. But, it seems so corprate. The food is getting like Red Lobster where everything tastes the same.I think they really try, but it is just not there.They really want to push alcohol on you, and starters. I know they have to  but, it just seems that they are forced.Steaks were just OK not fantastic! The Potaoes were rock hard. I mean the baked potatoes so hard,even when we took them home and re cooked they were hard.Very strange. Bathrooms are clean, our server seemed very over whelmed as if she could not handle it all.It is not horrible, just not wonderful. They keep putting out coupns and they are good ones as well. I just do not want to go there when there are so many good other places. Sorry, it is off my list of good places to go now days.No shrimp on this Barbie. Strictly Soup & Salad Barbie at Outback in this house. The best part is I can order it online and then bump to Tupac, tweeze stray eyebrows and wait for them to bring it out to my car. Now that's VIP service playa!They have a soup and salad combo deal for $9.99. Plus tax and tip I'm back on the road for just under $15. It also comes with a loaf of that unhealthy, but super fucking good honey wheat bread. The portion of the soup has gotten smaller over the years, but still seems to be the perfect portion to satisfy me. My favorite is the Creamy Onion, but will settle for the Potato if I have to. The salad is my favorite simple dinner salad around. Cherry tomatoes, cucumbers, onions, cheddar cheese, olives and garlicky soft, buttery amazing croutons. Top it all off with their homemade Ranch dressing which I'm convinced drizzled on bubble wrap or a hairy elbow it would still rock my universe. This meal is by no means healthy, but it is my comfort meal that doesn't leave me bloated for days. Especially enjoy it during hoodie season. Beautiful salad porn take one:http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zEOfVGv6DeprEzmFYMFhXA?userid=Sv48jgljDP-CRfXmU8uSgA#yHDt1iDFgHvGdrfwhFYQ6QOnline Ordering.  Only problem is they don't always have the soup you want even though the online system lets you order it. I don't like this. They need to fix this shit. The guys and girls that bring it out to your car are always cool and make sure you have your full order. In return I am nice to them.Yes, 15 bucks is a little steep for a freakin' salad and cup of soup, but it's good for the soul and I don't have to do tons of social interaction to get it thanks to the online ordering and curbside pickup. I can go home and eat it in my Underoos and legwarmers and get my Honey Boo Boo on. #fuckingwinning.What is a veg' doing reviewing Outback, you wonder? well. . .I like to give cred where I see fit. It wasn't my choice of restaurant of course, but my friend Angie gave me that doe-eyed look when I suggested that our dinner spot could be her choice. I will admit that upon arriving I assumed I'd be stuck with an option of salad and....salad. Much to my delight I had some options to choose from and this is what I indulged in:Complimentary bread-Comp bread is just that... you're stuck w/ what you get, but surprisingly it was fluffy and not rock solid when taking a bite and the waitress didn't mind bringing multiple refills to enjoy w/ our entrees. Caesar Salad- Salad was fresh and made perfectly as requested with NO dressing and blue cheese crumbles added on top. No Rules parmesan pasta-I loved this. They have an actual pasta listing where I can ADD meat if I want to or just get the pasta independently. Also, the waitress was good about asking me how "spicy" I want my noodles and made sure I was aware that they use cayenne pepper to add spice which I appreciated knowing.Strawberry Peach Sangria-Light floral notes w/ floating strawberries on top. Delicious to say the least and something refreshing I could sip throughout dinner.Not my first, second, or third choice to eat as a vegetarian, but as far as being accomodating to my diet, I'd say above average.I am an Outback lover.  I hit up an Outback at least once a month, usually for lunch.  Those darn Bloomin' Onions have me addicted!  Even with my love of Outback, it can't save this particular location for me.  This location just stinks!  I went here with a girlfriend to celebrate her birthday.  This location is near her work and where she picked to go.  We went in for lunch during the week.  We walked in and it was almost empty, even though it was 12pm.  The host stand was staffed with a guy that resembled a robot.  He was just on auto-pilot and was there to do his job and nothing more.  He wasn't rude, but he wasn't friendly either. He was just there to collect a paycheck and nothing more.  A smile or a hello would have been nice, that's all I'm saying.We were then seated at a table and waited several minutes before our server acknowledged us, even though there were only 2 other tables in the whole section.  Our server was friendly but ditzy.  He did bring out drinks out shortly after and then took our order.  We didn't see him again until we were half way though the meal. He did bring us out refills at this point, which was nice since we had been out of drinks for almost the whole meal by then.  Again he was super friendly, just an awful server.Now for the food.  We order the new Barrier Reef Trio with the coconut shrimp, crab avocado stack, and ahi tuna and a steak.  The seafood trio is definitely an appetizer, unless you have a small appetite.  Luckily we had also ordered soup and salad as well, otherwise my friend would have starved.  The seafood was pretty good though except the coconut shrimp were about 5 seconds away from being burnt.  The steak I ordered medium rare came out medium well.  Ugh, who even eats medium well steak?  Anyway, the steak was overcooked but my friend had to get back to work and we didn't have the time to send it back.  Since I was just going to eat it, I asked the other server (since I couldn't find ours) and the food runner if they could grab some blue cheese dressing (sounds weird but it goes so well with steak!).  They kept telling me ok, but no blue cheese ever came out.  I gave up and just ate the steak because of the lack of time.  I had also ordered the garlic mashed potatoes.  Even these were wrong.  They were so full of lumpy, half cooked potatoes.  I love potatoes, but not undercooked ones.I am really not a complainer, but this whole experience was just bad.  I still love Outback, but I won't come back to this location, unless I absolutely have too.  So you can see the food was ugh, the service was blah, and the overall experience was just mediocre at best.  You have been warned about this location!There are a lot of negative reviews for this location. I personally didn't expect anything above average eating here, but the experience was actually pleasant. Inside there was a lot of customers. We only waited maybe 2 minutes for a table which was nice considering how busy it was. Our server came over and took our drink order right away. She soon returned with our drinks and some of that delicious free bread. There's something about that bread that's just so good! Priced at $7.29 hubby and I shared a "Bloomin' Onion" because it's not a visit to Outback without getting one. The bloomin' onion tasted great, I just hoped between the onion and bread that we had room for our meal!I ordered a 6 ounce Filet priced at $20.49 after the addition of a blue cheese crown to the steak. I also for another $1 added a "Wedge Salad" to complete my meal. The wedge salad was awesome and almost a meal itself. The steak came with mashed potatoes that tasted alright, but might have been sitting on the plate for a bit because they weren't very warm. It also came with "Baked Potato Soup" that was pretty good. The steak really surprised me. I didn't expect much, but the steak was cooked to my liking, was tender and had good flavor. The blue cheese crown was too much. I little goes a long way in that department and while I usually like it on my steak, this time they could have scaled back and maybe even used actual chunks of cheese instead of a mixture. I don't know how often I'll visit, but after this surprisingly good experience, I will not hesitate to rule out Outback Steakhouse in the future.
Marc's Sports Grill & Nightlife=Marc's can be one star or 5 depending on the night.  It is one of my go-to bars so I decided to give it the benefit of 4 stars. Don't get me wrong I love this place. How can you go wrong with Karaoke 7 days a week? There is also a seperate side for hip hop music and dancing. They have a stage so that you can have the full rockstar experience though most people don't use it so it is by no means necessary. Drinks are strong and cheap. The seats are comfortable and loungy. The singing....depends on the crowd. The crowd changes a lot night to night despite the high doses of regulars. This tends to really be the downside...some night you get the hard rock cut up metallica t shirt crowd. metallica is ok but not much of a karaoke choice...then again if you are into it all power to you.The restoom on the Karaoke side is Ally McBealled, meaning unisex which is always a fun way to make friends. You can generally mix your crowd with another. Quite the social anamole. Based on friends reactions this place is not for everyone..but if it isn't you are uppity. ahem.If you want to enter the ghetto version of hell on earth then come to this place!  IF you are into (or yourself) ghetto, ratchet, and classless then this is the place for you. If you are into at least a halfway decent crowd then avoid this place like AIDS! The visit to the restrooms will make you feel like you might catch AIDS just from contact with anything in them Nastiest restrooms I have ever seen & I accept the lower standards of bar and club restrooms usually!This place is filled with hot messes, overweight nasty women dressing like they have the bodies of fit models in skirts way too short showing off their unfortunate meat "packages". I'm confident 70% of the patrons have criminal records and 25% have warrants for their arrest. I'm fairly certain that a few dudes were gone on something other than alcohol and/or even a little weed.IF you want crazy men stepping up to you like they would easily snatch you up to rape you if you were alone then here's the place for you.  At times throughout the night I was uncomfortable with my own safety given the men walking around. Guess I'm not use to the ghetto...this place immediately gave me flashbacks of the gutters of Memphis, TN that I had to escape from.The ONLY thing I could give this place is that the DJ played hot songs BUT unfortunately he had a thing for being stuck in the 80's as he scratched the songs way too much which at times disrupted the song and dancing altogether.  The women were messes except for a few and the men could've easily been mistaken for ex-cons or gangstas. I didn't try the food and one other thing, without any forewarning I had to find out that the place had a $15 minimum when using your card....outstanding! This place is definitely the conference hall for the ghetto, crazy, hood, and ex-cons!
Pesto's=I am not one to complain about my food but my clam pasta dish was so salty when the waitress asked me how everything was I had to say something. She was very nice and offered me another dish but I declined. Then the owner came over and seemed pissed I complained about the food and then when she asked my wife why she did not want to take her calamari home she told her it was kinda bland but not to worry about it she got  even more pissed. Then the owner said "well I brought you a cannolli I hope it is not to salty or bland for you" and walked away. My wife and I where open mouthed, I will never return after being treated like that. If you do NOT want to hear how the food was from the customer then don't ask. I also think the owner was drinking and maybe that's why she was so mean. I run a business of my own and if I ever heard of one of my employees talking to a customer like that I would fire them on the spot.The food is good.The wine is great.The service is meh.The ambiance is thumbs up for being in a shopping center.
Tofu Hut=In the Bay Area, I noticed a surge of Korean Tofu restaurants popping up.  And those that had been around for awhile, it appeared that they were getting a new surge of customers.  I was damn curious to see what the hype was all about and with a restaurant named "Tofu Hut", I figure it would satisfy my curiosity.  We actually passed another Korean restaurant first, a new one complete with the "Grand Opening" sign up.  I figure we'd try out "Tofu Hut" since it had been in Vegas for awhile and has lasted.  Usually, it's a sign that the business must be doing alright, right?  Wrong.So, my first mistake was assuming that because it had been in Vegas for awhile, it would be decent.  The second mistake I made was not checking Yelp first to see if anyone had anything about this restaurant.  If I had done this first, I would have seen TWO 1 star reviews with no other good reviews to counteract the two.  If I had done this research first, you would not have seen me eating here.Walking in for an early Sunday evening dinner, our party of four chose the cooking table with the plan to cook some serious meat.  Instead, we ordered the Kimchee Beef Tofu Soup ($8.36), two orders of Short Ribs BBQ ($12.59 each), and a Kimchee Pot Stew ($8.95).  If you do want to do the table barbecue, it's a minimum two orders to do that.They brought out a side salad for each person to start and then five banchan (side dishes) to share.  And yes, I said five.  I thought this was a joke - April Fools' Day, haha kind of joke.  No.  I know at some Korean restaurants they give out more banchan to the Koreans, so we even asked for more and they said that's all they had. I thought we were being gypped and looked over at the neighboring table of six Koreans to see if they got more than we did.  No, they did not.  Tofu Hut only gives out five banchan!  Blah!  They were this coleslaw concoction that I have never seen before, cabbage kimchee, fishcake, bean sprouts, and cucumbers.  I'm used to getting 5-10 banchans, you can imagine my shock and disappointment!When the tofu soup and pot stew arrived, the waitress asked if she wanted her to crack a fresh egg in there.  Sure!  As she passed over my hot tofu soup, she knocked over the BF's water glass.  No big deal, she apologized and cleaned it up.  (I was just glad she didn't drop the hot soup too!)  I had my tofu "spicy" and it was more mild.  There wasn't much taste going on here and I was less than impressed.  I did like the hot stone burnt rice that comes out with my tofu soup though.  My friend's pot stew was more soup-like than she cared for as well.  The only thing really good was the Short Ribs.  We ended up ordering another plate because it was pretty good.  Everything else fell below par.  To close out our meal, the check came.  We asked if they had shikhye, which is a this cold beverage that is usually served at the end of the meal.  It's refreshing after a greasy meal and I'm used to getting this automatically after our meal concludes at Korean restaurants.  They told us they did not have this.  Oh my goodness.  Five banchans and no shikhye?!  Final bill: $70 including tip and tax.This restaurant is sparse.  Lots of Koreans eating here, but perhaps I just have higher expectations and Tofu Hut doesn't cut it.My GOAL here, is to have you start drooling all-the-way to the front door entrance to this Korean BBQ joint.  You'll be crazy not to just go for it all & do the all-you-can-eat menu!All-you-can-eat @ $13.99 11pm-5am & $16.99 10am-11pmThis place is located near China Town on Spring Mountain. From the outside it looked dull and unattractive for customers just to walk in for the first time. So this place seems like it's making it by word of mouth (yelp!)Hmm.., sit down, get your glass of water, order the type of meats you want to cook on the built-in grill on counter top table, then....-Get a bowl of some bomb *** Asian salad (simply just shredded lettuce and flavorful Asian infused dressing)-Kimchee (just for kicks)-Olive oil w/salt & pepper dipping sauce (fancy huh?)-Pickled radish mini slices of cucumbers "daikon" (sweet taste)-Fish bread roti like mini pieces (I don't think it was fish bread, but that's what I remember hearing)-Ask for peanut sauce & special hot sauce they can provide... (we asked the server what the peanut sauce was called, & she just handed it to us, smiled, & nod her head yes, lol)For 4 people, we ordered:1 plate of brisket thin slices, 1 plate of ribeye thick slices, 2 slices of thick cut bacon (belly fat), & 1 plate of short ribs, (we order a bit more after thehehe)I also recommend the steam eggs, just cause you can mix it up w/ your bowl of rice like the taste of fried rice ;DNow that's a mouth full!!!On the other hand, service needs to improve please... Otherwise I would have given this place a 5 star rating...Because many known yelpers liked Mr. Tofu, we try to go there tonight. Sadly, it wad closed. We decided to try out Tofu Hut since we have never had their food before.  Seeing that it has 3.5 stars, I thought it should be ok. The furniture was old and raggety looking, especially the torn up cushion on the chairs, but nevertheless, I should try the food.The menu needed some wiping done since it was covered with sauce.  Ewww.Anyways, we decided on the beef seafood sundubu and a plate of kalbi.  When the older lady waitress came back to take our order, she was so impatient and short.  We wanted to understand their spicy level so we asked if the spicy level is Korean spicy, she said it's not that spicy.  So we continue to ask her at what level she would order it and she said she don't know since she doesn't eat spicy.  WTF!?!  Her ill-mannerism and major bad attitude continued and I wanted to leave right there and then but my friend wanted to try out the food at least.  Ahhhhh!!!When we paid the bill, she walked by and hurriedly grab the receipt.  I was pissed that my friend tipped her because truthfully, she did not deserve a penny for the crappy service she gave.Food was sub-par, nothing special.  I will never ever come back to this crappy place with this crappy ajumma waitress.I'm at tofu hut on a weekly basis and i'm surprised i havent gotten sick of this place!!! My BF & I mostly go during happy hour (after 10pm) and our orders usually consist of : brisket, regular pork belly, ribeye and marinated pork belly. My top fave is not included during happy hr and u have to pay extra (Short ribs). I noticed a decline in their marinated pork belly. I noticed during the last several visits, most of the meat is fat. Brisket comes in different thickness/length with each order, but still tastes the same. (Pls keep it long & thick!...."that's what she said....")..When we first started coming here, we didnt know if what they gave us was brisket or tongue coz it ALWAYS looked so different every time they brought it out....I am a HUGE fan of their salad...so flavorful! i'm not a big salad girl and this is a definite must have every time i eat here..My bf loves their korean pancakes and i am a fan of the japchae. Overall, good banchan.  Our servers are usually the same 2 guys at night and they are both so friendly, attentive and hard workers! This and Sura are my faves for Korean bbq...Honey Pig wasnt bad either!Yeah, I would say "Hut" is a good word to describe this place. It is kind of small for being a Korean Barbeque joint. Here's the deal. When you first come in, the left half of the restaurant is designated for AYCE while the right half is for a la carte. Make sure to sign in so you can have your place in line. Don't forget to include the time you signed in along with the number in your party.I would say you got room for about 48 people total in the whole restaurant. So on really busy days, you just might be waiting a while to sit down.The day I went, we had total of 16 for our party. Surprisingly, we were seated after waiting about 30 minutes. Not bad for a party of our size.So here's the low down if AYCE is your option.- You need a minimum of two people to pick this option so if you are going solo, then a la carte is your only option.- $16.99 per person any time. $13.99 from 10 pm to 2 am.- No to go or take home. (Duh!)- Don't be afraid to ask for refills on any of your sides because there is no extra charge.- You must eat all the meat that you order or you will be charged extra.As for the meats, I was pleasantly surprised, especially the marinated items like brisket, ribeye, and pork. The sides were good as well from the kimchi all the way to the salad, which is very solid. The salad itself I can eat all day.Service was fast and furious, which would of made Paul Walker proud (may he Rest In Peace) for our party was eating like there was no tomorrow. I was impressed because not only did they keep up with our demands, but all our waters were constantly refilled. So TH, I will definitely mention you if anybody asks about ACYE Korean Barbeque.Yelp 2014 365 Review Challenge #5If you are look for a good place to eat at Vegas and it is after 10:00PM this is the place to go. You would want to come with an empty stomach since this place is a All You Can Eat Korean BBQ. I dare you to come out of this place not smelling like Korean BBQ. So if you plan to go to a party after you might wanna bring a change of clothes. If this is your first time trying Korean BBQ let me tell you that the smell will linger on your clothes and hair. This is an AYCE location starting at 10:00pm-2:00am and it only cost $18-20 depending on the tipping amount. This is a great deal since NYC prices are outrageous of this type of food. Along with the Korean BBQ meat that you order it comes with Banchan. Banchan are small tradition Korean side dishes such as kimchee, bean sprout, fish cake, pancake etc. If these dishes run out you can always ask for more. I am used to my basket of fresh lettuce but instead they served chop lettuce with some dressing. This is a complete shock to me, maybe the basket of fresh lettuce is a NYC thing. The basket of fresh lettuce here is served like a salad with a fresh sesame dressing. I will recommend  this brisket, marinated pork belly and sliced sliced rib-eye. I will stay away from the squid because it comes really elastic when it is cooked. The marinated pork belly was my favorite because it comes with so much favor. Keep in mind that this place does not change the Korean BBQ grill. Since the pork belly is marinated the grill turns black quicker and they will not replace it until you finish the dinner. The restaurant is split into two parts. When you walk in the left side is for Korean BBQ quest. They have 6 tables that can seat 4 people each and 3 long table that can hold at least 8 individuals. The right side are for guest who do not want to eat Korean BBQ but just want Korean food. The only reason this place lost a star is because of service and the wait. I came at 10:03pm and had to wait for an hour to get seated. The service is slow and they seem like zombies. When the table before us finish eating it took 10 minutes to clean the table and when the table was clean the waitress did not call us until another 10 minutes has passed. So the turn around rate for the table is around 20 minutes because they lack the help. Since only two people are working it takes a lot longer for wait and the meat to come out. If they hired more help this place would have earn five stars. Hint: When you walk in place your name, time you came in and number in your party on that sheet of paper near the door. This place get pack after 10:15pm!Since my last review, I've been here a couple times. I'm going to knock them down a star. This is mainly due to the quality of the food.Many people like to come here because the all you can eat barbecue is the cheapest in town. It's 15.99 and it includes short rib and steamed egg. But recently, the food quality has gone down drastically.First, let's talk about the kalbi, or marinated short ribs. The beef was average quality. And, it was way too soft. It lacked any sort of chew, which means it was marinated too long. The spicy pork bbq was really disappointing as well. It had been overly marinated as well and we had been cooking it for a while, but it seemed like it was never done.The ribeye was acceptable, and so were the pork belly slices, but really, is it that hard to mess it up? All your doing is slicing. What seems to be the issue is the marinades here.The banchan is very disappointing here. The only highlight is the stir fried fish cakes, but it was average. The pancake and japchae are so bland here. The kimchi does not taste good. The only highlight was the salad.. just what I wanted to eat at an AYCE bbq (sarcasm).The bean paste soup is so bland and flavorless, and the once good steamed egg tasted like an overly salted, watery mess.The food, I'll give it 2 stars, but the price, I'll give it 4. The service here is good and fast. I would go here if my friends wanted to go, but on my own accord, I probably wouldn't be taking any out of towners here, no matter what the price was.I really hate to do this, because this once was my "Go-to" spot for KBBQ.. it has the best late night price in Vegas for $13.99, and even there regular all day price for $16.99.. I mean really you cannot beat that price!! But why 1 star?! Why am I updating my raving review about them?! Why am I probably never going to return to my once favorite KBBQ spot?! why you ask.. lemme tell you, it's because a little critter called a COCKROACH crawled its way across our chair we were seated at, and made it's way up against the glass window.. while we were still eating!!Had to get the attention of the servers that we had an unwelcome guest trying to join us.. and he quickly grabbed two menus to scoop up the critter to have it removed, and tossed it outside.. but I'm sorry my friend, where there is one seen.. there are always more to be found. There is NEVER just ONE COCKROACH.. and this one that was trying to join us was not full grown.. so somewhere are its mommy and daddy COCKROACH and siblings roaming around. The server apologized.. and we could see the rest of the servers quietly talking about it among themselves at the register. To EXTREME disappointment, no management came to approach us to apologize for the incident that totally ruined our meal and appetite.. I was even about to order another round of brisket, but after that.. I could barely swallow what I was already chewing.. My bf's dad, who works in hand with the health department and the USDA, was NOT HAPPY.. he asked to speak to the manager after they gave us the check.. which nothing was compensated for the horrific experience, and the server he was speaking to was playing dumb like she didn't understand what he was asking.. so he calmly said, "Well, when you do speak to your manager, please let him know everything was really good. The food all tasted great and was good up until the COCKROACH." To make this story even better.. is that this was my first time having dinner with my boyfriend's parents, it was their first time eating here at Tofu Hut, and it was their first time having KBBQ grill style, oh and it was me that recommended the place :/ I was SOOOOOO embarrassed because I had explained the concept of the restaurant and raved about how good it was, and the parents were even saying on the car ride there that they were excited to have AYCE meats.. My boyfriend's dad was really upset and super disappointed that no type of management came out to apologize and talk to us, there was no sense of urgency, sincerity in the apology, or showing that there would be some kind of action taken. I originally gave this place 4 stars because I really did love eating here.. DID is key word. I had taken off 1 star for the decor being run down and old and menus being sticky, and the bathroom being nasty.. but after this experience yesterday on 10/07/15... that's something you never forget, and it really does make you sick to see COCKROACH running around while you're eating. And something needs to be done. And to physically see a cockroach run around with my own eyes, while I'm eating in a restaurant is something I would never wish on anyone to experience. I literally almost threw up right there. So to end this review.. I'm sadden.. and disgusted to say that I will never be returning to Tofu Hut, no matter how good the meat is. It honestly saddens me to give this review and rating, but it's one thing to bitch and complain about terrible tasting food, or shitty service while dining.. but to be accompanied by a COCKROACH while eating raw meat that is being brought out to you is one a whole other kinda level. Oh, and my boyfriend's dad today did make a call to the Health Department.
Mimis Cafe=We came here for the first time last night. We like Mimi's but, had never been to this location. Nice parking lot and clean restrooms.We were seated by a very fun girl who was speaking French with my girlfriend. Don't get her started,hehee.Anyway we got a nice booth in the back. Our server was very attentive.The funny thing was he told us his name was Chance and when the Manager was checking on everyone to see if they were good ,he called him Zach. Plus the check said Zach. Oh well everyone should have fun at work I think.Anyway, our food was good, we got the Fried Zuchcinni. Which is always good at all the locations we have ever tried.  It is very lightly Breaded and comes with really good Marinara sause.I got the Pot Roast, my Gilrfriend the Salmon. Both were very good, just wxtremly saltly. We were so thristy even into the next day. Food was good, just too much salt for seasoning. Service was good. We will go back for sure.a lot of tacky decora lot of average wait helpa lot of messiness in the bathrooma lot a lot of very average foodand...a lot of old peopleThis did not start out well.  I showed up for breakfast only to find I had to cool my heels in the parking lot until they opened at 7.  And they actually opened at 7:04.  And even then they really were not ready to serve customers.  I got my coffee fairly quick, then my orange juice, then my bread (muffin) and finally about 7:30 my breakfast entree.  The waitress even apologized for the excessive wait time.The food itself was ok.  I had chicken fried steak, scrambled eggs, fruit and a muffin.  The muffin was applesauce something and was really good and huge.  The gravy was sort of thin.  None of the flavors stood out.  Being a little more expensive than some other breakfast spots I expected more taste.  That and being late/slow cost it a half star and in this case I chose to round down.
Pho Kim Long="CRAWFISH" is a new addition to Pho Kim Long, and that's what brought me here in the first place.  They only started offering this shellfish in June, weekends only.My luck that the Sunday I choose to come in, they weren't offering it. We still sat down for dinner and this is what we got: * Hu Tieu Hoac Mi Bo Kho (Beef Stew Egg Noodle) - $7.95: The Big F enjoyed his noodle soup.  I was too busy with my plate to eat much of his.* Dau Dua Xao XO Sauce (Stir fried String Beans with XO Sauce) - $9.95: Tasty string beans, a bit on the pricey side though.  A nice spice kick as well.* Com Ga Hai Nam (Hai Nam Style Chicken with Seasoned Rice) $8.50: I've always liked Hainamese chicken since my friend's mom made it for me, along with the seasoned rice.  It's good here, but definitely not as good as my friend's mom's version.Pho Kim Long II is a huge restaurant with lots of big tables for large parties.  A great place for families to eat and friends to gather after a late night.  Their menu is pretty extensive so there's plenty of choices for everyone.  And portions seem pretty decent-sized too.  (I wish they would get a bigger fish tank though because there are way too many fish in that tiny thing up front!)From this experience, I give it a FOUR stars.I love Hot N Juicy Crawfish up the road, and I definitely believe in some healthy competition.  So, last Friday we decided to finally check out their crawfish and see if it's worthy.We decided to start off with two pounds and see where we went for there.     We noticed a neighboring table with their order of crawfish and was definitely excited.  It came in a large bowl with red potatoes, corn on the cob and sausage.  They also brought extra bowls for the shells and a plate for us to eat on.  The Big F requested limes, salt and pepper to make a dipping concoction.I dove right in and noticed the big difference...the crawfish was not fresh.  It was old or way overcooked.  The tail meat didn't come off the shell easily and was broken up.  I thought it was just the first one and continued eating.  Unfortunately, this wasn't the case.  There was little to no head juice either, which was very disappointing to me.  The Big F was easily disgusted with the crawfish and we were glad that we only ordered two pounds to start.  (We usually go for two pounds each!)  The corn, potatoes, and sausage were good though, but it didn't make up for the bad crawfish.  Since it comes in a bowl, there's no sauce on the bottom for you to dip your crawfish in after you shell it.  No bibs were provided, which explains all the stains on my shirt.When I'm craving crawfish, I'll drive up the road and spring the extra cash over at Hot N Juicy.For this experience, I give it a TWO stars.Overall, a four stars for their Vietnamese food, and a two stars for their bad crawfish.  I'm giving Pho Kim Long II a THREE star.(Pics are posted!)This being Vegas, and if you've had too much to drink, you might think this place is equivalent to one of those post cards they hand out on the strip with a sexy girl on it wearing a skimpy outfit, with her phone number (696-9696) ready for you to call her for a "date". After all, with a name like Pho Kim Long, you might think this is the Las Vegas Chinatown equivalent to the Chicken Ranch. You might also forget that you have already slurped on the savory dishes here. Pho Kim Long is a popular Vietnamese restaurant in the heart of Chinatown. It is very large, and at lunch there are at least 10 people working here, doing a brisk business. The food is solid but not spectacular. The menu is very extensive, the ambiance clean, upscale and modern, and the service is very good. Prices are a little more than you are used to in California's Viet hot spots. They do have a lounge adjacent to it now, which I haven't tried yet. Maybe it is a Viet Cafe or classic Viet men's lounge? It might be closer to the sound of the name sake, Pho Kim Long, at least in some parton's minds.I've always heard from numerous people say that this place was the best place for pho. On a Friday night me and a group of girls decided to come after clubbin at TAO, after dropping the drunkies back off at the hotel we headed to Pho Kim Long! We didn't get here till around 4:30am and to my surprise this place was pretty packed, but they still had a couple of tables open. Parking around this place looked pretty decent.The pho was pretty good and is always good when you're still drunk or if you have a hangover! The rice plates here are also pretty good! Prices are comparable to that of the prices we have in SF for pho. The service was good, all the waiters were super nice! Overall the pho was good, but I've had better before.Note: Ask one of the waiters to call a cab for you if you didn't drive here, because you cannot flag down taxis on the street. They will not stop because they can't pick people up off the streets, or you can wait for a taxi to enter the parking lot.Just saying the name brings a smile to my face.Eating the food makes me just as happy. So before the fucking long (see what I did there) road trip home, we wanted something different.  So we decided on a meal off the strip.  Heading over to the Chinatown area of Vegas will give you a whole different Vegas experience, especially if you go during the day. If you've never ventured off the strip for any reason, Pho Kim Long would be just as good a reason as let's say a strip club.You'll get just about the same level of satisfaction.You want authentic vietnamese food and friendly service at a reasonable price.  Pho tai, spring rolls, fried egg rolls, strong iced coffee ... they got it all.You know you wanna come here just so you can say ... Pho Kim LongPHO!?...... FoSho!What an amazing basin of goodness! Yes! That was my first impression of their Pho Dac Biet (#13 in the menu) a delicious bowl of thinly sliced rare beef, green onions, basil, bean sprouts, fresh basil, jalapeno slices and rice noodles swimming in this AMAZING broth! A dash of Sriracha, Hoisin sauce and a squeeze of lime slivers and you got yourself a bowl of Pho that is simply hard to forget! In an armada of buffets and pretentious eateries in "Viva Las Vegas" it is refreshing to find places like this! The best part is...They are open "almost" all the time! ( please see hours of operation )The place is nice, roomy and clean, the servers are attentive and does their job well. There is plenty of parking as it is located in some sort of a strip mall but don't let the location fool you as this place serves some really well prepared dishes. Try their freshly made spring rolls while waiting for your order, it makes my mouth water just writing this review about it!All in all, I have no complaints, I highly recommend Pho Kim Long especially after a hard night of partying in the city that never sleep! Enjoy!Okay... Vegas may not be San Jose or LA's Little Saigon when it comes to Vietnamese food. However, with that being said, this joint really isn't too shabby either.Pho Kim Long (that name will never cease to get a chuckle out of me) is the go-to late night spot to get your drunk grub on. I've been here way too many times for my own good, as my state of sobriety while eating here is usually (although not always!) questionable. Regardless, the food is solid and the locals seem to love it.When I came to Vegas this past June for EDC (yep, as in the Electronic Daisy Carnival 2012 ---- suuuuch a crazy experience, btw), company preferred ordering family style dishes like shaking beef, ong choy, pork spare ribs etc. Everything was quite tasty and portions were ample, but I got the impression that this place catered more to American tastes. The dishes, while yummy in my tummy, were more like something you might find in a mainstream Chinese restaurant than authentic Viet food. Still, no real complaints as it was delicious nevertheless.During my last trip over Halloween weekend, though, I ordered more "true" Viet fare like seafood noodle soup and Bun Bo Hue. I was surprised that the taste and quality were above average. Definitely better than Tung Kee Noodlehouse and probably better than a good portion of pho spots back home! I can see why the locals took me here so often because if *I* was local, I'd probably become a regular too.However, here's the issue:NOT being a local, I'm on vacation. And should be eating Vegas-y thangs. Elsewhere. Thangs that are NOT pho. Since I can get plenty of it. Authentic, at that. At home.So...... basically......Eat it if you're a local, eat if you're drunk and broke, eat it if you want Viet food while in Vegas. Heck, I'd do the same. If none of these things apply, though? And you have a choice to eat something else? I would. Because dammit, it's called a vacation. Feed me fancy things. Because that's what I want. Hence.... 3 stars.Out of all the pho places in Vegas, I actually really like the rare steak and the brisket in the pho.  Doesn't have much fat, the pieces are very clean.  I gotta give them credit.  Some other restaurants serve really bad pieces of meat that are almost inedible or have too much fat on them.  Why 2 stars?  Restaurants owners, please don't ask your staff to ask customers to leave once they get their check so other people can have the table.  This has happened a couple of times to me on Spring Mountain, I think it's pretty insane and pretty darn disrespectful.I'm from LA and have been thoroughly spoiled by tasty cheap Asian food, especially Vietnamese food. Pho Kim Long is okay but definitely not worth making a visit during my trip.The wait was pretty long since early in the morning. We were seated after almost 20 minutes and ordered a bowl of pho and a bo loc lac. The portions were pretty small for the price on both.The pho was too salty and there was a lot of broth with a small amount of noodle. I have had a lot of better pho elsewhere. The bo loc lac actually tasted really good but it was pretty expensive for the small portion.The service was actually pretty good for a Vietnamese restaurant.This used to be the go-to spot every time after an eventful night of clubbing and drinking. They're open 24/7 which is why they're popular. They are on the snooty side because they know they get more business than the surrounding Pho restaurants. That means the customer service sucks and they don't really care if they get your business or not. Plus, they stopped serving tripe. Enough said.Wooooooweee.. Pho Kim Long has quickly become one of my most frequently visited places during a Vegas trip.Why is that?Convenience? CheckAsian food? CheckGood Asian food? Check24-hour good Asian food? DING WE HAVE A WINNER!That's right folks. 24 hours of Vietnamese goodness. What better way to ease that hang over or cure that headache with a hearty bowl of food and a side of crispy spring rolls. I usually order my Pho Tai (rare beef Pho) or the beef or pork vermicelli/rice plates.Reasonable prices paired with good and quick service, you've had me at Pho!Lots of parking in the plaza lot, just make sure you drive into the correct one. Everything starts blending together if you are still feeling the night before.I guess after the rapid growth of business, Pho Kim Long starts having some issue on their QC and customer service. Last time me and my girl went there, we found a cock roach in the soup and told the server about it. And guess what? He came check out the bug body and then took it away. Then he claimed that it was just some pepper they used to make soup and left a check then walked away. I can't believe this is how they treat their customer.Unbelievable. This place is a joke! The employees and manager are beyond ridiculous. Here is the story. My mother and I had gone right now and had ordered some food and one of the many foods we ordered was Chicken Pad Thai. When our dish came out and we ate couple chopstick full & looked at this so called "chicken" that was thinly sliced, chewy and what seemed and look like fat attached was simply "pork". Like any customers would, we called over our waiter, he took it back unsure as well than ANOTHER waiter aggressively came back with the dish and claimed it was chicken. We argued about this for several mins & because we didn't want to make a bigger scene we told him to take the dish back. NOW, this next part gets better. As we continue to eat our rest of the food, the waiter and his other employees gather around near by we were sitting and have the nerves to talk about our situation and laugh about it. So, as a customer I was furious. Asked for the manager to let him be aware of his employees behavior. Of course -_- manager isn't any better with his behavior so possibly that's why his employees aren't any better either -_- so anyways, manager comes to our table, not making any eye contact with me and fights for his employees (which is understandable defending his employees). Finally got an apology and ended the conversation. This gets even better, once the check arrives, we were charged for Chicken Pad Thai (in most case in other restaurants, the dish is taken off the check) so we only paid for what we only ate and with that kind of a crappy service, we didn't leave tip. As we were leaving, the manager came out to our car and told us we didn't pay enough. This is how the conversation went:Manager: "you didn't pay enough!"Me: "no, we paid for what we ate."Manager: "shut up!"So at this point, I was beyond furious and got out of our car and went up to him and he had the nerve to say he didn't tell me to shut up. So now I'm apparently gone crazy and hearing things -_- then he aggressively argues with me that I didn't pay enough, so I had to RE-EXPLAIN to him that we ONLY paid for what we actually ate and not what was taken back (since we didn't eat it!). This is where he failed miserably as a manager...not only did he verbally fight back, tell me to shut up, but he had his biggest nerves to tell me my service was unwanted there and for me to "go to hell". Uhm, are you serious right now?! How in the world can a restaurant manager say all that to a customer?????!!!!!! My mind was so blown away. Un-freaking-believe-able! For sure NEVER going back there and it is such a disappointment cause I been going there for many years now. I seriously think they are so full of it!     This doesn't even deserve a (1) star but I have to give something to leave a review...FML -_-Pho Kim Long is the perfect last meal before you endure that five-hour ride back to Arizona.  And why not?  Food is always light and fresh!After indulging yourself for days in The Entertainment Capital of the World, give your kidney  and wallet a rest and come here for some cheap good eats.  I like their egg roll bun with a side of spring rolls.  Nothing like a light vermicelli dish with all my favorite vegetables and some fried fatty egg rolls to soak up all the boozing and food from Sin City.  The prices are reasonable and service is fast.  I don't normally want something hot for the car ride home since it makes me sleepy so bun is the way to go for me.  Maybe one day I'll try their pho.Anyways, Pho Kim Long is 24/7 so it's a perfect for all the clubrats and the hungover boozers.  Chances are, if it's after midnight and you're there, you're probably a clubrat or a barfly yourself.  We're all just one big family here.I don't like being negative, but I don't mind telling the truth. The most mediocre Pho I've ever had. And some of the crappiest service around...unless you're asian. I absolutely dislike saying this, but it was so clearly apparent. Our waiter was a jerk! In the entire restaurant, there was only our table and one other table that wasn't asian. Both tables were neglected and weren't even given chopsticks. Come on!!! White people can't use chopsticks? Our waiter also forgot my sister in laws noodles and two beverages. How do you just forget an order that you wrote down? And my Beef Pho wasn't very flavorful and the beef was nearly inedible. It was so fatty and chewy. But, it was inexpensive. $7-something and came with add-ins. Like jalapeños, basil and mung beans. There's also house made sauces and spicy pepper sauces like Sriracha. And I guess you need to go stupid early, because A) Parking is a Nightmare and B) there's a 6 p.m. dinner rush which means you will be smushed in the doorway with a bunch of grumpy people for an hour. It's also open 24 hours and located within Las Vegas's China Town. All in all...I'm not recommending this place if you want good Pho or if you're not asian? I totally don't understand the reviews. Because apparently the clueless white folks are getting the crappy scraps or something.You would think that a place like this would be the Mecca of late night grubbing in Chinatown, but sadly this place really isn't that good. The food quality isn't really the best, and the whole experience was just subpar.The people working there, from the hostess to the waiter, were surly and gave attitude when seating us and taking our order. It wasn't really that busy inside because I think everything is a little slower in Vegas during this time of the year (people going back home from their vacations, the school year starting, etc.). I feel like at any dining establishment, the staff should at least try and be a little friendly... That's not the case here.Anyway, onto the food. My friend and I ordered their crab rangoons, shrimp udon dish, and their shrimp fried rice.When the crab rangoons came to our table, my initial thought was "WHAT ARE THOSE?!" because they didn't look like the conventional flower-shaped rangoons we are all (mostly) familiar with. They looked like they were made in a rush, but at least they retained the cheesy crab flavored filling. Fried to a golden-brown, these are a good appetizer to start off with.The shrimp udon dish was basically filler (loads of green onions and bean sprouts) and a few sizeable shrimp. The noodles, which should be the main part of the dish, were lacking. The presentation wasn't too appealing, either. It literally looked like it was stirred and thrown onto the plate to go out to our table...The shrimp fried rice was probably the only thing we really enjoyed out of everything we ordered. The shrimp seemed to be smaller in this dish compared to the shrimp in the udon, and even with the smaller sized shrimp, it was still sparing. The Sriracha sauce is the perfect thing to drizzle on top of the fried rice, I can't get enough of the unique spiciness it offers!Anyway, if we're talking about food quality and presentation, then Pho Kim Long is in the same league as any average Asian take-out place... which isn't saying much. Pho Kim Long misses the mark on so many things: friendly staff, decent food, presentation of said food, cleanliness, etc. Overall, I did not have an enjoyable experience. I think that maybe it's alright if you're on the hot mess express at 3 AM and want something to eat in the late hours of the night/early morning, but even that is a BIG maybe for me... Save your appetite for something better.24 hours? Check. Fast service? Check. Delicious? Check.When I'm looking for pho in Vegas, there aren't too many requirements that I have. There is plenty of seating so you will get seated right away. The food literally comes out within minutes of your order. If you're not in the mood for pho, their menu is pretty diverse so you can pretty much order any Vietnamese dish. I got the pho dac biet (special combination tender beef noodle soup) and it did not disappoint. The portion size is pretty good and there's plenty of meat in the bowl. The broth is on point and you cannot go wrong ordering a bowl of pho here.
The Farmhouse Restaurant=I don't want to share, I'm selfish by nature. Not proud of the fact but a character flaw that has been working out for me so far. So, why do I share? I can't help myself and it is so good, I do believe I could be meddling with my karma by not mentioning this little know fact....The Farm House is serving dinner. Yep, you got it. Dinner. One night a week, Friday to be exact from 5pm-8pm and yes, you can order beer or wine. Mother of God, it is nirvana and this is not due to the fact that I live in Chandler and have eaten everywhere else! Dinner items are meatloaf with mashed potatoes, ham steak w/scalloped potatoes, chicken and biscuits...OUTRAGEOUS! There is more, I just couldn't memorize the whole menu. Now, I'm not a down home cookin' kinda girl. In fact, I would tell you that down home cookin' is just an excuse for not trying hard enough. Well, take me behind the wood shed and beat me silly, this down home cookin' is amazing. I have never ordered anything with biscuits as part of a main entree and again, after the severe beating with a fence post I deserve, the chicken and biscuits is luscious, buttery, chickeny gravy goodness that curls up on your fork and and caresses your tongue till you can love it no more and are forced to chew! The wait staff is courteous, swift to keep your water glass filled, helpful with the menu, have tried all the entrees and to kick things off will offer you a dinner roll before your entree. Yes, its a single roll and dumbo (me) rolled her eyes, I'm a slow learner and said no. Well, the rocket scientists I went to dinner with had the sense to say. "Hell Yes" and the dinner roll from heaven with wings arrived on its own cake plate with a pat of butter. Don't be an idiot, get the roll. Learn from my stupidity. Enjoy your Friday in Gilbert, do not take my table and tell no one, it will be our secret.I have wanted to try The Farmhouse for months now, and finally that day came. My oldest daughter said lets go get breakfast I'm hungry, so I took that and ran with it and off to Farmhouse we went!  It was about 9am on Sunday and we got right in, lucky us!Right off the bat I ordered some coffee and it arrived at the table quickly.  And that's about all that did. Yes it was busy for a Sunday, but we sat for a good ten minutes before anyone took our order, but I had seen a couple that was seated well before us who hadn't order yet either. By then my coffee was gone and I saw a server walk by with a pot and I asked for some more.  But never did anyone come by to see if I needed more.  When it was time to place our order I went with the #10, bacon, potato, green onion, sour cream & cheese omelet that came with home fries & whole grain wheat French bread toast (fancy words for wheat toast). But I do have to say, the toast was delish, the bread was so good! I love fresh baked bread.  When the omelet came I was looking for the sour cream, I didn't realize it was inside the thing haha.  I know this might shock some of you on what I'm about to say, but with the omelet having potatoes inside & it coming with home fries; it just was too much potatoes.   The restaurant was steady, service was very slow to nonexistent, gave up on having my water cup refilled or even my coffee. I wanted to love Farmhouse, I waited so long to try them out, but I left unwowed.Another place so overrated that I wonder what kind of taste people must have to rate these so highly. I understand that food is generally subjective, but not so much that you can't differentiate between bad and horrible. I'll help you, this place is bad. The service is so poor I don't know how I didn't eat my paper napkin. It was so slow that I almost walked out. The food is what you'd cook at home if you weren't lazy, but you are so you come here. And pay a hefty price for your laziness. Guilty as charged. Except your food is better because you get it when you want it, not when they remember to put your order in. The waitress didn't write my order down (next time I'm insisting!) and it came out crazy late and without something I'd added. Grrr.By the time I'd finished eating I knew that I'd never be back. And I won't.
Nello's=RUN AWAY!  The food is disgustingly un-fresh. Their pizza tastes like it was removed from a can and baked in an oven spattered with old vomit.  Upon further inspection beneath the cheese of my tomato covered pancake I noticed all the ingredients were in fact canned water-logged pieces of grossness from the 1960'sdominoes is better, save a Buck an get a red Barron from the grocery store. Do not eat here!!!You have been warned.I love this place. My first time here. I will be back. What a nice experience it was. I came in to get a to go order. I have always heard such good things about the food here. So I wanted to try it. But, being short on time I wanted to get it to go.I was greeted right away by a nice guy, who showed me the menu and told me a little about the Pizzas.I ordered a Meat Pizza, I think it was called the Skinny, as well as a half a spinach Salad and a Tiramasu Cake. (Just a Slice) HeeheI sat and waited ,he said about 20min. He and another girl asked me if I would like something to drink while I waited. I declined ,but very nice of them to ask.I was working on some paperwork,and the time flew by.Everything was packaged up nicely. The Pizza was piping hot when I home. The Salad was nice and cold ,and the cake even had a side of fresh whipped cream!This place is a winner in my book and we will be coming back for sure.When we did have dinner at home ,it was all excellent. We even had leftovers for the next night.  Everything I ever heard about the Pizza is so true. EXCELLENT!The dining room was clean and there was a nice warm atmosphere here as well.
Mimi's Cafe=I don't get it. Yes it is a chain and not a "mom and pop" eatery, and no it is not a 5 star restaurant, but holy hell some of the reviews here are brutal and incredibly unjustified. Yet, some of the highly rated trendy breakfast spots I've found to be complete garbage. More is not necessarily better. The "huevos rancheros" I received at one of the highly rated local breakfast spots was reminiscent of large amount of vomit on a plate. But, I digress. I will limit my review to their breakfast service and food. The wait is never insanely long, and there are plenty of seats available inside of the restaurant while you wait. The entire staff is always very friendly and accommodating. We have tried their pancake breakfast and various omelets. The portions and quality are more than fair for the price that you pay. Our server has always been extremely attentive and friendly. I also enjoy their Pomosa, which is a spin off of traditional Mimosas. Instead of Orange Juice you get, you guessed it, Pomegranate Juice and champagne. Mimi's is a great choice for a reasonably priced, quality breakfast.When I think if Mimi's, I think of muffins. Mimi's Cafe is another one of our national chain restaurants.  I've been to several locations since its a known place.  They bake some amazing fresh muffins that are offered with breakfasts or separately.  Usually my visits are during the morning hours so a muffin is always accompanied.  Yes I rave about them but the main breakfast is just average.  Their omelette isn't anything over the top or memorable.  The filling inside is usually dim.  The breakfast potatoes are few and over salted.  I would suggest only getting coffee and a muffin for your morning meal here. Service here has been pretty good.  They have been attentive and friendly.  My coffee was always refilled without me asking.   It's not the best of places but it will do.
Chompie's Deli=With limited Jewish Deli options to choose from in the Valley, Chompie's  is at the top of my list when I'm craving matzah ball soup, potato latkes, bagels, black and white cookies, or quality sandwiches served with plenty of pickles!  I've ordered bagels in bulk from Chompie's before but until this past weekend, I'd never taken advantage of their catering options.I'm typically a planner, but this year, the Jewish holidays came around way too quickly, and I found myself scrambling at the last minute to feed approximately 20 guests at a break-fast on Saturday evening.  I went to  the Chompie's website and found their catering menus for the holidays...  I called and ordered a sampler platter for ten (this came with egg salad, tuna salad, white fish salad, tomatoes, onions, cucumbers, cream cheese (veggie and regular), a small fruit plate, and a  chocolate babka...  All of this was conveniently ready for me to pick up Saturday at 1pm per my request.  I added to the order last minute , just to make sure I had enough food,  and the folks at Chompie's were fine with that.  They even helped me carry everything out to my car.  Turns out, we had way too much food; portions are huge!  But everyone left our house with full bellies and many with leftovers for the week.  I'm actually kind of bummed that I'm traveling this week as Jared will get to enjoy the leftovers without me...  Needless to say, I won't hesitate to use Chompie's for catering again in the future!Incredibly odd layout to this place.  I needed a few minutes and a rosetta stone to figure out why there needs to be segregated dining.  Still a mystery.  The food is pretty good.  I echo the overall sentiment about the authenticity.  But they've done a decent job of melding the Upper East Side with the Southwest. One thing they should have left on Manhattan is that NYC attitude.  Because customer service matters in the rest of the world.Had this place bookmarked after watching Adam Richman eat a dozen sliders on Man vs Food.  Since I was in the area I decided to stop by for lunch.  The place was packed and I had to wait a few minutes to be seated. While I was waiting I browsed the Bakery side of the joint.  I didn't realize it was a Bakery & a Deli.The Bakery had a ton of awesome looking Desserts....I almost scrapped lunch in favor of a Dessert or two, ha!  But my name was called and I went to be seated.The food menu is pretty large and I had a tough time selecting a dish.  I asked my server for her opinion and she suggested trying the Sliders and making a combo with the Original Jewish Sliders (Mini Challah Rolls, Brisket, Potato Pancakes, Jack Cheese, Brown Gravy) and the Western Sliders (Mini Challah Rolls, BBQ Brisket, Cheddar Cheese, Onion Strings).....there would be 3 Sliders of my choice and Fries for $11.99.  I decided to go for it and ordered the combo with 1 Original Jewish Slider and 2 BBQ Beef Sliders.After a short wait my food came out.  I couldn't wait to dive into it.  I went for the Jewish Slider first.  I've never had anything like this before.....it was dripping with Gravy.  Took one bite and could taste the Gravy, Potato Pancake, and Jack Cheese immediately....then I could taste the Brisket, which was very moist.  It was pretty good, but I'm not a big fan of Gravy unless it's Thanksgiving.Next I went for the BBQ Brisket Sliders......they were very tasty.  The proportion of BBQ Sauce and Onion Strings were just right to give it that Sweet & Tangy flavor.  Of the two types of Sliders I prefer the BBQ Sliders over the Jewish Sliders.  The Fries were Breaded Wedge Cut Fries and were awesome......crispy on the outside and moist & soft on the inside.  The spices on the Fries were very good too.Overall, it was a good meal.  My server was very friendly and checked up on me often to make sure I was satisfied with my meal.  She offered to replace the Jewish Slider if I didn't like it.  I told her that it was good and then she suggested Pumpkin Creme Brulee for Dessert.  I wasn't planning on Dessert, but couldn't resist and said yes.  It came out and the portion was pretty big.....there was no way I could finish it but I gave it a good shot and ate 1/2 of it.  It was very flavorful and gave my meal a nice Holiday Touch.I enjoyed my meal here and got my money's worth.Will I return?  You bet.....I might actually give that 12 Slider Challenge a shot if I'm in the mood.***********Little Known Secret About Chompie's Rye Bread*********+++++++At their Deli Counter they charge a $1 more than Fry's+++++++FACT............Chompie's sells their Rye Bread to Fry's for resale.FACT............half loaf at  Chompie's $3.99FACT............half loaf at Fry's $2.99Their prices have exceeded the level of acceptability.Our Deli of choice is Miracle Mile ....... Great Quality ..... at Fair Prices.      **********We no longer eat at any of Chomie's 3 locations**********I am annoyed. Let me be clear, I've purchased dozens of bagels from this Chompies and they're always good. Big, fluffy with a little exterior crunch. The ordering process is simple and quick and the price is low.Yet, I am annoyed. I came in this late morning for a breakfast sammich. I ordered an everything bagel, toasted with a fried egg and sausage. I don't get down with the cheese. I get my sammich home and open it up and am immediately annoyed. Hence, why I'm annoyed. I will attach a photo, but allow me to describe. The bagel is burnt on the inside edges, like Black. The egg is overcooked, not hot and runny like it should be. And the sausage is literally the size of a silver dollar. It BARELY covers half the bagel. I mean, come on. I ate most of it, but it was dry, with no salt or pepper or any seasoning beside the bagel itself. The sausage tasted like nothing. So annoying. I will continue to buy bagels from Chompies, but I will never order anything else. And some old lady cut me in line after hovering over my shoulder for five minutes. Back off lady! Grrr.The year: 2010.  The episode: "Phoenix."The Man: Adam Richman, himself.The Challenge: Chompie's "The Ultimate Slider Challenge."...12 Original Jewish Sliders: each one brisket-filled and gravy-drizzled, stacked as well with mini potato pancakes, Jack cheese, and onion strings.  Knock this 5-pound nemesis on its ass within 30 short minutes, and you rule the stoop, my friend!  Myself, I don't entertain delusions: I'm weak.  I didn't even consider the Challenge.  Instead, I ordered the Combo.  And after tearing through an incredibly tasty two, alongside a cup of Matzo Ball soup, I was full.  Adam, however, he Manned-up!  Sadly, though, after a hard-fought battle, he--as many have before him--ultimately threw in the towel. The Challenge, it seemed, proved too hefty.  Food had won....However, if one, brave soul decides to accept this heaping challenge ($39.95) and conquers this plattered beast, it's free.  But not only that: upon winning, you will be forever immortalized on Chompie's "Hall of Fame" website (http://chompies.com/wall-of-fame/) and an "Ultimate Slider Challenge" T-shirt awaits you and your bragging self!! You bad!!  (By the way, there's no California representation on that website, zero, none, not one, nada...  Who'll step up?This having been my first time to Chompie's, I was truly impressed!  A Yelp check-in offer allowed for a free bagel from their awesome deli/bakery; our very cool server, Trudy, brought out a few, free cookie samples for this first-timer; and our just-as-cool host made lunch suggestions, which we ordered verbatim.  As promised, those Sliders were "deli-icious."  And the Matzo Ball and Chicken soup hit the spot.  But I couldn't leave...not yet.  As full as I was, I couldn't head back to CA without first trying the carrot cake, could I?  I mean, you don't blame me, right?So, "Man vs Food"...  That takes care of Phoenix: Alice Cooper'stown (http://www.yelp.com/biz/alice-cooperstown-phoenix?hrid=esDZwjuGZQlkpKrZAC_guQ), Los Reyes de la Torta (http://www.yelp.com/biz/los-reyes-de-la-torta-phoenix-2?hrid=nJiqRCfTtxs2bIoFrPdmkA), and now Chompie's.  On deck, LA.=]I came here with a group of guys from my Men's Group. We decided to meet here at 6am. Wow. Really early for me. Anyways, as I assumed nobody was here except for my friends. I thought it was a big dining area and they had a big back room that we were able to sit in. Our waiter was really good and got our drink orders as we sat down. I ordered the Corned Beef Hash Skillet. It was layered with home fries, corned beef hash, cheddar cheese, and scrambled eggs. It came with your choice of bread and I chose the English Muffin. Huge portion. It was pretty good. Thought the hash was good. Very filling. I could barely finished it but somehow managed. Service was really good. I didn't expect anything else since we were the only tables that early in the morning.So at 6am there was good service, food was okay but they do serve breakfast all day which is good. I'll be back but have to try their pancakes and French toast. This will tell me if they have good breakfast or not. Enjoy. I did.
Macayo's Mexican Kitchen=Working my way through my Phoenix trip, my next dinner out was to meet yet another "old" friend from high school. This one, I hadn't seen in almost 21 years and thanks to FB we got reconnected. MacAyo's is another local Mexican chain restaurant. This location is the newest probably open about 8 or 9 years now. Long ago, the location on Central Avenue was all the rage, but like any chain, sometimes growth does not necessarily equate to great.My friend and I shared a cheese crisp. I like the one here better than the one at Garcia's. I also had a shredded beef taco and black beans and rice. The taco had much better flavor than Garcia's and the beans were good. We each had a house margarita and I only drank half. Not because I was getting sauced, but because it was kind of nasty. All in all decent, but not blow me away good. Might come back but there are several other great Mexican food restaurants in the Valley that I will have to visit next time. Sadly with mom living in Sun City West, the schlep to get to some of these places is a bit too great.The waiter again was nice and accommodating. My friend and I had such a great time getting reconnected we also closed down this restaurant and then sat in front chatting till around midnight. This became the second night I did the tip toe walk through my mom's house hoping not to wake anyone up...I cannot lie. I am in love with their pork enchiladas, but that's pretty much where I draw the line. I think their decor is obnoxious, and the salsa sucks, even though for some godawful reason it was voted best in Phx for 2008... I do not agree, I also think their uniforms are possibly the ugliest I have ever seen. I'm not sure you could pay me enough to wear those bright ass parrot themed button ups. Although the food is decent this place has never been my first choice for Mexican cuisine.. I only came here because the Garcia's across the street was closed down, which upset me to no end because their bean dip is fucking amazing, well was... stupid economy. I had a margarita, and an hour later still have a decent buzz so cheers to the bartender.. The portions are big enough for two dudes, so I always have leftovers.. their service is suffice, but about as boring as this review is. I am now in a food coma, from the food baby they served me. Time for a nap.Meh.There was 9 of us in our group. We went here after our weekly Thursday meeting, Normally we go (when we go) for Mexican food to another restaurant but we all wanted a different Mexican food establishment this time around. If you have read my reviews about Mexican food restaurants I always start with how the salsa tasted to me and then go from there. The salsa was a combo of other places hot and mild chunky salsa so it was OK but the chips were served hot and added that "little" extra that marked their salsa & chips right there with some of the best.Now to the food: My dish was the Fajitas de Macayo. A flavorful treat of steak Fajitas grilled to perfection on top of  a bed of grilled onions and green chiles. Served with sour cream, guacamole, shredded cheese, Pico de Gallo, and refried beans. I asked our server (waitress who's name  I didn't  get) if I could get a side of grilled vegetables instead of the  refried beans. She said no problem so I substituted the  refried beans for a side if grilled vegetables. I expected I would be getting grilled onions, and the other grilled vegetable that came with the meal but instead got grilled zucchini, squash, broccoli and some other grilled veggies. But it was all good just not what I expected.My wife got a como plate of Shredded Beef Enchilada &  a Shredded Beef Taco served with refried beans  she really liked the Taco and next time wouldn't get the Shredded Beef Enchilada. all in all she liked what she picked out.FOOD: Everyone in our party liked what they ordered. AMBIANCE/ DECORE: typical modern Mexican restaurant décor .clean interior. SERVICE: Outstanding. Especially considering every had something different . they provided excellent customer service.  CONCLUSION: Very filling meals. This restaurant is spotless. The prices are excellent. What else do you want from a Mexican food restaurant. I'm sure we will be back RETURN FACTOR: 100% ******************* What does my OVERALL rating mean? ********************5 stars -Highly recommended.  I would be willing to drive out of my way to this business. It is that good. This place represents their industry or cuisine very well! 4 stars - Highly Recommended. I would frequent this business. 3 stars - Not that good but not that bad. Just average. I wouldn't mind going again. 2 stars - I would not recommend this establishment to friends or family. 1 stars - DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND DO NOT patronize this business. I would RUN AWAY from this place and you should too! DON'T WAST YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY AT THIS ESTABLISH .-An acceptable chain restaurant to take "out-of-town" visitors for (overpriced) sit down Mexican food with tacky decor.-Expensive! Almost $11 bucks for a carne asada burrito???? Really?? For that price, I could had bought like 2 or 3 burritos at any "...Berto's" type place in the Valley!-Refried beans are bland and thick like drywall putty.-$1.98 for a small side of guac OR sour cream with your meal.-Salsa not as good as it used to be...tastes like chunky watered down tomato soup with added preservatives (mostly ala sodium benzoate) . You'll be consuming a tin of altoids afterwards from "salsa breath".-Loud background music. I shouldn't have to talk super loud over the blaring music, was I in a nightclub or restaurant?-Service was ok. Servers seem to scowl when you request MORE chips & salsa.-Parking is plentiful.-Separate entrance in the back for take-out.
Carrabba's Italian Grill=So much hating on Carrabbas - I don't get it ! I guess I should start with the fact that I don't come here for "Italian" food (or what I consider Italian anyways). The pastas are disappointing - they are clearly processed chain garbage. I'm all about the wood grill plates! This place gets major points in my book for all the degrees of customization offered. Small or large sized? 4 choices of salad? 3 choices of side!? I'm in heaven. The chicken bryan (grilled chicken topped with goat cheese & sundried tomatoes in a lemon garlic butter sauce) is a MUST for me ! Their caesar salad is awesome, but honestly all 4 of their salad offerings are great. I love that you can choose veggies, potatoes, OR any pasta as a side. Last night's veggie was a delicious sauteed spinach with beautiful fresh cloves of garlic. YUM.So yeah, I wouldn't pit this against any actual Italian places in town - but for grilled chicken dressed up and done right it's my staple!Great service and delicious meal!This location of Carrabba's provides a great dining experience for all.  We were greeted and seated immediately.  Our waiter was over in a flash.  He was over the top attentive for our entire meal.  He had many many wonderful suggestions and opinions which helped us choose our meals.  He brought out the complimentary bread with oil and vinegar for dipping.  I chose the Mahi Wulfe. This was a wonderful seafood dish.  The mahi was lightly breaded topped with artichokes, sun-dried tomatoes and lemon butter sauce.  The combination of ingredients gave this fish a great flavor and would definitely order again.  This also had the mashed potatoes on the side which were good but nothing too exciting.  With the entrees, you can choose soup or salad.  I went with the caesar salad.  This had just enough dressing with a perfect blend of cheese and croutons.  When he asked if I'd like more of the freshly grated parmesan, of course! I can't say no to more cheese.  We truly had a wonderful dinner here.  I'd come back again for sure!
Shilla Korean BBQ=If you wanna go off strip and eat somewhere 'normal' and kinda feel like Korean, this is THE place to go. The food is excellent. OK, you'll smell like a BBQ when you walk out, but the food is great and the panchan is also really good.Whenever we've been it's always been a 99% Korean clientele -- with us being the 1%. Prices are not cheap, but no more than what you would pay in the LA/OC area. Just a thought since I don't particularly like to eat on the strip at the hotels where everything is overpriced and often, not really all that good. Plus, it's the same stuff over and over again. I like variety thank you very much.This 3 star rating is based on what the prices will be after the end of July.  For the current grand opening prices of $15.95 for dinner AYCE sushi or korean bbq and $12.95 for lunch, I would give it 4 stars.  We decided just to opt for the korean bbq by itself.  AYCE Korean BBQ and sushi is available for $5 extra which is a nice option that other restaurants in Vegas do not have.  The Korean BBQ and sushi sections are separated.  This is a good thing, since the Korean BBQ area is HOT! I'm a little sensitive to warm temperatures and with all the grills going, it really seemed like the AC wasn't working properly and the vents over each table weren't working properly.  The decor is a little dated and has an old school feel, which matches the location of this restaurant.The cuts of meat I feel were average and on par with all the other AYCE Korean restaurants.  The galbi, kobe beef belly, boneless short rib (dinner only) were the best cuts of the night.  The pork belly was pretty average.  The barbeque steak (dinner only) was horrible and a waste of stomach space.  It ended up being tough and dry (and no it was not the cooking technique).  Other options available that we didn't get a chance to try are the chicken, marinated pork, bulgogi, brisket, octopus, intestine.  On the AYCE appetizer menu, there's steamed egg, gyoza, crisped rice, mixed tempura, and chap chae.  The ban chan selection was average with kim chee, cucumbers, bean sprouts, and a sweet marinated dried fish.So don't be fooled by the picture of the crystal cooking plate in the pictures, out of the 10 tables that were there, only one lucky table got to use it.  By far it is not the standard.  Most of the cooking plates are these gold colored plates that burn and stick badly compared to the cast iron ones at other locations.  They did change out the plate once for us since I turned it off because it was smoking so badly.  One older asian lady was outraged that she was not given the crystal plate and went up to the staff and complained loudly.  They ushered her back to the table and quieted her....not sure what the response was in regards to one table getting the magical crystal plate.  I did notice the crystal plate didn't smoke and burn like the older gold cooking plates.  So overall, great value for the current grand opening price.  For $25.95 for AYCE korean BBQ and $29.95 for AYCE korean bbq and sushi later....I'd probably pass.Before you come here, lets get the most important thing out of the way.GET YOURSELF THE ROSETTA STONE KOREAN LANGUAGE LEARNING PROGRAM OR BRING SOMEONE THAT SPEAKS KOREAN!Apparently, these guys are trying to be so authentic that they hired Korean staff that hardly speaks any english. I asked for a fork and dude says, "You want spicy pork?" I said yes because I love spicy pork but at the same time I really wanted a fork because I am chopstick challenged. I dont have any patience to use that crap.Anyways, I came here because of their grand opening special of AYCE bbq 12.95 for lunch and 15.95 for dinner. Add 5 dollars more if you want AYCE sushi with that. Come August 1st its going up to 20.95 for lunch and 25.95 for dinner. The 5 dollar sushi AYCE sushi option still applies.Keep in mind that you pick out what you want on the menu and they bring it out to you on plates. It's not like Sura where you get up and get whatever you want and bring it back to your table. We ordered Short Ribs, Brisket, Bulgogi, Pork Belly, and Chicken. The short ribs and Barbequed Steak (which they were out of) are only available for dinner. All that we ordered was really good except for the chicken which was kind of dry. Besides the language barrier as the first major disappointment, im sorry to say that there were more to add to it. One was the parking or should I say lack there of. The parking lot is small and the spaces are narrow. Dont be surprised if your car has a few more dings or dents when you come out to leave. I recommend parking on the street. Next, the grills they have you use are gold colored and are not designed properly. When cooking fatty foods like Pork Belly, there is no place for all the excess oil to drain except the sides of the grill where they can catch fire. Ours did and we had to turn off the fire so they can extinguish the flames. One of the bussers came up and sprayed some kind of all purpose cleaner to put the fire out but it caused it to flare up and almost burn our faces. Im glad I didnt get burned or there would have been a severe lawsuit pending. All they could say was, "Oh, sorry". From that point on, our server would come by and mop up any excess oil off the grill with napkins. Really? I dont ever recall any Korean Bbq joint doing this.I would also like to mention that they have these crystal grills that you can use as well. We were not offered this option and would have turned it down anyway because of my friends that tried it several days ago said it sucked.Some random info: Hours are 11 am to 12 midnight every day. Lunch is from 11 to 3 pm. Dinner is 3 pm to closing (12 midnight). Makes me wonder if you can sneak in right at 2:45 to get charged lunch price and get dinner items. If you try it and it works, let me know. Lol. Also, dont eat here if you are wearing nice clothes or are planning to go to a nice or formal event. The smoke from the barbeque stays in your hair and clothes. I made the mistake of eating at a Korean barbeque restaurant right before going to a graduation ceremony. Everybody was looking around wondering if somebody was barbequeing somewhere close by and ironically thats what people wanted to eat for dinner as soon as the event ended. So in closing, I suggest that if you wanna try this place out, bad service and all, now would be the time because of the promo price. Then, you can decide if its worth any future trips when they charge regular price. For me that's a negative captain.

Skip & Jan's Sports Bar=I play squash racquet's, a sport favored by the east coast "elites" from them Ivy League schools, those snooty Britishers and the Pakistani leisure class:) Why they let me play, I'll never know:)Last evening, we had a little tourney in which a group of us from the Village traveled to the outer reaches of Tempe to play a group from Lifetime Fitness:)It was a jolly good, show, ever so much fun and our Village group gave the Lifetime group a bit of a "Rodgering":)So it was with happy hearts and high spirits that we headed down the street to the post tourney repast at Skip & Jan's...let me start by saying that the Lifetime group picked this place, and it's almost like they knew they were going to lose and wanted to select a venue that would be the grimiest, greasiest, grubbiest, grossest spot to try to eat...they succeeded:)Where to start...I know...the parking lot:)When we arrived, the total Kelly Blue Book value of the 50-60 cars in the parking lot was about $832...we raised that by several orders of magnitude, just by driving in...this parking lot hasn't seen a lot of traffic from the Mercedes/BMW/Lexus/Jaguar crowd (and may never again:)After I safely parked a block or 2 away, I went inside and took in the look and feel of S&J...crappy old wood paneling...tables and chairs from a circa 1955 high school cafeteria...an intriguing mix of flat panel TV's, regular TV's and OTB results screens (yeah, you can bet the ponies here...the sport of Kings, in a slightly less than "regal" atmosphere:)They must have 20-25 pool tables...faded felt...and a whole bunch of people playing pool (and frankly looking like they weren't enjoying themselves...extremely tight and serious expressions on the faces of the people playing and watching...aren't games supposed to be fun? :-)...I suspect there was gambling going on:)The smell in S&J can only be described as "extreme humanity"...the place smelled like it has seen a century's worth of spilled beer, cigarette smoke, BO, vomit, urine, spoiled food and every other aroma that humans create for themselves...remarkable, given the fact that this place can't have been here for more than a few years...how did they do that so quickly? :-)S&J has menus, they have some sort of kitchen, they have Jagermeister on "tap", they have a bunch of beers on tap and they had a buffet (or "boofay" for my friend Ryan C) set up for our group.It was supposed to be a Taco Bar:)S&J provided a table full of taco "fixin's"...the centerpiece of which was the taco meat hot tray...Holy Crap, was that disgusting! :-(They told us it was ground beef, but I know my beef, and I don't think this was it...this was ground "creature"...possibly some sort of unfortunate non-distinct animal which happened to be near the kitchen when duty called.I kid, of course...as far as I know, this was indeed, "beef"...just not very good "beef":(The hot tray holding the "meat" looked like a relief map of the Hawaiian Islands...small mountains of "meat" rising out of the ocean of brown/orange grease that was the real body of the dish:(But, I was starving (a banana for breakfast and nothing else) so I tried to make a taco.I decided to forgo the slotted spoon that everyone was trying to use to fish some meat out of the soupy brine, and use some tongs instead...my idea was to try to squeeze as much grease out of the concoction as possible...I was sort of successful, but in doing so, I probably squeezed any flavor out as well:(I got back to the table and tried a bite...not good...I added several shakes of Cholla and tried another bite...and that was that:(One of my buddies had decided to forgo the mystery meat tacos and ordered wings from the menu and offered me one...I'm not sure what the deal with the wings was, but the wing I tried seemed to be boiled (no, not "broiled"...boiled) and then dipped in buffalo sauce...not crispy, just wet...all the way through:)Then they announced that Karaoke was going to start soon...and that was enough for me:(Adding amateur singing to this tableau would have just been too much:)Still, it's not all bad news...the tires and wheels were still on my car when I was ready to leave...I didn't become immediately ill (although I had kind of a rough morning, this morning).They say shared adversity can make teams grow together, so I think I should thank S&J for making the Village Squash group nearly invincible:)
Gaetano's Ristorante=This place has been on my bookmark list for years ! We finally tried this place Saturday night as a double date with some of Yelp's finest - Lisa L. and Eric R. I will definitely be coming back again in the future - it's by far the best Italian I've had in Henderson. I agree with everyone that says Gaetano's needs to print a Specials menu! The list of 15 specials was so complicated even our waiter couldn't keep it straight. I love that they have specials, but the confusion of listening to soo many and trying to remember them was annoying. We started with beef carpaccio (YUM) and a pretty mediocre bottle of wine. Although I don't blame Gaetano's for the wine - that's my fault for picking the wrong one :)I had a 1/2 order of the chicken ravioli and a caprese salad for my main. The chicken ravioli was really good - definitely seemed homemade. The caprese was pretty awful. The mozzarella was yummy, but the olive oil was bland, there was no balsalmic, and they called it "Caprese con pepperoni" (I guess I'm an idiot for thinking "con pepperoni" implies there is pepperoni in the dish?). They had a huge pile of slimy red peppers in the middle and lots of onions. It was a weird rendition of a Caprese - not one I'd ever order again. My husband on the other hand got one of the best Italian dishes I've had in my life! I had major jealousy that he got to eat such fabulous food while I was picking at my weird Caprese! It was veal stuffed pasta in a cream sauce with proscuitto and peas. It comes with mushrooms but my freakshow of a husband had them leave those out. Seriously this pasta was incredible!!! Even without the mushrooms this pasta was SO GOOD. The veal was so tender and perfectly flavored. Next time I guess we'll just be getting 2 orders of this fabulousness!!A wonderful evening with friends and great food. Service was so-so, but the veal stuffed pasta will have me coming back!! Thank goodness it isn't a special and seems to be on the menu full time.My fault for not making reservations and requesting my friend Nick to be our waiter.  However, nothing is like a night out on the town dressed up with Blair B., her husband Mike B., and Eric R.!  We each brought restaurant.com coupons, and ended up using the $50 off $100 (what a deal!)  The coupon includes alcohol.Mike B. proudly picked the wine with his wine app, so I said we would go with it.  It was okay, but since Blair already said it wasn't her favorite, I will go ahead and agree (I am not much for red wine but did it for my heart, baby!)We started off with complementary bruschetta, bread and olive oil/basalmic, and the wine.  Gaetano himself gave us the specials, and there were like 42 of them.  Our waiter finally reviewed them with us (though a few were sold out) and we were more confused (the menu is already big as it is).  I ended up getting the butternut squash ravioli with sage and brown butter, and magnificent it was!  The beef carpaccio appetizer was also delicious and at least I can say our waters were refilled rapidly.  Eric R. ordered a veal dish as his main and a half order of the special risotto of the day, bay scallop and shiitake.  It was outstanding and I couldn't stop eating it.To top it off, my friend Nick sent over via our waiter complementary "house cappucinos" which were essentially hot bittersweet chocolate with 3ish liqueurs and topped with whipped cream.  Eric R. was skeptical because he hates coffee and when he tried it, he was relieved.  YUM!The food was just so good! Usually I can resist the bread, but their bread was so fresh and chewy that I had to have some! The cioppino was amazing, with Maine lobster, and a generous amount of mussels and clams. They had a good gluten-free pasta for my husband as well, so he got to have pasta too. We will definitely be returning!We had a $40 Groupon for the restaurant and went last Saturday evening.  Our reservation was for 5:15 and we were right on time.  The place was almost empty at the time and we were shown to our table.There is a Yelp check in offer for free bruschetta but you can't double dip on the coupons--either the Yelp or the Groupon--so of course, we went with the Groupon.We were brought iced teas and a bread basket shortly after being seated and ordering.  The bread basket was a let down.  The one piece of lavash was more like pressed cardboard and the two types of focaccia were merely OK.  We did not get butter but rather a mixture of olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  I have to remember in Italian restaurants to tell them to hold the balsamic.  It's just to sweet for me.  Give me plain olive oil and a salt shaker.We ordered fried artichoke for an appetizer.  It was very good.  The dipping sauce was quite good.  There were 6 pieces of artichoke.  For mains, we each ordered ravioli.  I got the Lobster stuffed ravioli with lobster sauce--a house special for the evening.  My wife got the ravioli stuffed with butternut squash.  We both enjoyed our ravioli.  The serving size was just right.For dessert, I ordered a cannoli and my wife got the vanilla crème brulée.  Both were good.  The cannoli was fairly standard but I didn't taste any of the pistachio nuts that were supposed to be in the cream.  The crème brulée was the winner of the two desserts.I think Gaetano's is overpriced.  It only makes sense to go here when you have a coupon of some kind.  Service was good.  It was pointed out when the bill was brought that gratuity had automatically been added because of the Groupon.  I'm not a fan of that.  Actually, the server lost because he got a lesser tip than he would have gotten had I made the decision and not the restaurant.  A good meal but a bit of a drive from Summerlin.  I can get equal or better Italian closer and for a better price.I may not have eaten at too many gourmet Italian restaurants so far, but this one is definitely great.Gaetano's Ristorante is a dinner-only Henderson spot that claims to cook homestyle food with fresh ingredients. It also seems to offer discounts through websites regularly, and I took advantage of the $20 for $40 Groupon today shortly after they opened for service. Fortunately, I had just arrived from work and was dressed reasonably well - otherwise, the tablecloth atmosphere and vest-wearing employees might have made me feel a little uncomfortable.The softly played music, which included some notable Italian tunes, opera songs, and Buble hits, helped me to relax more, as did the dim lighting (which did hinder some of my activities though) and the friendly service by the waiter, the bread server, the water server, and others. The waiter presented just the dinner menu, as I requested, and left me time to think about my options before coming back to rattle off the daily specials (and their ingredients) from memory. I'd been considering various dishes, but seeing the option for the Risotto of the Day on the menu, I inquired about that as well. After hearing his description, I ordered it as well as an appetizer.The complimentary bread basket came out first, along with a bowl of olive oil with vinegar. This alone was enough to win me over because those carbs were so delicious. The long, triangular sesame cracker was crispy but had some body to it, and it also doubled as a second utensil at times later in my meal. The tomato focaccia had a rather moist chew and was delightful. My favorite, however, was the ciabatta. Crunchy on the outside and with a long-lasting chew (that wasn't moist) in the center, this bread served as both appetizer and dessert after I asked for more later in the meal. I could hardly get enough ciabatta, and I'll be hungry for more gluten next time.The beef carpaccio came out next. True to its its flowery Italian name, the "carpaccio con arugula e parmigiano" ($14.95) had a full layer of thinly sliced raw beef tenderloin on the bottom, with a good portion of arugula on top of that and coarsely shaved Parmesan cheese above. It also had a light drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and some pepper flakes (to the server's liking, not necessarily mine). I loved the tender beef and the light bitterness of the arugula, and the cheese was surprisingly plentiful. I could see more of this in my future.Finally, the Risotto of the Day ($28.95) arrived. The server described it, once again, as a risotto with bay scallops, shiitake mushroom, parsley, and truffle oil. It was very rich and creamy, and it would have been piping hot if any steam had actually been able to rise from the plate. Be careful and save your tongues with this one! I don't typically like the bay scallop as compared to the sea scallop, but its meatiness worked well enough here, and the mushroom's contribution was felt throughout. My main issue, albeit a minor one, was that the rather large pieces of parsley required too much manipulation. They should just chop it up and mix it in for you so that you can also avoid getting a huge hit of parsley if you're a bit clumsy with your cutting.I'd already mentioned my Groupon at the start of the meal, so the waiter simply brought pen and paper over at the end of the meal to record my voucher number for input at the register. The check came shortly afterward, with the promotional value having been deducted from the subtotal. They did print a list of suggested gratuity amounts based on the original subtotal, which I much appreciated because that's how I learned it. (For the record, I tipped the 20% from the pre-Groupon price.)After this meal, I'm excited to come back to Gaetano's in the future to try more entrees. Several of the pasta dishes sounded enticing, and I'd originally planned to try the veal chop before I was lured away. This already seems like a great Italian restaurant to me, and hopefully I'll upgrade that positive praise next time.
Peter Piper Pizza=Ate pizza and played video games at Peter Piper Pizza with my lil bro Saturday afternoon as part of a larger pizza party, and we had a blast. No, the pizza ain't great, kind of tastes like a greasy sponge, but the kids don't notice - and really that's why you're there anyway. I say greasy sponge, but you know I had at least three or four slices. Even bad pizza is good pizza.This location definitely felt a little cleaner than some of the others around the valley.The game selection was decent, though still doesn't compare to an actual arcade - they had Star Wars Trilogy, Area 51, a boxing simulation, air hockey, at least three different sets of racing games that two people can play together, a bunch of the ones where you just drop your token in and that's it (aim for the back of the dump truck, aim for the railroad bridge, etc) - some of which are actually a little addicting. And Skee Ball, of course. God, I don't know what it is that makes Skee Ball so addictive - my lil bro and me, we must have dropped tokens into that game for over an hour. He walked away with hundreds of tickets, which he redeemed for cool stuff - a slinky, and some playing cards. Oh, and vampire teeth. Can't go to Peter Piper Pizza and leave without redeeming your tickets for vampire teeth.
YC's Mongolian Grill=Delicious, hot, affordable and filling! Pro Tip:  Opt for the dinner sized bowl and also buy a to go container too.  Then cram as much stuff as you can in your silver bowl before they cook it.  Then fill half of the to go container with rice and pour all your leftovers into the take out container when you are done eating.  Viola!  Ready made lunch for tomorrow.  :)OK, I really wanted to give this place 4 or 5 stars. Been coming here for years. Affordable and delicious! Especially love the Spicy Hunan Sauce. Always have had a great experience.Today, I went to this location with two of my coworkers. One of them has severe peanut and seafood allergies. The staff was very accomodating at first: They gave her an "Allergy Warning" tag and instructed her which sauces to steer clear of (a previous reviewer mentioned that some of YC's sauces have fish stock in them). Once we got to the grill where your bowl is cooked was where trouble hit. One of the two gentlemen said, in Spanish, "Just cook it on this used one. And play dumb like you don't understand them!" Beyond inappropriate and dangerous! Unfortunately for these clowns, two out of the three "snowflakes" speak Spanish and we called them on it.  They were very cautious after this, but it still left a bad taste in our mouths. Will I come back? Likely, 'cause . . .1) I'm a sucka, 2) LOVE stir fry, and 3) It's close to my house. Bottom line: If you have allergies, WATCH OUT!
Morning Star Cafe=Dropped in for breakfast at around 8:45 and the place was empty.  Good for me, bad for them I suppose.  When you walk in the the first thing you are struck by is how unlike the inside is the to the outside.  From the outside Morning Star looks like any old breakfast/lunch shack jammed into an industrial park mainly to cater to the employees of the various surrounding businesses, but the inside actually reminds me of an old time breakfast joint replete with funny old time signs strewn about declaring how wonderful their fresh brewed coffee is.I ordered the Italian omelet with an iced tea.  The first thing to point out is that Morning Star does not accept credit or debit cards.  They do, however, have an ATM conveniently located next to the register.  Luckily I had cash so this wasn't an issue, but I can imagine that first timers who hold up the line during the lunch rush could be on the wrong end of some dirty looks.  The omelet was fantastic, it was absolutely bursting with with tomatoes, marinara sauce, cheese, and Italian spices.  The wheat toast was thick sliced and the bread was made that morning, though not on site.The owners, a married couple, were extremely pleasant to chat with and while I write this I regret not learning their names.Overall I have to say that I'm sold on this place.  If I wasn't moving out of state in the next few weeks this would definitely be my short-drive breakfast place of choice.The owner may claim to be simply 'politically incorrect' however that is a statement that I have heard from many a racist before. Its the same as saying, "I'm not a racist, I just believe in genetic purity." I was unhappy to be at the receiving end of a rant that wandered from how he threw his wife's food out because she'd put salt on it. Which apparently offended him as a chef...or something. In my opinion that is abusive, controlling, misogynist behavior that is reprehensible. It at least points to an inability to communicate and a sharp need to be correct, perhaps a dangerous need.Furthermore, his referencing 'Lousy-anna' referring to Lousiana, the Shreveport area if I remember correct, became tiresome immediately. He called the population of the area he used to live, please forgive me, niggers! His claim that he was referencing the white and black population fell short when he told a story of catching a young black child he caught stealing. He apparently asked the child why he was stealing and was offended that the answer as that "You whites have been stealing from us for years."  I had to leave to get to work, I would have left just as quickly had I not had to be at work 5 minutes later. My only regret was that I had to leave my poor girlfriend there...Sir, if you wish to be a racist (excuse me: Politically Incorrect) you can do it without my dollars lining your pocket. I am sad to no longer have a place on my way to work that I could stop to grab a bite. I am truly discomfited riding my bike past the cafe and seeing that you are still in business. If you like your breakfast with a side of racism and misogyny, eat here. If you are a Russell Pearce, Joe Arpaio, or SB1070 supporter, here is your place. If you feel that people should not be judged, eat somewhere else. Somewhere that doesn't just dress up in bible verse, perhaps somewhere that embraces christian values, not just trite statements everywhere you look.So I have been hearing about Morning Star Café for a while now and since I was in the area I decided to give them a try. I was already prewarned to call my order ahead, which I did,  I have to be honest I really didn't look at a menu, I just asked my besty what her favorite thing was and that's what I tried. What did I try you asked?? Well I ordered the Green Chile Chicken sandwich and it was delsih!  It had chunks of chicken breast, diced green chilies and melted mozzarella cheese, this sandwich was amazing!!! Loved it, the flavors of everything was so fresh, it reminded me of homemade green chili for burritos, but instead severed on a sandwich, which worked, I would have never thought of doing that, but that's because in my house we use tortillas more than bread .I also grabbed a brownie/cookie because it looked too good to pass up, and man was I glad I did! Deliciously sweet! Glad I gave Morning Star a try, I do have to admit I did past the place up when 1st looking for it, didn't know it was in a industrial area, but now that I have found it I will be back more often, and calling in my order ahead worked out perfectly for me too!
Shimogamo=I was in the hood and visited for lunch today.... was super impressed.I ordered the special, which was a Japanese hamburger. The beef was tender and delicious. The burger was huge, and had a tasty sauce which made the burger, like, super duper umami. It came with a salad that had a tasty dressing, a bowl of rice, and a small seaweed salad.What a delicious meal!I didn't order sushi, but split an order of monkfish liver (!!!!!!!!!!! a favorite of mine) with the guys I had lunch with, it was sublime and wonderful.Most of their lunch menu items are $9-$11, for the quality and quantity they served, I felt it was a good value. I will def. be back!!I've been trying to shrink my "To-Do"/"Bookmark" list on Yelp.  Shimogamo was on my list for quite some time and I was happy to stop by late last year!  I really wish that I had gone long before.  This is now my favorite place for sushi in the valley and I keep going back and forth between 4 and 5 stars.  Let's see by the end of the review where I'll leave it.Shimogamo sits in a strip mall at the corner of Warner and Dobson Road, just barely inside of the Chandler city limits.  It share a wall and a door in that wall with a popular DimSum restaurant.  I have assumed that the 2 are sister companies because of the door.  Shimogamo is definitely a modern day sushi/Asian establishment with a modern feel to it.  It can appear kind of cold, but I guess when you're dealing with sushi, you need things to be cold.Needless to say, I think that this place is fantastic.  One of the things that I like about Shimogamo is the fact that the quality of the sushi is stellar.  The fish that they use is incredibly fresh.  The sushi that I've tried is unique and creative.  My favorite roll is the Big and Spicy Roll.  It lives up to its name too!  While just spicy enough for me, the smokey oil marinated jalapeno's may be a bit much for others. Since size does matter, this big role is a perfect fit for my appetite!  I love to eat Black Cod cooked in Japanese restaurants....Amazing delicate and flaky.  Seasoned well and simply delicious!  Shimogamo did not disappoint. The service is attentive and professional.  They have a large room in the back from a semi-private dining experience for large groups.The best part about Shimogamo is I spend less money here than I do in other sushi establishments in the valley, but I have had a far better experience with respect to flavor, creativity and freshness!I've decided given the quality of their sushi and the price... this is the best sushi in Phoenix.  If you disagree, send me a compliment with your suggestion.
Salvadoreno Restaurant=Authentic Home Style Cooking from El Salvador with a great tasting selection of delicious items to choose from their fantastic menu. Seafood, Meats, Appetizers, Salads, Pupusas and Traditional Entrees as well as Tasty Desserts. They even provide pictures that you can see of each of the dishes on the menu. Nice!Inside is clean and tidy with fun items on the walls that give you the sensation of being in a little tucked away place in El Salvador. The service was very friendly and helpful when I arrived and when it was time to order. I saw some photos on Brother Yelp and showed a few to her and said I want this one and one of your famous Pupusas to test out.Ordered the Churrasco Salvadoreño plate which is Steak, Shrimp, Sausage, Black Beans and Rice, Queso Fresco, Fried Plantain, handmade Tortillas and then some. Had to get a Pupusa and asked her what she recommend. She happily replied Pork, Beans and a Cheese or Revueltas con Chicharrón,Queso y Frijoles as shown on the menu. It comes with a delicious side of spicy cabbage and a very tasty red sauce that you put on top for some extra kick. Hotter sauce also available on the table if you are crazy like me.Everything was packed with flavors and super good. This is not your typical Mexican style food. You must check it out to experience it. In the same complex as Family Dollar store in the deep corner. Yummo!4.5 STARS
Benihana=Pretty consistent, average sushi and hibachi experience... or in other words, 'eh.'I've been more to the sushi side of the restaurant and sat both at the tables and the sushi bar... I've also done hibachi on several occasions.  The service is just ok.  I kind of consider Benihana to be like the fast food chain version of sushi...I was there over the weekend and had a fly in my water... other than that, the food was fine, but it still ends up being $25 - $35 per person depending on how hungry you are...I'm sure I'll be back when I am craving sushi and don't feel like dealing with a wait or care much about atmosphere.  However, I'm not rushing either...I think it had been a solid 5 months since my last visit to Benihana... and I still stand by my 3 star review.  It was just as I remembered - same waitress and all!  I took my BF's sister for dinner there on a Sunday night.  We each ordered a Benihana salad (I do love that dressing) and a miso soup.  I think they gave us a different kind of soup but we ate it anyways...We shared a Las Vegas roll, a spicy tuna roll, and then each had our own selections of nigiri (I had ikura and she had eel) and handrolls (I had spicy scallop and she had eel).  It was all edible but not spectacular.  I recommend against ordering the Las Vegas roll - it has way too much cream cheese and sauce on it.  Other than that, go to Benihana for a quick sushi dinner that is decent quality and price for sushi but no atmosphere - don't say i didn't warn you!
Blueberry Hill Restaurant and Lounge=LIVID.  They need a ZERO STAR rating. I came in and was polite, when they quoted me a 7-10min waiting time I said no problem and sat patiently and had my money in hand intending to leave a little extra as a tip..........I asked for hash browns with green peppers and mushrooms and explained NO ONIONS due to an allergy ::to go:: with a coffee. THEY GAVE ME A BOX FULL OF ONIONS ONLY... NO HASHBROWNS w/ green peppers.  They also gave me a TOGO coffee cup with creamer and sugar filled with cold dark Pepsi... AND A BILL hoping I would pay without checking my order before leaving.  They rushed me to pay and when I stopped to check my order they literally ran screaming ::"Oh no - she's checking her food!"! DISGUSTED.My stomach just growled in pure agony at the idea of slop they packaged as some sick joke on my limited time to head to business... and it's hours later. Treatment like this should not be tolerated and BELIEVE I won't be shy in protecting others from such a unwarranted, spiteful, cruel and unethical experience. I'm keeping the box in the freezer should ANYONE at this establishment take a moment to review the poor experiences mentioned thus far about this particular location on Green Valley.  I've seen ZERO responses to other patrons to date which paints a pretty clear picture as to just how this type of behavior continues.  This is not a personal opinion, a food critique,... This is a HUGE slap in the face to a local with a big heart for supporting her community, but a bigger mouth when it comes to cruelty... Not letting this one rest.The phone has rang approximately 20x for me to call in what happened ... No answer.  They picked up somewhere between ring 20 & 30... informed me the manager was gone for the day, not coming in tomorrow, doesn't have an email and to call back another time. After putting in way too much out of character work I received the contact name of: CHENCHO and hope he will be just as appalled by the behavior as I was/am.
Chop and Wok Gourmet Chinese=Decent food, I think the jalapeño puffs were the standout item i sampled.  The crab fried rice had huge chunks of crab, but wasn't nearly spicy enough as advertised, so that was a little disappointing.  None of the entrees we ordered stood out (orange chicken, strawberry-kiwi chicken, cashew chicken, or crispy honey shrimp), so i can't claim that this place has amazing food.  What it does have, and that in spades, is atmosphere.  my friends and i thought we were suddenly transported to mexico - i could have been sipping a corona and talking about the day's dive (maybe it was just Shark Week on the tvs) while waiting for our tacos.  Go to the bathroom and the impression only grows stronger.  then you see that they have beer pong on tuesday nights, they actually have a decent selection of beers on tap, and a few other elements that bring you back to the USofA.  Glad to be back.  So about three-ish stars for the food, and a full 5 for being a great place for grownups to go and remember college.  3.50 beers isn't half bad at happy hour, but the rest of the prices weren't amazing.  try the signature drink, though, it's pretty yummy.I had driven past this place for years and was reluctant to enter, but after reading Yelp reviews and seeing the posted photo of the interior (thank you Jason A.) my interest was peaked beyond what could be ignored. I've since been twice and enjoyed it both times. I think the best way to describe this place is that it is a bar that serves Chinese food. The food comes in Chinese take out boxes with plastic forks and styrofoam plates. The bar has limited table seating (unless you're willing to sit outside) and the walls and ceiling are adorned with (among other things) glass beads, starfish, cymbals and Chinese dragons. There's a breathalyzer machine in the corner. Ordinarily, I would not pick Chinese food but after my first visit I longed to come back. Mostly for the atmosphere, but hey! Chop and Wok got me to pick a Chinese place. :) The food is not exceptional but I have never found Chinese food to be exceptional. The variety IS exceptional. More than 10 vegetarian options alone, even more if you are willing to eat shrimp! Jamie has been behind the bar both times I've been there. The very first time he made me feel right at home by asking my name, shaking my hand and introducing himself as the owner. The second time, he generously made amends for a slow kitchen without even being prompted by complaints. The vibe is super chill and is a lot of what I love about Chop and Wok! Last night, some dude started playing guitar at the bar. He had an awesome voice and offered to take requests. When you're feeling low key and hungry, this place is a great solution!Thanks to Christina P for introducing me to Chop and Wok.  I would have never found my way in here otherwise, and I love it!Nice laid back bar for those of you not into the whole typical Scottsdale scene.  You can actually order your food from the bar as well.  There's a large outdoor seating area in between the bar and the restaurant which seems to really be just take-out and delivery unless you enjoy baking in the Arizona heat.  I didn't mind the styrofoam plates or take-out boxes at all since I always need a box anyway.As far as the food, most entrees run $6.50 for a small (pint) and $10 for a large (quart).  You can adjust the heat in your dishes, but even the ones that were ordered spicy were not that spicy.  The food is really good for what it is.  Keep your expectations in check.  The jalapeno puffs were excellent and a nice take on the crab puff.This will most likely be a place I end up at the end of a long day.  The bartender/owner? was friendly, and it's just a comfortable place to be.A dive bar that features Chinese food? Now those aren't two things you hear in the same sentence!  After trying this place I know why! My buddy and I stopped at Chop and Wok on the way to the airport  and ordered the food to go. The NFC championship game was on in the bar and patio area, so this review is a bit late.  We both got the same thing, a chicken and veggie combo on brown rice.I barely had time to eat a couple of bites as we rushed to return the rental car. 2 bites was 2 too many.  My navigator on the other had time for a bit more. Sad part is the chicken tasted like it was still frozen.  If you have ever microwaved one of those prefabbed frozen dinners, that is the level of flavor this dish had, bummer. Had high hopes for this place but all I can say is yuck! I hate to give it 2 stars but that was some bad Chinese food.
Chili's=Normally, I wouldn't take the time to review a place like Chili's. We all know by now how unoriginal and uninspiring their menu is, and that Chili's is the Denny's of late night grub. Well, having said this, the reason that I'm reviewing Chili's today is to tell you about an interesting thing that happened to my bf and I when we visited this Chili's not too long ago. First, shame on us for resorting to eating here, but it was a cold winter night and we didn't want to venture too far from home. There food is so forgettable that I honestly can't even remember what we had, I just remember that it wasn't that great. I think we had some sort of sliders and maybe some taco's that we took a few bites of and quickly got sick of. The real reason that I am writing however, is to tell about a lame thing that happened to us when we visited (even lamer than the food). My boy and I were cuddling in a booth, his arm was around my shoulder and my hand was on his thigh. We were talking to each other and laughing to ourselves quietly, nothing out of the ordinary if you ask me. We had ordered a dessert and were eating that when all of a sudden the manager of the joint comes up to our booth and says, "How's the dessert, let's keep it a family restaurant". Before we could even respond, he was gone and we just turned to each other with a bewildered look for the next 5 minutes. We couldn't figure out what we had done, and the more we thought about it the madder we got. It's not like we were having sex on the table or touching each other inappropriately in the restaurant. We were simply sitting close to each other cuddling and eating our dessert. We were so mad that we blew out of that joint and left our unfinished dessert on the table. We have never been back and we probably never will since we do not want to eat in a place that reprimands you for cuddling and having a good time. If a family restaurant is anything like Chili's, then I never want to eat in a family restaurant again!  Keep it a family restaurant my ass, there's probably more drug deals that go on there than anywhere in Scottsdale!
Havana Cafe=Never been to Cuba... probably don't ever wanna go to Cuba... so I don't know why such an intense craving to try Cuban food came over us on a random Friday night; but it did. Enter Havanna Café... the best/most reviewed Cuban place on Yelp in the greater Phoenix area. We went to the Scottsdale location which is nestled in a random little strip mall... if you didn't know any better you'd probably assume it's some no frills neighborhood diner, but how wrong you'd be... just beyond those stucco walls is a nice quaint Cuban restaurant with dozens upon dozens of dishes most people have never even heard of before. We were sat down right next to a live Cuban band... bongo drums and all... they were belting out some pretty groovy tunes. The main singer had a deep scratchy voice and a heavy Cuban accent... and he said 'wooooooooooow' a lot... this combined with the décor of the place really did make it feel like you were really in Cuba, very fun! We decided to order a schmorgisborg of stuff... what follows is a list of what we got along with a brief description:Calypso Chips - Fried Plantains w/ black bean dip... damn good... good chips and salsa alternative. Frituras de Frijoles Negros - Deep fried balls of black beans w/ avocado dip... heavenly.Dátiles con Chorizo - Chorizo stuffed dates wrapped in bacon... very unique flavor.Papa Rellena - Meat stuffed in a ball of fried potatoes in a bed of cream sauce... pretty decent though a bit rich. Tamal Cubano - A Cuban ground corn tamale with pork and other random goodness, it was alright but not quite good enough to specifically recommend.  Potage de Frijoles Negros - A black bean soup... a little too 'beany' if that makes any sense. Made a good dip for the black bean balls though. On top of all that we tried a couple of imported Cuban sodas... both were pretty different, but tasted great. The meal was very fun... flavors were all over the place; if you're a fan of trying new things then this should be high on your list. The Tapas section of the appetizer is quite extensive and you can easily make a fun and varied meal by getting nothing but appetizers. This place is easily recommendable for any of the more adventurous foodies out there; you'll have a lot of fun at this place trying some new things. For us, this place was more of a novelty, to try once just for the experience... but depending on your pallet I could see this place swooping in a stealing a lot of business from other more bland Mexican and ethnic restaurants nearby.  4/5.Yelp Eats Week 2011 (50% off!), Take 4:07/16/11Arrived before a friend did, was seated at a two-top, and I was handed a dinner menu.  Had to ask for the Yelp Eats menu (oddity #1 as all the other restaurants I've visited since the start of it all had hosts/servers deliver them w/ the YE menu on the very top of the pile), and when the host handed it over, I noticed a sticker that asked not to share dishes- oddity #2.  As I waited for Linda to arrive, I ordered a mojito ($7.50) and asked server Ana about certain dishes, and she demonstrated great knowledge of both food and beverage menus (kudos to Ana!).  The wonderful mojito (dark rum, fresh lime, muddled mint, sugar, and a "splash of soda") arrived just as L. arrived, and, having had their mojitos in the past, she also ordered one for herself.  (If you do not come to dine here, you should at least try their mojito... probably the best I've ever tried, besides the ones I've made!  Not very sweet, the rum not overpower, but still a potent cocktail.)  After a little chat, we placed our order (split checks) for the Bistec Encevollado (steak w/ onions, for me) and the Frituras de Frijoles Negros (black bean fritters w/ avocado dip, for her).  Despite my preface of "I'm going to skip on the apps and order an entree, because I want to have dessert later," Ana asked me AT LEAST two times "And what would you like for an appetizer?"  She even pointed to the app portion of the menu the second time, and again I said I was only going to order the entree as I'd wanted to leave room for dessert.  L. was going to start w/ an app first and see if she was going to order more later.  Again, Ana asked what she'd like for an entree, and when Ana left, we already felt like we were being treated rudely and pressured to order more.  (L. eventually ordered another app, and then a dessert.)  App and steak arrived together, and for the record, I offered L. a taste of the wonderful steak, and she turned it down, bec. she tries not to eat too much red meat, but she did try the Papas de la Casa (spicy homestyle potatoes) and found them very salty.  I described the side dish as "highly-seasoned."  Yes, they were very salty, and I hadn't noticed they were spicy, but Mom did when she tried a little bit at home.  L. tried to share her fritters w/ me, but I've already tried them before, and I wanted to concentrate on the steak.  It was a "good" thing that Ana had pressured L. to order a second dish, bec. she actually ended up liking the Frituras de Camarones (three crispy shrimp pancakes served w/ a Romesco sauce).  (Hey!  I was correct when I thought the sauce looked like it was thickened w/ some sort of nuts... friend described it having a flavor she couldn't put a finger on, aside from the pepperiness and acidity... it also contained almonds and sherry.)  I very much enjoyed the Bistec encevollado and would not hesitate to order it again!Ana had asked a couple of times if I was ready to order dessert, but I decided to wait for L. to finish eating.  I was still enjoying my mojito and was even contemplating on having another.  (Actually, I was stalling for time since I couldn't decide whether I was going to order the chocolate bread pudding w/ homemade dark fudge rum sauce, or the lime pie!)  Finally, I decided to order, and I chose the bread pudding and asked L. if she'd get the lime pie, and she said yes.  Score!  While I enjoyed both desserts (I'd had two "tastes" of the pie before I asked for one "to-go"), I favored the pie.  That night, however, I couldn't get enough of the fudge rum sauce!!  I tell ya, I don't know what I WOULDN'T do to have another chance at savoring this fudge sauce again.  ;)  As far as the lime pie is concerned, I don't know how Linda could sit there and watch me take three swipes off of her pie... I think I was only able to restrain myself from having more, bec. I knew I'd have another one to enjoy at home!  Oh yeah, take the bread pudding (but leave the rum sauce!), and I'll have the lime pie every time from now on!We plan on visiting again, esp. on Mojito Mondays ($3 mojitos all day), and we hope that the rudeness was only due to Yelp Eats Week (although there really isn't an excuse for the rudeness!), bec. it would be a shame to have to skip this HC location-- L. said that this location is less noisy than that on Camelback.  I probably should not have tipped 20% off of the original cost of the my bill (original would've been $40.50, plus tax, and w/ the YE discount, a total of $27, w/ tax), since she was so rude to us, but I didn't want her to think that Yelpers were cheapskates.  p.s.  Almost forgot to mention, upon entry to this location, I couldn't help but noticing that the restaurant smelled strongly of body odor!  (Onions.)  If I wasn't meeting a friend here, I might've walked out and gone somewhere else.  p.p.s.  The Cuban bread was terrific!- I must disclosed that this dining was done about a month and a week ago.   As you walk into this place you feel relaxed by the delightful Cuban music playing loud enough to hear in the background. I also love the dimmed lighting, oh soo relaxing!!   We were then pleasantly surprised by a warm greeting along with a big smile by our charismatic host, after the place was fully packed. We didn't even bother making a reservation, since the previous time I had visited this spot  was with my best friend who was actually the one who introduced me to this nice little spot, Special thanks Mr. B, and at that time, It was just about half way full.    So we weren't expecting to be seated right away, but we were, very nice!!. My boyfriend and I were both hungry, as usual, so we right away ordered the black bean fritters as our starting appetizer. We were surely pleased, they were hot and mushy on the inside served with a side of avocado dip, OH soo YUM, we also ordered ourselves the lime mojitos, talk about refreshingly good!!     We later ordered our main dishes, Tim got the Pollo Cubano and I ordered the Chicharones de Pollo, it was all pretty dang delicious!! Very flavorful, and just down right taste buds satisfying!!     We finally topped it off with my favorite, Arroz con Leche!! This on the contrary was just OK, it lacked cinnamon i think, I have made way better arroz con leche myself, If you like I'll share my recipe, but the appetizer and our chicken Cuban plates were bomb!! :)Thank you Havana Cafe for the great service and good food!! :)
Ristorante Giuseppe=Fantastico! (I don't speak Italian but I'm pretty sure that translates!)I cannot believe it took me so long to make my way to Giuseppe's... I'd heard about it before and driven by that corner of Scottsdale and Thunderbird thousands of times, and little did I know that I was missing out on the cutest, most unpretentious, tiny little restaurant with amazing Italian food ever!  Well, Giuseppe - you've got a new best friend, because I need to make up for all of these years without you!The other yelpers are correct... it is BYOB and no corkage fee.  Although, I have a feeling Giuseppe likes tasting whatever you may happen to bring in :)  I have no problem sharing; especially when I am being served delicious bruschetta, 'Giuseppe's Salad' that contains everything in the kitchen sink except for meat, eggplant parmigiana that melts in your mouth, and pasta cooked al-dente - made to order exactly how you like it!We visited Giuseppe's on a Monday night and the place was packed... I can only imagine what it's like on the weekends.  I assure you, it's worth the wait!  We sampled everything I mentioned above as well as Cioppino, Chicken Parmigiana, Chicken Cacciatore, and homemade tartufa for dessert. Everything was so delicious that we all cleaned our plates... We cleaned them so much that at one point, Giuseppe himself could tell that my brother (who is training for Ironman AZ) and my BF (who just likes to eat) were still hungry, so he brought out an extra plate of yummy perfect pasta with tomato sauce for them.  I've never seen that before!Giuseppe's is open for lunch and dinner daily except for Sunday - I guess everyone deserves one day of rest!  One thing to note is that it's CASH ONLY, so make sure to go to the ATM before you go.  Our dinner was under $25 a person and like I said, we had a ton of food!  I can't wait to go back to visit Giuseppe again soon!We brought the entire family to Giuseppe's last night for a pre-Thanksgiving meal... yes, that's right - my family likes to carb up for all of the eating we do today!  We brought a ton of wine and had a great time.  Franco was our waiter - and I'm guessing since all the ladies at the table had a crush on him, that he is the waiter Sheila B wrote about in her review too.  Nice eye candy!I absolutely love the eggplant rollatini and pretty much order it every visit.  We usually start with a Giuseppe's Salad and finish with a dessert to share.  My favorite is the white chocolate tartufa.Pasquale (pictured above) is the sweetest man and makes the experience extra special every single time.  Since I'm writing this review on Thanksgiving, I want to give thanks to Pasquale and Ristorant Giuseppe for all the good times I've had there and all of the good times to come!  Salud!Adorable Italian family making amazing Italian food.  The owner and his wife and sons are total sweethearts and produce some unsuspectingly great Italian food in a strip mall in North Scottsdale.When I hear the name Giuseppe I picture a little old man in the kitchen making spaghetti and meatballs like his grandmother used to make. So I was surprised when I found out that there isn't anyone named Giuseppe working in the back, though this wasn't the only surprise of the evening. The other little curve ball was a little embarrassing, we were scrambling to scrape together enough money to pay the bill, Ristorante Giuseppe only takes cash. However, this little stumble did not interfere with the food nor the fantastic service and hospitality we received. Ristorante Giuseppe is what a mom and pop independent restaurant is all about. The charismatic father runs the front of the house, the sons are the servers and mom makes all of the desserts. The father Pasquale interacts with everyone, he's so warm and welcoming it was like going to a friends home for dinner. While they do not serve liquor, you're more than welcome to bring your own beer and wine to accompany your dinner and no corkage fee, unbelievable. The menu is filled with classic Italian-American dishes and as well as assorted daily specials. Our server was telling us about the specials and noticed that his eyes were steel blue. I'm not sure how long he was talking to us but as soon as he walked away my trance was broken; I have no idea what he said. I can be such a dork.Once you place your order you're brought out a basket of warm bread with garlic butter, I love little touches like this. Just be careful not to fill up on the fluffy bread, there's so much in store starting with the deliciously simple Eggplant Rollatini ($9.75). Slices of eggplant are lined with cheese, covered in bread crumbs and pan fried, then the roll ups are covered with tomato sauce and cheese. Or if you loved stewed peppers and onions try the Peperonata ($6.95), a great combination of sweet, savory with just a hint of spice. My dining companions filled me in on the nightly specials which ended up being a couple of pasta dishes. The first was the Peppino Special ($15.95), a mix of tube pasta, alfredo and tomato sauces with meatballs, chicken and sausage then covered with cheese and baked. Another was the big brother to the tortellini called Tortelloni ($15.95), a large ring shaped pasta, filled with meat then again covered in sauce, cheese and baked. Do you see the trend here? Baked pasta dishes are so hearty and satisfying; no wonder the other patrons looked so happy. Along side we also had Sausages ($1.95) and Meatballs ($1.95) which were platted as a clever homage to the maleness of the restaurant, with just a little bit of cream sauce on the tip of each sausage, well you get the idea. Desserts were as comforting and homey like the creamy smooth Cheesecake ($3.95) which ended up being one of the best slices of cheesecake I've had in a very long time. Not being a fan of Cannoli ($3.95) Id have to say that they turned me into a believer. Its ricotta filling was so light and airy with just the right amount of chocolate chips and a pastry shell that was crisp without a trace of greasiness. Genuine and honest, Ristorante Giuseppe is a neighborhood gem that I wish was in my neighborhood.Traditional 70's style Italian-American food in a strip mall mainly notable because you can bring your own wine with no corkage fee.  Don't believe the hype - this place is nothing special.Contrary to the many reviews here that comment on how cheap it is, I found it a bit expensive for what you're getting, which is not exactly nuova cucina.  $15.95 for two small (non-homemade) cannelloni a la carte is not a bargain in my book.  Their linguine with white clam sauce is some canned clams tossed with a copious amount of oil (1/2 a cup perhaps) and some boxed pasta for $12.95.  The $9.95 "insalata Romana" is a plate of tired iceberg lettuce, a tomato wedge or two, and a few shreds of bland cheese swimming in a very tart vinaigrette.   This is the kind of food that used to represent Italian food in America before the food revolution of the 80's.  The kind of place you'd find, not in New York or Chicago, but in Terre Haute or Tampa at a time when "eye-talian" food was still considered a bit exotic.The many reviews stating that this is "real homemade Italian food" are a bit puzzling since it's neither homemade nor Italian.  This is very old-fashioned pre-foodie Italian-American food and while it's OK for what it is, it certainly isn't "real Italian" food by any stretch of the imagination nor is it, for the most part, homemade.  N.B. No, a visit to this restaurant is not "just like going to Italy."  For that matter, it's not just like going to Little Italy.  I realize Phoenix is not exactly a mecca for italian food, but WTF people!    The mostly 60+ crowd seems to love it.  I can only guess that they are overwhelmed by nostalgia for a simpler time, because while it may not be Kierland pretentious nor a crappy chain restaurant, the food just isn't very good.  Seriously. The servers have a strange attitude that I guess is supposed to be "east-coast" or something (rushed, cocky, borderline rude) but seems a bit out of place in what is basically a mom and pop strip mall joint serving canned food with plastic red checked tablecloths and thin paper napkins.  In any case, they are very selective with their attention and you can wait quite a while to get something.Also, as several other reviewers have pointed out, they give you a non-itemized bill with just the total due written on it which seems to include an extra 10% or so with no explanation offered.   This seems quite bizarre to me but apparently no one objects.  At this restaurant, $15.95 + $12.95 + $9.95 somehow add up to $45.65.  The non-itemized bill is a weird affectation at best - why would you do that, especially in a cheap joint like this?  But to do that and then mis-calculate?  There's a word for that in Italian - it's imbrogliare. $54 for two with tip for a simple shared salad and two pasta dishes with no meat and no drinks.
P.F. Chang's=Don't go aggro on me, Chain haters! Yeah, I like P.F. Changs. Deal with it in a constructive and mature manner.So I go here last night with my wife and son.  I didn't have to wait, for I called in earlier and got on the list (smart thinkin' bro!).  We all meet up and walk into the joint.  Oh, and exterior decorators... My son LOVED the ginormous horse outside, BTW thx!  We get a table and order.  I can't recall what my wife ordered.  Some sort of garlic shrimp plate with snow peas... It was worth a nom. My dish, however was the full triple nom. Double Pan Fried Noodles. Freaking amazing.  It tasted like the Kung Pao Chicken had rolled around on a bed of noodles so FAST that it cooked them to a delightful crisp and then left its tasty juices behind on its bed. Nom Nom Nom.We also order Crispy Green Beans for my son, but we ended up eating most of them ourselves. Sorry Conor :( but they were too good to pass up!!!! Tempura coated green beans lightly cooked and served with a spicy ranch style dipping sauce.  It was equally delish!Not to mention our waiter was on key that night.  He stopped by a few times and filled our mango ice teas and even bagged us up some extra sauce for the beans. Score!Overall, it was a memorable night with my beautiful fam... good freakin times, yoThis place is where Asian fusion food goes to die a miserable lonely death of un-deliciousness.  Everything that made PF Changs a go to Chinese food spot 15 years ago has completely disappeared.  The food is sub par to say the least and I am positive the business survives on its ever aging senior regulars and young couples with coupons.  I did not make it past my appetizer when I completely gave up on this place.  The "handmade" steamed shrimp dumplings tasted soggy and frozen.  I couldn't even taste the little micro bits of shrimp in the soggy wonton wraps because the dumplings arrived coated in a cold oily black peppercorn sauce.   So.... Ummm ... Mister or miss chef ... What happens when you eat two tablespoons of whole black peppercorns in a sauce???????? I'll tell you, you can't taste anything to else for the next ten hours!!! Extraordinarily poor composition of sauce and plating.  In addition to worst food I've tasted in years, the bar service was even worse.  The bartender made it fairly clear she was "opening"'tomorrow and made cleaning and preparing the bar for the next day her priority over serving guests.  Hopefully she ll be a better server tomorrow. If you have taste buds and care about your waistline, avoid this travesty.
Romancing the Bean=I am immediately suspicious of coffee shops with coffee-related puns in their names. It's almost uniformly a sign of someone who doesn't know shit about coffee and subscribes to the "country kitchen" school of decorating.But Romancing the Bean is on the ground floor of my office building, so let's face facts: There's no avoiding it. I go there almost every day. On coffee alone, the Bean gets 1 star. It's just not good. Unflavored coffees taste burnt and bitter, while the flavored coffees have names like "snickerdoodle" and do, in fact, taste just as sweet as a cookie. Espresso drinks have too many problems to name, the chief of which is that the espresso has the same burnt-and-bitter flavor as the house coffee. And don't get me started on their frothing abilities. But I digress. There's more to the Bean than the coffee, despite what the name implies. Muffins, cookies, croissants, cakes and other treats are all homemade and absolutely delicious -- I recommend the chocolate chip cookies or any of the berry muffins. At lunchtime, the Bean has sit-down table service and a variety of sandwiches, salads, soups and these stuffed croissant things my friend insists on calling Hot Pockets. It's all homemade, including the bread. Eat here a few thousand times like I have and the menu gets a bit dull, but the ingredients are quality and the staff and owners are great.Just stick with water.Never, ever, ever again. Ever. Because even if I think your coffee blows, and even if I only gave you three stars (*gasp*), there's no excuse for talking shit about me -- loudly -- while I am forking over $10 for a sandwich. That's just a poor customer service decision, folks. As business owners, you should know that. And just for clarification, I never wrote that your coffee tastes like shit. But I will now: Your coffee tastes like shit. So, no more $12 chef salads. No more $3 croissants. And definitely no more of your fake-nice bitchiness or dirty looks when I walk by in the morning with my Cartel coffee. I will save my money for an establishment that treats me like a person.PS -- look forward to a severe business decline as soon as the place across the way opens. I'll make sure to smile and wave as I walk by.Are YOU kidding me? This very morning I walked over to this "hidden treasure" as I had found it a few weeks ago.  I saw the fantastic baked goods and couldn't wait to share with my friends... I wouldn't spend a nickel here.Rude Rude Rude.10:20 this morning I was treating myself to breakfast and the little girl behind the counter was sweet.  I spotted the menu and decided to use the table service the girl was bringing me a menu and a muffin; as I'm sitting the owners whipped husband comes to the table and tells me he needs the table for the lunch crowd.  I said and lunch is when?  He says well you have a computer and you may stay for hours and I need this table.. so I proceed to another and that was the wrong table too.  He wants me at a tiny table in the doorway in the sun.  I asked if he was kidding, I had been in the hospitality industry and he was not acting hospitable.The little girl is trying to hand me the plate with the muffin and I'm telling her it is okay please wrap it to go...I'm not wanted here. The queen bitch sitting in the wing back chair with her strap on under her apron in case the husband acts up.. pipes up to tell me that I do not need to buy the muffin - I told her she was absolutely right and walked out.
Buffalo Wild Wings=Found across the nation, this Buffalo Wild Wings location does a good job!We stopped in on a busy night during happy hour.  There was a wait in the dining room but the bar is open seating.  Luckily we found a table with our name on it.  Our waitress was over quickly to get drink orders and take advantage of the HH price.  She was friendly and attentive even with the hectic time.  We decided to share the Tablegating Sampler.  This comes with wings, spinach dip and pretzels & cheese which were all great!  We chose the chipotle BBQ rub for the wings.  They had a great flavor! The spinach dip is served with warmed pita chips.  I absolutely loved the chips.  There were two pretzels which was perfect.  The plate also came with cheddar bacon jalapeño pepper bites.  I didn't really care for the flavor and consistency of these.  I think it would be better with a cream cheese filling than the cheddar.   It was a great visit overall.  It doesn't hurt they are a Red Wings bar for this Michigan girl.  Now I know where to watch the big games with some good food!
Denny's=Denny's is, well, Dennys.  Standard just-this-side-of-fast-food chain place.  But who can fuck up Bacon and Eggs?  Well, honestly, pretty much anybody can, but I've never had a problem with this Dennys.  They also do a decent lunch menu.  I've been there for dinner, but at places like this, I pretty much stick to the breakfasts and burgers .  It's hard to fuck them up too.  Denny's is the kind of place you go to when a. nobody else is open, b. you don't know any other place, c. you know what to expect.  Kinda like comfort food, but commercialized.I have been by this place many times and finally stopped one day. I had Breakfast on a Saturday morning. My server was Maxwell. He was adorable and very professional.I was happy I had gone in.Food is not the best but, it is very inexpensive, so no complaints here. After such a great experience, I thought I would go back for lunch.Since this time it was a week day Maxwell was not working, so I was given another waiter. He tried, however yelling at me from across the room ,did I need anything else was not professional at all.I know he just did not know any better. Please do not discuss your personal lives at work where all the patrons can hear. It is bad Business.Perhaps Maxwell should be teaching the others how to behave when they are at work. I had gone in for a late lunch so there was only 3 other tables in here. All the more reason not to put your business out on the street.I am sure I will be back. But, I am hoping to get Maxwell or someone similar next time.Bathroom is clean and lots of parking in the lot.The lines at Tacos El Gordo were too long so we decided to just eat at this Denny's. Bad choice. It was New Year's Day but the place was dead. Only one other table of customers besides us. A guy came to our table and took our drink and food order and never returned. We went 35 minutes with no drinks or acknowledgement. The manager had time to clean a window partition yet couldn't find the time to get us our drinks or even just acknowledge us. We were sat in the far corner so I couldn't see the kitchen but the manager seated us and the guy cooking took our order so they knew we were there. Finally I decided we would leave and go to a different location. I walked over to the kitchen to tell the manager we were leaving. She said "oh wait I'll cook your food right now" and I told her to forget it. I mean they were only going to start cooking our food because I said we were leaving. She never once said sorry or showed any type of sympathy to the situation they put us in. She  had no issue with us leaving and could have cared less.
Liberty Market=If you've never been to downtown Gilbert to visit Joe's Real BBQ, Liberty Market is another reason to check it out. Not only are there those 2 destination worthy places to chow, but Hale Centre Theatre which offers live performance theatre for post eating entertainment. The icon for downtown Gilbert is a massive water tower that is just amazing to stand by. I know its just a water tower but the history, being built in 1923, and the scale, 123 feet tall, it's quite a sight to stand underneath. With a 3 million dollar renovation and new park surrounding the tower, it's both modern and well, cool. Here is some good news if you're a fan of Joe's Real BBQ or Joe's Farm Grill; restaurateur Joe Johnston also owns Liberty Market. So you'll know right away that there will be high quality and tasty food at very affordable prices. This is also due to the fact that Chef David Traina and his wife Kiersten are pretty much running the show at Liberty. Both were so helpful that we felt like we were honored guests; as I'm sure most will feel when visiting. Chef David came from behind the open kitchen and greeted us personally. His gorgeous wife Kiersten was so helpful as she had many recommendations from the menu and drink list as we ordered. Its customer service like this that will not only make you a loyal guest, but you'll quickly share this experience with your friends.Built in 1935 the building has been lovingly restored into that retro-American-modern feel that the other restaurants have. On a side note, be sure to check out the bathrooms, there are several in which to chose and each has its own theme. To get things moving along at Liberty you stand in line and place your order at the counter, then they give you a number to place on the table and when your order is ready they bring it out to you. There are quite a few places to sit including a large patio, main indoor dining room and a long bar overlooking the wood-burning oven. This is the place to be if you love to see your dinner being made before your eyes, its up close and very personal.Depending on what time of day you go the menu has its bases covered. From the coffee bar to a fun and interesting breakfast menu as well as the main menu, you might be hard pressed to just order one thing. The main menu is comprised of sandwiches, pizza's, salads and cold case offerings such a fresh hummus and potato salad. You may also be happy to know that they serve beer and wine to compliment your dinner choices, priced so well that you may want to try more than one if you're not driving.  Be sure to take a look at the wall of kitschy gift items like bear shaped salt and peppershakers and Party Snaps. Who didn't play with those when they were a kid?Being all about fresh and local we started with the Antipasto ($11), which was large enough to share between 4 big eaters. A large serving platter covered in Molinari and Sons cured meats, roasted Brussels sprouts, baby carrots, olives and slices of artisanal cheese were a delight. The grilled bread that came with the platter was a nice compliment to the deliciously salty cured meats. Instead of ordering the Caprese Salad ($8) we opted for the Caprese Sandwich ($7), which even came with a cold case side dish. The corn, tomato + bean side was a bounty of freshness from the crunchy corn to the smooth toothsome Navy beans. This was a real compliment to the wonderful flavors of the mozzarella, sliced tomato, fresh basil and balsamic on the sandwich. The Liberty Joe ($7) is a take on the classic Sloppy Joe enjoyed by millions of kids over the years. Tender ground beef in a rich and hearty tomato sauce a top a toasted bun, lots of love for this one. Mac and cheese was the only side that could have been chosen for this one, kid heaven!The pizza's are all hand tossed and baked in a beautiful Renato wood-burning oven. The pizza crusts that come from this oven are lightly crisp, slightly charred and simply scrumptious! Starting with the White ($11) this one is not to be missed! If the combination of cream sauce and smoked mozzarella wasn't enough, wait till you taste the chopped bacon and tender pieces of chicken, oolala! Another sure fire hit was the Grilled Sausage ($10) covered in stringy mozzarella, roasted onions and tomato sauce. While the Molinari ($11) sounded great, the cooking of sliced cured meats makes them way to salty and intense for my taste, gamey.Desserts vary from day to day, so on our visit we had the pleasure of a slab of Red Velvet Cake ($5). If you've never had red velvet, please do. Moist chocolate cake covered in thick frosting of cream cheese delight. If you're in the mood for something a little different, order the Bread Pudding ($5). This was probably the lightest bread pudding I've ever had, which was more like French toast pillows swimming in a sea of creamy love.Load up the car with friends and go ahead, make the trip to Gilbert and see what you had no idea existed.Forgive me Joe for i have sinned . i visited your little restaurant a month ago for breakfast and never reviewed it..Yikes!!  Well here is the scoop I really enjoy the food, ambiance and downright hipness of Liberty .Can I can you Liberty?   The breakfast was super tasty and now I have eaten dinner here as well.  Hubby and I ventured out to Gilbert on our way to Pinetop ..yeah it's on the way. We split two entrees . Plus one had the Apricot Chicken, yummy  and generous with a grilled /slight char and a tasty apricot glaze that didn't scream sweet. The veggie with it was asparagus also grilled and a interesting sweet potato mash with a savory taste that I ignored because I kept loving the stuff on my plate.   For me I had a flat iron steak with a Chimchurri sauce that made me smile. I also had a garlic mash potato   which you cant go wrong with  and tasty grilled carrots . We also had the red velvet cake which had a smooth texture and a light cream cheese frosting that really made it. As always the service was friendly and prompt and made me want to come back.  Love the decor so updated modern farmy , how do they do that? I also love the unisex  bathrooms with recipes on the walls, yes I took pics hope the recipes turn out!This is the sort of review that the Liberty Market powers that be might not want to associate themselves with.  They should read it, and then disavow it if need be.So we've been to LM a bunch of times.  I famously said that I'd eat myself to death on their red velvet cake (more on that later) but had marginally less success with the rest of the menu.Well all that changed two visits ago.  My wife ordered the italia salad, which is sort of like an antipasto salad with garbanzo beans, kalamata olives (the lone blight on the salad, but I can appreciate that that's only my opinion), and italian meats with lettuce and tomatoes and all.  Totally delicious.  And I ordered the italian sausage pizza which is actually amazing.  Totally delicious.  It comes with ricotta cheese and onions, the ricotta being delightfully creamy and the pizza, on the whole, being perfect in every way.  Thinish crust (but not too thin) and just really flavorful.We got all that last night, too, and it was amazing again, but the trip was marred by...the worst customer ever to live.  If you see a mushroom-shaped woman probably in her mid 40s, wearing a visor on her mushroom shaped head, and a t-shirt with "talk to the (paw print)" emblazoned on the front, look out.  You'll recognize her by her disconsolate husband/significant other, who carries around with him the ethos of a beaten pet.WOMAN: I'll have the (five thousand different desserts to go) and the pecan bar.  But NOT the pecan bar that was cooked on the side of the pan.  I HATE that.HAPLESS EMPLOYEE: Okay... what about that pecan bar right there.WOMAN: NO! Not that one.  Look. You can tell that that one was cooked on the side of the pan.  No, I want that one (the one predictably buried under thirty others).  That *should* be all right.  It looks okay.HAPLESS EMPLOYEE: Uh.  Okay.  Sure.WOMAN: (orders fifty more things)HAPLESS EMPLOYEE: (rings up woman. she pays.)WOMAN: And MAKE SURE that I don't get the pecan bar because (points credit card menacingly at HAPLESS EMPLOYEE) I am *very particular* about this.  If it doesn't look right, I will send it right back.HAPLESS EMPLOYEE: Okay (reassuringly).  We will.  Thank you.So I roll up behind her and give her a withering look as she turns away and commiserate with the homeboy at the bar.  Then we order, etc.A couple of pointers.  One) if my wife thinks you're an asshole, you are.  She's got a pretty long fuse for this sort of thing.  And yes, that's how come we're married.  Two) if you're fat, why would you act so... fat?  It just reinforces the fact that you're a great big fat person and what the hell?Fat person code: (I am an authority)1. Don't act like if you don't get the exact pecan bar you want, that your life is OVER.  It may be true, but for fucks sake.2. Don't order a disgustingly fatty triple-super-size quadruple burger with extra mayo and then a large diet coke.  You get laughed at when you do this.3.  I would say DO diet and exercise but I'm fat and I think those two things are profoundly boring.Anyway, I know this has dragged on but I talk so that I can hear myself talk, and the same generally applies to my writing.  BUT: If you are from LM, I HOPE YOU READ THIS BECAUSE...Our red (please see updated below) velvet cake last night was (sorry about the parentheticals but the yelp-bots are to blame.) terrible**.  TERRIBLE!  We got it to go and whoever served it to us either grossly misunderstood the quality of what they were serving, or they should be fired.  I have (albeit indirect) experience with Joe (the owner/conceptual mastermind) and I am certain that if he knew that this five day old, dried up piece of cake were being given to customers, he would be upset. There were even two people in line ahead of me trying to decide between the carrot and red velvet and I told them they should get red velvet, hands down.  YOU MADE A LIAR OUT OF ME, LIBERTY MARKET!  And for this, I won't forgive you unless I get a free slice of (do I even need to specify "fresh") red velvet cake.Having said all of that, every restaurant has it's moments, bad or good, and I forgive that and on the strength of the usual red velvet perfection and the deliciousness of everything else, I give LM five stars.__________________**Red Velvet Update: I have been in twice since and this most recent time, Kiersten (one of the owners) gave me a new piece of red velvet cake.  And a pecan bar, from the middle of the pan no less!  But I want to make this clear, just in case it isn't: I love liberty market--it's exceptional.  And I really want everyone to know that I've had the RV cake many times before *and since* and it has, every time, been amazing.  I still hold that it is the best piece of cake I've ever had.  So it clearly was an aberration this time.  And the carrot cake is almost as good.  Really.  The bread pudding is totally sublime.  If you get a dessert there, you won't be disappointed.  I promiseI love Liberty Market. I grew up in Gilbert and remember when this was a small grocery store. I've been wanting to check this place out since the conversion and I'm so glad I finally stopped by. It was perfect. This place just feels like home. Casual, but warm. When we walked in my friend and I were lost and didn't know where to start. Luckily one of the staff quickly handed us menus and told us where to order. I had a couple of caramel iced lattes and the Liberty Bowl. I loved both. The Liberty Bowl came with 4 big meatballs in marinara sauce and and two slices of toasted bread. It was so hard narrowing down my choice because there were so many delicious looking items on the menu and the baked goods display kept calling my name, but I resisted. Next time I think I'll just give in and have a slice of red velvet or carrot cake, or a cup cake or a slice of zucchini bread or a sticky bun. So much to choose from. I would love to come back here and have a coffee and sit and enjoy the atmosphere at the espresso bar. Loved all the different themes in the bathroom stalls. You have to check each one out. Joe was there and stopped by each table to see how everyone was doing. We spent so much time here chatting and catching up. It's a great place to come and hang out. I will be back soon.02/07/10What a fun and inviting space!  I loved it!  If it weren't for the fact that I was on my way to join some friends at their house to watch the Super Bowl, I would've stayed here longer!  (My first, and so far only, visit lasted three hours.)  Liberty Market reminded me of Scottsdale's The Kitchen, but geared more towards the younger crowd- college, young upstarts, thirty-somethings (who here miss that show?), and the young-at-heart.  Loved the whimsically retro mini "giftshop."  I would later on come to find that the restrooms here are reasons enough (five, to be more precise) for a visit!  Maybe it's just me, but it's the quirky touches such as these that make destinations like Liberty Market and brother company Joe's Farm Grill stand out from the pack.  (Although I must admit enjoying LM's restrooms MUCH better than JFG's (check out my review!).So, what did I eat??  Only one of the tastiest white pizza and farmer's salad I've ever had.  The thin-crust pizza wasn't as crispy as I'd like (I'm very finicky), but this pizza was bursting w/ so many flavors!  With grilled chicken, crunchy and chopped thick-cut bacon, parmesan cream sauce, smoky mozzarella, peppery arugula, and pine nuts, how could it not?? Can you believe I ate the entire thing??  Well, OK- I did shave off half of the crust (the soggy center), but nary a chicken chunk, lean bacon (I trimmed off the fatty layers, which there weren't much to begin w/, as these chopped pieces were grilled crisp-to-perfection!), nor arugula leaf escaped my ever-vigilant fingers!  And what about the farmer's salad?  (BTW, you may find its recipe on the walls of one of the themed restrooms.)  It, too, was quite scrumptious, if a bit too salty, and contained lightly-roasted vegetables, mixed greens, heavy on the palatable sesame-crusted croutons, and a really great lemon vinaigrette.  I'd be hard-pressed not to order these again on my next visit, but I am determined to try other selections as they sound so appealing.LM's layout made it fun to look around and get a feel of the place and what it has to offer.  The desserts looked so tantalizing that, on one of my next visits, I may have to consider throwing caution to the wind (food allergies), and select one to have with an Americano or a cafe latte from the espresso bar.  Oh, the choices I have to make...I'm disappointed in myself for not getting dessert or iced coffee, but i needed room for food. I think that should be an entire separate trip because the food was too good to stop myself. I even got to spot a little local celeb while there. Mr. Bianco himself. I tried to be sly and peek at what he was eating so that I could order it. You know it's good if he's eating it, right?! All I could tell was that it was a pressed sandwich for anyone curious. And I think he caught on to me being ridiculous because he started smiling. Or he wants to date me, in which case HAAAAYYYYYYYYYYYY ;)During my wonderful trip to Liberty I got to taste the hummus, sweet potato salad, pizza, the picnic sandwich, and the caprese sandwich.first things first, i am going to spend now until november trying to make  that sweet potato salad. it was insanity. It was roasted and I could taste the garlic and there were craisins and oh my gosh. I need to figure out how to make it so that I can take credit for it at thanksgiving dinner. with respect to liberty of course :)second- how the heck can i pick a favorite between balsamic drizzled bread with ripe, red tomatoes, tons of fresh basil, divine mozarella or the turkey with bleu cheese crumbles, granny apple slices, and candied pecans? both sandwiches were so amazing. my eating companion and i decided that the caprese sandwich was the winner. so amazing. but that doesn't discount how awesome the picnic is, because that is amazing in it's own right. i've already figured out my next trip. instead of ordering two entrees and switching halves with the other diner, we will order and split only one entree, one side and then we will have room for dessert. or i'll just go in and order a ton of desserts. whatever.Dear Gilbert,Don't take this the wrong way, but I've never had a reason to come visit you. I'm sure I've skimmed your edges, or skirted just around you many times in the past. Sometimes maybe even on purpose. Sorry. You've probably seen me drive by and thought - "There goes that prick again. Who does he think he is?" But you're miles away. We don't have any friends inside you. You lacked a compelling draw to pull us out of our mid-town cocoon. Until now. So I hope we can put the past behind us and shed our preconceptions about each other and just move on with our relationship. So...LIBERTY MARKETWhat a refreshing, rewarding surprise. A hip, family-friendly, easy-going place to get great food and beverages in a clean, clever setting. The website hinted at its authenticity, but how many times does that fail you??On the street, it's a nifty setting that harkens back to an Americana that I grew up with in the midwest: water tower, mid-century neon diner signage, real brick, public sidewalks intended for human use, trees, etc. But the building itself is a clean juxtaposition of modern worked into a cool old (by PHX standards) building. Old brick meets steel beams and open space. Everything is functional, not just there to look cool. From the structurally relevant beams to the authentic wood-fired oven, it all serves a real purpose.We (me, wife and 9mo old daughter) chose our seats at the pizza oven counter and clamped on our baby's magical floaty chair. We immediately struck up a rapport with James, at the oven, and learned that almost everyone we encountered, other than customers, were his family and friends. That's pretty cool. We've now been several times and the food has never let us down. In fact, we've been drawn back almost weekly on our little pilgrimage to keep exploring the menu. I don't see a James Beard award in the future, unless they give one for consistently delicious, honest comfort food. But we're all happy to drive out of our way for a visit that puts a smile on our faces every time.THAT CHRISTIAN THINGNow, to address something that really shouldn't matter, but often does to many people: "The Christian Thing". Due to the amount of interest in Agritopia and its "Bible-based design", I think most people know going in that this is a Joe Johnston place (Joe's Farm Grill, Real BBQ and now LM) and he's pretty open about his beliefs. I'm sure to the surprise of many who would avoid establishments that clearly identify as one religion or another, there is nothing in-your-face or proselytizing or patronizing about this place's pretty public Christian identity. If anything, the experience speaks volumes about the honesty of their description of their beliefs on the Liberty Market website. Yes, when you know about it going into it, you feel the presence of their faith. But all in a good way.I almost feel like bringing this aspect of it up was unnecessary, but at the same time, I think it needed to be brought up; simply because of how many people I've talked to who immediately jumped on that angle - "oh, the Bible Thumper enclave in Gilbert", or "sounds kinda Stepford-ish", etc. If you just wandered in without any background info I think your takeaway would just be - "Now that was a friendly group of people and a great meal."Oh, and check out the bathrooms. It's fun.So for what it is: friendly, sincere, fresh, honest, well-thought out, comfy, delicious, consistent, complete and did I mention friendly? - 5 stars.4.5 stars!I've eaten at Liberty Market a few times already, but this morning marked my first breakfast- and what a fantastic meal it was!- of pancakes (3 in a stack; $6.5) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3N9U549Zse8UP-MwKZAjAQ?select=Xg8U6Fz2E8hu0xQ3Hf7CZg#Xg8U6Fz2E8hu0xQ3Hf7CZg w/ added topping of "market-made granola" ($1), a side of Grilled Flattened Meatballs ($3.5) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3N9U549Zse8UP-MwKZAjAQ?select=MMwKpMltbKCWNNlraI-tGw#MMwKpMltbKCWNNlraI-tGw, and a double-shot of espresso ($2) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3N9U549Zse8UP-MwKZAjAQ?select=M1WrCuX3oouHHrynL8KJQg#M1WrCuX3oouHHrynL8KJQg.  Service was in fine form-- I couldn't have the market-made maple syrup blend, nor any of the house-whipped cream, blueberry compote, raspberry and apricot jams, or any of the flavored syrups used at the coffee counter (my server patiently checked for those items we were unsure about), and when I asked for chocolate chips, I was, instead, offered a chocolate syrup made from scratch composed of chocolate, sugar, and coco oil... good stuff!  This syrup would be excellent on ice cream sundaes, too.  (FYI, I didn't really need anything extra to add to the pancakes and meatballs... the two paired well!)I've mentioned this once before, but I think it's such a great thing to yelp about again-- buy an espresso (or any of their specialty coffees), and you can have unlimited cups of regular coffee during your meal!  Not like I needed more caffeine after the double-shot, but I did have some of the house-blend coffee.  After 1.5 pancakes, the meatballs (watch out, they're very greasy!), and caffeine, I'll be good to go for a few hours, despite only having four hours of sleep!  (I'm hoping, anyway!)p.s.  Despite tipping more than 20% at the cashier upon ordering, I thought Bruce, the server who took care of me at my table, deserved a couple more bananas for not displaying annoyance at my staying here so long.  One more reason why I love Liberty Market so much!  Addendum:  After getting directions from Bruce as to the quickest way to 101 N, he asked me if I wanted a cup of coffee to go, gratis!  Have I told you how much I love Liberty Market??Helpful hint:  Free wifi can be accessed by entering the code printed at the bottom of your receipt.-Wait in line to order your food, the Hostess will seat you, and someone will bring your food to your table.-Friendly service.-Parking sometimes sucks, depending when you go.-BUSY, busy, busy...they claim they will find you a table, while you wait in line to order...but, what if the table hogs who are DONE EATING continue chatting for hours and NEVER leave and there are no tables available???-The restrooms are unisex. The toilets are individual restrooms and the day I went they smelled like urine, pee-pee men's restrooms. GROSS! Usually the restrooms smell clean...-YUMMY pizzas! Baked in a fire brick oven.-Yummy salads! Perfect portions! $9+. -Italia sandwich is a bit weird...what is that sweet vinegar jelly on the bread? Too gourmet for my liking!-Sandwiches come with a side of your choice.-Ambiance is like eating in a trendy warehouse.-I like Liberty Market!I don't know what I could say about Liberty Market that hasn't been said multiple times already.  But here goes. The people- helpful, friendly, accommodating.  Always happy to answer a question or to whip up a sample of some tempting little treat.The menu- exhaustive. I've yet to try something I didn't love. If you can't find something to eat here, then you must work for the competition!  My go-to meal is the Liberty Bowl with pasta. The atmosphere- kitschy, eclectic. The neon, the colors, the espresso machine (more on that in a bit). Plenty of indoor seating. Nice outdoor patio. Bathrooms that are works of art. Parking- can be a little rough, what with all of the other businesses there in downtown Gilbert. The Espresso Bar- Oh. My. Goodness. That E61 espresso machine is older than me- and probably most Yelpers (if not any two combined), but wow does it make a delicious shot of espresso!  If you've never had a Cortadito, I highly recommend giving it a try.Go to Liberty Market. Do it. Do it now. Thank me later.It's more Liberty than Market.  I was just back from vacation and hoping to buy some ready made food for my empty fridge - my options were beer and cold salads.  So instead, I sat down and had a meal there.  I ordered a salad and my partner in crime had a grilled cheese sandwich, both were tasty.  Very cool minimalist decor but the tables and soda station were messy in the rush of the lunch hour.  The service was friendly - you go up to the counter, order your food and they bring it out to you, you grab your own drinks - it's not the type of place where you're being waited on.  The restrooms were unisex and then had an outer area where the boys and girls washed their hands together, I thought that was nice because you don't have to commit to going into a restroom just to wash your hands before your meal.  The sinks don't have a mirror in front of you, it's a window that looks outside - I liked that little detail.What an odd experience. :-/I seriously dislike the waiting 20 minutes in an order line, getting seated, then waiting another 30 minutes for food after we were seated. Why not just take names like every other restaurant and seat people as the table opens up? My thought is that you're standing in line right next to the display cases the whole time, when it's your turn to order, you've been eying that slice of cake, scone, or other baked dessert for so long that you have no choice but to order it. Will power won out this time - no scone for me!The food was decent and the service was also pretty good. I ordered a chicken salad sandwich, being more in the average category than extraordinary, I don't think I would get it again. Having to serve my own drink from the fountain, waiting in line for so long to just make our order, getting taunted by all the baked goods, the general chaos of the place, and me personally living so far away (in downtown PHX), I can honestly say I'm not going to be making this a destination for dining. If you're close by and it's not a weekend, I imagine this spot is a lot less hectic and easier to deal with.Happy Yelping Phoenix. See you on Yelp!Yet another great local restaurant brought into being by Joe Johnston (creator of Joe's Farm Grill and Joe's Real BBQ).  The place is built out of a revamped 1930's grocery store and is super cool inside!  They have a wood fire pizza oven (you'll see all this wood stacked outside on the patio -- adds to the cool ambience) and swanky espresso bar.  The bathrooms are pretty awesome too.Most all the food is amazing here.  The pizzas are really tasty, so much so that I never seem to have the self control to not order them and try something new.  If you're vegetarian or trying to eat more greens, try the veggie pizza -- made with local produce, whatever is freshly picked ends up as toppings!  Salads and sandwiches are also delicious.  And the dessert selection is always pretty great.  The only negatives are that the place can get incredibly busy at peak hours, so come early or be prepared to wait.  Also, food (entree, drink, dessert, etc.) adds up quick and can get kinda pricey here.  Another bummer is that the waitstaff won't seat you if your whole party isn't present, which has been an issue/hassle in the past when a large table was needed for a birthday party or special event but all the guests had yet to arrive.  Other than that though, it's wonderful!Come here on your birthday and get $10 towards your meal!After anxiously waiting several weeks to try this restaurant, I was not that impressed with meal. $39.35 for two people for breakfast...Holy Cow! We ordered:- Bacon Pancakes- Liberty Potatoes- Side of Eggs- Side of Sausage- Griddled Bread Pudding- Kir Royale Pro's:- Appreciated the ability to order my food before sitting down- You can see the chef's prepare the food in the open- Bacon Pancakes were awesome! Loaded with plenty pig! - Liberty Potatoes were well seasoned and on point!- Sausage was acceptable; not too salty, which I preferCons:- Major attitude was given when I POLITELY advised that my glass had apparent lipstick of sorts and NOT from my lips. The person tending the E61 Bar suggested that it wasn't ..... I DONT GIVE A DAMN WHAT IT IS, MY GLASS IS APPARENTLY DIRTY! The manager was not all that pleased that I brought it up either, but so what! I just paid $40 and expect stellar service and clean tableware.- Potatoes, eggs and sausage were brought out several mins before the main dish....uh, I prefer my entire meal at once and not in courses. - Griddled Bread Pudding was a bit soggy for my liking. - Kir Royale IMMEDIATELY gave me a headache; clear sign of cheap alcohol- The line was a tad bit long to place an order. I would expect if you're standing in line to order and pay that it would move along much quicker than 25 mins.While the menu had several items I would love to try, it will be quite a while before I revisit. I never place a dollar amount on a good meal however, I do prefer to get what I pay for. This was NOT a $40 breakfast!
Palo Verde Lounge=I know I'm not the first and I know I'm not the last person who has or will throw up at the Palo Verde on their 21st birthday.  I came in their already blind drunk and the bartender served me a gigantic, obscenely huge shot of Jagermesiter on the house.  Throwing up at the Palo Verde is hitting rock bottom.  It's like admitting to smoking crack before work.In case you've never been there before, here's the rundown:  It's disgusting.  There's a mop hanging up outside that's gotta be in the running for "Dirtiest Mop in Tempe," second only to a mop used for a murder scene... although I can't say for certain that the PV's mop hasn't done the same.The bathroom... my god.  One time I went in there, and there were flies on the toilet paper.  Once, I had diarrhea (I know! it was bad!) and some fat guy snorting cocaine sparked some conversation, "Man, I've been going to bars for 18 years, never had to shit in one before, though."  The bartenders are hilarious.  The one guy, Chuck, looks like he'd beat the shit out of you for wiping your nose wrong, but he's as nice as anyone I've ever met.  The drinks are stiff.  Ten bucks will get you more absinthe you know what to do with.  Chances are, you will stumble out of the PV, jump on your bicycle and wind up home somehow, giggling like a madman.I love it there.  I would give it five stars, but I had to surrender one due to the "punching machine," they installed and the classic rock that some douche-nozzle always puts on the jukebox.After a brief hiatus with the Palo Verde, I returned.  For a while there, I was seeing the same people time and time again and I feared that I was becoming a regular so for months I stayed away.I came back over the weekend and I'm glad I did.  When you go to the PV, sometimes there's a band playing.  Man, the PV does not need a band to be playing there.  The place is tiny.  When people are dancing and singing and what have ya, the temperature inside increases by maybe fifteen degrees.  The humidity raises.  It's disgusting. Other times, the place is just too crowded with douchebags who scream, "WHOOH!" each time they do a shot, and of course they won't just do one.  No.  If you say whooh, chances are you like saying it and you're going to use any and every opportunity to say it.  You'll take a shot to say it, you'll put a song on the jukebox you like or meet eyes with an attractive girl.  Whooh!Saturday night, I feared that maybe these two options were in effect.  But, no.  It was dead and I sat there for a few hours with my sister and my friend and we kicked back, watching Dinocroc and then Dinocroc VS Supergator.  Unfortunately we missed Supergator by itself but we did see the ultimate VERSUS match.  I shot the shit with the bartender/owner Chuck for a bit.  I asked him how much he thought the movie Dinocroc cost to make and he said, "I dunno... not as much as E.T., not as much as Star Wars, but probably more than.... Blair Witch?"Chuck told me one time he tried call Domino's Pizza because he had the number memorized.  He fucked up on two numbers and accidentally called 1-800-Condoms  I convinced him to call 1-800-pee-on-me and he did.  I saw his face sour and he was like, "Ah, man, nice sound effects...."It's a great bar.  I love going there, it's just such a nice, chill atmosphere and the drinks are dirt cheap.
Kona Grill=I really enjoy this place, and for a few reasons. 1) A great Happy Hour, and 2) some really good fusion food.They have a huge bar, a huge area for seating, and a decent size sushi bar.  I've eaten at all three areas and the service has been consistent.  There are a lot of standouts on the menu so you can get whatever you like and expect good food.  I've had excellent sushi and a noodle/beef stir fry that was out of this world.This is not fine dining but I'd go here again in a minute.  The decor is nuevo Japanese (if there is such a thing).  The hostesses and the waitresses are smoking hot.  I woulda loved to have them feed me the food, nothing like being pampered (damn, time to wake up).I really enjoy Kona Grill for every time I go I never seem to have a problem! Each time I go I stop and look at the beautiful fish in their large fish tanks, I always sit outside on their shaded spacious patio and the staff is always incredibly friendly. This time I ordered the Basil Pesto, which was magnificent! It's a mix of sausages, chicken, noodles and their creamy basil pesto sauce. The dish is very flavorful and exciting with a hint of spicy at the end! My son was able to enjoy the basic chicken tenders and fries which seem to always satisfy him, we were able to have a very nice lunch and each of us enjoyed our meals.This is a great place to come for lunch or dinner; they have a great bar to sit at if you are looking to come for drinks. The inside dining area is very classy and open, and if your in the mood for being outside they have high top table and regular tables to seat plenty. This place gets crowded on Friday and Saturday nights, but there is definitely a reason! Great food, great service and great drinks!Kona Grill at Chandler Fashion Center never disappoints!Kona Grill is a casual sophisticated restaurant and bar which is perfect for a date, a party or whatever. Although there are 4 Phoenix valley locations (Chandler Fashion Center, Scottsdale Fashion Square, High Street, Santan Village), I always eat at the Chandler location. Kona Grill is modern American cuisine prepared from scratch in their kitchens. They also have an impressive, extensive sushi menu with fresh fish flown in daily. Although there is an impressive full menu and sushi bar, I absolutely love their Happy Hour food & drink menu/hours. (see pics)Happy Hours:Mon - Fri 3pm - 7pmMon - Thur 9pm - 11pmFri/Sat 10pm - 12amSat 11am - 2pmSun ALL DAYDinning HoursMon - Thurs 11am - 10pmFri/Sat 11am - 11pmSun 11am - 10pmKona Grill is located at the Southeast corner of the Chandler Fashion Center at the entrance to the Village, directly across from the Harkins Theatre. Valet parking is available right in front of main entrance. For more information:KonaGrill.comI 5/5 highly recommend Kona Grill!
India Oven=I should've known this meal was hopeless when our waiter brought my dining companion non-alcoholic beer instead of the real thing.  Thankfully he did not make this mistake with the wine however it still puzzles me as to why he brought the bottle to the table for inspection but did not think to also bring an implement for opening it. The chicken tikka masala was almost passable but the assorted appetizers we ordered were pretty woeful. A tiny little plate of dried up little bites, almost indiscernible in flavor from one to the next.Suffice it to say, India Oven is not worth putting on your list of "must dine at" spots in Las Vegas!
Dragonfly Cafe=What a nice little place for breakfast! The boy and I made our first trip over to Dragonfly Cafe for our usual late Sunday morning breakfast (2:30ish by the time we got there) and were pleasantly surprised at how tasty the food was. The place is cute as a button inside and out with a quaint down home cozy atmosphere that you just don't get from a national chain restaurant. Looking over the menu, it was difficult to decide on what to try as so many things looked good. We finally decided on the daybreak breakfast sandwich and the cinnamon raisin french toast, and boy oh boy were they good! The sandwich was so fresh tasting and they must have picked the onions that day, because they were so flavorful and perfect in the sandwich. The potatoes that came on the side also had a nice flavorful garlicy taste to them and the french toast was pretty darn good too! And the best part of all is that they serve breakfast all day every day (except Monday's) so I know for sure that we will be back soon to sample more of this tasty menu at the Dragonfly Cafe!Decided to stop by for breakfast by myself one Sunday morning.  The reviews on Yelp were enticing, so I gave it a shot.  I ordered the Sonora Potato and Sausage Hash (Eggs, Potatoes, Hot Links, Chipotle, Garlic, Onions, Peppers) w/side of Sourdough Toast, $8.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nEyREad5GZd3RiEZA-Irpw?select=TKoW6UY1opAaH4wFxLkFpgI couldn't wait to take a bite of my dish as I love Hot Links and have never seen it in a Breakfast item before....it didn't disappoint, it was very good.  The Hot Link was actually spicy, which is often not the case.  The Potatoes were very tasty as well.  My only complaint was that it was kind of a small portion...I was left wanting more.My server was very friendly and welcoming.  She asked how I found the joint and addressed me by name when I left....very cool.Return Factor - 98%
Texas Roadhouse=I went here for a 'nice' steak dinner. however, i think 'nice' is actually 'bleh'.All I wanted was a big, fat hunk of delicious meat and some healthy vegetables. Apparently they have vegetables but I wouldn't call them healthy. They have green beans, and I'm sure they are delicious with all the butter and bacon they are cooked in but I am 100% sticking to my New Years resolution. I asked instead if I could have fresh green beans cooked by themselves. My waitress said NO.NO?! you mean you don't have fresh vegetables?Everything they have is already premade and nothing is fresh. GROSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!The steak was bland and I pretty much used an entire mound of salt for flavor. It ended up being like $20 bucks after tip. Totally ridiculous. I don't understand restaurants that don't use fresh vegetables and nothing can be cooked to order. that totally grosses me out. I will not be back. If I was by myself I would have left when I found out nothing was fresh, but I was with people and didn't want to insult them because one of them chose this place?I have to say this is one of my favorite steak places.Although you will fill up on Peanuts before you get to your meal if you are not careful/ It is a popular place to go. So many times there is a wait. We came here on Monday fairly early ,so we got a booth right away.This time I got the Rib eye and Ribs. I usually try to stay away from pork. But, everyone raves about them so I wanted to try them. Divine!However, The steak was awful! It was cooked very perfectly. But, it was full of gristle, not something I would expect from and $20.00 dinner. I took most of it home to the dog and I had to cut it into small bits for her. But, she loved it!Most every other time I have been here the food has been great! So this one time is just that , One time.Vegetables are really good as well as the potato.We all know the bread is great(rolls) but, not gluten free. Great staff, clean place.Tons of parking outside as well.
5 & Diner=Thanks to Derek r.'s review, I thought I'd add my $.02.  It's been awhile since I last dined here (at least a couple of years), as I try to support non-chain restaurants these days, but I enjoyed the few dining experiences here, solo and w/ relatives.  Servers were always friendly and efficient.  Tables, chairs, booths, and women's restroom were clean.If you're one to check out those mailers that arrive in your mailbox from time to time, you'll know that 5 & Diner usually has BOGO offers on there (buy one, get one).   Years ago ('03, '04?), this very location sold, during Christmas season, upcoming new year calendars that had cute 50's theme pics.  Each month's page offered coupons such as BOGO, free children's entree with paying adult, or a free shake w/ an entree.  Does anyone know if this promotion is still running every Christmas season?Had an awesome time here at breakfast.Its an old school diner.  Juke boxes at the table and everything!We got the breakfast special which was 3 pancakes, 2 eggs, 2 bacon and hash browns.  It was only $3.99!  I got a heath bar shake and my buddy got coffee.  The heath bar shake was awesome!  They hook it up too by that they give you the shake, plus the leftovers in the metal shake container.  So its like 2 shakes in one.  It was kind of hard to suck through the straw because they put sooooooo much heath bar in there but I wasn't complaining......I love heath bars!  The service was awesome and our waiter was really nice!  Cool vibe, good food and low prices make this one of the best diners I have ever been in!
BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse=I came here with my co-workers for a team lunch. We do this every quarter and decided come here cause they can handle large parties and they have a big variety menu. When we got here our table was already setup and once we sat down our server was really quick to provide us with our drinks. I ordered the California Burger. I thought that this was really good. Bursting with flavor. The burger was on a grilled sourdough bread with avocado, green chilies, pepper jack cheese, chipotle mayo, and ranch. Burger was very moist and perfect. It came with shoestring fries. Half the plate was filled with fries. It was a huge lunch meal but really worth it. As for the service, our server was always checking on us. Refilling our drinks and clearing the empty plates. We even had the manager come by to make sure everything was okay. It seemed like they really cared for us. So overall, I would say that we had a really enjoyable time. We had a table over 10 people and the service and food came out in a reasonable time. The only regret was that I didn't order their Pizookie. Those are so good. Enjoy...5-star Happy Hour!  We had a bunch of beverages and a bunch of food for 35 bucks!  Can you believe that?  The bartender...I think his name is Geoffrey...took great care of us.  Next time we need to leave room for a pizookie.  That Harvest Hefeweizen is so good it took me back to old Bavaria AND made me blaspheme.  Now that's a great beer!  We always enjoy stopping in at BJ's.
Rice To-Go=I drive past this place constantly but never really hear about it- good or bad. Finally stopped in for takeout and was impressed with the quality and selection of dishes. Cafeteria-style ready-made dishes available as well as a large menu for fresh-made food, takeout is their specialty but they do have a few tables to dine-in as well.SALT AND PEPPER PORK CHOP: Gigantic portion, flavorful and good quality cuts of pork. Wish there were a bit more peppers and onions for added flavor.SINGAPORE NOODLE: This is more or less a combination pan fried noodle dish with veggies, chicken, bbq pork, and shrimp, along with tons of veggies and noodles. Portion size can easily feed two.BOKCHOY AND BLACK MUSHROOM: Simple but good, generous portion.BEEF & PORK SHUMAI: Better than expected, and much larger than other versions elsewhere at dim sum specialty places. Bit less flavorful than expected but still better quality than most would associate with the location appearance.Most dishes are a flat $9, their ready-made combination meals are also really affordable. Service is polite and prompt, if the order takes a bit longer than expected they may tuck in a few Hong Kong donuts in your order gratis.
Cracker Barrel Old Country Store=I have eaten at Cracker Barrel once or twice before (long ago), and just had to visit one before heading back home to Los Angeles where we don't have any nearby.It is a store with lots of knick-knacks and a restaurant with good old-fashion country food.There are a bunch of rocking chairs you will see as you walk down the long porch/patio to the front door.  There are some for sale.  Such a cool country feel to it.  Sit a spell and relax.  You can play checkers while you wait.  We had to wait for our entire party to arrive before we could put our name on the list to be seated.  Once they arrived, we were seated rather quickly.They were busy and our food arrived at the table cold.  We had 7 in our party.  The service was okay, I think our waitress was there and then disappeared and then reappeared later on.  My husband ordered a breakfast combo with scrambled eggs, sausage, & hashed browns.  It was rather basic.  I got the Blueberry Pancakes, they were really, really, really delicious!  They bring out individual bottles of maple and blueberry syrups.  I got the blueberry syrup and was surprised that the syrup contained real blueberries!  It was deliciously awesome!  My daughter ordered french toast with maple syrup.  If the food had arrived promptly to the table, it would have been ideal!  When you are ready to settle your bill, you have to take the ticket to the cashiers in the store to pay.The store is full of cute things!  There were a few items I would have bought, but I restrained!  The pig salt & pepper holder was cute!  I would have liked to taste the Divinity although it would not compare to my mother-in-law's fresh divinity!!  They had their Easter items out as well as a religious section of goodies.  There was a big poster announcing the sale of the new Casting Crowns CD, which I thought was rather neat.  If I ever return to this Cracker Barrel, I sure hope the food is hot when it is brought out to the table!  I should have told the manager when she walked by and asked us how things were.  We asked for more syrups and she then went and had the waitress bring them out.  I guess she herself doesn't get things for guests.  I was really hoping this would warrant 5-stars, but it just didn't measure up.
Hamburger Hut 'N' Market=ANOTHER GREAT FIND FOR MY HOLE IN THE WALL PLACES LIST!Based on some of the reviews I read, the wings, fried chicken, hot links, and catfish were all highly recommended.So I ordered wings and catfish. Originally I wanted to order fried chicken as well but they told me that they had just run out. From what I heard, their fried chicken is so good that they usually run out. Ok, so why don't they fix that? Anyways, the wings were decent. Your choices were mild, medium, spicy, and barbeque. The catfish was really good. It had that perfect blend of batter and cornmeal. Nice and juicy too. Next time I hope I can come early enough to try their fried chicken.Now when you go to this place, they are situated in their own building in between an apartment complex on the right and a convenience store on the left. Parking is rather small and on busy occasions, you might just have to park down the street somewhere. When you finally make it inside, you will notice that they are basically a convenience store that just happens to serve burgers, wings, fried chicken, catfish, and many others that looks appetizing. You have about 4 decent tables and if you're lucky, you are able to sit at one of them if you are not gonna take your food to go. Yes, they take cards and I dont remember seeing any signs of a minimum amount so I guess that's a good thing. Their bathroom is all the way in the back and it's not all that obvious. You kinda have to do a little bit of exploring before you can find it.I hate to say it, but the actual appearance of the place looks rather ghetto. But the food and the service they provide is quite remarkable. If they had a better location and make up they would be making some serious money.So in closing, my advice would be to call ahead for a pick up order and if there is a table available then by all means, go ahead and eat there. As for their menu, you really have to be there if its your first time and some parts of their menu are not all that clear.  4 stars for the food and 2 stars for the location so 3 stars it is for me.
Marcello's Pasta Grill=RUN, RUN, RUN AWAY FROM MARCELLO'S!!!!!!!!!!!!! I have to say that I absolutely had one of the worst dining experiences of my entire life at this place. It was surreal!Let me explain. Years ago, my sister, a friend and I went here for dinner. We were seated in what was at the time an empty dining area. We waited for the server, none ever came. We waited longer, still no server to take our drink order. After about 20 minutes we stood up and left. Since that time I had no interest in going back.Then a groupon showed up... OK, so maybe I'll chalk it up to it just being an off night years ago. Tonight my sister and my nephew decided to go and use the groupon. I arrived first and was quickly seated by a very nice young man. Our server, Cheryl came over a few minutes later and took my drink order, I had the Sangria. Cheryl was very nice but seemed a little either nervous or out of sorts. No problem we all have off days. (However, side note to Cheryl: If you are in the service industry you really should keep your perfumes to minimum as it can be extremely overpowering and offsetting especially when serving food!) Cheryl brought me the Sangria and the water as requested. Good Sangria however, nothing really special... basically a sweet red wine with an orange slice. Certainly none of the layers of flavors you expect with Sangria. Decent start. My sister and nephew arrived and both ordered waters. Here's where it starts to get odd. Cheryl brings the waters back and sets down another Sangria in front of my sister. She then states that "it's sort of a freebie, I'm not sure where it came from so you can have it." She then asks if we are ready to order, we ask for a few minutes. She then looks up at the table two over from us and says: "Oh, I just remembered where this goes." She proceeds to pick up the glass and take it to the next table and serve it. 1) Weird, right? 2) Health code violation? 3) Rude? She comes back several minutes later and explains the specials (well 3 out of 7 specials we later find out) and we ask for a few minutes. Honestly, we were trying to see what the better deal was for our dollar. Groupon vs. 40% off Early Bird discount vs Dinner for two combo for $29.95. Cheryl returns and takes our order. Appetizer: EGGPLANT MARCELLOEggplant stuffed with cheese, served in a marinara sauce with caper and topped with melted mozzarella cheese $7.95Entree 1: RIGATONI VODKAEntree 2: CHICKEN PAILLARD(sub the pasta for a side of green beans $2.95 up charge)Entree 3: FETTUCINI ALFREDOAs we were waiting for the appetizer a fairly familiar scent from my youth wafted in our direction. I asked my sister if she smelled it also and she confirmed, smells like the kitchen staff is smokin' a lil weed in the back. I get how the restaurant industry works and honestly I don't mind as long as the food and service is good.Appetizer came out... It was OK...nothing special... had that previously frozen taste. Entrees came out... Entree 1: The Rigatoni Vodka was soupy and tasteless... extremely bland. I decided I wasn't going to eat it. Entree 2: One bite into the chicken and my sister decided that she wasn't going to eat it. It really should have been served in a bowl with as much "sauce" as it was in. I took a bite and agreed... the chicken was tough and bland and her whole plate was greasy... including the green beans. Entree 3: Does Chef boy-ardee make fettucini alfredo now? My nephew ate about half of it because he was starving but left the rest and didn't ask for a box. Just not good... you could tell that it is not made in house and again was very bland. I had enough and when Cheryl returned explained that we were not happy and asked for the manager. Mark showed up and we explained the situation. I mentioned the sangria incident, gave him a bit of advice in that if his staff was going to smoke weed they should really shut the back door so that the patrons do not have to smell it and final explained that we were not happy with the food. His immediate reaction was to say that "no one was smoking marijuana in the establishment." Whatever. I know what I smelled. He then offered to exchange the food. We explained that we were happy to pay for the drink, the appetizer and my nephews food but were not interested in trying anything else. Cheryl arrives with the bill. Surprise, surprise! It's wrong. (we went with the 40% discount but where charged full price). My sister explained the error and Cheryl corrected it. I provided my card to pay the total for the 3 items (w/the discount $19.26). When she returned she had only charged my card $4.95. She asked for my card again. I refused and asked for the manager again. Worthless. Bad food and incompetence do not make for a good dining experience. But hey... I did get the evil eye from the old lady that may be the owner... so that was fun!  :)Don't put yourself through this when there are so many better places out there!
Arriba Mexican Grill=There are so many choices for Mexican food in our neighborhood.  We've passed by this place more than once and finally decided to stop by and give it a try.  There is a lot of influence from New Mexico here and it's evident by the use of Hatch Chile in many of the menu items.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/y2e1DgIUBlERep7hrKz2-w?select=jR0gwZgN7GK1O0Spel1N_gAfter browsing the menu, we ordered:Hatch Chile Cheese Crisp (Fried Tortilla topped w/melted Cheese & Hatch Chile)White Sands Chimichanga (Spicy Pork Green Chile covered w/Queso Fundido)http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/y2e1DgIUBlERep7hrKz2-w?select=Ev2eduloh_wsuBGoRq9xDQThe Hatch Chile Cheese Crisp was pretty good, but the Tortilla wasn't cooked all the way and was still soft....not crispy as it should be.The White Sands Chimichanga was simply awesome!  The Queso Fundido made this dish taste soooo good.The service was pretty good.  They have craft beer on tap and I wanted to sample some before I decided....the server brought out a few tasting glasses for me to try.  I thought that was cool.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/y2e1DgIUBlERep7hrKz2-w?select=8pgTu034N-xFslG8NGjn7wOverall, it was a decent experience.  I wasn't blown away by the food, but it is definitely worth coming back to try other items on the menu.Return Factor - 80%The only way I would ever eat here again is if..... 1. Every restaurant in the world has closed except Arriba 2. I died and was reincarnated with no taste buds 3. I'd just smoked some chronic and had already finished off all the moldy stuff in my fridge 4. I was a rat. 5. I was a cockroach. 5a. I was a  rat who'd eaten a cockroach and wanted to get the taste out of its        mouth. 6. I was King or Emperor or something, wielding enough power to have the head chef tortured if he fucked up my meal. 7. Roadkill no longer existed. 8. There was a nuclear holocaust and for some strange reason, this was the only     place left standing. 9. I'd just been released from a mental hospital.10. My in-laws were visiting from the east coast and wanted to 'try some really good Mexican'.11. I lost a bet.12. I needed to get out going to church, blaming  'food poisoning' as the culprit.13. I'd just landed the role of surly waiter in a major Hollywood film, and needed to       practice the part by understudying the real thing.14. I was into philanthropy and accustomed to the idea of throwing money away.15. I was on my deathbed, and my family refused to honor my living will by not      pulling the plug on me. I'd ask them to take me here for one more meal where I'd      die on the spot.My waiter was a major sphincter, telling us about the happy hour Margarita for 4.99 when a moment later, he informed the couple in the next booth of their 'famous' 99 cent margarita. I want my four bucks back.When I ordered the taco salad for 9.99, trying to be helpful, he suggested I order the salad on the next page..the one for 11.99. I did. It came with cold chicken tasting as though it had been boiled. The lettuce was layered with gobs of sour cream and featured rust spots. I ate about two bites before sending it back. Arriba, between its sphinct-o-waiter and the god-awful, overpriced food, was so bad, if I had to compare it with shit, shit would win.  Even some rare form of shit only found on the bottom of the ocean, left there by some deep sea creature who's never been photographed. Please tell all your snowbird friends about this place.Friend raved about the margaritas here, so we checked out Arriba's for dinner last night.  I'd called ahead to ask if Arriba's makes their sour mix from scratch- it does.  I also inquired about happy hour-- from 3p to 7p, and reverse HH from 9p to closing, 12 oz. house margaritas are $0.99 each!  There's a short list of apps at 50% off, as well.He wanted to try the "margarita for two" on the rocks, as he's tried the house margarita on previous occasions.  Presentation was nice, and it tasted very good- not obnoxiously strong and not cloyingly sweet. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/arriba-mexican-grill-scottsdale?select=ZuAE6ZAXVIeGNKKMWbJogw#ZuAE6ZAXVIeGNKKMWbJogw  $7 during happy hour, which I thought was a steal, since the last time I shared a margarita that big (with sister) was at one of the restaurants on the San Antonio's touristy River Walk-- the margarita was $14!  Our drink last night had a LOT of ice, though, so we'll have to request for less ice next time, and there will BE a next time.  :)  Our server also suggested guacamole and chips, or a queso fundido app, so I chose the latter.  We both loved the cheese dip, despite the fact that my friend hates tomatoes and there were tomatoes mixed into the fondue. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/arriba-mexican-grill-scottsdale?select=fVPVC3W4MQx5SNDyVN1QMw#fVPVC3W4MQx5SNDyVN1QMw  The fondue/fundido also came with a dollop of chorizo.  I appreciated its spiciness, but found it too salty.  Due to my corn allergy, I requested for fried flour tortilla chips for dipping, and thankfully, the kitchen obliged!  Awesome service, so far, which reminds me kudos to our server Chance! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/arriba-mexican-grill-scottsdale?select=F8pySbJ7wQ_z3O5Bj-u5eQ#F8pySbJ7wQ_z3O5Bj-u5eQ  Friend didn't enjoy the flour tortilla chips as much as I did, so he asked for regular corn tortilla chips, and again, Chance and kitchen gratified.My friend was going to order the enchiladas, and I told him I was going to try Arriba's pollo con queso.  He's had it before, so he decided that we'd just share the entree.  Fine by me, since I don't ever finish an entree at the restaurant, anyway.  (I always take leftovers home.)  The entree was a deep-fried chicken burrito, split three-ways, and smothered with three different cheeses. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/arriba-mexican-grill-scottsdale?select=hzYXTqkmjXz9IOQ-AjgVoA#hzYXTqkmjXz9IOQ-AjgVoA  I don't know what kind of cheeses, and the menu online does not state what they are, but I liked the white variety the best- it's a softer cheese, which equals meltier, creamier, more sensual cheese to me!  He liked one of the dark yellow cheeses.  Will have to get more info on our next visit.  I wonder if I may order this dish with just the one type of cheese?  Hmm... further investigation of the menu is needed!  ;)My friend doesn't have a sweet tooth, and none of the desserts really caught my eye last night, except perhaps the ones with ice cream; However, Arriba uses Good Humor ice cream, and these contain corn syrup, so I must say no.  Only the best, for the most part, para mi, por favor!Can't wait to take Mom here.  I've already told her about the dinner and shown her the photos, and she looks very interested.  :D
Lox, Stock & Bagel=4/11/11It's been so long since I could enjoy bagels, since most are made w/ corn syrup and/or other additives and preservatives, that when I found out a couple of weeks ago, via online inquiry, that the bagels here aren't made w/ cornmeal, cornstarch, corn syrup, or baking powder, I knew I had to try this place!  By sheer luck, the day after the email notification came through, I was able to take advantage of a groupon for LSaB!  (However, that will have to wait another time to be used.)  As if I needed a third excuse to try this cafe, I found out that this venue is in the vicinity of where I work.  How lucky am I??After a bit of adventure locating this place using the Yelp mapping directions, and then driving around the busy complex looking for a spot, I entered the cafe.  It seemed like luck was on my side again, bec. this place got busy right after I placed my order.  (BTW, business is still brisk as I'm typing this review!)  I couldn't decide what to try, so I decided to do two bagels: a French toast (w/ maple syrup and bacon bits baked in!) w/ honey-whipped peanut butter (Skippy-brand), and a sesame seed bagel w/ Nova lox cream cheese.  I asked that half of the bagels be toasted for me to eat here, so that I may take the other halves to-go.  No problem, said owner Michelle, and she gave me the spreads "on the side," so that I may have leftovers to take w/ me, as well.  I really like the personable service here, and I appreciate the patience and consideration shown to me by both Michelle and her employee in looking up ingredients for me.  Spotting the book I was holding (Picoult's Sing You Home), Michelle asked me if I was enjoying it (yes!), as she had just finished reading it herself last night.  Did I know that Picoult visits LSaB when she's in town??  What an interesting day that would be for me if I were to run into her on a future visit!  :)Anyhoo, to make a long story as short as possible, I will say that I enjoyed the bagels so much, that I decided to try a third one- the wholegrain whole wheat bagel (again, half to-go), and I also ordered a small coffee.  Michelle uses the local roaster Espressions, which I was happy to hear since I have enjoyed Espressions in the past.  The wholegrain wheat bagel is definitely more dense than the other two, which were made w/ white flour.  LSaB also offers a fluffier honey whole wheat bagel made w/ a whole wheat and white flour blend.  Since I already had the sugar in the honey-whipped peanut butter to contend w/, I decided to go w/ the denser oatmeal-topped wholegrain bagel, which indeed was heartier and chewier than the other two- I liked it!Can't wait to return, w/ or w/out the groupon!(FYI, the bacon served here is from a local distributor, and while it doesn't contain celery juice/salt, it does contain cornstarch-- corn allergy sufferers beware.)
Morton's The Steakhouse=I have been racking my brain to think of nice things to say about Morton's:* They plastic wrap they use on the "selection tray" is very shiny:)* They have single malt scotch:)* The lighting is very low if you have light sensitivity problems:)* The steaks are better than the steaks at Lonestar or Outback or the buffet at Eagles Nest in the casino:)I want to say something nice, because that's how I was raised.But I'm having trouble.Was the food really bad?...Well, no it wasn't a horror show...although medium rare isn't that hard to achieve...I shouldn't have to put up with an over cooked steak (I don't like to send food back when dining with clients...doesn't send the right message)Was the service inept or ill-mannered?...Not really, although being asked if everything is "to my liking" after every third bite can become cloying (I suppose it's in the manual somewhere:)Was the bill really that bad?...Well, my prospective clients actually took me to dinner, so I didn't pay, but I did see the bill...$460 for the three of us, so not as much as some but for that kind of dough I do expect a better meal:)Morton's seem to have become the McDonald's of steakhouses (as contrasted with Ruth's Chris...the Burger King of steakhouses:)They are safe...You won't get the wildly uneven results that you'll find with say...a Mastro's location:)You always know where the toilet is:)...and the bar:)...and the coat room:)...and etc.:)You always know where the rib-eye is located on the "selection tray":)But the preparation of the food is pedestrian, the presentation is uninspired, the sides are uninspiring and the whole feel is formulaic and dated:(I do expect more at this price point and Morton's just doesn't deliver these days:(So, just like MickieD's, I only go to Morton's these days, when I am dragged (or is it "drugged":)Are there worse dining experiences?...oh you bet...we could still be dealing with The Pink Taco:)Bought by corporate Landry's (and the Camelback location closed) this former steak giant is headed south, and fast.What do you think about when you think, "Morton's"?--strangely tan vinyl booths (yes, I've seen them in Chicago, and I finally get it)--sinatra standards--bow ties--to be shown what a beefsteak tomato looks like (from the cart)--to be shown what a life lobster looks like (the poor kiddo)--to be shown what a porterhouse looks like (oh, YUM)--crabcakes--AND THE BEST DARNed steak you can get in town, _no matter the cut_--don't forget the sprigs of watercress, my favorite.But Landry's isn't having it. A multi-million dollar brand is taking a new direction:#no more Sinatra#no more cart#maitre'd has no tux#limited Champagne options; $160 Tatt is a plain ripoff.Steakhouses are a dime-a-dozen these days and with Eddie V's nearby putting on the Ritz with live jazz and magnums of the Heitz Martha's Vineyard _besides great steaks_, Landry's Morton's won't be here for long.
Best Hong Kong Dining=Whenever I crave Chinese food, which is often because I AM Chinese, I hop in my car and drive 27.1 miles down to this place for several reasons.1) It's authentic.2) It tastes reliably great every time I go.3) There isn't another Chinese place on the north side of town that serves anything comparably good.I know the young college kid/busboy/waiter that Madi D. mentioned and yeah, there are times when he's a little space brained but it's not intentional and for the most part, he's pretty attentive to customers.  So yeah, the service may not be a 5 but once you get to know the people working there, they take care of you.  While I agree that it shouldn't matter because a patron is a patron but still - this is just how it is... My favorite dishes from this place include:* Eggplant and garlic sauce* Beef stew* Porridge* Salty fish & chicken fried rice* Four season beans* Beef noodles* Bitter melonIt's all very tasty and believe me, I wouldn't drive over 50 miles round trip several times a week just so I could yelp about it later.  I've brought many friends and family here and will continue to do so in the future because it's just that damn good.If you see me there, feel free to introduce yourself, you can tell if I'm there because my oil dripping car will be in the parking lot (read my review for Right Toyota!).Cheers!cProbably my mother's favorite place for siu laap!  Since she lives in Glendale, I'm often asked to be the delivery gal to bring her roasted duck, boiled chicken with the head still on, and roasted pork whenever she needs to do some Chinese ceremonial tradition.  If it's not me she's forcing to do the grunt work, it's one of her co-workers.  Regardless, even if it's on the east side, it will always show up to Mommy W. fresh!I first came across this place when my friend invited us out for dinner.  It seemed to have all your Americanized and authentic foods.  Service can be a bit of a wait but it's definitely worth your time.  Kudos to the chef for making such amazing flavorful food.  Prices are reasonable and the place is clean.  I haven't tried any of their lunch specials but my friend says they're pretty decent.  They make a delicious Mussels with Black Bean Sauce and their Salt & Pepper Shrimp is pretty amazing as well.  And there's nothing like some rice soup [aka porridge] when you want something warm.  It's the Asian chicken noodle soup [comfort food].  I stick with either the pork with the century egg or the fish fillet porridge.  Momma W. makes it best but Best Hong Kong Dining is a close second.  The only reason why I don't frequent here as often as I should is because parking is always a pain.  There are some other eateries and a grocery store in this strip plaza so parking can be pretty sketchy.  You know us Asian drivers.  Look out!  :P
The New Frontier=How simple, yet intricate can a country breakfast be? What makes it different than a breakfast you would make yourself, or grab in the city? Is it because it's made with love, made with lots of fat, or is it because you're not in a rush to eat it? Probably all of the above. I was starving and taking a drive with Mr. Hottie and Erin. We were passing through Wickenburg and I wanted breakfast. I suggested we stop at a cafe we passed. When we walked in, it seemed as though the whole town of Wickenburg was in the cafe! It was packed and hopping full of locals. We city slickers seemed to stick out like sore thumbs. Oh well, no matter, we were greeted warmly. An adorable old man gestured for Mr. Hottie to come over and lend an ear. He told him that if we were thinking of leaving, to "wait. This is the best breakfast". Soon after, a table cleared out. We were greeted by a very friendly waitress who gave us time to look over the menu after taking our drink orders. I always want a little of everything when I go to breakfast. I decided on a bacon cheddar omelet with a side of hashbrown, and sausage gravy and one pancake..whew! I don't mess around with breakfast, my friends! I sipped on my OJ and played black jack (cards are at the table) with my breakfast partners. It wasn't very long until our food arrived. My OJ was refilled and my hot, steamy food was delivered. My omelet was FLUFFY and full of cheese and bacon! The hashbrowns were fresh cut, and well cooked. I was a happy girl. I poured the sausage gravy over the top of the omelet. PURE PURE HEAVEN!! This is THE BEST sausage gravy I have EVER had. I wanted to spoon it into my mouth! The sausage wasn't fatty (chunks of fat mixed with meat), it was flavorful with just a hint of spice. The gravy was also seasoned well. My pancake was HUGE. It was bigger than a regular sized dinner plate and fluffy! Oh my goodness it was so good! Of course I didn't finish my food, but I surely tried! I think I waddled out of the restaurant! We didn't eat anything else until we got back into Phoenix around 7pm if that tells you how filling and delicious our breakfasts were! I'm looking forward to the next road trip that takes me back to the New Frontier Cafe! The service was great and the food was delicious!
Siamese Kitchen=I really should explore not-so-attractive strip malls more because some of them have hidden gems like this one. After you are seated by the gracious hostess, you will have the challenging task of choosing from so many tempting dishes listed in the menu. The food is VERY flavorful, the curries really rich (watch for the heat, though; even "mild" packs a respectable kick), and the prices are great! Four and a half stars, probably going up to five with future visits.Who would have thought that such a hole-in-the-wall spot in a semi-suspect location would have such great food?  Luckily, my fellow yelpers pointed me in the right direction, since I never would have stumbled upon this gem on my own.Since I was dining with a group, I was able to sample a wide variety of items, and my stomach was so happy for the variety.  The many appetizers I tried were delicious.  I particularly enjoyed the papaya salad, Thai toast, and fried tofu bites.  For dinner, we had the veggie curry and pineapple fried rice.  Both were delicious, well-seasoned, and made perfect leftovers the next day.Despite the drive, this has moved into the top spot on my Thai take-out list.  Be sure to be patient if you come with a large group - there is only one server and one cook.  However, if you don't mind a leisurely pace (and perhaps refilling your own water), the food will make you smile!I came to Siamese Kitchen with 19 other Yelpers and we plowed through much of the menu and overwhelmed the kitchen but they were gracious and didn't mind when I jumped in to help clear tables and keep the food moving.Wow, that was a run-on sentence.Overall the food was really good and the service was good as well.  They did have a hard time keeping up (as most restaurants would when 20 people order at once) but were good natured about some of us jumping in now and then to bus tables or refill water.I really enjoyed the Yellow curry although I would order it hotter next time.  Dottsy ordered her pad thai hot and the leftovers came home with me...too hot for most.All of the dishes I tried (7-8) were nice and flavorful.I will keep Siamese Kitchen in mind for lunch when I'm in the neighborhood, good stuff and good prices.
Rae's Restaurant & Lounge=You know, I'm surprised over these other reviews.Sure the layout is bit awkward, the lighting is always a tad bad, and the negotiations needed to grab a table is a bit disappointing, but I do love me some Rae's.First off, it's a Bar and Grill.  And it's always pretty empty when I'm there.  The owner/lady is always sitting in the same booth going over whatever owners/ladies do in a restaurant.  I don't know if it's unprofessional, but it is a little poor in taste seeing her on a phone with stacks of paperwork in front of her - and it's one of the first things I saw.I've frequented this place dozens of times because the food, despite the fact that it's a Bar and Grill, is severely underrated.  I've had the chicken fingers, the taco salad, the tuna melt, the hamburger (with bleu cheese crumbles is the way to go), the fish and chips, and prime rib:  all are very good.  All are well flavored.  Put it this way: I've never had something here I didn't like a lot.Speed of service isn't terrible, but it can work in your favor if you have nowhere to be.  A gripe here is the cups.  They are so small (12 ounces-ish) that I feel like I'm at the kid's table.  Wouldn't be a problem if A) I wasn't thirsty ever again or B) the waitress was more attentive.All of this to say:  Is it my favorite place?  No.  Would I want to frequent it every day?  No.  But based on how close I do work to Rae's, it's not bad.  And I usually leave there (despite the atmosphere and mediocre service) pretty satisfied.  Try it out?  Could be good.
Chinatown Express Restaurant=This place is hit or miss. Sometimes the food can be superb and sometimes it could be just average. I do have to say that I do come here every now and then for my Taiwanese food fix. My usual suspects as far as dishes ordered here are the 3 cup chicken, braised fish, pork with chives and bean curd, various cold dishes and noodle dishes. Not a bad spot to eat usually.
Subway=I was running some Errands out in Gilbert and it was far past lunch time. So I thought, I will stop at the next place I see.There it was Subway located inside a strip mall. As soon as I walked in I noticed how clean it was. There were several customers inside and it was nicely decorated.I really do not know how long it has been there since I do not get out here too often. But, now with all the new building it is getting very busy out in these parts.Anyway, Vijay was my sandwich maker. He did a great job. One thing they do not carry Gluten Free, which is something I think everyone should go to now. I got the Philly Steak Sandwich and you can get anything you want on it which I think is great!  He even toasted it for me. Napkins are not out so you have to ask for them.  I keep noticeing this in a lot of places. I don't know why, but I hate not having enough.  However, he gave me more and I was on my way. Food tasted fresh and that is all I ask for.Lots of parking in the lot. I wish they still did the punch cards for Subway, but I know that went away a long time ago.
Chipotle Mexican Grill=When my brother and our friend Ron asked if I wanted to join them for lunch today, I said yes before I realized where they were going... I was super hungry! Although I've been to Chipotle just a couple of times before, I have to say, I'm not as big a fan as everyone else seems to be.  Reason being - both their corn relish and chunky salsa have a ton of onions in them... yuck!But, I was hungry and needed some quick fuel, so I decided to tag along with the boys. I will admit, that for fast food, Chipotle doesn't seem so bad.  I ordered the chicken salad and although I would've liked some corn or tomato salsa without onions, the rest of the options were tasty; especially the guac!I will agree with Zack that Steve, the new GM, and Sam, his apprentice, treated us like VIPs.  Never before have I been approached by the GM at a fast food restaurant like that.  (Then again, I rarely eat fast food).  Needless to say, it was impressive. If I need some quick food, I won't hesitate to return to Chipotle, it grew on me quite a bit today!When I'm craving Mexican Food, I always get tempted by Chipotle to stop by and grab a Steak Burrito.  That's exactly what happened a couple of weeks ago....I couldn't shake the image of a delicious Steak Burrito, so I dropped by this location to satisfy my craving.When I arrived, there were 6 people ahead of me however it didn't take too long for the line to move.  I ordered my usual here....Steak Burrito w/Rice, Pinto Beans, Cheese, Guacamole, Sour Cream, and the Spiciest Salsa.It only took a few seconds after sitting down for me to take a bite.....yep, it was just as good as I had imagined.  My all day craving was finally satisfied!  Needless to say, I devoured that bad boy in no time.Overall, it was a pleasant experience at Chipotle.  I like this location and will definitely return.Return  Factor - 95%I love Chipotle. I can eat it everyday if I could. I've been going to this location pretty much since I moved into my house and their service and quality of food have gotten worse. Last time I was here I wanted guacamole in my bowl. They were out of it. I simply asked if they meant for now or they're going to make more for the entire evening. The girl looked at me like I was crazy and didn't understand what I meant because I had to repeat myself three times. I came back today to get a bowl for myself and a steak burrito for boyfriend. After they did the burrito, as they came to my bowl, they were out of both steak and white rice. I told them I don't even want it then. Note to chipotle, order/ make enough food to last you the entire day. Half the line behind me walked out. Distance doesn't matter at this point because I won't be back to waste my time if they don't even have half the items I want in my bowl.Definitely nothing wrong with this location per se. Standard Chipotle decor, food and quality of food. I've never had a bad experience coming here and I have to admit I frequent Chipotle quite often. (We don't have this chain in Hawaii and there's just something about it that keeps me coming back for more.)I'm a fan of the chicken burrito bowl with brown rice (with my tortilla on the side sometimes) with extra lettuce and corn salsa yummm!My only gripe is the parking lot. It takes quite a few twists and turns to get into the parking lot from Sunset and once in the lot, it's a little narrow so I usually like parking further away and walking those few extra steps.
Landry's Seafood=We came here for a business lunch. The restaurant was completely empty so we had our choice of seating and opted for a booth. Our server greeted us immediately and took our drink order. They have a happy hour special 3-7pm daily for those looking to imbibe and enjoy small bites. We ordered off the regular lunch menu. I had their lobster bisque which was very underwhelming. I will always and forever love Brio's lobster bisque. As my entree I had FRESH CATCH PONTCHARTRAIN - broiled tilapia fillets, lump blue crab, mushroom ragoût, white wine cream sauce; rice pilaf & broccoli crown. I thought it was very well prepared and delicious, especially for it being tilapia. I also sampled some of their fish and chips and Shrimp Jambalaya and decided that my option was by far the tastiest. Unless a client insists on lunch or dinner here, I would not come back. It is not cheap and the food quality and taste do not warrant the price.
Hawaiian Hale=As Karen K says in her review of this restaurant, this address is WRONG!**** Yelp has since changed the address! Now you can all find your way to ONO! *** BUT, boy can I say that although this place hasn't gotten much attention on Yelp, it's certainly gotten enough attention to stay open for 15 years! I had a short but friendly conversation with the older man who works there. (I'm sure he's probably one of the owners OR SOMETHING, and I thought it was cute he was in a shirt, slippahz and shorts!) They are closed on Mondays, which is an odd day, but at least they are available for Sunday church-goers! The menu is extensive, and they have pictures of almost everything they serve up on the walls, along with some interesting pictures and a few local articles. The food is amazing and portions are generous! It is Local/Hawaiian style food from a hole-in-the-wall mom & pop sort of place, so don't expect wonderful presentation or anything, but the taste is definitely there. In fact, they have some of the best mac salad I've tried... WAAAAY better than L&L's hands down! I've been there twice, and have had a chance to eat the Sweet & Sour Spare Ribs, THEY FALL RIGHT OFF THE BONE! and taste just like home... MMM and the second time I went I had the Beef Sukiyaki! It was much bigger than what most Japanese restaurants would serve and it came with rice. My boyfriend had the Combo Adobo the first time. He preferred the chicken Adobo over the pork, and the second time we went, he had the special that came with Lomi-Lomi Salmon, Kalua Pig, & Lau Lau. EVERYTHING WAS GREAT! Also, the both times we've went large families have come in and dined as well. I'm talking about 15-20 people all at once! They also got taken care of well, considering that there is one cook, and one server. Amazing how they handle themselves!If I lived closer to this, I'd definitely be getting take out more often... but I'd say it is worth the drive, regardless. If you're looking for some "local kine grindz"  this is a spot to hit. They get the flavors right on, and at the same time offer friendly & casual service.OH, and they have shave ice!!! THE REAL SHAVE ICE! NOT "snow-cones" and they are only $1.75 for up to 3 flavors (if I'm remembering correctly.) You can even add ice cream for a small extra charge. Talk about feeling like you're back on da 'aina. Thank goodness for Hawaiian Hale.
L & L Hawaiian Barbeque=After having a pretty good experience at the last L & L http://www.yelp.com/biz/t8HbRjam5R1z0hH0I4WajQ?hrid=nX30_xaimagO3kJ_TMQSVQ, I was craving for more of it.  However, instead of going to the S. Maryland Parkway one in Vegas, I was at the N. Stephanie location in Henderson.As always, I had a regular order of pork lau lau.  It was about $7 and came with two small scoops of rice and one small scoop of mac salad.  The mac salad was creamy and peppery.  Imagine my surprise though to find not one, but TWO pork lau laus in my order!  Wow!  They were already getting four stars just for serving up two of these babies.  In all my years of ordering this stuff, I have never gotten two in a regular order.  (They never offer a mini order of pork lau lau either.)  However, the pork lau lau was a bit watery.  It wasn't dry, thank gawd.  But it lacked flavor.  I had to douse it with a lot of soyu, unfortunately.  They did have a good amount of pork and fatty goodness in there though.The BF requested a combo with Chicken Katsu and Hawaiian BBQ Short Ribs.  His order cost $7.70.  Upon opening the box, he saw the chicken was a bit darker than he would have preferred, either it's from over-frying it, or old oil.  I think it was from the former because the katsu was really crunchy.  His order was surprisingly large and we both ended up with leftovers.  His short ribs had a distinctive sauce on the ribs, like they put the sauce on top of it after it was cooked.Cleanliness of the store was an issue here.  Initially, we were seated at a booth and saw this red sauce on the wall.  "Uh, is that hot sauce?"   "Yeah."  "Uh, okay then...let's move."  There is hot sauce up on these walls, and dark marks too that I think a good wipe down would take care of.  They obviously have a leak in their ceiling as you can see by the dark water stains from above.  And it's just a bit grimy here.  I don't think anything bothers to clean up the tables or seats here.  Sidenote: They do offer a weekday lunch special.  For $4.95, you get  a choice of chicken katsu, BBQ chix, or BBQ pork, and it comes with a 16 oz soda, their daily appetizer, rice, and mac salad.Overall, I give them four stars for the amount of food you're getting for the price.  In terms of quality, that's where the stars go down.  And plus, stuff on the walls should always bring your star mark down too.  Take your order to go so you won't have to see the grime.
Oregano's Pizza Bistro=I tried to take the family here for dinner 3 times.  Each time, we were told the wait was 30+ minutes.  Since I hate waiting and they don't take reservations, we passed and went somewhere else.  On the 4th attempt, The Better Half went ahead of time to put our name on the list so that I could join them later when we got seated....it worked perfectly.  I was in a business meeting and she timed it perfectly so that I was able to make it right after my meeting.We ordered:AppetizersSpinach Artichoke Diphttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_ZwDLtBopUHb6F2mIPFUJg?select=kmUXZrIRtqqJbOxfJeksrwSweet Potato Frieshttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_ZwDLtBopUHb6F2mIPFUJg?select=0FNCsaKdjoPOayWsFC8x5wPizzas10" Thin Crust - Onions, Green Peppers, Sun-Dried Tomatoes, Jalapenos, Mushrooms, Gorgonzola Cheesehttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_ZwDLtBopUHb6F2mIPFUJg?select=dD0jzKpj2Oh-eaE7sVvLZw8" Thick Crust - Pepperoni, Sausagehttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_ZwDLtBopUHb6F2mIPFUJg?select=VxSsA7mn7xU0QCmvjHrfUg10" Thick Crust - Anchovies, Mushrooms, Gorgonzola Cheese, Onionshttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_ZwDLtBopUHb6F2mIPFUJg?select=HOLWbqCsw7-cPBoyFTY19QYeah....we were hungry!  We ordered too much food and had to take a lot of it home.The Pizzas were cooked well done, per our request.  We enjoy well done Pizza.  Because the ingredients are fresh, it took 45 minutes for the Pizzas to come out.  I had the Thin Crust.  After such a long wait, I had high expectations....unfortunately, I was disappointed.  It was just OK.  The Crust didn't have much flavor and the ingredients, while fresh, didn't hit my taste buds on a positive note.....damn.The rest of the family felt the same way about their Pizzas.  Kiddo had the Thick Crust Pepperoni & Sausage....he too is a Pizza lover like me and he said his was just OK.  Mom & The Better Half had the other Pizza and they too were underwhelmed.The Appetizers were the highlight of the evening.  The Spinach Artichoke Dip was delish & the Sweet Potato Fries were awesome.Overall, it was an average dining experience.  Was it worth the long wait to get in, then the long wait to get your Pizza?  No.Return Factor - 10%
Casella's Italian Delicatessen=I was inspired to visit Casella's after a coworker told me about their authentically Italian goodness. As my tummy growled today, I was in the neighborhood so I knew just where to go. I walked into a simple yet clean deli. Immediately, I was welcomed by the entire staff (I believe they are all related or at least family through friendship). They asked me if it was my first time in and I said yes, so right away they started giving me a history of the shop and the tasty cuisine. Celebrating their 33rd anniversary (congrats!!), I learned that everything is homemade -- from the meatballs to the chicken salad. The owner said he goes through 40 lbs of chicken a week. He gave me a sample and the chicken was chunky and delicious. I'm not surprised he has to prepare so much chicken every week! The meatballs and freshly cut meat for Philly Cheese-steak sandwiches looked great too! The owner mentioned he is from Philly so better be ready for some authentic Philly and Italian style cookin'! While I was there, the owner was slicing some fresh provolone, so I added that to the warmed turkey sandwich I ordered. The turkey was tasty, the provolone was yummy and the sourdough roll tasted like it was fresh from the oven. It was $8 for a sandwich and soda but the sandwich was hefty enough that I saved half for later. As I walked out, everyone said goodbye to me and I felt like I was leaving a family dinner. In summary, here's what made Casella's stand out: - The very friendly staff- It's a local family-owned neighborhood deli celebrating their 33rd anniversary. Gotta support the local businesses! - Clean decor - Tasty, homemade food that's on display for visitors to see - A good family-style atmosphere that greets you the second you walk inside. I'm not sure how it's taken my so long to find this local treat, but now that I've found it, I plan on becoming a regular. Directions: Note that this is hidden in the Basha's strip mall (on the side of Granite Reef) but don't let that fool you!While I love each and every visit to Casella's, today was something special - Casella's was celebrating an anniversary - 34 years in business!!There is something to be said about good food and a friendly atmosphere that stands the test of time.  It is easy to see why this family-run business has been open for 34 years and counting.Since first discovering this local gem with my Favorite Yelper a few months ago, I have lost count of the number of visits we have made.  Each and every time, we are greeted like family.  Denise even remembers our order!  Well, to be honest, every customer is greeted like family.  That is one of the many reasons we can't stay away.The decor is unpretentious, and the wood-paneled, nostalgia-filled walls tell the story of years of being a staple in the community.  Don't be surprised if you are offered a taste of whatever is being sliced behind the counter - thank you again Joe, for that Provolone!  :)Ready to taste a little bit of heaven?  Order the Hot Italian Beef with Provolone.  Served on a soft yet slightly crisp roll with a side of Au Jus, I struggle to find words to describe how good this sandwich is.  Just try it.  You won't be sorry.  Maybe money can't buy you love, but it can get you a fantastic meal - Casella's is cash-only.I have decided that I want to be adopted by the Casella family.  Sorry mom, but if you ever taste one of Casella's sandwiches, you will understand...I met fellow Yelpers Brian S and Shannon M here and learned that it's all about the sandwich.  And feeling like you have walked on to a set for "That 60's show" or "That 70's Show".  It's pretty clear the owners of Casella's are focused on the sandwiches, not updating the decor.I had an Italian beef sandwich.  It was great.  And I sat and soaked up the 70's decor as the bread from my sandwich was soaking up the juice.This place is old school all the way - old school awesome.  F#%*ing A.  Now where's my Trans Am?This place was recommended by several Yelpers on the Talk board, so I decided to give it a shot for lunch one day.  Since everyone recommended the Italian Hoagie, I decided to order it.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/GTuAPBRsM5dVPqPy9oe14Q?select=wlDWkJfzaYGWqDVviW9-oghttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/GTuAPBRsM5dVPqPy9oe14Q?select=YIheIM7GeCTUlLRrczkM_QThe Bread on the Hoagie was pretty good, but I thought it was a little on the dry side.  Would have enjoyed a little more Oil in it.  The ingredients tasted fresh and it was a solid Sandwich.....not the best I ever had, but pretty good.  Will have to come back to try some of their other stuff.They're not open on Sundays, so I'll have to try and squeeze in a visit during the week.Return Factor - 85%I'm not sure how to write this review without telling a story. I normally don't write dissertations, favoring the short and sweet condensed review, so if it's a little verbose, bear with me as it's a story worth reading.We've heard about Casella's for years but have never eaten there, usually due to bad timing on our part as they close early on Saturday and are not open for business on Sundays. We finally made it there today during normal business hours.Not knowing what to expect, we decided prior to going in if we weren't impressed with the menu, or the joint itself, we'd give each other the signal and find another lunch place.Well we weren't impressed with the decor, the menu or the overall ambiance, so we gave each other the nod and started for the door. That's when the owner, Joe Casella stopped us.Recognizing us as newbies, he told us all about his restaurant,  the menu, and even offered us a taste of whatever we liked.We declined, perhaps being a bit skeptical.But then something interesting happened. Joe introduced us to his wife and two of his four daughters (who were on duty) and we were instantly enamored with this family. Who does that in 2011? Seriously. He asked our names and even shook my hand. Long story short, after talking with Joe for just a few short minutes, my wife and I gave each other a reverse nod, signaling our eagerness to try something...anything! We ordered a couple sandwiches on Joe's recommendation.The food was superb.The bread was one of the best rolls I've ever had and is enough reason by itself  to keep us coming back. Crusty and not overly breaded, it reminded me of the rolls in Atlantic City where the bread is pure perfection. Same for the sandwich ingredients, full of flavor and cooked just right.But the best part was how Joe came over to talk to us after finishing our meal. He wanted our candid opinion of the food and service.If there's any single reason for me to frequent this place, it's the genuine heartfelt sincerity of the owner and his family, not to mention the food!Sure, the decor is old and needs updating, but somehow, after meeting the family, and eating lunch, I didn't care about the decor, or the no-nonsense menu, or the layout. None of that mattered anymore. What mattered was the overall experience of a true family restaurant, their wholesome foods, and being in the company of genuinely warm people. In a time when most of us tend to rely on first impressions, judging the proverbial book by its cover almost caused us to miss out on the Casella's experience had it not been for Joe Casella taking our hand and welcoming us into his unique domain.Casella's took me back in time today, when my grandparents would often take me with them to the Italian deli for lunch. As they visited with the owner (in Italian), sipped espresso for what seemed like hours, and ate a slow lunch, I wanted to die. I remember sitting there in the booth fidgeting as they talked, hoping like hell we'd get out of there soon.I hated that experience as a kid.I loved it today as an adult, but more importantly, finally recognized and appreciated the gift my grandparents unknowingly gave me. Thank-You Joe
Filibertos=If you like roaches in your breakfast burritos... You have come to the right place!!! Won't be coming back here again!  Bleh!!!!
Golden Gate Chinese Restaurant=We were impressed with Golden Gate.We started with an order of Crab Angels.  $4.50 for 6.  They were plump and the filling had a much higher mixture of crab than most Chinese restaurants provide.We shared House Fried Rice, Triple Seafood Delight and House Special Chicken.  The fried rice had chicken, beef and shrimp.  The rice alone I would give 3 stars.  The seafood delight lived up to it's name.  I'm normally not a fan of the traditional white wine sauce on this dish but Golden Gate's is very nice.  The scallops were done just right, melt in your mouth.  The crab also was tender and cooked just right with no taste of fishiness.  The shrimp was slightly overdone but still very good.  The house special chicken was a whole chicken breast dipped in a thin coating and deep fried, then sliced and placed over a small serving of vegetables.  The chicken was very tender and flavorful with a robust brown sauce.My daughter had chosen the restaurant for her birthday dinner and they must have heard us mention it because after the meal they brought out fried dough pockets filled with banana and sprinkled with confectioners sugar.  Nice touch and very tasty.Our total bill was about $38, a great deal for the quality and quantity of service.  An appetizer, fried rice and 2 entrees shared among 4 people and we brought home 3 boxes of leftovers.Some people have said that this place serves the best Chinese food in the Valley.  Others say it sucks.  I have an opinion between the two extremes.Being from the San Francisco Bay Area, I have had a lot of Chinese food of all qualities and types.  This stuff was pretty mediocre, middle of the road stuff.  The place really does have the look of a 1970s Chinese joint as has been said by other reviewers.  They also have that little mini grill lit by sterno that they put on the table so you can cook meat on a stick (or burn it if you are not careful).  They don't have that back home. . .Sure, I'd eat there again some time, but this place can't compete even with the average Chinese restaurant in the Bay Area.  You will get a plate of quite edible food here for your dollar, will get good, attentive service, and will leave full--just don't expect anything special in terms of taste.
Yao Fine Chinese Cuisine=Yo, Yao serves Americanized Chinese food that is pretty good.  The food falls solidly in the 3-3.5 star range.In my only visit to Yao the service was definitely lacking.  I don't know if this is the norm or they were short-staffed.  I had to wave people down through the entire time I was at Yao to get:-refills on water-refills on tea-boxes to take home leftovers-the check-I finally gave up waiting for someone to take the bill and took it to the counter.I would try Yao again but probably just for takeaway.I came because of the high ratings, I stayed because of the low dinner prix fixe menu.  $10.75, after tax, will score you any one of their special menu entrees.  My Hamilton garnered me a small cup of egg flower soup, a sizable deep fried egg roll, 2 crab puffs (which I could partake in, as they are not made from real crab) and a plate of kung pao chicken with fried rice.The chicken was sparse, but the taste was ok.  But lets face it, why get Chinese when there's Thai?  Lesson learned
La Torretta Ristorante=We found this place via Groupon and have eaten here several times.  It can get busy during the main dinner hours (6:30 - 8), so be sure to call ahead of time.  There's a small bar area on the left side of the restaurant if you're interested in dining solo or to grab some appetizers and drinks.  We prefer to sit in one of the booths in the main dining room.  During our visits, I've had the following items:Mozzarella Caprese & Bruschetta, $9.99http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-torretta-ristorante-scottsdale?select=or8bZj8bwnbM9IyObpUuRA#or8bZj8bwnbM9IyObpUuRACalamari, $10.99http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-torretta-ristorante-scottsdale?select=77WwI7Ut1lSoKKMR25xw4Q#77WwI7Ut1lSoKKMR25xw4QBreaded Ravioli, $7.99http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-torretta-ristorante-scottsdale?select=rrlu2zLgF8f-tFhw3bvVjw#rrlu2zLgF8f-tFhw3bvVjwCheese Ravioli, $15.99http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-torretta-ristorante-scottsdale?select=PnHlTuqTJksi0c1XDFKG9g#PnHlTuqTJksi0c1XDFKG9gCannelloni Fiorentino & Gnocchi (Baked Pasta filled with braised Veal, Chicken and Wild Mushrooms with Potato and Ricotta Pasta Dumplings), $22.99http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-torretta-ristorante-scottsdale?select=jdDIvDXs1Q0WV1ovGqDDmQ#jdDIvDXs1Q0WV1ovGqDDmQhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-torretta-ristorante-scottsdale?select=O9MptWALjOVNfDTKvLuNxA#O9MptWALjOVNfDTKvLuNxATortellini con Ricotta (Tortellini with sautéed Mushrooms in a Cream Sauce and Parmigiano Cheese), $18.99http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-torretta-ristorante-scottsdale?select=1FSj93ZjHABis7iarBfWxA#1FSj93ZjHABis7iarBfWxAGnocchi w/Cream Sauce & Cheese (special order), $18.99http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-torretta-ristorante-scottsdale?select=Vez8LJdi8YULSbMPATRT_A#Vez8LJdi8YULSbMPATRT_AVeal Scaloppini alla Parmigiana (Herb Veal Scaloppini baked with a Tomato Herb Sauce & Mozzarella Cheese served with Penne Marinara & Vegetable of the day), $29.99http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-torretta-ristorante-scottsdale?select=hm_q9fzAdOPjt0powPL1Dg#hm_q9fzAdOPjt0powPL1DgStuffed Shells w/Vegetables, $20.99http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-torretta-ristorante-scottsdale?select=J9vXuJUV2V5mxfyY4mlczA#J9vXuJUV2V5mxfyY4mlczAChocolate Lava Souffle (Cocoa-soaked Sponge Cake with a rich molten warm Godiva Chocolate center w/Vanilla Ice Cream), $8.95http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-torretta-ristorante-scottsdale?select=k2R5CnbA-ySqckl2aijSuw#k2R5CnbA-ySqckl2aijSuwThe Gnocchi is outstanding.  We like it so much that we ask for a special order of Gnocchi w/Cream Sauce & Gorgonzola Cheese as an appetizer and the chef always obliges....that's great customer service!Besides the Gnocchi, my fav dishes here are the Stuffed Shells and the Tortellini con Ricotta.  The Stuffed Shells are a special menu item and it isn't always available.  The rest of the menu items I've tried are pretty good as well.The customer service here is very good.  There are a couple of fun waiters who are always smiling and cracking jokes with you....they're also attentive to your dining needs.  Overall, it's a good dining experience.Return Factor - 90%
Fuzzy's Chicago Style Pizza=When it's my turn to cook, I pick up the phone an order Fuzzy's. Thin crispy crust pizza sliced in easy to handle squares - just the way I like it. I have had the opportunity to enjoy Fuzzy's dine-in, pick-up and delivery numerous times over the years. The owners have changed a few times and it has always been consistent. Fuzzy's is as close to Chicago-style pizza you can get without a plane ride. Vienna dogs, Italian beef , wings and pan pizza options are available. Chicago sports memorabilia and bold colors mark the decor. Good prices fast delivery gets a hot pie to the door.
I Love Sushi=Where do you go for some off strip sushi to die for? "I Love Sushi" of course. I didnt know what to expect especially from a place called I Love Sushi, let alone it being located in a strip mall. Boy we're we surprised. This place was huge and had about 20 sushi chefs working behind the counter. The place was packed on a Tuesday night. I think the place seats about 200 easily. Wow. The food was awesome. AWESOME. The rolls were about $12-15 each but boy were they worth it. I guess one of the gimmicks of this place is the names of the rolls. Screaming Orgasm, Taste Like My Ex Girlfriend, Fat A$$ Special, and so forth. Regardless about the name, the flavor was top top notch. This is definitely one of my favorite places to eat at. Even though the names and description mention "special chef sauce", they are all different sauces that are highly recommended by the sushi chefs. I read somewhere there was a total of 81 chefs that are employed there. Here's a list of rolls we had:(Check out the pictures I added to the I Love Sushi page. Warning: May cause a craving for some Sushi!)Jackpot Roll - I dont remember the exact description but its a fried tempura roll with spicy mayo sauce.Spider Roll - Soft Shell CrabScreaming Orgasm - Seared Tuna in chef special sauceFat Ass Roll - Tuna, salmon, yellowtail, white tuna, crab meat, avocado, deep fried panko, spicy mayo, hot sauce & eel sauce.I Love Sushi Special - Spicy tuna & cucumber topped with tuna & spicy special sauceDouble D roll - Raw Salmon and tuna on a roll and then into the yummy sauceDragon Roll - Lotsa lotsa Unagi.Baked Scallop MushroomAlright! Off season is officially over. I'm all settled in Vegas. It's time to get back to some good ole fashioned reviewing. I've got a lot of places to review but what better place to start than "I Love Sushi" because anyone that knows me, knows that I really LOVE sushi more than anyone!Cozily located in a strip mall in Henderson, I Love Sushi is one of the best sushi restaurants in Vegas, on or off the strip. The place is always bumping and the staff is always friendly. Although some of the roll names are less than desirable (example: Tastes Like Your Ex Girlfriend...) TMI and very SCARY DUDE! Not partaking in that one right off the bat, no offense! I'd use more examples but I am unable to find a copy of their heavily sexual connotated menu online. Poking fun at their menu's items is like fishing from a barrel.I recommend starting off with the oyster shooters. I order mine minus the quail egg. For those that are into the whole Rocky raw egg thing, have at it! You might want to even ask for my discarded ones as I've certainly discarded enough of them, although I can't guarantee they'll hook that up. Their oyster shooters set the mood quite nicely for date night. Gotta love those aphrodisiacs! Yum yum!I typically am a creature of habit when it comes to ordering sushi so I don't mean to bore anyone after this point. I love the Philly Roll + asparagus. Even better is their "spicy ponzu sauce" option which is not offered elsewhere at most other sushi bars.All in all, this place is one of the good ones. It's about as unpretentious as it gets and the quality is as good if not better as that that can be found at many of the high end strip sushi bars, without the lofty price tags. My name is Bobbi Billard and I approve of this message. I'm on a mission to become the Duchess of this restaurant... Stay tuned.Our friends Nicole B. and Steven S. begged us to try I Love Sushi, so after 6 years of avoiding it, I finally went.  Eric R. didn't think it would be a good deal since it is a la carte, and I heard it was all about pornographic-named rolls, so I wasn't expecting much.  Our friends made reservations, which we thought was weird for a local a la carte sushi joint, but lo and behold, there was a crazy wait at 7 and we skipped all of that.  The servers wore kimonos, and this place is really big for a sushi restaurant - less activity at the bar and more at tables around it.Our server was very friendly and efficient, and we had a private-esque booth.  I got iced green tea.  Steven S. does NOT love sushi, so he ordered a dinner bento with chicken and beef.  He got brown rice for a $1 charge.  Nicole B. got udon and the cherry blossom, a non-rice "roll" which is really a massive amount of soft shell crab chopped up and wrapped in avocado slices.Eric R. got the rainbow roll, ikura sushi, and had a few pieces of my nigiri order.  I went for it, and appreciated some interesting selections here.  I got hamachi, sake, saba, amaebi, uni, salmon skin temaki, and a quail egg shooter.When I got the first pieces, salmon and yellowtail, I immediately noticed the same problem Goyemon has - HOT rice, COLD fish.  YUCK!!!!  The sushi rice was hot and not really sushi rice, which is upsetting because 1) sushi is about the rice and 2) the mixed temperatures make everything taste weird.  Not okay.  The fish quality was fine enough, though the yellowtail was splitting apart at each seam so to speak.  I liked the salmon better.The mackerel was cured just fine and covered with my fave vegetable, green onions.  The uni was okay.  The salmon skin handroll was stuffed, and it was prepared with gobo, kaiware, cucumber, and avocado without sauce, which was very good.  The quail egg shooter had 3 quail egg yolks, masago, green onion, and ponzu which was different and tasty.  I got the amaebi last.  The sushi was good and the fried heads were enormous and covered in tempura batter.  They were on top of shredded daikon and served with ponzu.  I was very full after all of this, and I am glad I tried it finally.  However, there is no excuse for poor rice when sushi is about rice, so I do not see myself returning.This is where I broke my Las Vegas sushi cherry... TMI?After a long day of driving a U-Haul across the CA/NV stateline, lifting and unpacking boxes I was ready to eat, but I was sick of fast-food and pizza options. I yelped Sushi and this place popped up with 4 1/2 stars? Let's do this! I placed an order for pick-up and they said it would take about ten minutes. Hmmm, ten minutes for 2 orders of Udon Tempura and 2 Caterpillar Rolls? I decided to test this and arrived 8 minutes & 25 seconds later. "Hi, order for Tiffany?" (my GF) "Yup, right here...two orders of Udon Tempura and 2 Caterpillar Rolls"...whoa, this place is on it, but how does it taste?I brought it home and feasted. The Udon Tempura was very good and full of flavor. The tempura was delightful, not to greasy just lite and flaky. Poi-fect!The Caterpillar rolls you could tell were super fresh and delicious. These were definitely made to order. This place gets an easy 4 stars. I'm coming back to get the full restaurant experience soon. Maybe this will lead to an updated review and a added star?So I guess I recently went on a sushi splurge. What can I say? I love sushi! HahThis place was hustling and bustling the Friday night that I came. We had a group of 8 people and they accommodated all of us very nicely in one booth. It was my first time here so I didn't know what to expect. It's a sushi/Japanese restaurant run by Koreans with waitresses in kimonos. Interesting.. Let's start off by the saying that the specialty sushi roll menu is.. well.. extensive. Like really extensive. There are so many options.. maybe too many options for my indecisiveness haha.. The sushi was not bad though. I ordered the Ryan roll which was basically a crunchy shrimp tempura roll with maguro and special sauce. It was quite tasty.Our service was great! Considering how busy the place was, our server was really attentive and fun. So why just the 4 stars? I was a little thrown back by the price of the rolls. My roll was $15 already. I was a little disappointed to find out they didn't have a AYCE option but it is what it is. (I think people from Hawaii are just too spoiled with cheap food) They also have bento boxes/dinner specials that also looked yummy. I would give those a try if I come back next time!I love sushi, but not so sure if I love it here.  There are many pros to this place, but here's why I thought it was just A-OK.Walking in, you're greeted and waited by waitresses/servers dressed in kimonos (cute).  It was busy going to lunch on Saturday, but there was plenty of seating.  We decided to sit at the sushi bar.  I'm not exactly a fan of sitting at a low sushi bar where I have to look up to talk to the sushi chefs.  It's just awkward.  Tuna Karai, Candy Cane Roll, and the super white tuna nigiri (ono) are what we ordered. The Tuna Karai:  $16.50 for a bowl.  You can go to Sumo Sushi and get a Tuna Karai for $14.00 and double the amount.  This was good, but not $16.50 good.  I love softshell crab, and I'm glad that I Love Sushi has a variety of sushi rolls that include softshell crab.  I decided to try the Candy Cane Roll.  There wasn't any sauce on it.  The flavor was just okay.  It had a weird after taste to it.  It was also a bit too salty too.  Just a weird flavor.  The super white tuna nigiri (ono) was probably my favorite.  They give you a generous amount of ono sushi.  Great with a piece of wasabi and soy sauce.  Maybe I'll come back and give this place another chance in the future, but for now, it was just okay.
Cucina Tagliani=It's almost as if Cucina Tagliani doesn't even exist. Despite its visible location right off the Loop 101 freeway, I've never seen a wait. To some that might be a good thing; in my opinion, if it's too easy it's probably not worth it. And Cucina Tagliani proves that it isn't worth it time and time again. Lets start with first impressions: tacky and unoriginal. The whole interior is decorated to look like some small Italian village or something. Oh gee, I've never seen that look before...Oh, wait isn't that what every Italian place looks like? The food is so-so. Nothing special at best, and downright disgusting at worst. They don't even have spaghetti and meatballs. This place fills the Italian restaurant stereotype to a tee, and then they don't offer traditional Italian fare. It just doesn't make sense. The service is just terrible. They never have enough people to keep everything running smoothly, and the waitresses are so fake. Working in the food industry myself, I'm not the kind of customer that asks for three sides of ranch after my food is already at the table. But even if you order the simplest items, the waitresses will still treat you like they'd want nothing more than to poke your eyes out with the rolled utensils. With this deadly combination it's no wonder Olive Garden has a 45 minute wait at any given time, and Tagliani can't even fill the dining room.
Pong Pong Restaurant=I just moved to AZ so I haven't "been around" yet.  But, I did go to Pong Pong Restaurant. Let me start here... I love Chinese food.  I have been to many different types of Chinese food restaurants.  I usually order won ton soup...and that's what I did at Pong Pong.  I took my first sip of soup and it tasted like someone poured the entire contents of a pepper shaker in my soup.  I couldn't eat it, so I returned it to get another soup that was completely disgusting.  Let me describe the soup: DIRTY GAS STATION TOILET BOWL WATER.I also ordered the chicken chow mein combo - which includes pork fried rice.  The chow mein did not have any taste and smelled funny.  I noted 5 small chucks of chicken in the whole plate. The rice was favorless and had a spackle-type texture.  Last, but certainly not least, my pepsi was flat.  How do we screw up SODA, people?My husband ordered the sweet and sour chicken, which looked more like vomit than anything.  No part of this dinner was good, not even remotely good.  The place isn't the cleanest either.  My husband said the unisex toilet was filled to the very top with water (I didn't have the pleasure of witnessing this).  If you were sitting down, you would have drown.So we blew $17.00 and ate about 5 bites each of what we ordered.  Big waste of money.  I was surprised I didn't get sick to my stomach when I got home, my stomach ached for the rest of the night.  Every time I drive by Pong Pong, I think Puke, Puke.So, if you are into getting ripped off and eating crappy food, I recommend Pong Pong!  :)
Hard Hat Lounge=I came here last night to see Bobby Yang and his Unrivaled Players in their only Las Vegas concert!  I'm not usually at bars but this was an exception and I had to go hear Bobby and his group.The bar is called a dive bar and I guess you could say it is although it was a lot nicer than I was expecting and there was a lot less smoke than I thought there would be.  The place is small.  A narrow aisle past the bar to the performance area in the back is the only space to move around.  As we gathered in the back, we tended to block the entrance to the ladies room.  The bartender from whom I got my Coke was very kind and the price was right.  There were some problems with mic feedback at times, but nothing serious.  The band rocked the joint and it was great fun to see and hear a friend lead his band with his great fiddle playing!It was a fun night and the Lounge was great.  I'd like to go back sometime and get photos of the whole Frank Bowers mural behind the bar.  Bowers was a Los Angeles mural painter who is said to have painted this mural to pay off a bar tab.
Pho Vietnam Restaurant=I used to think this is my favorite pho in Vegas but now I'm not so sure.  I recently went and ordered the dac biet with extra tendon.  The broth is pretty good, it's not as sweet as Pho Kim Long and not as salty as Pho Saigon 8.  The extra tendon I ordered was way undercooked - so it was yellow and a little chewy.The worst part of the meal was that my server decided to sit at the table next to me and start clipping her finger nails.  I was so worried that a little piece of her nail was gonna get in my soup that it ruined my dining experience.  She had her back to me and I'm pretty sure it was her fingernails she was clipping, but I kept worrying it was her toenails.  Either way f'ing disgusting.In the past, breakfasts in Vegas for me meant huge buffets or overpriced Starbucks meals... or it was an especially rough night, overpriced room service. However, this last visit to Vegas opened a whole new world for me. This was the trip where I realized that pho, my favorite morning after meal, was available to me even in Las Vegas! Pho Vietnam is located in a huge, sprawling Asian plaza with a 99 Ranch and Volcano Tea. It's a combo pho place and Chinese food restaurant, which would normally make me wary, but my friend the pho expert vouched for its delicious broth. I ended up going with the bbq pork and egg roll bun, my favorite selection when I'm not feeling like soup. It was a huge serving for about $7, with deliciously crispy egg rolls and lots of veggies, including pickled carrots and radishes, which I'm not typically used to on this dish. I did think the pork was a little bit dry but still very flavorful. The place is really simple and straightforward, like most good Asian places tend to be. The tables were filled with fellow hungover partiers who know that pho heals all bad decisions. Definitely a new go-to during my trips to Vegas!CHEAP MEALS CLOSE TO VEGAS can be found in the vegas "chinatown" where the asian food resides!!I was skeptical that this restaurant would be mediocre because it was a vietnamese & chinese fusion restaurant BUT i ordered my ~$3 banh mi regardless... lots of bread! it was just okay ... the EGGROLLS on the other hand were surprisingly delicious!! ANOTHER vegas budget meal for those gamblers who've lost too much money at the tables!... but beware, you get what you pay forThe holidays are upon us which means I run screaming away from my family. No joke. I ended up a Pho Vietnam on Thanksgiving afternoon when a few friends didn't have plans until later and I got skip out on the family.Since it was Thanksgiving, we decided to head to China Town and we all decided on Pho. Entering the complex, we spotted Pho Vietnam and headed up the staircase.The restaurant is large and has multiple large tables. This was definitely a place you came to with the whole family. The restaurant was busy, spaced a little tightly, and was nothing pretty or noteworthy.We were sat right away, water and tea arrived shortly after, Vietnamese Iced Coffee, Pho, & Spring Rolls were ordered. I was bummed the Iced Coffee isn't steeped at the table. I love watching and smelling it brew, then swirling in the lightly sweetened condensed milk. Also, how long was the premade iced coffee been sitting. Answers I never got; nonetheless, the iced coffee was delightful.Our Pho came out, it was a decent portions, and a decent price. For me, a great pho has an amazing broth. A simple, yet complex flavor profile. I don't like to add anything other than veggies and spice to my Pho. I had no choice but to try and spruce this up. The broth was less bland than the time I tried instant Ramen. Meh. Our waitress disappeared and our spring rolls were MIA. I made eye contact with another staff member at another table, she rushed over, grabbed our spring rolls. The Spring Rolls were deep fried and that's all I can tell you about that. They were fried, you couldn't taste the vegetables inside, which were just mushy and off color. Not even fish sauce could save it. It was, for a lack of a better term, gross.I won't return to Pho Vietnam: poor service (which doesn't deter me from the dankest of the dank), lackluster flavor profiles, and a menu with nothing that you wouldn't find at any other hole in the wall Vietnamese joint.I originally came here to eat at Capital Seafood Restaurant, not realizing that it shares a space with Pho Vietnam. With two menus to choose from, I ordered from both!The Combination Pho #2 has flank steak, tripe, and meatballs (my favorite!) and a solid, complex broth. This was better than another nearby version I had recently, but not the best I've had in town. Amount of noodles was extremely generous.  I only had a little of this dish, BF at the majority and felt ill afterward.Service was typical for Chinatown plaza- you order, you receive your food, and you have to hunt them down for anything else.
C-Fu Gourmet=After reading all the reviews here about C-Fu Gourmet being the best place for dim sum in the valley, I am really disappointed to be writing my first 1 star review for the areaWas the service rude and uncaring? The answer here is yes.  Especially the way that push-cart servers call out the food which make you feel like you're in a rowdy tourist market full of cheap knock-offs they're trying to get rid of.  But all would have been forgiven if only the dim-sum being served was any good.  However the dishes we ordered reflected a sloppy kitchen that was focused solely on putting in minimal effort and taking every possible shortcut on the food. Dishes that made me ashamed to be Chinese (yes, the level that C-Fu dimsum brought it down to was that bad):-  Fried glutinous rice:  The preserved meat that was supposed to flavor the dish was MIA. We complained to one of the waiters who replied that "they probably forgot" (um are you sure it's not cost cutting for those who don't know any better?).  More over, the proper way to cook this classic dish would be like risotto where you're constantly stirring and gradually adding water just a little bit at a time (except of course everything is being done in a wok)...Here the C-Fu kitchen obviously just shoved the whole thing into an electric rice-cooker and try to stir fry the huge sticky mess at the end by adding in gallons of oil.   -  Glutinous rice with chicken steamed in lotus leaf:  Once again that electric rice cooker in the back of the kitchen must be working real hard cause the dish lacked the aroma that it would have had if it had actually been steamed in lotus leaf.  Just tasted of sloppy topping of minced chicken and last minute wrapping in the lotus leaf.Dishes I was amazed by (and no not in a good way):-  Deep fried taro dumpling:  Have never quite had it in that simplistic way before where the filling literally was just mashed taro held together by a prodigious amount of oil-  Steamed bok choy:  How the heck do you get oil into steamed vegetable?  C-Fu managed to accomplish this amazing feat of greasy steamed vegetable...unbelievableOn a good note, the Siu Mai was decent.  We did keep on ordering more dishes hopping that something good would pop up...but nope that was it,...so if  you must go to C-Fu for dim-sum...just order order a lot of siu mai and be careful of all the other dishes.  Dinner here was much better. 1 star is for dim-sum only.Next time I have a dim-sum craving, you'll be finding me across the valley at China Chan's (Glendale) where the short & sweet dimsum offering is cooked by a man who doesn't cut corners and it shows.  That's where I'll be sticking to from now on.My Aunt Sue and Uncle Frank told me about C-Fu Gourmet awhile ago, and invited me to join them for dim-sum once or twice... they rave about this place, making the drive to Chandler from North Scottsdale quite often, so I figured it would be worth it.  I saw there were mixed opinions on previous Yelp reviews for C-Fu, but sometimes you want to decide for yourself...Well, in this instance, I agree more with the Yelp average rating than I do with my Aunt and Uncle... Jared and I really wanted to like this place, but nothing about it was that great.It has an old school Chinese feel to it, but the food was nothing to write home about... we had an order of egg rolls, wonton soup, chicken with Chinese veggies, and a noodle dish... you'd think something would stand out, but unfortunately, it didn't.  It was all pretty bland.  We didn't even take home our leftovers... (that's when you know it's bad!)Needless to say, we won't be returning to C-Fu, so I cannot even say "C U to C-FU," cause I won't!I came here for dimsum with a few friends during lunch. The quality of the food is mediocre compared the legit ones in Hacienta Heights, CA or San Gabriel, CA. My friend and I are hardcore dimsum fans, so we have been to this dimsum a few times, until we decided to change to the one across the street called Phoenix Palace Buffet. For some reason, we returned back to C-Fu to try it again, but the service was horrible!! We requested water and tea, and in my water cup and all around it were white residue from a previous mixed drink of another customer. I had already drank half of the iced water and realized there was all over the sides of the cup. I immediately asked for a replacement and even the server was grossed out! They did not do anything to compensate for such a gross encounter, which in the end made everyone at the table lose our appetites. Seriously... traumatized. Definitely not coming back until their service improves!As far as dim sum goes, C-Fu has always been the last option for me.  While the restaurant itself is definitely the most gorgeous out of the rest, the food is pretty white-washed and Americanized.  If I am to drag myself out of bed for dim sum on my precious weekend, I expect hot steamy food and delicious steam to waft over me.  Instead, the food is always mediocre and warm at best.  Don't arrive too early for dim sum or you'll get the leftover steamers from the prior day.  While their food isn't downright disgusting, the targeted audience has definitely changed the past few years.  I say come around 11pm so you get the fresh dishes of the day!
Olive Garden Italian Restaurant=This is Olive Garden and I knew what I was getting into when I suggested lunch here.  I knew Rand would be all over the all you can eat pasta and I was right.  The only thing I've ever liked at Olive Garden was the soup and salad and for 6.95 you get all that and breadsticks.  The zuppa tuscana soup had little flavor and the pasta fagioli which has always been my favorite was bland and tasteless.  Even the salad was rather sad, only 1 little piece of tomato and no cucumber.The ledge of the booth had crumbs on it, and so did the windowsill.  There was scraps of paper on the floor under the table next to us.  Disappointing especially since were were the first table today.Service was good but I don't think I'll be going back to an Olive Garden anytime soon.We were seated.We perused the menu.We chatted.We colored.We waited.We were not ever approached by a server, not in 10-15 minutes of sitting there.
Domino's Pizza=::::::      ::::::            ::::::      We looked at our entertainment book for pizza coupons and came across Domino's in some cruel twist of fate.  Since we hadn't had Domino's in easily 10 years and it was a pretty good coupon we decided in what later seemed a momentary lapse in judgement that we would use the coupon and give them a shot.It will likely be at least 10 years before we try them again.Pizza that was on a par with those frozen ones from the grocery store and a free sandwich we shared that left us with tummy aches.Despite the coupon savings it's no deal for poor quality food.
The Lunch Bag=Sometimes it really doesn't matter what the food is like when the people are just this awesome. My coworker and I came here for a quick lunch the other day and were greeted as if we were old friends. The Lunch Bag is a family run place with mom, daughter and son working the counter and making the food. They were laughing and joking with customers that they clearly knew very well. We felt like we were really apart of something fun and special. The food was good too and a decent price for lunch. I had the New Yorker (minus the cheese) and it was super tasty. I would get the coleslaw on the side if you don't like soggy bread but otherwise would totally eat it again. Absolutely will return.
Black Angus Steakhouse=when i worked in retail my paycheck was spent before i got paid. therefore, i relied heavily on coupons and splitting meals w all of my other poor college friends.well, i hit the jackpot. $15 coupon for a FEAST. the picture on the coupon showed everything we would get: a huge steak, shrimp, and lobster PLUS 2 sides. there were 3 of us- this was PLENTY. it was prom night too so we were initally fooled with how popular it was. popular for prom girls with light up clear shoes (not even lying), if that says anything about the crowd for you...our waitress stops by our booth and just stares at us. one of my friend kinda looks around at me and our other friend, then back at the waitress. 'ill have a diet coke?'then our waitress writes it down and doesn't say anything but looks at my other friend.i lost it and started laughing. why isn't she talking to us? this is so weird. we ended up asking for a different waitress, then found out the coupon was a big fat liar. you didn't get all of that. it just says you do but you don't. the food ended up being nasty. probably one of the worst meals ive ever had. as we're leaving susy talks a lot waitress trips over my friend and it was all too awkward bc i couldn't control laughing. awful food, awful service, AND the bathrooms were some of the grossest i had ever been in. if wal-mart ran a restaurant, this would be it.Its 6:45pm on Thursday night and daughter and I are starving, I'm not in the mood for cooking and would like a steak, so happens there was a flier in the mail for Black Angus Campfire Feast for Two for 39.95. I told my daughter here is our mission, to get Black Angus have our dinner and be done in 50 mins to be on time to pick up son at his job. So off we went, we were seated right away. I clearly explained to my daughter how the campfire feast worked, but somewhere between talking to her and her looking at the menu she got carried away, so I got her back on track, and asked her what type of appetizer she would like, for me it didn't matter. She started us off with the wagon wheel sampler, which is perfect to share with 2, it's the best of everything, Shrimp Cocktail, fried garlic-pepper zucchini, buffalo chicken and loaded potato skins. Everything was great, I have to say my favorite where the zucchini, even though it was fried, it was lightly fried and not greasy, and the flavor was delish!For my meal I ordered the 12oz ribeye a loaded baked potato and Caesar salad .Lets start with the Caesar salad, omg the slices of parmesan cheese on this salad was amazing! I love parmesan cheese and this salad was not lacking in it! So very good!  My loaded potato wasn't really loaded, it had bacon cheese and sour cream, but more like a micro mini scoop of it, but it was better for me that way because even though I went all HAM on this dinner, I still need to watch what I eat.  The ribeye, it was cooked medium and still very pink, but it was flavorless it could have been hit with some salt & pepper before the grilling.For the dessert we had the cookie and ice cream, my daughter really enjoyed that, I had a few bites, but honestly I was just full!  The chocolate chip cookie though did taste heavenly sweet! Our server was Rachel and she was awesome! We did make it out within 50 mins and I did make it in time to get my son from work, did I feel guilty for going out to eat, maybe for a brief moment when he was heating up his hot pockets in the microwave, but that passed away quickly .  ( I did take him to get food elsewhere I'm not heartless LOL)I have not been to Black Angus in about maybe 6 or 7 years. To be honest , I did not think they were even around any more. So I was surprised when I was over in Chandler at Mimi's & saw there was a Black Angus there.A few nights later we came here for dinner. We came about 5:30pm. There were just a few tables in there dining. About 6 people in the Bar.Our Hostess was really perky and sat us right away in a booth,with our menus. We waited so long to be greeted that we actually were ready to completely order by the time our Server came over. The menus are nice well laid out. However, The first thing I noticed was how high the prices all are. This is not the Black Angus I remember . I remember decent food at a good price.Our server was not interested in waiting on us at all. As if she had better things to do. I promise, they were not busy in there at all.With the Tip our bill was about $100.00,so I really thought for that kind of $$$ I would rather go to The Keg, or Somewhere with a nicer ambiance. The dishes were very plain, almost looked plastic. The Tables were not set high end at all.The food was good! I really liked it. But, I thought it was priced too high.If you look at my photos, the food is just put on this really plain dish. was not appealing at all.We had to wait far too long for our bill as well. I don't know where our Server was because, I did not see her anywhere. I can honestly say we won't be back.I did like the Ladies Room, it was decorated nicely with great old adverts that were framed. That was a plus!Never DisappointsIt has been quite some time since I last visited Black Angus Steakhouse.  However, today my sister and I were craving steak for lunch and Black Angus has the absolute best lunch specials when you have a hankering for steak.Black Angus offers an extensive menu and well prepared food at a reasonable price.  The drink menu is great, and the beer is cold on tap.  We seldom have to wait very long for a table and food is served promptly.On this visit my sister had a medium rare sirloin steak with grilled roasted corn and a loaded baked potato and raved about it. I had a filet mignon sandwich with grilled onions and roasted red peppers.  The filet mignon was the most tender steak I've ever had, as well as being flavorful, both cuts of meat were cooked to perfection, just as we had ordered them.  Prior to our entrée we were served a small loaf of bread which was delicious and hot from the oven. The bread was hot, crusty, and soft on the inside.  I could have ate the entire loaf myself, but decided to share.  The deserts at Black Angus are to die for, however, we usually take ours home to enjoy later. Our server was amazing.  Once seated our drinks were served within a few minutes and we were given   a lunch discount card (8.99 for each lunch meal with the purchase of a drink) The Manager at Black Angus knows how to make the customer feel special. During most recent visit, the manager cleared plates,  assisted with getting our desert ready for leaving, and made sure our dining experience was a pleasant one.We have never had a bad experience at Black Angus and plan to return every time we get the chance.
Pho Nhu  Y=This is your classic dive-asian-restaurant-take-out-buffet-joint-and-ma-pa-convenience-store. This places specializes in quick take out food, with a steam table of rice and other Vietnamese deli foods to make assorted Com dishes.There are also a few shelves of desserts and deli/convenience foods.  But it has about 6 tables to sit and eat, and you can watch the TV with a DVD playing over and over again the traditional Vietnamese outfit contest portion of the Miss Universe Pageant in Nha Trang, Vietnam,They have a decent smattering of Vietnamese fair in a grungy envirnment devoid of any charm, but the food is pretty good. Khai Vi, Pho Bo (about 17 combos) Hu Tieu, Mi Xao, Com Dia, Che, and special dishes like Bun Bo Hue, Bun Rieu,  Banh Cuon, Goi Du Du, Nem Nuong Cuon, etc. They also have Boba drinks, coffees, etc.Don't expect great service. The Pho Tai Bo Vien and Pho Tai came in quite large bowls, with full size rounds of rare beef and decent size meat balls. There was also a lot of noodles, more than most places. Only $4.99, good price even for San Jose or Little Saigon. If you want quick to go Viet food, or a cheap and large bowl of Pho in Las Vegas, try here. It is in a 2 story strip mall just below Korean Garden BBQ.Open 7 days a week, 9 AM til 9 PM.
Ted's Hot Dogs=Geez!  I've been dreading this review for the last couple of hours.  If this is the last review you see from me, it is because I have upset someone and they have killed me.Cash Only? WTF! The hot dogs are barely good (flinches, looks over shoulder).  YEAH I SAID IT!  Its not so much the food I have a problem with, its the staff and the hype.I mean, I had a feeling it wouldn't live up to the hype.  How could it?  Its a hot dog joint that has the reputation of a 5 Star restaurant.  The dogs are good. Thats it, good.  The staff and functionality of the restaurant, however, was not. Plus, they charged me for an extra order of fries! Hey! My 20 month old can't eat two orders of fries!I ate at Ted's for lunch on Sunday with my wife.  We both got the Jumbo All Beef dog with all the toppings (Catsup, Mustard, Onions, Relish, and a Pickle)... The problem was, while in line for only 5 minutes the staff managed to screw up 3 different orders.  That was like 40% screw up!  They were not apologetic, and the customers were getting irate!  This isn't the atmosphere I look for when eating lunch.  Irate customers and hasty cooks are not a good combo.  The onion rings were just a knot of messy fried mystery.  Don't get me wrong, I ate them!Unfortunately, I can't give this place more than 3 stars.  And with this review I will be buying a handgun for protection.Thank god for Ted's Hot Dogs!  There is nothing better in life than a charbroiled hot dog with tasty onion rings and a soda.  My cohorts at work turned me onto Ted's and I kept it secret from my wife.  Yes, I'm that cruel.  Then one Sunday morning we were watching one of those Top 10 Hot Dog shows on the Food Network or Travel Channel.  She said to me, "I wish we could have a great hot dog today."  I broke down and wept, confessing my multiple sins of all the times I tip toed to Ted's to enjoy a chili footlong dog and an all beef dog with the works. She, loving me, immediately hit me a couple of times about the head, and said "Get dressed bitch - lunch is on you."  Now, if you ever meet Marie, you'll come to know that she is sweet and understanding, but on that day, I found one of her few limits.  Needless to say, we had a great experience at Ted's that Sunday.REMEMBER:  They only take cash.  No debit cards, no credit cards, no bartering.Someone asked the question in the Yelp talk threads where the best place was for fried things, like french fries and onion rings.  Several people said Ted's had great onion rings......so off I went!  I expected a smaller place but I was pleasantly suprised when I pulled up to a medium sized store.  I was greated with a smile and asked what I would like.  It was a Sunday afternoon so they were not very busy.  I liked the fact that you tell them what you want and they toss it on the grill right in front of you.  Everything is freshly cooked.  They did the same with the onion rings and french fries too.  Everything was fresh and hot.  My daughter had her favorite....a hot dog, which she loved, and fries which were fresh and crisp.  I had a burger and onion rings.  Yes, the onion rings were delicious!  The batter was great and the onions were a little on the sweet side.  My burger was cooked to perfection.  This is another great little place we will go back to.  It's also sort of near my work so maybe I'll get out one day and go here for lunch.  Thanks Ted's and Yelpers!Alert the media!!!Ted's is one of the Top Ten hot dog shops in the galaxy!!...Ted's is on the Travel Channel!!...Ted's is really authentic, because they are from Buffalo NY, the home of the Buffalo Bills football team (in an interesting side note, everybody thinks the Bills are named after "Buffalo Bill", the cowboy showman...but "Bills" is an acronym for "Boy I Love Loosin' Superbowls").I learned most of this standing in lines at Ted's over the years (not the Bills trivia...they love their Bills at Ted's and you would do well not to question that or to make sport of the Bills, as I just have:)Why is Buffalo the home of the best hot dogs, you ask? Well, don't ask...it just is...as far as you know.Ted's created the Tempe outpost a few years ago when the owner of Ted's got tired of shoveling 24 feet of lake effect precipitation off of his driveway every winter and needed to have a way to write off the trip west every year.So he packed up his sausages and some plaques and Buffalo newspaper clippings for the wall and landed in Tempe, AZ:)It's our good fortune, really. I doubt we'll get the Papaya King to relocate to the Valley of the Sun, and I'm pretty sure Pinks will stay put, so this may be the closest we'll get to galactic class hot dogs.And yet, they're just hot dogs. Good hot dogs, yes...and I do like them...but just hot dogs.The dogs (and everything that they cook at Ted's) are open flame broiled over a real charcoal fire, with the standard compliment of condiments available (including chili, although I am not a big fan of Ted's chili dogs...the chili just doesn't grab me).They also do a nice job on brats, white hots, polish sausages, etc. And, I understand the hamburger is decent, although I have never had one...I go to Ted's for one reason and one reason only...the stars of the show...the hot dogs!And I'm not the only one...people do, indeed, line up to get these dogs!It's like trying to get a pizza at Bianco's. In fact, Ted's can be a tougher test of your dining will than Bianco's...to wit:* Wait     o Bianco's - 2-3 hours, but you can sit at a table and drink and eat     o Ted's - You must stand in line for the full hour...no cuts!!!* Ordering     o Ted's - you better be ready or be prepared for a bit of a public dressing down ("sir, are you ready? Ma'am, the menu is right up there!! sir, other people are waiting!!)     o Bianco's - "You want what on that pizza?!?! Chris will not make "his" pizza that way"! "Did you get my wine and cheese order Mr. Shaved Head-non-responsive bartender at Bar Bianco...hello...hello"? "Yes, I know I told you check with me every hour during the wait, but now that's annoying me"* Price     o Ted's - 2 foot longs and diet coke for $11? That better be a hot dog made with sausage imported all the way from Buffalo, NY! Oh, right...it is:)     o Bianco's - $15 for a pizza that I can't even get my way after a 3 hour wait and $150 bill for wine cheese from your shop next door! This pizza better be made with buffalo mozzarella, made by hand, by you! Oh, right...it is:)For the local "Best in the Universe-Peasant Food Division", Ted's certainly gives the pizza joint a run for its money, in pretty much every category:)Give them try, but bring your comfortable shoes and something to read in line (unless you'd enjoy reading 3 week old Buffalo, NY newspapers from Ted's reading rack)...and for the pete's sake be ready to order!Best hot dogs ever?  Almost....damn near a photo finish but Wieners Circle in Chicago has my #1 vote, but you know what?  Coming in second is still something to be proud of.  Teds Hot Dogs are a-m-a-z-i-n-g!We came here 2 times during our 4 days in the desert.  Both times I left with a smile on my face and a stomach full of tube steaks.The first day we went I got 2 regular dogs, a white hot sausage, split an order of onion rings and washed it down with a Loganberry shake.  We got in line and the man grilling the dogs kindly asks you what you would like.  You kind of shout it out and then he grabs the dogs and stacks them in order of when they are going to be cooked.  A very streamlined operation.  By the time you reach the man, they are pretty much done and then handed off to the condiment lady.  You tell them what you want on each dog.  I went with mustard, onions and their hot sauce concoction. They dish up your onion rings and make your shakes and then off you go.These dogs are super tasty.  Everything just works so well.  They use a soft potato bun and the dogs are char-grilled over charcoal so they get a crispy/burnt like texture to them.  I devoured those things in a matter of minutes.  The onion rings are more like an onion loaf.  Pretty good.  The Loganberry shake was very good too.  Just sweet enough without overpowering it.  The shakes are a tad small though but they are the right consistency and you can easily drink it through your straw which was nice.2nd trip I got a foot-long, a regular and an Italian sausage.  This time we split fries and got another Loganberry shake.  The Italian sausage was the winner of both trips.  It was the BEST sausage I have ever had.  I got it topped with just mustard and onions.  It was perfectly cooked, snap when you bit in, but soft and almost mushy when you chewed through it.  Kind of hard to describe but god damn that was a tasty sausage.  Perfect flavors and everything.  My 2 dogs I got topped like day 1.  Mustard, onions and hot sauce.  The wife had a burger which she said was ok.  Looked kind of skimp though.  She doesn't eat dogs so she missed out.  I will have dreams about this place.  It was by far my favorite 2 meals in AZ and I would eat here all the time if I lived close.   I cant wait to find some reason to go back to AZ just to eat here.  It may even be worth the 5 hour drive just to eat these, turn around and come back.  Seriously.....these dogs are great!Still my favorite hot dogs.  We started the trip and ended the trip with meals at Teds.First visit-  Got there about 2pm on Saturday afternoon.  I have never seen a line of more than 5-7 people here at Teds.  We walked in and there was a line about 30 people deep.  I don't know if everyone was getting their hot dog fix since they were closed on Easter or what,  but it was busy!  Waited in line and placed my order for a Footlong, Polish, White Hot and a Corn Dog. (This trip, I was going to eat every hot dog they had....veggie and kids hot dogs don't count ;-) lol)  Washed it down with a loganberry shake.  My wife got some fries.  Second visit-  Got there around 10:30am and there were only 2 people in front of us.  Today I placed my order for a Bratwurst, Italian, All Beef and Regular Dog.  My wife got a hamburger and some onion rings.  Washed it down with another loganberry shake.To add to my previous review, in my opinion, this is the order of greatness of Teds dogs/sausages.1. Italian- My favorite.  Spiced right and always delicious. A must order every time!2. Bratwurst- Close runner up to the Italian.  A must order every time!3. Polish- Another great sausage. 4. Regular Dog- The classic.5. All Beef Dog- Huge and beefy.6. White Hot- Wont get it again probably.  Not enough flavor.7. Corn Dog- Foster Farms regular corn dog.  Fried proper but plain.  I can make one like that myself at home.8. Foot Long- Tastes different than the other dogs.  Bun was stale, have not liked it the 2 times I ordered it.  Wont ever get it again.Cant wait to go back.  The dogs are always delicious!I came to Ted's last week to meet up with the lunch UYE group, but I was a little late and they were on their way out.  So, I waited in the line, alone, to order a dog to go.  The funny thing, they call to you from behind the grill to place your order.  As they were calling for my attention, I looked around over my shoulder as if to say, "Oh, you're talking to me" when the cook was calling for my attention... haha, that's something you should look out for so you're not caught off guard if its your first time around the block.I got the beef dog with ketchup, mustard and a pickle.  They grill the hot dog on an open flame.  The dogs don't taste "grilled" enough for my tastes, but it was ok.  I really enjoyed the onion rings that I ordered on the side.  Very tasty.  I won't miss this place if I don't go back.  But if someone wants to go, I'll meet them there.  No problem.I love reading about my yelp friends' vacation finds.  I always bookmark them because although I never know when I'll be in that part of the country, I do know those bookmarks will eventually become tourist destinations for me.  My yelp bud Tim S. knows his comfort foods.  When he raves about a pizza in New York, a cheesesteak in Philly, or a hot dog in Phoenix, I'm so there.  Wait a Hot Dog in Phoenix?  That can't be right.  This ain't Chicago or New York.  Or is it?  Ted's is a Buffalo, NY Hot Dog blooming right here in the middle of the desert, transplanted in 1983 from it's 1927 original wintery environment.  Sometimes when you are a food tourist, it's ok to over order and try a few different things.  It's not ok for your waistline, but "Hey you're on vacation!"  At least that's what I tell myself.  And I got absolutely no judgement from Ted's when I ordered a Regular Hot Dog, a Jumbo All Beef dog, an Italian Sausage, and a Bratwurst.  Chased down with some Onion Rings and a Loganberry Milkshake.So what makes Ted's so good, is the charcoal.  As I came in, they were adding a bunch of new charcoal to the grill.  It gives the dog a nice smokey flavor and a good snap.  Each of my 4 dogs/ sausages were excellent and it's tough to choose which one was best.  I actually think I preferred the basic hot dog, because of the soft grind of the wiener offset with the crunchy slightly charred casing.  It was texture heaven for sure, and I got this one dressed in classic Chicago style - chopped onions, relish, tomato, pickle, and yellow mustard.  I dressed the all beef with kraut and chopped onions - excellent dog although a little firmer in texture, as most beef dogs are.  They have polish, bratwurst, italian, and a white hot under their sausage menu.  I read a couple of slightly negative reviews on the white hot, so while it sounded very interesting, I had no room to put one down on this visit.  Italian and Bratwurst it was for me and I got them dressed the same way with grilled onions and peppers.  I opted for the hot sauce on the side.  The hot sauce pairs perfectly with the Italian Sausage.  This is a nice and spicy Italian.  Adding the hot sauce seemed to just reinforce that same flavor, rather than cover it up.  Ted's has an interesting home made hot sauce.  If you made a salsa out of hot dog condiments, this is what you would get - relish, onions, in a ketchup vinegar base.  For the bratwurst I went straight up with some brown deli mustard.  Awesome!   Next visit, I'm trying a chili cheese dog for sure.The onion rings taste like an onion loaf, but not super peppery.  They have a great batter here, but I like that you can still taste the onion and there isn't too much batter.  The Loganberry shake is a must order.  The perfect sweet creamy drink to offset the spicy Italian Sausage.  From what I understand loganberry is a Western NY flavor, because you don't see it around these here parts too much.  It's like a red blackberry.  I have no idea if it was loganberry flavored ice cream or vanilla ice cream with loganberry syrup.  Whatever it is, order it and you will be happy.  I can't wait until the next time I'm in Phoenix (or Buffalo) to get me a charcoal grilled dog at Ted's. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/teds-hot-dogs-tempe?select=HYh6Dv4htWxebTjRMwgh6g#OCLoB-p-pzUUNcCib8xK-QTed's Hot Dogs is one of those places that just emits an aura of times long gone. When walking into this establishment I immediately heard music from the 1950s and 60s. I could smell the meat cooking on the grill and I felt like I was in another world. I looked over Ted's menu and some of the signage and became aware that this place is tied to and related to a chain of "Ted's Hot Dogs" found in Buffalo New York. The line was fairly considerable on my initial visit and after perusing the menu I settled on an all beef hot dog, onion rings and a soft drink. With the hot dog I decided to make it as close to a Chicago style hot dog as possible. So I asked for mustard, relish,, onions, tomato, and a pickle slice.  I took the dog to an open table and dug in. The taste of the sausage here is definitely different than the steamed Chicago style dogs I'm used to. One primary reason is that everything (well all the meats) at Ted's is char grilled. This gives a nice grilled flavor to it, the actual hot dog used had an unusual filler taste with a somewhat sweet flavor rather than spicy. All things considered it was a strange mix.The onion rings weren't so great, these were very thin onion peels deep fried. While they were plentiful there was very little onion and just lots of batter. I'd say I was a bit disappointed with them.Since I've been in Arizona for quite a few days I did decide to return to Ted's and try things just a little differently. I went for a footlong dog which was only a little more expensive on my second visit. And rather than go for the toppings mentioned above I opted for Chili. The footlong dog was a great value and while the chilli was an extra 60 or so cents, I felt this was a much better dog than the one I ordered the first time and a lot of food for the money.I ALSO got a regular cheeseburger, this was fairly standard and tasted like most burgers that come off of a backyard grill. Not bad, but nothing worth writing home about.My overall opinion of Ted's is that I love the ambiance and atmosphere, the food is pretty good and it's a good value if you go for the giant footlong hot dog. I am going to give Ted's Hot Dogs four stars and a recommendation if you happen to be in Tempe Arizona.Ted's = The fuel that kept me running when I went to ASU.I first came across Ted's after my classmates up'd and kidnapped me after our studio class one sunny afternoon.  I've never heard of the place and was intrigued with promises of the "best wiener you'll put your lips on [Sun Devils at their prime]."  Upon entering the small establishment, the scent of meat sizzling on charcoal perfumed my senses.  I was sold.  I had the White Hot [veal and pork], a Regular with chili cheese, and a vanilla maltshake.  It was the best meal I had that long stressful year as a Digital Art major.  If this is a taste of Buffalo, I'll gladly say that I love New York!  Been a faithful customer of Ted's since that first bite~
Oiga, Mire, Vea Colombian Cuisine=Was fiending arepas so I searched Yelp and seems like this is one of the only places serving them.  You walk into a little Colombian market and the dining area is to your right.  I understand this dining area also becomes a salsa dance floor one night a week.The photos on the menu look amazing.  I wanted to try everything.  There were a couple different kinds of arepas and they were decent, but none of them compared with really good arepas I've had outside of Vegas.  The empanadas were so-so.  They hard-sell you on their fresh juice - I got the tamarindo and it was pretty good.  For dinner I ordered the Sancocho de Gallina which is hen soup w green plantains, yucca root and a piece of corn on the cob in the soup.  The picture looked incredible.  But the dish did not taste as good as the picture looked.  Very bland and the cliantro wasn't fresh.  Also the yucca root was undercooked.  The plantains were decent.  The corn on the cob was the same sweet corn used in the arepas which was pretty good.I'm not sure if I'll be going back.  Maybe if someone came from out of town and really wanted to go.BABY THIS AND BABY THATIn 2011 I went ahead and purchased a batch of restaurant.com coupons for a couple dozen places.  What I didn't anticipate was that more than half of them are still in my makeshift folder. This evening it was either Russian or Colombian. Russian place is closed and/or relocating.  So, it'll have to be Colombian.Last time I dined Columbian style was at Pueblito Viejo on Bird Street, Miami, FL http://www.yelp.com/biz/pueblito-viejo-no-2-miami#query:colombian%20restaurants in Miami, FL  It was like the second coming of Walt Disney. Eccentric, overwhelmingly eclectic to the max, animated and authentic Colombian from the moment I had set foot into that restaurant.Now keep that picture in mind and strip all those Disney characters from the ceiling and walls.  That's what Oiga, Mire, Vea Colombian Cuisine is simply about.  It's all about the muy rapido speaking server, a room fit for a union hall meeting and those monster black JBL speakers suspended from the ceiling.  Fortunately, it was not time for the partying to start.  So we got to dine in peace and quiet. Yelper Kevin P's review will tell you what it's like during party time. It's the work hard and play hard factor.Our server was quick to suggest sampling the following (talk about being lead by the nose):Bunuelo:  round bread, fried, made from white corn flour and cheeseEmpanada:  turn-over stuffed with meat and diced potatoes. Served with "Aji" homemade mild green sauce.Bandeja Paisa:  Colombian traditional mix plate of grilled steak, fried pork rind, red beans, rice, chorizo, fried egg, in this case fried ripe plantain.Ajiaco:  Chicken soup with Colombian yellow potatoes, domestic potatoes and corn on the cob,  Served with sour cream, capers, and rice.As it turns out there's enough food for another meal for two.  In retrospect, the leftovers tasted even better.  To wash things down, we ordered a Colombian pina and their version of a cola soda. Our muy rapido server has now begun to call us "her babies." She obviously took a liking to us.  We talked story about family.  She has a 37 year old son... you couldn't tell by looking at her (that's a compliment).Once again I've tinkered with Colombian cuisine, I would very much like to taste more of this cultural mix of indigenous, Spanish, African, Arab and some Asian influences. It was much too late in the evening to try their Colombian coffee and desserts. BTW... in Miami there are over fifty Colombian restaurants and that does not include the Chinese/Colombian which are extremely popular.
Randy's Restaurant & Ice Cream=Where to begin. How many times have I driven by Randy's over the years? Maybe 100 or probably even more? Every time I drive by, I look in and see crowds enjoying themselves; especially around 4:30 for the early bird special. But can you blame a place located in the heart of old town for having some retirees on their list of regulars? I can't. In fact, I applaud Randy's. Apparently the old timers know what's up. Let me be truthful here. Randy's is just a diner. It's your everyday, run of the mill, All American neighborhood diner...and it's awesome. Walking in on a Saturday morning at 9:30, the place was jam packed with folks of all ages. The staff quickly greeted us and scurried us to an open table while keeping a smile on their face. Looking around, guests looked like they were having a good time. Whether it was the group of partiers who needed some grease to settle their hangover or the retirees on the run from Sun City andd taking a morning walk to get breakfast and coffee, I saw just about every type of person at Randy's. Now let me get to the menu. I am pretty sure that not a thing on the breakfast menu exceeds $6.00. Slowly but surely, Scottsdale's losing this trait of economically priced meals so I salute Randy's for keeping the prices down. Now on to star number two in my book of Randy's cuisine. Do you ever go to a restaurant for breakfast and think...I'd really like an egg but I'm also craving a pancake or french toast, but I don't want nor do I need a full order of carbs. I do all the time. I love pancakes and I love french toast, but there's a rare occasion when I actually order that as my main entree for a meal. Enter Randy's. In their 20+ breakfast combination choices, they offer options like "one egg, one piece of bacon, and a half order of french toast" or the same but with a pancake instead. When I read this, my heart skipped a beat for Randy wherever he is. And let me also mention that this meal is around $4.50. Can't beat that! The food itself was just what the doctor ordered. It tasted homemade, with flavor and it was just the right amount of food. Now don't walk in expecting The Food Network to feature Randy's, but if you want a solid breakfast at a decent price, this is your spot. But buyer beware. They only accept cash or checks. Better bring some cash because if you are under the age of 60, I highly doubt you're walking around with a check book and if you lack both, you'll be slapped with a $3 ATM fee. That's nearly the price of the meal! So until next time Randy's. With a six (?) page menu chock full of everything imaginable in small town USA dining, I think I have my hands full getting through it!Omgosh.  This place is a block from my house so the location is convenient.  My initial perceptions before going were sketchy but once my husband and I went in for breakfast a few weekends back, we are weekend regulars!! The employees are so great! They are friendly and whether they are serving you or not, they give the friendliest greeting with a smile. Nothing phony. The place is VERY clean - dated but CLEAN. Just the 80's pink but it's cleverly nostalgic. My husband and I love sitting at the bar so we can watch morning sports after our workouts. The service is quick!! I don't think I've been anywhere with faster service - and even firing the busiest of morning breakfast hours!! The kitchen crew is crazy organized and efficient.  The food is FABulous!! Yum yum!! My favorite is the skinny skillet. So freakin good. My husband is a big muscular guy and he easily is fueled up by the food, too. We will definitely keep coming back. Love this place!!!! They only take cash or checks which is probably why the prices are so great, too! But if you forget, they have an ATM by the front door. Get in here!!! :-)
Fast Eddie's Diner=Fast Eddie's is one of those places that you forget how good it is until you go back. The prices are dirt cheap and the food is consistent. Three of us can gorge ourselves at breakfast and walk away with a $20 check. The waitresses are all friendly (sort of like that one weird aunt that everyone has). Service can be a little slow if they are busy, so take a does of patience. They have a relatively large menu and you can order off either the breakfast or lunch/dinner as long as they are open... so if you have a hankering for killer buttermilk pancakes and bacon for dinner, it's there for the taking. In addition to their menu, they have daily specials (you know the drill - all you can eat fish Fridays, stuff like that).The decor is a little cheesy - they bought out the inards of the long defunct Ed Debevicks, so they have the old "Eat at Ed's" signs all over. But the shakes are killer good and the pancakes are light and fluffy. What more could you want from your local dinner hang? Not much, unless you are like me and believe that a side of bacon makes everything better!
Greek Wraps=Best wraps ever!!!I was here on Friday the 28th of September, and It was great!!!The place, is modern, well-kept and clean, with lovely images of Greece all over their walls.    *** I decided to go with their Lemon Chicken pita, with the Cesar sauce and the works in veggies, it tasted extremely fresh and healthy to me!!!BEST WRAP so far!!!! Oh so tasty and also well proportioned, I would love to frequent this spot, but its a long drive from my home!! ** One day we will meet again!!! :) **I have been going in this nice and simple place for many times and can't even remember being disapponted because their food is really yummy, affordable and you will get out with full tummy plus you will say thank you The greek wraps for my good lunch :-) always recommended this to my friends.
Pasta Cucina=If I could eat one food everyday for the rest of my life, it would be eggplant parmesan. In my mind eggplant parmesan is a tasty food that is hardly possible to ruin. I am attracted to eggplant parmesan as a duck is to water. With that said I have good things to write about Pasta Cucina.  This is actually my second dining experience in a Pasta Cucina. It is an accidental dining experience. I was in Boulder Station bound for Feast Buffet. So were hundreds of other people. I passed over an expected blah meal in the Grand Cafe. I tried Pasta Cucina. I was very satisfied. Fast forward to a couple of weeks later and I was dining in the Sunset Station Pasta Cucina.  What is surprising is that Pasta Cucina's prices are relatively the same as the Grand Cafe. An example is that spaghetti and meatballs is $7.99 at Grand Cafe. At Pasta Cucina's it was $9.99 and INCLUDED bread sticks with dipping sauces plus a salad or Minnestroni soup. Where Grand Cafe has a decent atmosphere, Pasta Cucina borders on the elegant with the Sunset Station Medditeranian motif. You could say Pasta Cucina is a borderline classy restaurant with Grand Cafe pricing.  When I stepped into Pasta Cucina, which is to the right of Feast Buffet; I observed that the dress code was casual and the noise level average. Throughout the meal, the Waiter was professional and attentive.  A few minutes after ordering, the Waiter placed the warm soft bread sticks on the table. They were served with both mozzarella and ranch sauces. I enjoyed every bite being careful to save my appetite.  The salad with ranch dressing was a taste of the food to arrive. Meanwhile the Waiter was on top of the Pepsi refills. If I was up to an alcohol beverage, the menu features a decent selection of cocktails for $6.   The serving of the three slabs of eggplant parmesan over spaghetti was moderate yet delicious. Although the eggplant parmesan is levels below Chef Mark and Chef Olds, it was slightly better than I remember Olive Garden and Long Island (NY) diners. I had zero issues with the eggplant parmesan and spaghetti. They could of added an additional slab of eggplant parmesan, but I would have little appetite for the cannolis.    After savoring every bite of eggplant parmesan with spaghetti,  I treated my tastebuds to desert. It was two cannolis with a cup of coffee. The delicious taste of the cannolis complimented the quality coffee.  If you are in the vicinity of Sunset Station and enjoy Italian food at Grand Cafe prices, I recommend Pasta Cucina. You live once, why not enjoy delicious Italian food at a price that won't drain your wallet.ITALY IN 15 MINUTESBaked Penne:  meatball, Italian sausage, marinara, mozzarella, Parmesan. Marinara sauce was subdued meaning not very zesty.  Plenty of sausage but the few marble sized meatbals prompted Yu-go to start wondering if the kitchen had forgotten something. Would had preferred more marinara sauce and much less mozzarella. Chose the Minestrone soup to start.Eggplant  Paremesan:  spaghetti marinara, mozzarella, Parmesan. The thin large slices of eggplant coated with seasoned bread crumbs and prepared crisp that went well with the not so al dente spaghetti.  I choose the house salad to start.Dinner includes either:Minestrone Soup:  ditalini pasta, beans, potatoes,  tomato,  peas, spinach, squash, cauliflower. Not spicy but packed with the listed ingredients ... was served lukewarm. House Salad:  Choice of mixed greens, tomato,  cucumber, house dressing; or romaine,  parmesan, croutons, caesar dressing. Went with the romaine, served with a lemon based dressing.  A full salad could be an ideal meal in itself.This restaurant is more than romantic and mimics an every day dream like perfect Italian courtyard filled with lemon trees. Waitstaff is very cordial and constantly monitoring their diners.  Now that we're aware of their cooking style, we can ask up front when ordering for more marinara sauce and less mozzarella. This could be the beginning of a beautiful friendship.Ciao baby.
Tacos Mexico=BEST Tacos Off the Strip!How there are no other reviews of this place IDK!It is always busy, It's Open late It has A drive thru it's Cheap and it is damn good.I almost forgot it's ONLY 5 minutes west of the strip near IN & Out. Check it Out!!I love the carne asada so I always get 6-8 tacos and 2 churros to go. It always hits the spot.I got punished and paid the price for trying a burrito at a place best known for their tacos. It also kinda helps too if I did more researches on things to do and places to eat and avoid when I visit any city. "I know, that is why we have Yelp!"This place is opened 24 hours and a drive-thru, which are the only positives. But my $6.00 "so called" super burrito wasn't what I was expected for a city best known for good food. First of all, I love all my "super burritos" fat, juicy, and wrapped tightly in a aluminum foil. But my burrito from here was small and wrapped loosely. Therefore, all the key ingredients fell apart on me leaving a fat mess. The meat, beans, and rice were also dry. And the chips were stale.I'm an old man and still play with my food. So I dissected my burrito and noticed, "I got ripped off." The shop didn't give me any cheese, guacamole and sour cream. If I wanted those fillings in my super burrito, according to menu I have to pay extra. Now I got it.  I ended up throwing 3/4 of that burrito away and left just finishing my Sidral Mundet sparkling Apple drink, which was refreshing.To find a decent "super" burrito in another city continues.
Tropical Smoothie Cafe=Tropical. Not paradise. This chain smoothie location isn't amazing, but it does the trick. I came here after a four-hour long dentist appointment and needed some sustenance. I didn't feel like driving the extra two minutes down the road to Greens and Proteins, nor did I want to spend nine dollars on a smoothie. Not hating on G&P, just stating a fact. This was probably the first time I walked into Tropical Smoothie and there wasn't a line out the door. I stepped up to order and I waited and waited... finally a person walked up to help. "I'll take the Peanut Paradise please", my order was placed and I waited and waited, and waited. By this point there was now a line out the door and there are only two people working here. Yikes. Finally my order was called, but not before they called out two mystery smoothie orders. When I first walked-in this place was empty, who orders a smoothie and bails? Would I recommend this place, probably not? But if you're the Smoothie-Masochistic type, then this is the place for you.
Black Mountain Grill=This was my 1st trip to @BlkMtnGrill. It's A lodge-like bar & grill with seperate dining room the kitchen is open in the dining room so you can see your meal being made. Really Cool:)After taking a minute to clean up and check the place out-which if you are a hunter you will love it. Very cozy with a fireplace front & center big comfy seats and lots of great decor;-)Since we arrived just before 11- we could order breakfast or lunch and decided to do BOTH.We started off with the cheese plate(cheese & fruit really)-then ordered a 3 item omelette with ham,bacon & cheddar-potaotes & english muffin-also a burger with grilled mushrooms and french fries.(NOTE: Drinks-they serve PEPSI)Service was OUTSTANDING-our drinks were filled quickly and the food was brought out in a timely manner.When the food arrived we knew immediately we were in way over our heads-it was ALOT of food!!The burger was good a little-bit over cooked, the fries were great.The omelette was insane-the was a whole hog in there soooo much ham & bacon:) maybe a little too heavy on the cheese but that was an easy fix:) I like shredded potao hashbrowns myself but the kids loved the country potaotes!!The cheese plate was fantastic with strawberrys,granny smith apples,grapes and raspberries and several different cheeses-my favorite was the smoky cheddar-yummy:)Yeah I know I only tried the bar food but it was damn good.They serve a much more sophisticated menu than the items I ordered so I'm gonna have to go back some Tuesday evening (2 for 1) and try their dinners. Maybe the Stuffed Alaskan Halibut of Petite Beef Wellington;)I knew we'd found the secret best deal spot in town when I walked in and the average age in the dining room was 70 or so. The social security set knows where to get the best food deals in town, and in this case they picked a place with damn tasty food as well. As far as the more "moderately priced" steak type places in town go, take a date to Twin Creeks. If on the other hand you're an old married couple just looking for good meat - this is your spot ! Tuesday night is incredible. All entrees are buy one get one free! This makes their normally reasonably priced steak dinners ($25ish for a filet mignon + 2 sides) INSANELY priced. $12.50 for a filet mignon and 2 sides? WHAT?Let it be known that I'm a steak snob. I've tried to do the $9.99 steak dinner casino rap and ended up throwing it away too many times. I can't do chewy cheap steak. I don't even eat Prime Rib as I find it beneath me. Yup, I said it, I'm the world's biggest steak snob. I went in to this place with pretty low expectations, I mean how the hell can you serve a sizeable filet for $12.50 with sides? The steak here blew me out of the water! SO TENDER, so perfectly cooked, so quality. It was crazy. Honestly it was just a couple ticks below a filet at Hanks. I asked for double green beans to avoid the carby potatoes and they were happy to oblige. The husband got a HUGE ribeye and also liked it, but it wasn't as money as my filet. It was really really good for a cheap ribeye, but it wasn't anywhere close to a Hank's ribeye if you catch my drift. The filet is where it's at!The dining room is comfortable (it's like a lodge inside) and service was really awesome. Wine was fairly priced (we had a fabulous bottle for just $24 that retails for $16! Very low markup for Vegas). They also have very creative specials (think duck, inventive salmon dishes, etc - they post them on their website ahead of time). Unfortunately I've only had this $12.50 Filet mignon dinner once so I'm scared it was a fluke but I really hope it's not . Sometimes in life you don't get what you pay for - you get so much more ! A bottle of wine and 2 steak dinners with sides and bread for $50ish? Crazy I tell you.
Zinc Bistro=Another Food Network find.... Supposedly the best thing cheesy "Chef Beau" ever had was the onion soup from here..... In looking at Zinc it boasts some local awards for its French cuisine... I am on vacation sure why not. Service Stellar. Frankie was super funny, polite and ensured we felt like we were his only table. The food: I did get the onion soup and it was good.Yes the crispy gruyere was yummy and the soup was good but not the best I have had....HOWEVER the scallops were probably the best I have had in a while. I got the scallops with black lentils and mustard cream... I give those two thumbs and a snap around the world. They were perfectly seared, sweet, buttery and huge. The lentils were firmer than I am used to but not unpleasant. The mustard cream was a perfect topper. We also got the parma/truffle fries were good. The fries were not greasy, crispy and the aiolis that accompanied them were a good complement. The curried chicken sandwich was well liked by my boyfriend. Other things ordered at our table: duck confit sandwich, chicken salad and house fries.  Overall: great place to grab some lunch, excellent service, don't believe the hype about the onion soup.09/23/10My first of two Restaurant Week 2010 experiences began at Zinc Bistro.  Let me preface that I took Mom w/ me, and it was this meal's experience that I have learned never to take her to a place that ranks higher than a "moderate" in terms of costs.  It doesn't matter that she's not the one paying, and I refuse to let someone, not even my mother, dissuade me from enjoying a great meal!We'd arrived 30 minutes before dinner service, and Mom was already hungry.  I tried stalling for about 15 minutes, looking over the off-hour menu for something for her to nibble on.  (We also found it difficult to flag down someone to help us during our stay here, even though it wasn't busy!)  I decided I'd get her the open-faced Zinc Burger, which was listed at $13.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zinc-bistro-scottsdale?select=MgpZeM3N2f8wi6EuEbjd3A#MgpZeM3N2f8wi6EuEbjd3A  The menu didn't list a side dish accompanying it, so I asked our server if there were any fries or salad that came w/ it.  No was the answer.  This angered my Mom, who did not wish for me to pay $13 for just a burger.  She only had the ambience (of which she thought wasn't great) and the arrogance of our server to go on; I knew of Chef Matt Carter's reputation, as well as Chef Beau MacMillan's endorsement of the best French onion soup (at Zinc Bistro) he's ever tasted on Food Network's episode of Best Thing I Ever Ate: Cheesy.  Those 25 minutes waiting for the burger to arrive were the longest 25 minutes I've ever experienced in my life, no exaggeration!  Thank God that when the burger finally did arrive, that it was a VERY tasty burger!  Of course, she wouldn't admit this to me.  No... I only learnt of her approval when our server had asked us later on if we were enjoying our food-- a very enthusiastic yes was her reply!My restaurant week meal thus followed: 1st course: Smoked Scottish salmon tartare- green apple, creme fraiche, and toasted brioche.  A truly lovely dish to gaze at, and even more wonderful to taste!  I loved the texture of the salmon- very creamy, and the cubed hard-boiled eggs added some fun mouth-feel!  This dish made me think I was eating salmon sushi w/o the rice!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zinc-bistro-scottsdale?select=z--Qcv88vRbjCa_KUDY7Hw#z--Qcv88vRbjCa_KUDY7Hw2nd course: Seared Ahi Tuna- preserved lemon creamy orzo, roasted beet, and fennel.  Another winner!  Great presentation-- seared ahi tuna chunks, w/ red centers atop wonderfully creamy orzo (Mom's first time trying orzo... she loved it!), with a beet reduction glazing the dish.  Really enjoyed the meaty tuna chunks, which tasted fresh-from-the-sea and not "fishy" at all.  Again, the orzo added great texture contrast to the meaty fish-- I enjoyed this dish so much, I had the leftovers for breakfast the next day! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zinc-bistro-scottsdale?select=SHDk_-fvZRXr4O82qOEKFg#SHDk_-fvZRXr4O82qOEKFg3rd course: Apple "Tart Tatin" Brown Butter Caramel, which really wasn't a tart tatin.  It wasn't even a pie, which was a bit disappointing.  It consisted of a cake that looked like angel cake but had the texture of a pound cake, apple-flavored, and quite dry.  Not even the brown butter caramel sauce nor the house-made ice cream could save it. :( [I was told it was either a cream cheese, sour cream, or buttermilk- based, but all I tasted was vanilla.]  My favorite components of this dessert were the three, caramelized and very thin-sliced pieces of apple.  We also enjoyed the French-pressed coffee, which also came w/ one piece of biscotti each, that I chose to accompany this "tart tatin."  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zinc-bistro-scottsdale?select=M8rhOQyLbDHHNTSq7nF6gw#M8rhOQyLbDHHNTSq7nF6gwhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zinc-bistro-scottsdale?select=sXKSvx7P8pLPKLeZPdLHeQ#sXKSvx7P8pLPKLeZPdLHeQ4 stars overall for the food, and less than 3 stars for the arrogance and absenteeism of our server and for the ambience.  (We didn't like the flow of the rooms: the tables were too close to each other, and while there was a lovely mini-Eiffel Tower on display, on its base sat containers filled w/ artificial sweeteners- a bit tacky, I thought.)  I wouldn't mind ordering the Zinc burger again, but please add a side dish to it!  And lose the arrogant servers.  Unless, of course, they have sexy French accents to go along w/ their dispositions!  (Pa dum dum!)As a general rule it is a bad sign when a restaurant is too dark to read the menu (and presumably see your food). Another general rule is that a waiter starting with a terse "no" will lead to a bad evening. Lastly the manager not acknowledging an issue and even trying to deflect it indicates that no good will ever come from the dinning experience. Fortunately we left before getting started and am better for it.Having researched Zinc Bistro  I was excited to eat there. Unfortunately when we got there in the evening we found the interior to be very dark. Dark enough that it was hard to read the menu (I have very good eyesight). My wife politely asked if they could turn up the lights and the waiter responded with a terse "NO" and then proceed to offer to get us a flashlight. I talked to the manager about the waiters attitude and the issue of the lighting and he was dismissive and deflected the issue saying that they had alot of flashlights around. We also noticed that other patrons where using their iPhones to illuminate the menu so it wasn't just us. All I have to ask is why in the world if you know it is an issue (to the point of having several flashlights ready) would you subject your patrons to the inconvenience. We left and will never return. There are so many options for great dining (e.g. Roka Akor) in Scottsdale, don't waste your time on a restaurant that doesn't deliver even basic customer service. The choice is yours.I. loved. this. place.my favorite spot I tried while in AZ this week. it was so good I was longing for my favorite Uptown girl to be there dining with me.i started off with a cocktail called rye direction. that was definitely a step in the...I had the Scottish salmon with onion ravioli. every last bite had more flavor than Public Enemy. I was blown away and damn near licked the plate clean. and then to follow it up with the bread pudding - which is such an understatement, because it is so, so much more. I forget how it is referred to in French; please accept my apologies.my colleague ordered the chocolate soufflé that was oooooowee goodie good. (I finish off all of her desserts after she has a couple bites.)this would be a great date spot. I would definitely come here again if ever in the area.*rubs magic lamp*
Boomer's Bar=Hellz, yeah, Boomers!Who doesn't like boobies??  You can't find that person.  I challenge you!Live Burlesque has their monthly show here and it is fantastic!  I like that you can reserve a booth so you can feel like a big shot Rat Pack member whilst watching the sparkly ladies take off their unmentionables!Drinks are totally reasonable.  Not over-priced like you'll find on the strip!Come to the Halloween show!  Yours truly will be performing along with a stellar cast.  A good time will be had, for certain!
Goldmans Deli=9/15My first visit, and probably my last for awhile.  Loved the pastrami and corned beef combo on marbled-rye, but found the slightly-under $12 price tag too high for a sandwich, chips, and a pickle.  I will note that I was able to squeeze four small, but ample, meals out of this: two with the marbled-rye, and another two meals from the leftover meat cuts with bread from home.  I might stop over and buy some deli cuts to enjoy at home, but I find the price paid repulsive, esp. when I drive many miles to dine out at least three days a week!BTW, I chose to eat one-half of the sammy at nearby Crust, which explains the background.Okay, after 17 reviews that received either one or five stars, I'm actually writing a two star review (technically, I'd give them 2.5 stars but there's no mechanism for that). I feel it's my duty, being a transplanted east coast Jew, to weigh in on Jew food here in the valley.First, the positives: the food was pretty good. They didn't put any of those annoying coatings on their fries and when I said "extra lean" I got a corned beef sandwich w/o any fat. They also stocked one of my favorite sodas, a deli staple, called Doc Brown's diet black cherry. Yum!That doesn't sound too bad. So why the 2.5 stars, you ask? Okay, the negatives: the negatives all center around price. I paid $10 for a SMALL sandwich and fries. Now, don't get me wrong, I got enough to eat. But that's not the way a Jewish deli works. Half a sandwich and a side should be enough to eat. It is at every other Jewish deli I've ever been to. That way you can share or save the rest for later. Plus, I asked for an extra pickle. How dare I?! Little did I know when I made the request that they were going to charge me $1 FOR A FREAKIN' PICKLE SPEAR!!! THAT'S LIKE AN EIGHTH OF A PICKLE!!! I couldn't believe it! Add to that the cost of my beloved Doc Brown's $2.49 and I'm quickly going broke. But wait, there's more. I dared to order pastry.Now, there are several reasons I ordered pastry and none of them are particularly startling. First off, I'm never in a Jewish deli so I couldn't let the opportunity pass. Secondly, I'm a real sucker for apricot pastry and they had two different kinds. Third, they had mandelbrot, which is prominently featured in my novel so I wanted to try theirs and see if it's any better than what I get from Simply Bread (it wasn't). Though I only had nibbles of each of the three small pieces, just to try them, I paid $3.30 for the privilege.Will I go back there again? Probably not. While the food was okay, I feel like I was mugged. Kinda leaves a bad taste in the mouth. One even good Jew food can't get rid of.Goldman's is a prime example of a delicious deli that was hiding right in front of my face! Yes, I've passed by Goldman's hundreds of times and it's a small sin that it took me this long to step foot inside. But, now I have and I am happy to report that this is going to be added to my rotation immediately! First, I like that Goldman's has some serious pride in their love of Chicago. It's nice to see a deli with some passion and this deli is definitely passionate about their food and the Windy City. The menu has it all...burgers and grilled cheese to brisket and pastrami. Let's not also forget about matzah ball soup and other classic Jewish deli cuisine. I decided to try their famous hot pastrami sandwich. My bf has the brisket so I was able to try both! I think I liked the brisket better then the pastrami but the pastrami was also delicious. The food is definitely meat happy so come with an appetite or you'll be leaving half the sandwich on the plate like me. I don't think I would stay and eat here, but it's a very worth deli for on the go! PS -- they also serve breakfast starting at 8 AM!So, I'm always on the hunt for a good Deli, especially out here where they seem to be non existent.  I saw another reviewer talk about this place recently on yelp, and thought that I MUST go check it out.  I can't believe I've lived here for 7 years and never heard of this place. How is this possible?Anyways, Scott W and I came here and I really liked it.  I think its probably the best Deli that I've had since having moved here.  For starters, they have a really great full menu. TONS to choose from, and a small deli case with some side items in there to choose from.Some of the things that won me over about this deli are the following. For starters, they serve Beet Borscht.  This, my friends, is by far one of my absolute favorite Jewish dishes.  My grandpa and grandma would make this from scratch when I was growing up, and bring it over to the house when I was a kid. It was always a treat to eat, and I haven't found anything as good since.  There's a few deli's in Michigan that serve it, but nothing out here that I would recommend.  I didn't get a bowl of it here, but the fact that they serve cold beet borscht is going to make me come back and visit again.Secondly, they have real gefilte fish!  They serve it by the piece here, and it looked like it was supposed to look in the case...large with a carrot on top.  This, my friends, is the way to my heart.In regards to my food, I really enjoyed my brisket sandwich.  I got it on challah with a side of fries.  Really really good, and it came with au jus sauce. I was able to plow through half the sandwich, and brought the other half home for later.It was also a really a good sign to see other Jewish grandmas in there when we ate.  As someone who is not only Jewish, but has a high bar for Jewish food expectations, this place is awesome. I do plan on going back in the future for more, as I was really happy with my experience here.  Plenty of seating indoors and out, I really wish they had waitstaff instead of ordering from the counter.  This is a million times better then Chompies any day of the week, and I will gladly drive back here in a heartbeat to get more food.Solid place, worth the drive.  Go check it out if you want good Deli done the way its supposed to be.
I-Mart=The meat shop in the back offers some good selections for you. It is very convenient to pick up from their refrigerated section or if you have a special order of halal goat, or cut up chicken etc then you just go in the back and talk to the butcher who quickly prepares it for you. A lot of people also choose to order over the phone and pick it up. We were so disappointed over the last few months with Baiz market for their meat selections and offerings(their halal ground beef is just gross, even the extra lean ground beef is awful )  that we finally made the switch to I-Mart after 5 years of exclusively purchasing our meat from Baiz originally. The meat and prices are incomparable to Baiz as I-Mart certainly offers a better selection in meat and their prices are slightly cheaper plus we don't have to deal with any attitude from the butchers like at Baiz. I am glad we finally found this place. They also carry a bunch of Indian and Pakistani spices, indian desserts, whole wheat flour from India etc.
New York Bagels 'N Bialys=Picked up a dozen bagels & bialys and sampled the corned beef.  Unfortunately the corned beef is at best a good goyashe corned beef, not Kosher or Kosher style.The bagels and bialys were top notch though.  Great selection.  What's the difference between a bagel and a bialy?  A bagel is boiled before baking, a bialy is not.  Bagels have a chewier hide.If you enjoy noshing on bagels (or bialys) I recommended getting them here.  It's about 9 bucks for a dozen and they are so much better than anything you'll find at the grocery.  We're talking east coast quality bagels here.This place reminds me of a mullet. Business in the front, and party in the back. In front, this place has all the characteristics of a hardworking, economically priced and noteworthy bagel/bialy business.But in the back, they have a full-blown, totally stacked, BAR! Party time, baby!New York Bagels 'N Bialys cracks me up. For the life of me, I will never understand this place. NYBB is an eerie combination of bagels and booze. Totally random and off the wall - just like my personality, and probably why I enjoy this place. I know it's hard, but try not to judge this book by its cover.Their bagels and bialys are my favorite circular delights in the valley. I'd never even heard of a bialy until Matt and I randomly stumbled upon this spot one hung over morning. I came to realize that bialys are awesome! Instead of getting boiled before being baked like a bagel, a bialy skips the boiling part and just gets baked. Their bialys come in almost all the same flavors as their bagels.NYBB does breakfast and brunch really well. When I used to live in the 85254, I came here almost every weekend. First of all, they make really great nonfat lattes, mimosas and road rash bloody marys. The coffee is around $2-3 depending on what espresso drink you desire, and it's cheaper/tastier than Starbucks. From the breakfast/brunch menu, my favorite dish is the veggie omelet but all the omelets are pretty delish. They have every ingredient combination imaginable, you can sub egg whites, and you get the following sides: a bagel or bialy and cream cheese, in addition to your choice of home fries (greasy deliciousness), cottage cheese, french fries, tomatoes or a potato pancake.I also recommend the house breakfast specials. The bagel with nova lox is to die for and the breakfast burrito is filling but it won't make you feel like an oinker. They also have egg bagels with cheese & bacon, sausage or ham! Oink Oink!I've never been here specifically for lunch or dinner but I have tried a pizza bagel from their lunch menu for brunch. They start at $3.49, and then you can add on your own toppings for 50 cents each! No pre-made garbage here my friends, just deliciousness. As a note, I'm only rating this place of breakfast/brunch and happy hour but FYI, they've got: sandwiches, salads, regular pizzas, nachos, quesadillas, chopped liver & bagels, potatoes and gravy, macaroni & cheese, desserts made from scratch, soups, smoked fish, burgers... oh, and they also cater. Basically, they try to accomplish too much with just one restaurant. Food wise, your best bet is to stick to the bagels, breakfast menu and pizza bagel (the desserts look good too).Then... after you finish business as usual for breakfast... you can come back!! Not only does this place change its name to the Rush Café in the evening but they also get the party started with $1.50 domestics from 4-7pm during their happy hour!!! Your buzz will be buzzing with wine, champagne, premium spirits and cocktails. Whatever your little heart desires!NYBB is one of the cheapest breakfast spots I've found. The wait staff ensemble does consist of a crazy cast of characters (they are all a little "different") but they provide excellent service. Everyone here enjoys engaging customers in conversation.Therefore, instead of giving yourself a mullet (if you do please send pictures), just come here! At NYBB you get business in the front and party in the back, without having to cut your hair.I wouldn't dare compare any of our delis in the Valley to those you'll find in New York.  Hell, the delis we have in Arizona don't even come close to the delis I group up going to in Detroit.  But, I've recently become very fond of New York Bagels 'N Bialys.  Not only do they have close to four dozen different varieties of bagels and bialys, but they have history... they've been around since 1987; they have fabulous service (thanks to Angela, who was my waitress the last two visits), they are kid friendly, ad they make a good bagel with lox and omelette.  They also have a check-in offer on the yelp app... check it out!I'm sure I'll be back to visit NYBNB soon... as a matter of fact, I already have a date planned with friends to return again during Passover.  Matzoh Brie, here I come!One last thing: the prices here may be higher than what you'll find elsewhere, but I do think the quality is worth it.This place has good bagels, but tepid service. I get bagels to go, and the last time I was there the kid making the bagels had no food service gloves on, and was taking money, making bagels, etc. Not the end of the world, but it does kind of junk you out. Another odd thing is that when you like your bagels double toasted, for some reason they put SO much butter on, it's almost like the bagel is deep fried. I haven't been back since the kid had poor food hygiene practices, but I need to get back there.
Sam Woo BBQ Restaurant=The DYL crew was hungry and seeing as I know my way around town, I suggested some Chinese food.  That seemed to pique everyone's interest...the hungry group was ready to go as soon as I had mentioned it.   We managed to cram 8 people in the backseats of the Jeep Commander. Luckily, as the driver, I didn't have to feel like a sardine.  We headed toward Chinatown Plaza and reached our destination and piled out like clowns at the circus.  Sam Woo's was a blessing to many who thought they'd only be eating at the casino's the whole trip.I've been to Sam Woo's many times and have not been disappointed with the food.  It's typical HK/Cantonese food and reasonable for an individual or group.  They have Chinese BBQ, which includes roasted duck, roasted pork, BBQ pork, salted chicken, and soy sauce chicken, as well as other staples such as chow mein, chow fun, porridge, won ton, and other meat, vegetable, and seafood creations.  For this particular feast, we decided on a beef chow fun, chicken chow mein, honey walnut prawns, roast duck, bbq pork, spicy tofu, salted pork chops, Chinese broccoli, and Westlake soup.  Everything tasted good and seemed to satisfy everyone's palate.  The Asian restaurant row along Spring Mountain Road has grown over the years, and there are probably similar restaurants that can deliver the same or better quality than Sam Woo.  But it's nice to have a goto place that you can rely on when you're craving Chinese food in Vegas.B.A.R.F. Somehow we ended up here on 12.28.2008 instead of Ichiza (http://www.yelp.com/biz/ichiza-las-vegas) or Harbor Palace (http://www.yelp.com/biz/harbor-palace-seafood-restaurant-las-vegas).  BIG Mistake.  Long waits.  Poor service.  *Mediocre* food.  This is nothing like the Sam Woo BBQ in the Los Angeles Chinatown (http://www.yelp.com/biz/sam-woo-b-b-q-restaurant-los-angeles), which I was quite fond of from 1990-1999. 1 STAR for the decent Pork Chop with Spicy Salt.  Better food and better service at Food Express (see: http://www.yelp.com/biz/food-express-chinese-restaurant-las-vegas).  No go for Sam Woo LV.This place used to be my favorite Chinese restaurant in Vegas. What the hell happened? I told myself that I wouldn't mind paying a 15 dollar cab ride(one way) to Chinatown to eat here but it was terrible this time. The won tons here used to be great. The roasted duck was awesome. It's just not the same anymore. I hate to say this but I think MGM's Grand Wok is a lot better than this place. Not only that...........the prices are comparable to casino restaurants. After the cab fare...........Sam Woo is probably more expensive. A real disappointment.For a real decent Chinese restaurant off the strip................try Joyful House.  They have the best soy sauce supreme shrimps.  It's more of a dinner place but I love their food.My sister came to Vegas a couple of months ago and was raving about the roast duck she chowed on from Sam Woo.  She lives in San Francisco, and my parents were very skeptical about her excitement about this fabulous duck that she begged them to fly back with on their recent visit. (They refused.)The Husband and I wanted to see if it was all quacked up as she said it was supposed to be.  Mission: Roast duck to go.We did the quick take out side, although a peek at the menu definitely reflects that it's a better deal to take out if you can.$12 for half a roast duck$19 for whole roast duckIt was pretty easy to go for the whole duck.  We also ordered a couple of boxes of steamed rice as well so we could eat on the run.It was good - but then again, we haven't had any other roast duck in Vegas and it's been a long time since we've had roast duck in general.  Sure, I've had fattier ducks though than what Sam Woo offered, but there was definitely a good flavor in there.  The skin is the best part, but they could definitely have more meat on them.We ate half last night and the other half tonight.  We think we got a pretty good deal on the duck and we were satisfied with that.I spent some time living in SoCal, so I've had a few visits to Sam Woo BBQ there.  It definitely has me looking for other places that serve up roast duck though.Cash only on the take out side.Was a bit skeptical having lunch here because of all the negative reviews, but we came based on my cousin's recommendation who lives in Vegas and has eaten here numerous time.The positives:+ Food came out very fast.  We were very hungry, so this was a bonus.+ Food was tasty.  We had: beef chow fun, kung pao chicken, roast duck, roast pork, scallops with vegetables, choi sum, fried calamari. The negatives:- Cash only. - Extremely RUDE service.  Staff was more interested in eating their own lunch than taking our order of filling our water cups.  Actually, they never filled our water cups, just plopped a pitcher of water on our table and walked away.  As a matter of fact, that's how all of our dishes were delivered - server just dropping the dish on our table and walking away.  Never asked us how we were doing or if we needed anything.  Also forgot to give us the rice we ordered - had to remind the waiter.  Only made an attempt at being pleasant when it was time to deliver the bill.Won't be going out of our way to eat here again.CRAPPIEST CHINESE JOINT I'VE EVER EATEN AT! AVOID! I don't want to give it one star, but there's not an option for NO STARS on here. This place is CRAP.It's located in Chinatown about 10 minutes away from the Las Vegas strip. My family and I entered and waited to be seated. We waited for about 5 minutes. The joint was pretty empty except for two tables. We really shouldn't be waiting that long since there is a hostess stand, but the hostess was no where to be found. Weird...Anyways, we were seated and were immediately asked in Mandarin what we wanted. My mom asked them to speak in English and the waitress said, "What do you want?". Rude much. We ordered and our food came 10 minutes later.What we found most surprising? Charging for rice. We're Chinese and we frequent Chinese restaurants a lot and it's always complimentary rice whenever you order a dish. We ordered roast duck, soup, beef and broccoli, and the beef chow fun. We asked for rice and they gave us two small bowls and there's five grown adults here. I see other tables had the large red containers of rice while we didn't. When we got the check, they added 18% to 20% gratuity even though we were not a table of six. On their menu, it says they add in gratuity for tables six or more. We didn't want to tip at all, but they already included it. Don't dine here unless you want to be mistreated. There are numerous plazas and restaurants (pho/Vietnamese, Japanese, etc) surrounding this crappy place.  The service sucks as the servers are lazy and give you attitude if you try to get their attention. Also, PLEASE speak Chinese to them if you MUST dine here. My mother made the mistake of NOT speaking Chinese which I think made them believe we weren't Chinese and thus, gave us bad service.
Chase's Diner=Better than an average 3 star, for sure!  It reminds me of a Johnny Rockets or a nicer 5 & Diner.  The first thing I noticed was how clean it was.  All polished stainless steel and freshly wiped down red booths.  I almost felt like I was in a circuit board clean room.The food? Ohhhhh the food!  I split a swiss mushroom burger with the wife and I got my young one a kid's cheeseburger meal.  I really wish I would have ordered more, but the current status of our yackonomy advised me against it.The other food coming out looked ridiculously delectable, and it was brought out with the haste of an olympic sprinter.  Who could ask for more?I will definitely be coming back to here and recommending it to my friends.  Its well worth the 2 block drive from my house.  Did I mention they have breakfast!  I'm so there!
Yoko Fast Food=I love local run shops! I love when the owners are friendly with their cliental. This was my 1st time to Yoko, but I have to say I'm sure it won't be my last!   I ordered the orange chicken bowl, and now if you're thinking panda express chicken man you are off base. This is fresh orange chicken, with slices of fresh orange rinds in the sauce. It was a clean orange taste, very delish!  Was impressed.I'm from the Los Angeles area, the mecca of all good eats. So, believe me when I say this, there really isn't anything good to eat in Arizona.That said, Yoko is one of the very few places that I frequent when I'm in the area. It is definitely on par with, if not better than, most of the Asian/Japanese fast food joints in LA. Allow me to explain why this is the case.1. The food is freshly prepared from scratch. (In this day and age, few businesses can lay claim to this kind of practice because it is, dare I say it, honest) The orange chicken is my favorite item because, as names should suggest, the sauce is actually made with real oranges and the meat undeniably comes from chickens. I have asked the friendly, elderly Asian man (presumably the owner) on a number of occasions for the recipe for the awesome teriyaki sauce. No surprise, it is a closely guarded family secret - and with good reason.2. Some have commented about the decor of this establishment. I believe that this is a ridiculous criticism leveled at the restaurant owners. Take your pathetic sensitivity elsewhere. This is a casual, family-operated, fast food restaurant, not PF Chang's. (And if you're eating at PF Changs, I question your tastes) If anything, I am fond of the modest decor of Yoko because it isn't distracting. The owners have focused on bringing the customer an affordable, delicious meal. This is commendable. You should focus on your meal as well.3. The business is family-operated. The employees are genuine people and I always appreciate interacting with them at a level beyond my order. One reviewer commented that he/she was offended because an associate shared his/her gun control views. This is laughable. I guess freedom of speech stops short of restaurant and small business owners.Trust me on this one. Yoko provides excellent food and service at a reasonable price. It is definitely worth your time and money.
The Good Egg - Hilton Village=I don't know what I was expecting... I thought this would be a nice place for a nice breakfast... I was expecting frills... and boy was I disappoitned! My mom had breakfast there with a friend at the downtown location and loved it. So when we were on a shopping excursion to scottsdale this was the natural place to go for breakster. We entered the CRAZY busy resturant that was all hustle and bustle... I was excited. We sat down and pour ourselves some water and ordered our food. We laughed at the silly egg-centric western themed paintings and waited for our food. When it arrived it was a bit of a let down. The eggs benedict were mushy. I wish the english muffin was toasted more and the hollandaise was luke warm at best and became cold before I was done with my meal. It didn't help that the skillet they served it in was ice cold! I would have preferred it on a warm plate. The country potatos aren't anything great - but they aren't anything terrible eaither.  My mom loved her sun devils egg scramble with bell pepers and onions. Everything really reminded me of Denny's and Ihop. Nothing was substantial, other than the rudeness of my fellow diners. One woman sat and picked at her teeth with her bare hands! Mouth WIDE open and everything!! Another man came in without shoes!! not even flip flops! WTF?! I thought this was Scottsdale?! The hell?!To my fellow yelpers: it's nothing great, save your money and your time and try somewhere else.A classic breakfast joint that always serves up a tasty breakfast! I've been coming to The Good Egg for so many years, I can't remember the first time I visited. However, over the years, I've always known that Good Egg was there waiting for my visit. Consistency is perfected with The Good Egg and no matter the location, I always know I'm going to get quick service and classic breakfast food. Some say that breakfast tastes the same no matter where you go and I agree to a certain degree. When you perfect a classic, why switch it up? There are some who have created a unique twist on the classics, but The Good Egg is more about the classics (in a good way). They serve up pancakes, french toast, skillets, healthy start meals, omelets and a variety of Eggs Benedict. They also have a lunch menu but I typically stick to breakfast. You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu and if you are looking for a classic breakfast at a reasonable price, this is your spot. Be warned that they do get crowded on the weekends,
Buono's Pizza=Ugh, I just made my first Yelp retraction.  I wrote a review of Buono's right before they switched over to new management.  When I got the text from a friend, a twice a week customer to Buono's that they switched owners and the food is now garbage... it was like a family member died.  We had our daughters birthday here, our son and I used to go to lunch here every Saturday.... This was our family establishment.  Sure enough my family had to try the food with the new ownership.  The pizza was garbage.  It was cheapened up... how could it be?  I was in denial.  Maybe it was an off night.  That's allowed right?  So we tried it again, this time I didn't even want to eat pizza.  I tried the meatball parm sammy (which was always my go to meal) it was horrible.  Soggy bread with tasteless meatballs... what struck me the most was this was a Friday night... it was a ghost town!  Two tables sitting at 6:30 and a 20 minute wait for the pizza.  Back in the day on a Friday night, the place was packed and an hour wait for the pizza.  Well, it looks like I am back to square one.  I need to find a pizza place.  I am so  bummed that a place I gave 2 five star reviews now get's 1 star.  Gone are the days....After watching my sister try on wedding dress after wedding dress after wedding dress after freaking wedding dress all day, pizza and Netflix sounded like a well-earned evening. I wanted to shake things up from our normal pizza routine (two other NY Style places, one in Mesa and one on Arizona Avenue in Chandler) and finally got around to trying Buono's Pizza this weekend. It's been on my bookmarks for years with several recommendations from friends, five minute drive around the block, can't hurt.Called in a 14-inch Neapolitan Pizza with Pepperoni ($13.95 pre-tip). The lady on the phone was friendly, and let us know that it'd be ready in 20 minutes.Walk in, and the place is pretty cool. Nothing fancy, but covered wall to wall with New York Sports Teams Memorabilia and other affiliated decor. Divey. My kind of place! Got home ready to tear into some pizza and the Netflix cue. Slight layer of grease typical of NY Style Pizza? Check. Crust that's still substantial and crispy despite said layer of grease? So far, so good! The pizza wasn't horrible; however, nothing stood out about it in terms of flavor . . .  And this was a very simple order, the ingredients should SHINE! Bland sauce and unexciting cheese blend. Perhaps Buono's was just having an off night, but I found their pizza to just be average. Not the first place on my list next time I want to have a lazy evening in.
Cheba Hut=So met my best friends in the world, Z and Dally, here for lunch today. I drove the 33 miles to Mesa in order to try a sub that I have been told is amazing. So, having trusted Z on many a thing and as he would tell you, always trust him when it comes to food, I was gleefully happy at the end of my eating experience. There are a lot of subs to choose from and it took me about 5 minutes to finally decide on the La Canna. Salami and ham with provolone and olives. Get it on the garlic-herb bread. Have the happy dude behind the counter throw on some spicy mustard, lettuce, tomato, onion, oil & vinegar, Parmesan, and oregano. The sub is toasted and doesn't shred the rough of your mouth, which happens to me quite frequently. I was still not satiated after this sub, so I split the White Widow with Z. Marinated chicken, bacon, provolone and ranch dressing. Again another great sub. The employees were all in a good mood. Not sure if that was herb induced or not, but it was pleasant. Phylis behind the register was particularly kind. She came complete with the stereotypical stoner laugh. She's cute. It was totally worth the drive and I will be back in the future to try something else.roll, roll, roll your joint. twist it at the end. take one puff, that's enough. pass it to a friend. ya sonnnn, i love this place. that song gets stuck in my head every time i go to cheba hut... the same way the jingle bells gets stuck in my head during christmas. i'm festive that way. i like the chicken with marinara on garlic herb. i add black olives, parm and oregano. ya son. then i top it off with a bite of one of their crazy rice krispy treats- reeces puffs, coco krispies and cinnamon toast crunch joined together by holy matrimony (aka marshmellow cream) is my idea of the perfect cereal  menage a' trois. those weird little kelloggs elves have NOTHING on the cheebs concoctions. i love people watching here, is everyone high except for me? the employees are so nice. i genuinely think they care when they ask me how my day is. so sincere. and they ask for my ID, so thumbs up on preventing theft. however, since im the only sober person there i have noticed the dust bunnies accumulating on their toaster. time to dust.
Manuel's Mexican Restaurant - Tempe=Finally, a Mexican joint in Tempe I can rank with some of the best places in Phoenix.  We've been looking around for a while now to find a spot that is on the same level as Mi Patio or La Santisima.  This is it.  There have been a lot of disappointments and "pretty good" places, but the prize for best Mexifood in Tempe goes to Manuel's.For between $10 and $15, you get a big, hot plate of food with a smile from your server.  Every bite of my enchilada was loaded with cheese and meat, with a taste far more complex than that of most of the Mexican places in town.Manuel's has been around for a while, so they know how to serve you right.  Apart from the good taste of the food, our server and even the manager came around frequently to check in on taste, drink refills, or just to see if we wanted something.  Because of this, Manuel's is now our go-to place for a sit down Mexican meal in town.I have been coming here for many years. I had not been here for about 4 years now. So a long over do visit!This place is simple, simple and good!  It is very clean inside, including the restroom.The staff is great. We had a great male server. Sorry to say I cannot remember his name.  Chips and Salsa fresh and great!   Enchiladas are fresh and tasty.  I did not realize that Mexican food could be so bad till I went to a place in Scottsdale called , Jalapeno inferno! Because, of my Visit there I found how much I really appreciate Fresh, good Mexican food.This place is worth your time. Worth your Money. Good price as well. Get it a go!
Islands=Adequate - it filled me up and was convenient to where I was at.I was going to give it two stars for "Meh, I've experienced better" but the wings were pretty good, so I upped a star.  The wings had a good sauce on them, vinegary and spicy, and they were crispy.  They could have been a little bigger and meatier. The burger I ordered was a little overwhelming in flavors, and I actually had to stop eating it before it was gone.  The burger itself was rather small for a restaurant burger, slightly bigger than a patty from In-n-Out.  The fries were real potatoes that were nice and crispy, but not outstanding.The atmosphere was pure chain, through and through.  The service was adequate but not exactly great.I wouldn't go out of my way to go back, but if it was convenient I wouldn't say no.Islands... Something about the name in collaboration with the tropical sign that makes you feel like you are going to a wonderful amusement park for adults.  A place where you can relax on a beach with endless Mai Tais and feast on rotisserie style pig with pineapples.  Where dolphins spray you with mist from their little snorkel holes and Ariel gives you a lap dance. Okay, I probably took that a little too far, but you get the idea.As a matter of fact, the REAL Islands isn't much different than my fantasy restaurant in the Bahamas.  I mean, take away the dolphins, the pig, and the pornographic Disney character and you are right on the money!  Their drinks are marvelous and their burgers are insane!!! I mean psychiatric ward insane! You can take your 80 year old granny to Islands, and one bite of the Bluenami, and she will be ON the table doing the Arsenio Hall "Woo! Woo!"... It just does that to people.  That is why the LAST time I visited this place, I stayed FAR away from the burgers.I got the nachos.  I mean really, how can you go wrong with nachos? You can't, and believe me... Islands DELIVERED! It wasn't your typical 2 foot pile of tortilla chips with cheese and everything else.  It was a beautifully made craft of corn tortillas. The binding agent was an aromatic and delicious blend of cheeses that also cooled the palette from those commercial jalapenos.  It arrived with glistening globules of sour cream. The fresh stuff. I could have just stuck my spoon in it and eaten it all by itself. I didn't, of course... That would be nacho sacrilege!!! Olives, Beans, and Hot Sauce... enough said, right? I think so.The service was impeccable.  Aside from our waiter constantly calling me "Boss" and winking at my wife, it was perfection... I can't STAND to be called "Boss"... Seriously. No, really.
Gameworks=Wow. I thought I'd been to a Gameworks before, but this isn't the place I remember. Puts Dave & Busters to shame. Shame, brother. Hung out for a couple hours there this afternoon with my lil bro and man, we had a blast. Price-wise you can't beat the 2 hour unlimited play for $15 we hit. Don't think that's available all the time, but it was today. Score.  Service was actually really good too - what kind of service do you really need at an arcade? Well, not having been in one quite like this, it was kind of nice to have someone patiently explain the swipe card system (no pockets full of quarters anymore), not to mention the layout of the place (which is huge - two floors!). The selection's incredible - everything from your typical racing games, shooting games and fighting games to basketball and skee ball and air hockey - there's even stuff I've never seen before, like a Karoake booth and jumping games (?) and roller coaster simulators. And as one reviewer mentioned, there are several that even require a seatbelt. A seatbelt. Sweet.
Chart House=The chocolate lava cake alone gets this place 4 stars. You place your order for it at the beginning of you meal because it takes quite some time to bake. There is a cute little lake/pond that you can get a window seat next to and watch the ducks. They print out their menu daily (maybe twice a day, I can't remember). My boyfriend loves the fillet here and I've had the sea bass and it was delicious. They also have a very nice salad bar where you can add your own ingredients to the salad and try some of their cold pastas. Our waiter was very attentive and made some great wine suggestions. This place has an upscale atmosphere to it even though most people dress in resort casual wear. It would be a nice place to go for a romantic dinner. *Sign up for their dining program. You get one point for every dollar you spend (not including taxes and tip) and my boyfriend said they accumulate toward free gift certificates.
Henry's American Grill=NIGHT TO REMEMBERWednesday's three plus hour visit to the St. Rose Dignity Health's emergency room eliminated the idea of a home cooked meal. By the time I was released it was already most dark. So, where do you go for late dinner ?  How about trying Henry's American Grill that has been in our Garmin forever.This place is a few doors from Fausto's and across the street from the dreadful DMV. Two entrances, one to the dining room and the other for their smoke filled bar which was full of patrons.  Dining room was occupied by just one group of six and then us two. We pulled up to the small round table adjacent to the open kitchen.Tonight I'm in a mood for something fried. It would have been the chicken fried steak and eggs but they only start serving this after midnight. So how about their Pollack fish and chips. Tonight Yu-go chauffeur can eat a bear and quickly focused on "The Henry" aka "The Hank" their Blackened Prime Rib Sandwich. He asked our server Kali if she would request from the kitchen the closest to a rare cut.While waiting for our meal, we're watching the Chicago Bulls/ Thunder game. Derrick Rose is definitely back. More interesting was the sighting of the NFL TV package banner in front of the kitchen counter. Going to call in before Sunday to see if they'll show the Niners/Jaguar overseas game in the dining room where there's no smoking.The coleslaw, tartar sauce and three large pieces of pollack was plenty filling.  Not to forget their crispy fries.  Yu-go couldn't stop raving about his prime rib sandwich. He said it was the best with the rock salted outer trim, tenderness of the cut topped with a slice of Swiss cheese together with seasoned grilled onions and peppers. He didn't think he could put the sandwich away in one sitting.... how wrong was he. Definitely five stars for "The Henry" or "The Hank" when he eats it again.Kudos to our server Kali who works only on Wednesday evenings. Thanks for all the suggestions and information about Henry's American Grill. Looking forward to returning on Sunday morning and trying out their chicken fried steak and corned beef  hash while watching an NFL action in Wembley Stadium.Update:  Returned for another dinner plus watched a NBA game on TNT. The chicken fried steak was over the top wonderful. Prime rib this time was slightly disappointing.Cannot enjoy and watch sports in this environment with the type of background music being played.  I guess we could have watched the remainder of the game in smoke filled bar. But elected to head to the Sunset Casino for a quieter setting.Located in an obscure mini mall in Henderson, I came here with my friend on a drizzly day in July. When we arrived the restaurant was pretty empty. Just one other table was occupied, so the waitress told us to sit wherever we liked. Henry's has a home-y vibe. Lots of large booths and tables available to accommodate large and small parities alike.Our server approached us quickly for our drink order and returned swiftly with our drinks and carafes for each of us. As someone who requires lots of refills, I was a fan of this. Everything on the menu looked great so it took a while to figure out what we wanted. Our server helped us out by letting us know what her favorites on the menu were. She also explained that everything is made from scratch, so I was already excited about our meal.My friend ordered the Savannah burger with waffle fries and I ordered the fried shrimp with crispy fries and cole slaw. The food came out and it was delicious. My friend's burger was enormous and despite his hearty appetite was only able to finish half before throwing in the towel. My shrimp was tasty and fresh. I really wanted to try their desserts, but we were just too full. We will definitely be back next time for that. Service was friendly and incredibly attentive, as well.Used to be a favorite, Frank was awesome as the head chef however last time I went in I was told he was gone.  It's been a while since I had been back and I am sad to say its not the same.The wings were over cooked, they were supposed to be garlic Parmesan, what used to be a lot of garlic and Parmesan, now is barely garlic and Parmesan.  They just were not the same, they used to be covered in garlic and Parmesan.The BLT was good but again something from the taste was missing.  It seemed like the bacon was not only over cooked but it almost seemed like they are using a different kind then they used to.This was a great place for comfort food now it is just an ok place.  They do not have wifi still so that makes it inconvenient as a place to hang or meet with people if you need Internet access.All in all, this visit was less then spectacular.  I may give it another try some day but there really is no rush after the last two experiences.
Tea Light Cafe=Tea Lite Cafe's offers a quick and delicious meal. Located in the same complex as the Harkins 101 Theater, Babies-R-Us and several other large shops. Tea Lite offers a nice meal option for shoppers and business people alike. I recently visited with Gabi M, who is an expert (in my eyes at least) when it comes to Vietnamese cuisine and luckily I was with her to guide me through the menu. I wanted to get a full taste of Tea Lite Cafe, so we ended up ordering the Tea Lite Special which comes with spring rolls, egg rolls and Pho (choice of chicken or beef). This is absolutely the way to go, especially if you're a first timer! It provided a nice variety and was large enough to share. It's also very inexpensive and less than $9 for the entire dish! I thoroughly enjoyed the Pho and added hot sauce and the various spices.  There's not much to say about the atmosphere because there isn't much to the cafe. It feels like a cafe that you'd find in the busy streets of a big city. It's casual, clean and they featured pictures of the menu items on the wall. The service is incredibly fast too! We barely got our drinks and sat down and our food was already being served! It's perfect for a busy lunch hour. The owner was very friendly and helpful during our ordering process. We ordered a decent amount of food and after our meal, I decided that I wanted to try a BOBA because I had never had one before. However, I only had a credit card and they have a $5 limit. The owner was so nice that he ended up just giving me the BOBA because I had already ordered so much. It showed their level of customer service and his gesture went a long way. Meow, what are you waiting for? It's time for you to visit for lunch!I've been driving by Tea Lite for awhile but never had a desire to try this place but for some reason we decided to try it today. This is a small little place with a few tables outside with umbrellas and with about 8-9 tables inside. So for a big group is can be a little difficult. So you order at the counter and then you find your own table. They bring your food to the table. No number given, no name given. They somehow figure out what you ordered. Interesting. I ordered the Spring rolls to start it off. They looked really good. The rolls were pretty good. There was a lot of vegetables and shrimp. When you put the roll in that peanut dipping sauce, oh my goodness. Really enjoyed it soaking it in that dipping sauce. I ordered the Beef and Egg Roll. What a meal. Grilled beef, noodles, salad, and egg roll. Loved it all. They give you this sauce to dump all over it and it really brought out the taste. Nice tender beef. Nice salad. Really enjoyed the egg roll. Surprisingly, I enjoyed the egg roll more than the spring rolls. This was a really filling lunch and really good. My wife ordered the Chicken Pho. She really liked it. Got to try the chicken. Thinly cut chicken and it was pretty good. My wife was able to finish up her Pho. Only issue was it had a little to much MSG. Little thirsty afterwards. So the service was amazingly pretty fast. Our spring rolls came out really fast. This older Asian man rolled out the rolls on a carts and knew which tables ordered spring rolls. Impressive. All the food came out fast on this cart and the tables were cleaned up pretty fast. Tables were turning over pretty fast. So I couldn't ask for anything more. Good food, fast service, and big portions. We really enjoyed it and will be coming back again. Enjoy.
California Pizza Kitchen=Why only 3 stars??? Well it was the service and not the food.We have been here before and had really good food and really good service. Not last night. We came here for dinner,I was very tired after a long day of work. I just wanted Ice Tea. No alcohol,which I very rarely drink anyway. T went to wash her hands and asked me to order her a hot water with lemon.When our server Sareena came over and I gave her the drink order, she seemed miffed we did not want alcohol. She kept saying ,"you don't want any Cocktails???When did CPK become the boozing place, Anyway, she brought out the Ice tea and hot water, however, no lemon and she was holding the glass from the top. It is a glass coffee mug ,it has a handle. Why are you putting your fingers all over the tops of the cups.??? T had to go to get lemon and napkins. She never asked her if she wanted more Hot water,but she did refill my Ice Tea.We ordered the Chicken Waldorf Salad. Which was great ,but she never asked us what type of dressing we wanted. It has 2 choices.  Plus she never brought us bread, we had to ask for it.I got the Fish Tacos and they were quite good made with Mahi.T got the Kung Pao Pasta, with Shrimp. I sampled that as well and it was awesome.However, Sareena never picked up any dishes from our table or trash. The manager did a drive by and she cleaned up the table for us.Even the table behind us,yelled out to her, hey can we get some bread!I do not agree with that, but clearly she did not know the proceedure.When T asked for more hot water,as she was not offered any.  Our server once again brought out the cup by the top and when she put it down she actually ran her fingers over the lip one more time for good measure. IT HAS A HANDLE,WHY ARE YOU FINGERING THE CUPS! Of course T was freaked out,because she is such a germ aphobe anyway.But even I do not understand why you would serve a glass or cup like that.We have always had good service at CPK, but not last night. However, the food was very good.
Hodori Restaurant=I've been coming to this place since I've moved to AZ about 10 years ago.  I ate here so often that at one point I was a "Mayor" on FourSquare and "Duchess" on Yelp!  They've changed ownership twice since 10 years ago, and the new one took over about 4-5 years ago I believe.  Their food's ok, but the best thing on the menu is their kimchi jjigae.  That's the reason why I came here all those times and I don't even touch their banchan, because it's so subpar compared to LA, SF, or NYC that it's laughable.  Their Soon Tofu is average and the Kalbi is average as well.  But you take what you can get here in AZ when you have a craving for Korean food.  Well, if you're serving mediocre food, at least you expect them to provide really good in service right?  NO!!  I have always been unhappy with their service since day one, but I just dealt with it.  Well, I've just had it today and sort of lost it!  The waiter (in his 20s, about 5'11" tall) who speaks fluent Korean and Enliglish, just pushed me over the edge!  WTF??  Are you kidding me??  I could not believe the service I was getting from this guy!  OK so here's what happened.I ordered 1 Soon Tofu Jjigae with only beef,  2 lunch special Kimchi jjigae, 1 Lunch special kalbi, 1 lunch special kalbitang. (5 total items)  He brought the banchan (side dishes) and rice and asked me if I wanted eggs in "all of our soon tofu jjigae."  I said I only ordered one soon tofu.  Then he said I ordered 2 kimchi soon tofu, 1 beef soon tofu, 1 kalbi, and 1 kalbitang!  I said "no I didn't" and I repeated what I ordered.  Then he argued with me and said "Yes you did! You ordered 3 soon tofu, plus kimchi jjigae, kalbi, and kalbitang!"  I said "are you kidding me right now?  Look here!  We're only 4 people!  Why would I order so many soups for?"  The guy must be a moron, because he can't even count how many people there are to be ordering 7 items?  Do we look like we could eat that much?  We were two slim adults, and two kids under 15!!  Then he let out a big sigh and then stomped off to fix the order at the kitchen.  He comes back with our food and he literally bangs the soup bowl onto the table!  He is obviously emanating a negative attitude, bangs down the rest of the stuff and stomped off.  I just shook my head and we started to eat.  Half way through the lunch we needed more rice and napkin so I called him over since he was bringing stuff to the next table.  He obviously heard me and didn't bother turning around.  OK, so I'm thinking to myself, maybe he didn't hear me.  I call him again second time and he pretended he didn't hear me.  Then the third time, I called him loud enough for the whole restaurant to hear me and then he turns around, rolls his eyes, makes a face and then comes over.  I couldn't believe my eyes!!  I asked him "are you giving me an attitude right now?"  then he yells (yes he yelled at a customer) at me and says "did I even look at you right now?"  Then he passes by our table, goes to the next table and "politely" asks  "may I take your order?"  WTF?  I asked him to help me get something and he completely ignores me?  Ok so let's recap here.  He takes the order wrong, puts in 2 too many orders of Soon Tofu, then gets mad at me when I correct him that isn't so, then he practically throws the food at us banging every chance he gets, and then he ignores me when I call him!  OMG!  At this point, I'm FURIOUS!  I get up and go talk to the owner who happens to be there today.  I reiterate everything that just happened and he doesn't say anything but to just look towards the direction of the kitchen!  Then I say to him "is it ok for the server to do that to a customer" and he turns and apologized.  He said that it's his fault for not training the staff correctly.  OK, so I'll take that for an apology, but then he should go quietly talk to the server, have the server come over and apologize to me personally!  Nope, that never happened, and guess what happened next?  The owner comes over to our table, being extra nice, and says he's going to take care of our lunch on the house.  At this point, I'm still shaking from rage and I can't even eat anymore.  I said I'm not making a scene, because I want free lunch.  I'm going to pay for what needs to be pay for, I don't want free lunch.  So while the owner's talking to me at our table, that server is standing near the kitchen talking to another server, looking directly at me, and laughing at me!  WOW!   Just amazing!  I've dined out at so many restaurants over the years in my life at all different levels, from Michelin starred to hole-in-the-wall scary places, but this was just the worst service ever!!Stay far away from this place!  I called my mother after what happened.  She was at a luncheon with 20 of her Korean friends for a church function.  You can bet that she spread the word.  None of those ladies are going there in the future.  And neither am I.  To the Owner:  word of mouth is a scary thing.Went here recently with the tour around-the-world lunch group that I organize.   This was a great lunch.  I appreciate a restaurant that understands that a group can grow.   Our group doubled in size from the start and our servers were more than accommodating.I ordered 2 things at this restaurant for lunch.  I ordered the Haemul Pajeon (Seafood pancake) to start.  I ate a small piece of it and had it packaged to bring home for lunch/dinner the next day.  A very tasty pancake with lots of shrimp and squid in it, onions and other spices.  Similar to an okonomyaki that we frequently see in Japanese restaurants.For my main portion of the meal, I had a bowl of the Kimchi chigae  (Kimchi soup)  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=piisc06BvMh6csRPY7RvHw&userid=DHQWSHz6b7Jsy-A04m1cIA.  The yelpers that said this was a delicious dish were  not mistaken.  A very well seasoned and delicious bowl of soup that had nice chucks of pork in it and the veggies.  Fellow Yelper and ATW lunch groupie, Dawn K, said she really enjoyed the somewhat fatty meat in the soup.  I personally enjoyed the spiciness!  I would eat this again and I can't wait to have it again.I wasn't very impressed with their banchan selection.  The side dishes just were not as tasty as I would have liked.
Nello's Pizza Mesa="You better cut the pizza in four pieces because I'm not hungry enough to eat six."  ― Yogi BerraNothing beats a cheesy deep-dish pizza with all your beloved toppings.  That original pan crust is crazy delicious.  It's always busy here for a reason.  I personally love the BBQ Chicken.  If you grab it to go, make sure you toss some fresh cilantro on top for even more flavor.  Their wings are also incredible and they even throw some Parmesan on top of the Garlic Parmesan Wings for more cheesy-goodness.  Nello's pies are flavorful and packed full of calories so if you're on a diet, leave it outside and indulge.  This 30+ year-old award-winning establishment is made of love.I think of dieting for the new year and then I eat Nello's pizza.  No shame.  No regrets.Thick crust, fresh toppings, great service! Delicious spinach salad, but super fatty and gross buffalo wings.I am officially on great pizza overload in this town.  Now that we've tried Nello's, it will be really hard to choose where to go the next time we're craving pizza (which is like every other day!).  Yesterday we decided to try somewhere we'd never been and Nello's was the place.  We walked in and sat at the bar and right away were greeted by Joshua who took great care of us.  He was fun to talk to as well.We started with a 1/2 doz. of the BBQ wings and those were nicely done and I think I managed to grab 2 before Mr. M scarfed them down like they owed him money.  They don't fry them, they bake them, which I can appreciate.  The less grease in my life the better.I ordered the 7" Pizza Bianca which was just four cheeses, but "just" four cheeses doesn't give this pizza credit.  The flavors were amazing!  This might be my new favorite pizza.  And I loved the crust.  Golden and buttery, chewy on the inside.  Perfect.My husband ordered the 10" Numero Uno, thin crust, which is sausage and mushroom.   This is our favorite pizza combo and it was great as well.  Chewy cheese and fresh, flavorful toppings.  It really doesn't get much better.The cold beers were reasonable too.  I had a pint of Four Peaks peach ale, and Mr. M had 2 pints of the Franziskaner Hefe Weiss.  That took us right back to Germany.  Each beer was $4.50.  What a deal!  All in we spent $36.36 before tip.  I can't wait to go back!
Aladdin's Kitchen=My experience here was awesome from start to finish.  I was greeted by an extremely friendly, smiling man (I believe to be the owner) who helped me with my order decision, took my order, then asked me to "please, sit down, be at home".  Awesome.I inquired about the salad and asked if they put any feta on the salad (they don't), he followed up informing me the sauce they serve has dairy, but that he would substitute garlic sauce instead.... now this might not seem like much, but to someone who has food allergies like myself, having someone with intimate knowledge of the ingredients and the care to make sure they don't serve you anything that might not agree with you is really a blessing and gives you assurance when you eat there.  Huge bonus.I had a half chicken shawarma and  half gyros plate which came with hummous, salad, rice, cucumber (substituted instead of pita since I don't eat wheat... nice touch) and a side of garlic sauce.  I do not normally enjoy chicken shawarma, but he insisted I try.  Well, he was right, I will say now I love chicken shawarma, Aladdin's chicken shawarma.  Their gyros was awesome too.. homemade, not the typical Kronos Meat Cone variety.  I paid after my meal and was welcomed back with a handshake.  Service was awesome, food was awesome, and they were able to easily cater to my picky food needs.  A+!
Top of the Rock=Wow, I'm going to have to show this to my friend who thought I was "being too picky" when in essence, he obviously  has some simple ass taste buds.It started out wonderfully. The sun was about 1/2 hour from setting and casting that orange glow that Phoenix does so well. We went there for the ambiance. I offered to treat. Little did I know, I was in for a treat and it sure as hell wasn't a good one.So we get Kathy (I think that was this crappy waitress' name).  She takes my friend's drink order and I'm still deciding and she just walks away. No "I'll be back" or anything customer service-y like that. Then she comes back and takes my drink order. Fine.She suggests the Pork chops and even though I eat 90% vegetarian, I go with her suggestion. Cause the alternative is one boring salad choice.  It comes back pink and rubbery. What the--?I don't give a crap what anyone says, pork ain't supposed to be pink. That  means it ain't cooked and I ain't eating it. So I send it back and it comes back clearly microwaved for a few seconds and guess what? Still freakin' pink on the inside.Lovely! So this girl asks if I want to try the  Chilean Sea Bass. Ok, now I've had too much alcohol and I'm not thinking properly cause that shit's endangered - - very politically incorrect but I'm near my boiling point  so I  agree and think surely something's getting spit in or on.Well, she brings out beers stating that "he bought you  2 beers for the trouble". Huh? He who? The waiter? The manager? And she damn near slams them on the table. Now I'm about to ghetto but my friend just casts me a look that puts me in check.So the sea bass finally comes and you are seriously not going to believe this-----it was pink and pretty much undercooked. And of course, I had her take it back and then it came back flaky. I ate a few forkfuls but was pretty much frickin done at that point and now burdened with a 3-beer buzz within 1.5 hours. Not good.That's why they put the restaurant on top of those damn rocks so you'll be distracted away from the crappy service, mediocre food, ignorant help, and gouging prices. There is no way that food is worth what they charge. And I agree 100% with the other reviewer that I could have made that shit at home. Cooked thoroughly and a helluva lot tastier and I didnt go to culinary school.There's so much more to bitch about people but I'll stop right here or you'll be scrolling down forever. I apologize for all the cussing. I don't normally in my reviews cause I think it's tacky. But this review could not have been true to itself without these appropriate words.I can't believe I tipped that jerk. What the heck was I thinking. One star and that's only for the view. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THE FOOD! DRINKS MAYBE SO YOU CAN GET THE VIEW BUT THATS IT!The view is definitely worth seeing. My fiance and I have been here twice. Once for Valentine's Day and a second time for a wedding reception. We actually pass this restaurant on the I-10 quite often and we would have never thought the view would be amazing. I actually don't remember the food all that much but the atmosphere was great.If the weather is nice out they'll allow outdoor dining but I'm sure with a little coaxing the Maitre d' will turn on the heaters and fire pit for you. Bring a coat/jacket/sweater in case. The service was amazing and the waiters were very helpful. Sunset is obviously the best time to go. During colder months I would suggest going in an hour before just so you're not stuck in the cold weather. You will be treated to the bright lights of Phoenix and the airplanes that go in and out of Phoenix International Airport. But don't worry you don't hear any noise from the airport or the nearby freeway.The wedding reception followed a beautiful ceremony that took place below the restaurant near the pool/waterfall. I think they fit about 200 guests in the entire restaurant. The appetizers were decent and the buffet was typical nothing out of this world.I would definitely rank this one of Phoenix's best restaurants with a view. Perfect for any romantic dinner or social event.I do not know what is going on at this place. It used to be a lot nicer.I know that they are fising this whole place up to be high end again. But, they should just shut it down and start fresh. Shut it down, remodel, and reopen.We were staying at the hotel here so we wanted to give them some business. We went at happy hour. The server suggested some really good food items actually we ordered about 4 things. They were all really good.The best thing was those Canadian french fries. They were really great! We ordered those on suggustion of our server. Glad we did. All the food was good , but those were best.It just looks old and dirty and worn out in there. THe Manager was standing around doing nothing the whole time. I thought maybe he should of been more pro active helping the staff. They were not slammed but, you can always help your people.If not why even be out there helping.I hope they fix it up nice again then we will be back. But, for the prices they charge on everything it is just not all that.
Sakana Sushi & Grill=Word must've gotten out about Sakana because tonight (on a random Tuesday night), I showed up with 2 girlfriends around 6:45... we were all craving sushi and couldn't wait to sit down and order.  We walk in and what?  a wait?  20 minutes?  Wow!  I never had to wait at this place before!It's great quality sushi, large portions compared to other sushi in this town, decent service, and casual.  Yes, casual.  We were all in gym clothes and no one looked us up and down.  It was great!The garden salad with ginger dressing is like 3 x the size you get at other places.  The rolls are big and filling and the sashimi comes with plenty of fish!  Caution on spicy items:  IE spicy tuna and spicy salmon - you might want to tell them light on the spice... I usually like spicy but I think tonight's sushi chef has a heavy hand!Nothing better than the complimentary fresh sliced orange and whipped cream to end your meal here either... it was worth the wait!There are sushi snobs everywhere. Sushi in Phoenix? Ha. At least that's what I used to think. Sure it's easy to look down on everyone who thinks they've had good sushi after eating at Ra, or Zen 32 - but forgive them, this is Phoenix and they're still learning about sushi and that's okay.When they're done having bad california rolls and a happy hour menu full of pieces that fall apart, take them to Sakana in Scottsdale. I know, I said Scottsdale but don't let that turn you away. Sakana is away from the cheesy old town and located in a non-descript strip mall on Hayden just east of Scottsdale Rd. You won't be disappointed. In fact, you'll be surprised at how awesomely fresh, clean and flat out delicious your food will be.If it's just you and a friend, I'd definitely recommend sitting at the bar and not only watch the sushi chefs work, but actually talk with them. While there are a few who would prefer not to say anything, there is usually at least one who's up for anything and definitely up for you buying them a cup of saki.The lunch and happy hour specials are excellent here. Order lots and try everything eventually. It's all good.We used to live deep in Phoenix at 36th st & McDowell and we'd make the trek to Sakana simply because anything else was bound to be sub-par. Sure Zen32 was practically in our front yard, but we'd simply keep driving.The ambiance is everything you'd expect for being in Scottsdale except you'll notice that families come here. You'll see groups of friends both old and young eating and drinking - all without the pretense you'll find down in Old Town. This isn't the sushi restaurant to be seen, this is where you go if you want the best sushi you can find in all of Phoenix.If you grew up and Phoenix and the first time you had sushi was during a Zen32 happy hour, graduate and get over to Sakana in Scottsdale.So I really fought coming here because it always looked like a hole in the wall to me. My mom loves coming here (but then again she loves wildfish )So I said what the hell. She chose this place for here bday. We got there at 5:30 right when it opened so we were instantly seated. It was happy hour and they had the basic rolls half off. We ordered the spicy tuna and the tootsie roll. The tootsie roll was not the normal salmon cream cheese schpeal it normally is. It was just cali roll with Shrimp tempura. I would give the spicy tuna roll 3 stars, it gets 3 and not 2 only because it wasnt fishy. It was just rice and heavily mayo'd tuna, with no spice. They should have added a little green onion put half as much mayo and maybe added a little cucumber for crunch. The tootsie roll is impossible to f up there, so it was good for what it was. We also ordered one of the speacialty rolls the yellow tail tempura. It was ok again 3 stars only that high because no bad fish flavor. It seems the quality and care for the fish is there but the sushi chef destroys all the rolls with too much mayo or Krab. They should invest in a few new chefs or training or something. Even the shape was off, it seemed this guy was straight out of school? Maybe it was  just the guy who happened to be there that night?I would go back but only if I was meeting someone there.I ate here months ago, but I still yearn for the great crunchy calamari salad I had!  Golden-brown calamari, tasty, yet not too greasy, over crisp-fresh greens (mostly romaine) and just the right amount of sesame house dressing.  This resto is significantly smaller than that in Ahwatukee, which gives it a nice romantic ambience.  That is, until it fills up, and then it can feel quite claustrophobic in here.  I would imagine that it'd be a great place to chill out during happy hour: I've spotted nice-looking people here when I wasn't even looking to meet any!Eat and drink your heart out and chances are, you'll leave with less than $20 missing from your wallet; at least that's how I feel every time I visit Sakana. Hidden within a random strip mall on Hayden and Indian Bend, Sakana is unassuming and I've passed by many times before actually venturing inside. Friends swore by it, so I had to give it a try. When I walked inside, I was immediately welcomed by sushi platters staring right at me.. very similar to sushi restaurants I see in SF's China Town. As weird as it seemed to stare at sushi that was either plastic or had been sitting out way too long, it did give me a good idea about what I wanted to order: everything on the menu of course. When I visit, I can roll in sushi, wash it down with plenty of sake bombs and leave with a satisfied appetite and happy pocket book. I've been with a large group of friends as well as just a couple and it's always an enjoyable...sake-filled experience. You can't beat their happy hour. From the inexpensive sushi to the really inexpensive sake, it's a match made in sushi roll heaven. The restaurant isn't exactly huge and I've visited when there was a line out the door. At the same time, I've also visited when I'm the only one there, so it all depends on the time of year and day of the week. The staff is very friendly and you can watch the sushi chefs working their magic at the sushi counter. Sakana proves that you don't have to visit the finest sushi establishment in the Valley to dine on some high-end, delicious sushi. Their prices make me walk through the door and their sushi keeps me coming back for more. And the sake? Well the sake just turns the night into a whole different story in itself,As a foodie, cook and native Arizonan, I've always had this strange misconception about eating fish and seafood in a landlocked state. My mindset was simply this, don't do it. You see it only took that one bad experience from years ago and I've held ever single seafood restaurant accountable since. With the passage of time and through technology, modern shipping and refrigeration methods the life of fresh fish and seafood has been greatly extended. So much so that my attitude towards eating fish has turned around completely and now I crave it.While fish was exiled from my life, Sakana sushi was quietly building a mini sushi empire of Japanese restaurants. Since opening their first in 1996 they've continued to expand and now with 4 valley locations, it won't be hard to get your sushi fix without breaking the bank, especially at lunch time. Each day Sakana offers several different daily creations and specials in addition to the 15 or so items on their standard lunch menu. Between you and me, go for one of the daily specials. These lunch plates are massive and will satisfy the most famished of appetites. You'll see exactly what I mean if you order up the Chicken Maturi ($8.99). A whole chicken breast pounded out into 2 thin slabs, breaded and deep fried until golden and crunchy is then dressed with a slightly sweet soy sauce. Oh and that's not all, along side is a salad of mixed greens and a half of a crab filled California roll. You will not leave hungry.Along with a happy upbeat greeting when you arrive at Sakana, Miso soup comes standard just as soon as you sit down; talk about an efficient lunch service. For a light snack to accompany the soup I also enjoy ordering Edamame ($3.25); steamed soybeans sprinkled with salt, that are as much fun to say as they are to eat.Many people do not understand the difference between sushi and sashimi. This is actually really easy; sushi refers to the vinegar cooked rice while sashimi refers solely to the fish itself. To see the difference first hand, order the Sakana Lunch ($9.99). Thin slices of sashimi; raw salmon, tuna, shrimp, albacore and house smoked salmon are placed on top of sushi; rice. Served on a wooden board, a California roll and a rotating fried item accompany the special. If you're dieting and trying to watch your starch intake, Id highly recommend trying the Sashimi Deluxe ($11.99). Not only do you get a crispy salad but a platter filled with a delicious combination of sliced salmon, tuna, albacore and hiramasa aka Australian King Yellow Tail. However this line up isn't set in stone as the chef will change these out with what's available any given day. What you can take for granted is the freshness and quality of each type of fish served.For the price, Sakana is hard to beat, though for peace of mind, I would have gladly paid more.
Chevys Fresh Mex=Yes, you see it correctly, I just gave Chevy's 5 stars.... Why you ask? Well when i lived in Cali we would meet our friends at Chevy's for the awesome happy hour and have some great margaritas. Since coming to Vegas I thought that there was not any Chevys around anywhere. We ventured over to the mall and guess what I spy?!?!?! CHEVY'S. I think they have great salsa and I really like the nachos.. I am in no way saying that this is "real" Mexican food but it was good and cheap. If I really think about it I am giving this place stars just like how you would give your friends that you have not seen in a long time a high five long before you ask how life has been treating them. So in all reality the food could have been so-so but it was all about the reminiscing.Anyone want to go get a Margarita... Count me in!I am disappointed after tonight. We were seated quickly, the place was not busy.My guy asks what kinds of Tequila they have (he hasn't been here) and the waitress snottily says, "We're a Mexican restaurant, reallyyyyy...?"RUDE. You couldn't have told him a few of your best sellers, or any recommendations? Our waitress took our (alcoholic) drink order, but didn't come back with any waters. We were then approached by 2 separate servers trying to take our drink/food order. A few weeks ago, I was here with a girlfriend (DEC 27,2013). Their fresh fish tacos are done with Tilapia (gross to me) and last time I was able to switch it out with their Mahi.By the time our waitress got us our drinks from the bar, we had gotten our waters. We asked our original waitress for lemon slices when she was ready for our food order.I asked for the fish tacos, with the Mahi. She said that there might be a up-charge (there wasn't last time) but I told her that was fine. I didn't recall what my guy had, but it was a combination plate with floutas, a Chile rellaneno (I know I am completely butchering this spelling wise, sorry) and a chimmechanga.After taking our orders, and our menus, the waitress comes from the back and tells me that her "manager said no to the Mahi." I grabbed another menu and ordered the Mesquite chicken tacos.Still no lemon wedges. She walks around the restaurant. We ask another waiter, who Finishes cleaning a few tables, putting dishes away, and still gets us our lemons before she does. Ugh.Our food comes, and it's good. I prefer their kickin chicken tacos, but those were discontinued, I guess. We asked for some sour cream, which they will charge you $1.30 for. Annoying, but whatever.While we were eating, we saw the manager walking around, and usually, a manager will ALWAYS at least greet us and ask how our food was. This guy didn't.... Our waitress had no problem just kind of yanking our plates out of the way. It must have been a bad night for her.Meh. It makes me sad to write this review. Food was good, but service and management are not on the same length.
Island Teriyaki=If you are going to include 'Island' in your name, you better make us feel like we are on an island.  Indeed that is what they have done.  From the faux palms to the cartoonish waves and surfers, it was well decked out for a school play.  But that's not why I love this place.  The one item that beats the competition is their teriyaki beef bowl.  The beef is prepared so tender topped with their homemade teriyaki sauce.  You can tell it had been braised for hours.  When you can leave a memorable impression like that, you can Yelp about it later.Their menu is focused on primarily meat and rice--just the way I like it! The lady behind the counter is so sweet and kind.  This mom and pops is the type of place you come for those delicious cheap meal nights.  No doubt I will make a return.
Romano's Macaroni Grill=Um, something has happened to this place, and it ain't good. I felt like I walked into a Cronenberg film where you don't know if anything is real.Every redeeming quality is now gone. The roaming singer is gone. They have a bar but don't even produce drink menus any more, and the waitstaff can't readily list drinks available. Not good when the wife is looking for drinks. The service is awkward and slow, even though they sat us at a table next to at least a half dozen servers who loitered around the kitchen area with the manager. I couldn't tell if they were off the clock or hanking or both. The only reason we went here is because they take reservations and someone in our party was concerned about restaurants being crowded. The hostess made a point of telling us over the phone that they don't usually take reservations on such short notice, but they would accommodate us. When we arrived, the place was mostly empty. Inflated sense of self-importance, much?The only reason I bothered updating this is because you might be like me: easily conned into going here when you're hungry. Well, resist the temptation and insist on going elsewhere.A friend of mine invited us to dinner here.  It's been a while since we've been to Macaroni Grill.  We use to eat at a Macaroni Grill for lunch all the time, but in recent years have ignored it.I have a favorite dish....the Pasta Milano (Roasted Chicken, Sun-Dried Tomatoes, Mushrooms, Farfalle Pasta in a roasted Garlic Cream Sauce, $11.99).....but I got it without Chicken since I'm on a no Meat diet.The Better Half ordered the Crusted Sole (Filet of Sole topped w/Lemon Butter & served w/Sun-Dried Tomato, Spinach Orzo, $14.99).I didn't like my Pasta Milano.....the Cream Sauce was very watery and didn't have much flavor....bland, which has never happened to me when I've ordered it.The Better Half enjoyed her Sole, but didn't think it was anything beyond average.My friend ordered the King Salmon ($17.99) and enjoyed it.If I was rating this dinner on my experience alone, it would have been 2 Stars....but since the other two dining with me enjoyed their meal, I'm bumping it up to 3.  The service was so/so.....young wait staff here with plenty to learn about service....I didn't ding them because of their inexperience.  They were pleasant and sincere....which goes a long way with me.Return Factor - 30%I'm giving one star for the friendly waitresses. The food portion sizes for to-go are horrible . I paid a lot of money for kid portion sizes... will not return or recommend. I recommend those waitresses go elsewhere .
Redendo's Pizza & Pasta=Another five star service restaurant in Fountain Hills. I think people here are just very nice. We came here for weekday night quick dinner the other day, and I really had nice pleasant time dining here.It wasn't crowded at all at dinner time, very small place, six or eight tables (can't remember exactly). You order at the counter first and they will bring your food.  Since it wasn't the full table service restaurant, I wasn't expecting much but the staff took our order came back to our table at least 4 or 5 times over the course of dinner to make sure we were doing well. He brought a big bottle of water, and when we finished a bottle, he came back with more.Food was good, I liked the pizza I ordered. Garlic knots and marinara sauce was nice appetizer to have.  Pasta meat sauce wasn't what I expected but we ate all anyway.  It's so close to my house, I think I will add their number to my phone, so I can order pizza from them whenever I don't feel like cooking.
Coffee Pub=A fantastic breakfast/lunch spot that supposedly caters to Vegas power brokers...whatever those are. Lots of signed headshots on the walls, that kind of thing. Patio dining looking out over a quiet parking lot, extensive menu, great food. I dig everything about this place except the fact that it closes at 3pm. Who the hell wants to weigh themselves down with a ginormous meal that early in the day???Still, highly recommended. If looking for a good breakfast spot on the West side, it's a toss-up between this place, the Omelet House, and the Egg &I. The food at all 3 is of equal excellence, but Coffee Pub has the edge because you can dine al fresco, and the view/atmo is better than that of the Egg &I's patio.Arrived for breakfast on a weekday morning. Parking was convenient to locate and I was seated immediately. Free wifi is a plus but you need to obtain the password from a staff member.I asked my friendly waitress what she recommended and she replied - the Hervos rancheros, which I went with. When my entree arrived I bit into the eggs which were smothered in cheese, cooked perfectly medium and tasted delish. The entree came with a large amount of re-fried beans and I ended up eating only half.The coffee here was hot, strong and was a good chaser for any BF entree. I noticed they also offer a lobster omelet so that will be worth a return visit.A lovely surprise!I just found out about Coffee Pub from a girl friend of mine. She promised I would love it. We met there for coffee and she was right, this place is so cute. We sat outside and enjoyed delicious caramel macchiatos. Our server was a younger guy, super nice and very attentive.The owner was walking out to run a delivery and stopped to say hello briefly. I have yet to eat food from here but their menu is extensive and I have heard good things. I will definitely be back to try breakfast.I have driven past the Coffee pub more times than I care to remember- because until yesterday, they were usually always closed. But finally, I made it by when they were open!Walked in toward the end of lunch for a takeout order. I went with their daily special, the Baja Chicken sandwich- chicken with olives and onions and a chipotle sauce and two kinds of cheese, with tomatoes, and lettuce. Each sandwich comes with a side, (potato or pasta salad, chips or fruit)- I chose the pasta salad. I also added the Chai This blended drink- chai, banana, protein powder, and soy milk.Service was friendly though they nearly mixed my order up with a group order.  Dining room with the barista is surrounded by windows and has almost an old school diner feel to it- but there is far more space in the other adjacent dining room than I expected. Larger than it appears on the outside.Got home with my meal- sipped the chai drink as I drove and it was delicious! A bit steep at over $6 for a 24 ounce cup, but it was tasty. Sandwich was $8.50 including the pasta, and the sandwich itself was enormous! I only ate half and gave the other piece to my BF, along with the pickle. Pasta salad was also a decent portion, served in a lidded Styrofoam cup to keep it cold and prevent spills. Also fresh and flavorful, with bits of tomato and a creamy white sauce similar to salad dressing.Delicious sandwich, good portions, lots of variety on menu- will come back to try another sandwich, or perhaps a soup. Today they were out of cream of mushroom, but let me know it usually sells out fast.I've had this place bookmarked for a minute and I was majorly disappointed. Coffee Pub has all of the makings of a hole-in-the-wall/hidden gem, but doesn't stack up. We were instantly greeted and sat, but it took about 5 minutes before a waitress came over. The place wasn't busy at all. Our drinks came out quickly and their iced coffee and espresso based drinks are amazing. Unfortunately, everything else was lackluster.I ordered the Pub Dip, the bread was over toasted and the beef was cooked to the point where it has a rubbery, bad clam texture. My sister ordered the huevos rancheros which was eggs covered in salsa and crusty re-fried beans.My mom's eggs were overdone, her potatoes burnt, but the sausage patties were okay.The food here was on par with a low grade buffet. Nothing tasted fresh.  The food took forever to come out and the service was just blah. I won't be headed back to the Coffee Pub no matter how great their coffee is.
Pioneer Restaurant=Saddens me to drop a star but tonight's fish was not up to par. It was a different breading and not as good. Service was almost bad, no refills on water, never received the beer we asked for, and never received the last refill of fish. The wife salad was just ok, they were out of blue cheese. I swear shit like this only happens when she goes with me there. LOL
Horse & Hound Sports Grill=When I think of sports bars I envision pitchers of beer, hamburgers, more TV's than you can count, team memorabilia, life size cardboard cutouts of Shaquille O'Neil that scare the shit out of you when you turn the corner, shoddy service, janky menus, video games, tons of dudes and the token girl who pretends to be into sports.. Horse & Hound delivered and will provide you with all of the above. Two rooms of it even.. this joint is huge! They even have one of those claw games, but instead of being full of cheapy stuffed animals or 6 year old snickers bars, there were lobsters in it. Live lobsters that you can catch and have them cook.. no I did not do this.. I had nachos instead.I am adding a star for the sheer fact that they had an area devoted to the Red Sox (Yes all you Yankee fans can unfriend me and kiss my ass), another star for the shuffleboard table. I freakin love shuffleboard with a passion.. wasn't sure why it was situated directly underneath the 17 big screens, perhaps for the attention whores out there? Whatever, bravo anyway.This place is great for all you sports fans.. literally, every sport was playing on one of the 50 TV's and they will put your game of choice on the large flat screen front and center if you ask nicely, or tip well.. Either or.P.S. Its also great for off-site betting ;o)
Rosati's Pizza=I just hung up with Rosati's pizza after calling to let them know of our poor experience.  My boyfriend went there with our two kids to pick up the pizza.  He waited 10 minutes watching our pizza sit there while they served about 10 other customers picking up their pizza.  By the time we got it it was cold.  The kids were hungry so he brought it home and we ate it.  Cold pizza is better than no pizza and hungry kids.  I called Rosati's; while on hold I listened to their "Satisfaction guaranteed" message.  Finally talked to a woman who claimed she was a manager.  I asked for a refund because my pizza was cold.  She insisted my pizza was not cold, and refused to give me a refund because we already ate some of the pizza.  So I'm supposed to turn around with my hungry kids and bring the pizza back and wait 45 minutes for another one?  Please.  Clearly they are disorganized about their service because they couldn't even find our pizza for 10 min while it was sitting right there getting cold.  She was extremely rude and obviously uninterested in providing good customer service.  1 star because the cold pizza was edible.I pass on this place.  We had loved Rosati's in Arizona and finally decided to try them here.  I would think they would be close to consistent in their food but I was completely wrong.  First off their delivery time initially stated was 1 hour. That was fine but then 1 1/2 later was when it was finally delivered.  Time is of the essence when I'm hungry.  They failed. Once we received our order I noticed they sent pizza dough nuggets instead of the garlic knots I ordered.  Fine. Whatever I was hungry.  Upon opening the bread box, sauce was leaking out of the corner with sauce all over the top of the pizza box.  In the end it didn't matter because they were cold and not good.  We didn't eat them.  They are consistent with one thing... Spilling sauce all over their delivered items.  The chicken wings had blue cheese dressing all over the container.  Did it make the wings better? No. They were completely overcooked and tough.  Yuck.  Was the pizza alright? Nope. 3 for 3.  It was cold with hardened cheese.  Crust had no flavor.  With bad food and delivery wait time, it was clearly disappointing.
2 Men and A Pizza=I was starving after a long day and ordered a Sausage & Pepperoni Pizza for delivery.  The Pizza came really fast, but.......after I paid and the person left, I opened up the box and it was a.....Cheese Pizza, bummer.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/6MEKzqX4uuxBTqavZKdc4g?select=Fr3F1GJhhP_-PHyTz6zBGwhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/6MEKzqX4uuxBTqavZKdc4g?select=AENO1fl5IZ6pB6XOb919HQhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/6MEKzqX4uuxBTqavZKdc4g?select=8TDBDYRiaTrz8XRQXWCF1wSince I was starving and didn't feel like calling and waiting for the right Pizza, I ate it anyway.  The Pizza was pretty good....the Crust was really good and the Cheese was gooey...yum!  Some other lucky person got my Pepperoni & Sausage....Would have given them 4 Stars, but took 1 Star away for the mixup....oh well, maybe next time they'll get it right.  Since the Pizza was good, I'll give them one more chance.Return Factor - 75%
Nando's Mexican Cafe=Yum! Yum! Yum!  Friends introduced us to this place - they're regulars and we may be too.  It's a hidden place, but once you find it you are welcomed into a gorgeous restaurant with plenty of space.  They have a good sized drink menu, and my first "Yippee!" happened when I saw they had choices for margaritas that didn't include syrup and sweetness that you can get with margarita mixes.  I could actually taste (and later feel!) the tequila.  My second "Yippee!" happened when I was informed that the Chile con Queso was (gasp) vegetarian!  It was absolutely delicious and hot and if I wasn't watching my athletic figure I would have chowed down on it and the thick chips that go with it.  My third "Yippee!" happened when I saw black beans on the menu.  Black beans that are lard free!  My black bean and cheese burrito was amazing - not too greasy, just the right amount of cheese.  They also had more vegetarian choices, and I'll have to try the Spinach Enchiladas one of these days.  Loved everything about this place - will definitely be back!  But not on Tuesdays, since I'm not interested in seeing kids eating free.
Ajo Al's Mexican Cafe=First off, I love this kind of Mexican food.  The kind that is covered in cheese and so unbelievably unhealthy that I shudder to think what the caloric content is.  I swear AZ has it's own brand of Mexican food.  When I lived in L.A., there was no way I was finding a deep fried burrito covered in jalapeno cream cheese and then topped with more cheese or a Mexican pizza with that same jalapeno cream cheese used as a sauce.   Ajo Al's does have lighter options and their Salad Carbon is favorite of mine as well, but sometimes I just need to indulge. You should know something else.  I worked here as a hostess when I was a senior in high school.  So, I had the opportunity to try a ridiculous amount of Ajo Al's food.  I still love this place and always will.  If you're like me and you love the Sonoran style food served in places like Julio G's and Valle Luna, you'll like Ajo Al's too.  You should also know that I don't understand when people say this type of food is not authentic.  Authentic to what?  I sure can't find this crap in California, New Mexico, or Texas; all of which border Mexico.  So, it must be authentic to Arizona, right?  And that is what I love, good ol' AZ Mexican food.Happy 25 year anniversary, Ajo Al's!Yes, it's a local chain with four Valley locations, and this is one of the two locations I've actually been to... but it's family owned and operated and still going strong after 25 years.  There's something to be said for that!It's not at the top of my list, but I've never been disappointed by Ajo Al's.  I go maybe once or twice a year for lunch or dinner.  When I recently had a craving for Mexican food, I suggested this place to my friends and they gladly met me here.  Our waiter was attentive, the atmosphere is fine, the chips and salsa are addicting, and the food is A-OK.  Portions are large.  I had a burrito (enchilada style per the waiter's suggestion) and a salad and took half of my meal home.  My friends went with a burrito and a quesadilla respectively.  None of us oohed or aaahed over the food, but we ate it and it was fine.  Prices are moderate.  Oh, and my leftovers were just as good the next day for lunch!One weird thing: on their menu, they list several items with guacamole but it's funny... every time that guacamole is listed they put "(meatless)" by it.  Has anyone ever had guacamole that is not meatless?  I found that really awkward!Anyways, if you're in the mood for traditional Mexican food, you can't go wrong with Ajo Al's.  I'm sure I'll end up there again in another six months or so!We came here for Valentine's day because my husband's sprint phone was not working.   We drop off the phone and walked over for a quick bite.  We were lucky we got there before the crowd.  We waited for a few mins, before we were greeted and sat.  Within 15 mins, the place was packed with people.  We sat down and received a basket of warm chips and two salsa.  Then we got two cups and a pitcher of water.  The lady did not say anything to us and left.  I was not sure if she is coming back or not.  ???  Then our server came to greet us.  She was very nice and told us the special.  She took our drink order and swoosh she was gone.  She had a ton of tables.  She came back quick with drinks and to take our food order.  I ordered the Comb #11 Chimi with chicken served with beans and rice.  The red sauce had good flavor, the chicken itself was bland, the rice was good, and normally I am not a fan of refried beans but theirs was pretty good.  To sum up everything, it was ok.
Octagon Cafe=This was the highlight of a wasted 2 hours or so on the way from Tucson to Sedona yesterday.  This and the magnificent sculpture of the horse in the parking lot of the strip mall that houses the restaurant.  The horse is a combination of chromed and rusted metal and found objects, larger than life and probably comes from a gallery here in Sedona.  We were on a fool's errand, looking for an arts and crafts show that was described as one of the 3 best in the nation.  Not by MY standards.  In fairness, I didn't look at all the offerings, probably not even half, but was I saw would have been juried out of the Brookside Art Annual in KC.  But on to this wonderful restaurant, a homey little cafe that we wandered into by chance.  It was fairly new but our waitress was an older woman who called us darlin'.  Tam, don't read any farther...  We both ordered their special green salad topped by small scoops of chicken salad, egg salad and tuna salad, each one excellent.  It was a light, pleasant lunch and very satisfying.  And Tam, I know you didn't listen to me and you just threw up in your mouth.  One of these days you'll learn...
Jimmy John's=Ok, ok, you got me Mr John. Seems like when lunch time comes around, you just happen to have a location that is conveniently nearby. I have been to this location several times before you guys decided to close down to remodel and boy that seemed like forever. Now that you guys are open, I see that you made the place even better. I think out of all the other locations I have been to, this is definitely the biggest one.As for the sandwiches, you cant really go wrong with any of them. Except maybe the veggie sandwich. Come on man! What kind of sandwich is that if you don't have any meat up in there? To me that sandwich does not exist except for when I mention that it doesn't exist in this review.I basically have 4 sandwiches I order as a normal rotation. They are #8 Billy Club, #14 Bootlegger Club, #16 Club Lulu, and if I am really hungry, The JJ Gargantuan (it's so much meat that giving it a number was not gonna be enough).Sure I can go on and on about what is in these sandwiches but I don't want to waste your time. Just stick to this rule of thumb: If you like ham, roast beef, turkey, and bacon, then any one of those that I mentioned will definitely satisfy you especially the JJ Gargantuan. This monster has salami, ham, capicola, roast beef, turkey and provolone topped off with onion, lettuce, tomato, and Italian dressing.Pro tip: If you refer to their menu, there are freebies that you can have them put in your sandwich like onions, lettuce, tomatoes, mayo, sliced cucumber, hot peppers, dijon mustard, yellow mustard, oil, vinegar, and oregano. If your sandwich does not normally have these items, they will not put it in your sandwich unless you specifically tell them to. Same thing for freebies that are already in your sandwich. You can order extra of that item. Also don't be afraid to ask for different bread. They give you the standard white bread with all your sandwiches but you can ask for wheat or the traditional sliced bread.Service will always be lightning quick because of a couple of factors. All the sandwiches they make are cold so there is no time wasted in cooking or heating anything up. Secondly, they have an assembly line type of set up so you have different people taking turns putting stuff in your sandwich.The only thing that takes that one star away is that because they don't have any hot sandwiches like meatball or a cheesesteak. I love my usual sandwiches but sometimes I gotta have something hot and fresh off the grill. Until they make that happen, it will always be 4 stars from me.Yelp 2014 365 Review Challenge #66
Carrabba's=Maybe it's been a while since I last stepped foot into a Carrabba's or something but this place makes me, a 5'0" gal, feel like a giant.  After being given our beeper/pager/thingie for our table [10-15min wait at 7PM on a busy Saturday night], I managed to get the top of my riding boot caught in the stupid bench twice and bump my head on the trim of the window.  Is this how you normal height people feel?  Anyways, more boot-catching-on-seats-action followed as we were seated in the tiniest booth ever.  I was sitting on one side with my gal friend, who's about the same height and weight as me, while my brother had the other side for himself.  During the whole meal, we were bumping into each other and it's hard to imagine how two people can sit on one side of a booth comfortably.  It's a surprise how I even ate when I was curled up against her the whole time!Anyways, while I seldom review bigger chain restaurants, I really just wanted to say that Carrabba's has delicious food but I think their portions shrank... A LOT.  I had my fill of warm toasty bread with herbs and olive oil, a nice steamy bowl of sausage and lentils soup, and then had the tiniest plate of shrimp and scallops linguine alla vodka.  I'm not a big eater by any means but I somehow found myself in front of an empty plate with a hungry tummy.    It tasted amazing, so much more than my brother's lobster mac and cheese and my friend's champagne shrimp and scallop linguine, but it was ridiculously small.I know I look pretty young but seriously, it was like a kid's sized meal and considering that I was carded when I ordered my Limoncello and Prosecco drink, which tasted more like cranberry juice than anything, I'm definitely an adult.  $23/pp including tip for three entrees, one alcoholic beverage, and a lemonade.  Not sure I'd be back even though they have decent flavor.  Pity... I do love their sausage and lentil soup!
Golden Egg Roll=I've tried Golden Egg Roll twice. Once for delivery and once in the restaurant. BLECH! Both times. Actually ICK the first time, MEH slash ICK the second time. The delivery is quick and efficient. I ordered the House Fried Rice and a veggie egg fu young. I was grossed out by the shrimp in the fried rice. I could SMELL my shrimp before it even entered my mouth. Sounds normal right? No it was FUNKY shrimp that was slightly slimy. Blech. My Fu Young was unremarkable after you got past the saltiness of the dish. Months later, I was asked by a coworker to have lunch. I let her pick the place... I will never make that mistake again. She picked Golden Egg Roll. The restaurant itself is nice and clean from what I saw. I chose the orange chicken. Again with the salt! I was baffled and I asked the other ladies I was with if they were having the same issue. Yes, they were! Well that summed it up for me. I probably won't visit Golden Egg Roll again. What a bummer, they have all this swag from a service (they probably paid for) naming them one of the top Chinese restaurants in the area. I'm uninterested in giving this joint another shot, unfortunately. There are too many other places to try.
Red Devil Italian Restaurant & Pizzeria=11/11/10Was in the area for a November OYE that was about to start in 30 minutes, but I was so hungry and didn't really think my second meal-of-the-day comprised of pie, cake, pastries, and wine was a healthy way to end the evening w/, so I decided I'd check out Red Devil.  It was dead inside (only a couple was there for dinner), and I got the feeling that most of the business that evening was going to be take-outs.Bartender was friendly enough, until I started asking questions about the ingredients.  He still remained accessible, but the smiles certainly went away.  I almost stood up and left.  When the food arrived 25 minutes later, I wished I had left!  I found the calzone crust soggy- no crispiness anywhere, and the mozzarella-ricotta mix made for an ugly, bland-tasting (I detected no ricotta flavor at all) conglomeration.  (See photos.)  The only thing that turned out OK was the marinara sauce, but what good is it if the item you're supposed to eat it w/ isn't worth the trouble?  I had the leftovers boxed, and stood up to go after only spending 5 minutes eating.  After all, I had a party to attend!p.s. What a poor example of a treehugger I am!  No sooner had I exited RD's doors did I take the first chance to throw the leftovers in the trash.  Should've just left it on the table...I have been coming in here for many years now. What is not to love~!I think the food is pretty fantastic!  Pizza, really good. Wings,excellant!Salads are freash and flavorful. Like how easy it is to call in an order, pick it up at the window and go.Good staff, the decor is a bit old fashion in an 80;s way. But, in the grand scheme it means nothing. I like the food here so I will be back many times!Lots of parking in the lot as well.This is a review for the pizza take out.There are a few levels of pizza in the 602.Top tier is Pizzia Bianco, Cibo, Federal PIzza, et al. Those are NOT daily pizza choices, to me they are special occasions. Everyday kind of awesome pizza is Red Devil! Light years ahead of NYPD, Streets, etc. this place is legit! I highly recommend trying the pizza 'well done' which gets you more char on the crust. It's super good. This place also has really great wings, which surprised me. I ask for all drums, as those little wings aren't worth the trouble.Keep up the good work Red Devil. You are an oldie but a goodie.
The Good Egg - Dobson=I like the Good Egg.  Really, I do.  I have eaten here sporatically at a few different locations.  This one gets busy, obviously, but not as busy as the other locations, from what I have noticed.Anyways, I came here this AM for breakfast.  I was out and about when I realized I was starving. I usually dont keep breakfast food in the house, so I knew it was time to stop.Came here and the service was quick and efficent.  I was in and out of here in no time.   I had scrambled eggs, an english muffin and hash browns.  Food was tasty!!I will probably be back.  Rock on Good Egg!We have come here more than a few times over the years. Today we came around lunch time, just missing the rush! We got a nice booth for starters. Our server was Annette ,she was friendly and very quick with everything.I got the Lumberjack scramble. It was a lot of food and I ordered an English Muffin instead of the bisquits that come with it. Lots of gravey,(Country style) I liked it but, I had to scrape some off because, it is so much. Something else that they had,that I thought was pretty good was the Marion Berry jam.T got The Krabby one,it is an Egg crepe (made with Crab) I had some and it was really good ,nice and light.I have to say there potatoes are awesome and the coffee is nice. Not bitter at all.We have always been happy with our meal at all the locations.Something else to love is the stamp card system they have. so many stamps and you get one meal free. Gotta love that!
Houston's Restaurant=I am soooooo confused why this place has good reviews? Stumped actually, no.. aphauled. Ive eaten here a few times because my mom likes this place. Why? ...Because she lives off lettuce and has never tried anything else here. She like the turkey gizzards, she has no opinion. So I went there and got a salad, dressing was pretty gross. My brother got a burger that was actually raw, so he took it back. So he gets the burger back and now............The lettuce was hot wilted the bun was soggy and the cheese was still in the shape of grated cheese. This was obviously put in the microwave, topping and all. Completely disgusting!!!!!I had chicken there too and it was like the turkey on Nation Lampoon's Christmas Vacation!!!If you remember that scene, that is exactly what happened hereHouston's delivers a solid meal every time and that spinach dip goes straight to my hips every time as well! Yes, there will most likely always be a wait at Houston's unless you get in right before the lunch or dinner crowd...but mind you, there are some early birds in the bunch. Regardless, the wait is ok because they keep a fire going to cozy up the wait time and then there's always the bar to warm you up from the inside out. The seats at Houston's are nice because they are private so you can have a conversation without feeling like four other tables have stopped their conversation to listen in on yours. The service is normally pretty quick and then there's the food. Like I said, Houston's delvers a solid and hearty meal. The spinach dip is a must on the list of starters regardless of the calories that come with it. I've enjoyed the chopped salad with a side of honey mustard. Their honey mustard is creamy and delicious and one of my favorite honey mustard locations. I do miss the Racket club. They used to do it perfectly with some relish and honey mustard on soft bread. RIP Racket Club. However, the normal club is good too and you can never go wrong with the Biltmore Chicken Sandwich and their ribs are famous too. For dessert, my personal favorite is the Apple cobbler but apparently it's seasonal and so they will switch it out for the Key Lime Pie. It's always a hit or miss on whether or not they will have the Apple Cobbler and personally, I think they need to keep the cobbler on the menu year-round because it would keep some regular customers coming in over and over -- like me! I've been visiting Houston's for years. It's also cozy once inside and the fireOh boy, where do I start?  A colleague suggested that we come here for a lunch meeting one day.  He said they had the best French Dip Sandwich in town.  Seduced by this claim, I had to give this place a try.  Of course, my first time there I had to try this legendary Sandwich.  Priced at $20, it better be good...http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/houstons-scottsdale?select=U0ixpfN85zASG-5U8eBq1w#U0ixpfN85zASG-5U8eBq1wI took one bite and OMG...!  It was friggin' awesome!  Even better than I expected.  The flavor of the Prime Rib and the Au Jus sent my taste buds into the stratosphere.  It also comes with a Creamy Horseradish Sauce that just adds to the flavor explosion.  The Bread is Buttered and soft, but had just the right texture to hold this all together and complimented the sharp flavors of the Beef and Sauce.  Wow, it is a masterpiece.The service here is also impeccable.  You feel like you're dining in a 5 diamond restaurant....and it's lunch!I was so impressed after that 1st visit, that I've been back several times and have brought many friends and colleagues to experience the French Dip.My other favorite item is the Hickory Burger (Canadian Bacon, Cheddar Cheese, Onion, w/Hickory Sauce), $14.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/houstons-scottsdale?select=CYjS0T6wl1Pe9fX_-DV9mw#CYjS0T6wl1Pe9fX_-DV9mwThat's right folks, there's a thick slice of Canadian Bacon that tops this Burger!  This is a big bad Burger....and it tastes awesome!  I can barely take a bite out of it....and it's not like some freakishly huge Burger, but the ingredients are fresh and stacked high....making for an awesome Burger.For sides, the Cole Slaw is by far the best you can order and I highly recommend that.  The Fries are so/so.  Another tip, if you come for lunch you can make reservations.  It can get busy, so it's worth the extra step to do so.Return Factor - 100%I've been here many of times but i was surprised that I haven't been here for a long time. So it was time to check out all my Yelp friends reviews to see whats recommended. The place is dark but elegant in its own way. We started off with the Spinach & Artichoke dip. The tortilla chips were nice and crispy. It came with a warm spinach and artichoke dip, salsa, and sour cream. Oh my goodness, the warm dip was so good. Out standing. We were licking every drop of it. We even got another bowl of chips to finish everything off. I ordered the famous French dip sandwich. When I first ordered it, it doesn't sound too exciting but wow. Thinly cut prime rib with this really soft bread and dipping it the sauce made it outstanding. It was like melt in your mouth goodness. My wife and son ordered their go to dish of a full rack of baby back ribs. They are fall off goodness. The BBQ sauce is sweet and tangy. Really like these ribs. The sauce really makes it so good. They had cole slaw to and it was good and goes so well with the ribs. Nice and creamy. I shared with my wife and it was so good. The service was good. Usually it's outstanding but today we ordered our appetizer and needed a few minutes to order but it seemed like she got lost and took awhile to get back to us. That was the only negative but our water cups were bought to us very quickly. Refilled regularly and took our dirty plates on a timely manner. Loved coming here. Great food,  good service, and a really nice ambience. We'll be back again but not to long like last time. Enjoy
Rubio's Fresh Mexican Grill=The first time I had Rubio's ever was about 6 months ago in Casa Grande.  Now I'm hooked.  Love the original fish taco, and now I'm also really enjoying the shrimp salsa verde tacos that I think are out for a limited time only.  So fresh and delicious!  This particular location has very friendly staff, and when we were there over the weekend one employee was moving tables and scrubbing the walls and floor.  The joint was clean anyway, but how often do you see an employee taking the time to do a deep clean?  A lot of places I visit I don't even want to look at the floor/wall/behind the chairs.  Best to stay in the dark, but this place is as clean as it can be.  I also like the choices on the salsa bar and the fact that I can get a cold adult beverage to have with my tacos.   I've never had a bad visit to a Rubio's.  Definitely a fan.I'm a fan of Rubio's and stopped by this location for dinner one evening.  I ordered my traditional item.....Steak Burrito.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/j0h8OH6ktQsnTmIaJsN5Hw?select=Zx--exGz8noCK_pSNsQuOAOf course, I stopped by the Salsa bar to get a few cups of their Spicy Salsa.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/j0h8OH6ktQsnTmIaJsN5Hw?select=FpVfp0gkLcDXCZBTWSLyGgThe Burrito was very tasty as usual.  So far, all of the Rubio's I've been to have been consistent with good quality food and service.  This one is no different.  I'll be back again!Return Factor - 100%I am not ashamed to admit it, but I am a fan of Rubio's. I have been to several restaurants, but this was my first time at this location. It was a bit challenging to find, so be sure to look for the Party City store and look across from it.One of the things I like about Rubio's is they have a lot of lighter and healthier options.Don't forget the Fish Tacos! The beer battered fish tacos are really popular.I may eat mostly vegetarian, but eat fish once in a while. If you go there on Tuesdays, they run a special on fish tacos, and if you sign up for the Beach club you get coupons and a free taco.Very good value.2/28/13Redeemed a couple of free fish taco coupons I was given at the Yelp event held here a couple of years ago (?).  Was told they were for the Alaskan pollock- the same ones we were given at the party.  While I waited for these to be prepared, I realized I don't like the atmosphere indoors, as it felt too fast-foodish for me, and yes, I realize that I am writing a review on Rubio's... I guess dining al fresco is the way to go when you're here.  Should I ever go back, I will choose outdoor dining, or just go for takeout and head to a nearby bar with a better selection of beers and wine and better atmosphere, as well.Oh, and I liked the beer-battered pollock with the greens and signature "white sauce" on flour tortillas.  Just wished each taco came with more than just the one lime wedge-- I need more acid to cut through the grease!FYI, I was told by a Mexican coworker, who used to work at Rubio's many, many years ago, that the beans' side dish is well-prepared here, for those who are health-conscious.  It isn't refried in lard like in other places.  I can't say I've tried it in recent times, so I can't comment on it any further-- just passing on what she told me.Money talks. And where I spend my money, I talk about it on Yelp. Even if it is for a $1.50 Tuesday fish taco special.   This Rubios is located in the Pebble Marketplace, which is the Smith's-anchored shopping center off Green Valley Parkway immediately north of the I-215 exit. It sits in the far northwest corner of the shopping center where it shares a patio with Starbuck's. With the corner facing windows and outdoor seating, it is an appropriate restaurant to experience the Vegas sunshine.   Between a hard days work and a cup of coffee before shopping in Smith's, the $1.50 Tuesday fish Taco special is a rewarding weekday treat. When I walk in the door, friendly employees including Vivian will greet me before taking my order. They will give me a water cup (immediately after I will be drinking a Starbuck's beverage) when I order the fish taco, a few minutes later deliver the taco to my table, then check up on me. Whenever they deliver a fish taco to my table, it has been tasty and filling. The toppings station is advantageous to the fish taco experience. There are all kinds of sauces including pacante plus peppers that you could place in a small cup or directly to the taco.   After many Tuesdays spending  only $1.50 on a quality fish taco with a water cup served by friendly people, I talk good about Rubio's on Yelp. This is a  special that will brighten up a Tuesday.
Los Olivos Norte=After a long week, taking the family to dinner Friday nights at Los Olivos is quite the treat for all.  The highlights for us are the relaxing atmosphere, good Mexican food, attentive service, cold Negro Modelo beers and talented mariachis playing music.My kids would be happy just eating their awesome chips and salsa.  We all love to get the tortilla soup and share that as a starter.For the adults our favorites are the Huevos Rancheros and Chorizo Con Huevos.  The kids love the bean burritos and cheese quesadillas.  Would have given it a 5 star except last time really did not care for the tough to eat carne asada (way too thin and overcooked) nor the margaritas (way too sour).  If looking for a good Mexican restaurant in Scottsdale that won't break the bank give Los Olivos a try.The Northern sister property of the Los Olivos in Old Town Scottsdale, this is one of our family's favorite choices for Mexican food.  We enjoy the Cheese Crisps and Enchilada & Taco combo.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/LVyoW7-2XMnb1avqWNZ3yw?select=7OSp0zucUguetvAc48g37AOf course, complimentary Chips & Salsa is offered here.  What I like is that they offer a really spicy Salsa and a Mild one.  I love the spicy stuff and the rest of the family enjoys the mild.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/LVyoW7-2XMnb1avqWNZ3yw?select=1uhB-OTY0yApqdfsVZfMQwhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/LVyoW7-2XMnb1avqWNZ3yw?select=FrJYrz1giW5lvi0iDW-JjwWe've dined here several times and have had decent service each time.Return Factor - 90%This location lacks the character of the original location but it's a nice option for North Scottsdale dining! Although it's located in a strip mall on the freeway, once you step inside, it feels like a family-friendly restaurant with a little bit of Mexican flare. There's plenty of seating making this a good option if you want to have a big party. The food is decent and your generic restaurant Mexican food. Holy large portions though! I ordered the carne asada tacos and it came with a salad, then two very large flour tortillas, two large pieces (probably 3-4 inches long each) of carne asada beef and heaping beans and rice. All of it was very delicious but had I know the size of the portion, I would have definitely shared. You also get chips and two types of salsa with your meal. In summary, this is a pretty basic Mexican meal experience, but in a good way. I think it's nice that North Scottsdale has this option and I can only imagine that the bar area can get pretty crowded on the weekends.I really love this place!  I've been here many times on all different occasions.  They offer a great happy hour where I enjoy the chicken quesadilla and margaritas.The decor is just okay with nothing to brag about, however, the food and service is great!  The margaritas are perfectly made and the chicken quesadilla and enchiladas are delicious.  I also really like the salsa and chips!  When getting Mexican food, I usually go for enchiladas, tacos, or a trio plate, but If you can't already tell, I absolutely LOVE the chicken quesadilla here!  Give it a try!
Byblos Restaurant=This place sucks.Now I understand that's not the most helpful assessment, so I'll elaborate to save you from ending up at this crap hole should you think, "Oh Erica, you must have just been cranky that day!" Not so.It all started when I had a craving for hummus earlier this week. I work too far from just about every hummus slinging place in Tempe but Byblos. So I decided to try something new, and was left with a sour taste in my mouth.First off, the place is located in a shitty plaza of decaying shops (home to the Yucca Tap Lounge if that's any indication) and it's right next door to a Mexican food restaurant that I've never seen anyone enter or leave, so it looks like a front for some shady 'business' dealings. But my craving would not be deterred by a craptastic plaza, after all, Capistrano's is in the same plaza and it's delicious. Looks aren't everything. Hummus would be had.We enter. It's empty and dumpy looking. The only people here have a mean age of 70. We significantly bring this average down. Waaaay down. We are escorted to a table and peruse the menu. The server (I assume it's the unfriendly server you had, Kelly B., because he looked like he had a stick up his ass that had been festering there for the past 60 years) took our drink orders and came back with two itsy bitsy little cups. Seriously? You're going to charge me 2.50 for six ounces of lemonade? We order. He frowns for the umpteenth time in our short interaction and waddles off to the kitchen. The food arrives.The hummus was straight up GROSS, and the pita bread was shockingly similar to cardboard. The hummus tasted sour with a texture that was a combination between chalk and paste. If I can corner a five year old, I'm going to conduct a taste test between the two substances and see if there's any discernable difference. My money's on no. The presentation was nice, with pickles, tomatoes, olive oil and parsley, but if I wrap a piece of dried up dog shit in ribbons and bows, your gift would still be a piece of dried up dog shit. Maybe you could use it as a paper weight? The tomato soup that came along with lunch was pretty decent,and the gyro meat was well spiced. But the fact that my gyro was wrapped in the aforementioned cardboard pita bread was really unappetizing. It's like they took rock hard, stale pita bread, heated it in the microwave to make it pliable, molded it and let it cool in its rigid formation. So if you're 70 and your senses are slowly numbing, you might like this place. Other than that, stay away. It's unwelcoming and unappetizing. The antithesis of what a restaurant should be. Let it slowly decay along with the rest of the shops lining this creepy little plaza at the corner of Mill and Southern.I met Yelpette's Georgie S and Sunny B today for lunch and was pleasantly surprised by the experience. In addition to famously amazing company, the food was really good, we had quick and efficient service and I was happy with the portions and price. We started with Hummus, which came out immediately. It was pretty tasty. Both Sunny and I had the falafel pita/ sandwich. I was really impressed with how moist the falafel was. Normally it comes out really dry. We also got soup with our meal. I had tomato, which was EXCELLENT and she had the lentil. I forgot to ask how it was. Georgie had some chicken and rice thing which looked good and she said she enjoyed. Our server was a little aggressive with Georgie and Sunny because they didn't finish all of their food (yeah... I'm a big pig and devoured everything in front of me) but I think he was just trying to ensure they were happy with their meals. For the three of us plus the takeaway chicken sandwich for my sister, the $34 tab was extremely reasonable and they handled our multiple payment methods like a champ! Next time I am in Tempe and in the mood for some falafel, I will be back!!!I have driven by Byblos so many times and was looking forward  to join the International Supper Club UYE in September, the front parking lot is extremely small, but there is parking in the back, and it's a lot bigger on the inside then you would, ok I, assumed it to be. We all were seated and handed menus and the owner was giving us a very detailed list of the specials they had going, and was even ready to take our order right then and there, but we told him we needed a few more minutes, so he said he would be back in 5, and he was. I already knew what I wanted, I ordered the Falafel Sandwich, it came with soup & fries. There as 2 choices of soup, lentil and tomato or as the owner put it, fight for or die for. I went with the Lentil soup, I love lentil soup but after the order was placed he came back and apologized for the mistake and it was chicken noodle soup or tomato, so now I went with tomato soup.  He said it was to die for! Well let tell yall, that tomato soup was creamy, full of flavor and well maybe it was to die for! I'm not much of a soup person but I could see me having a nice warm bowl of that on a cold day.   The falafel wrap was good to, I had been craving falafel and this hit the spot.  Good food, great company, great time! Look forward to the next ISCUYE.
Wendy's=Mom loves the salads here, and today, I don't know why, but the "natural-cut fries" called out to me.  I've never ordered these here before.  Oh, now I remember why-- because the words "Natural-cut fries" were followed by "with sea salt."  My body must've been craving for salt, because these were oh-so-delicious.  Loved the crunchy texture, as well!  I detected a peanut-y flavor, so I wonder if peanut oil was used?  I thank the Lord that I only had the chance to eat about a little under a fifth of the large serving while driving before I decided to wait until I had safely parked and transferred all of the groceries from the car into my home.  By the time I turned my attention to the fries, they were now soggy and inedible (to me).  Have I ever told you how I hate soggy, floppy things?  No?  Well, I do.  Fries, pizza, sweet potato fries...---UPDATE   5/17/15Mom said the last three times she's had salad from here, the chicken was very salty, so no more of Wendy's salads!
Inaka Sushi=This place was highly recommended to me by a friend. I have been meaning to try it again. I had eaten here once several years ago. Food is good... Sushi was fresh & tasted good. I would definitely recommend that no one order the garlic edamame as it was inedible, but other than that every thing else that we ordered was fine.  As far as sushi goes Octopus was really good, eel, white fish & yellow tail were great! ... Boyfriend said the sea urchin was the best he's had... I couldn't try it.... Maybe if it had been in a roll or something ... But just with rice & wrapped no thanks. For rolls the Japanese Lasagna was OK... Boyfriend didn't prefer it (so what - more for me) although almost every piece I had fell apart... But what can you do. We both really liked the Kiss the Ass Roll & Leo #3 (daily special), and sec on the beach. Our absolute favorite was the Unagi roll.  Delicious! As far as service that's where things get a little sloppy. For the most part we received everything we asked for... Although I did all for lemon for my water & was basically told no, until my boyfriend asked them he finally brought me some.  Neither sushi Chef nor waiter smiled at either of us even once during our entire visit, and I was going out of my way to be extremely nice. I said thank you about 40 times. It was kind of ridiculous. Twice the sushi Chef just kind of grunted our way when we ordered something new. Also we arrived around 2pm, lunch AYCE goes until 3,  but we were charged for the dinner AYCE. We didn't complain because we ordered a lot, but something to keep an eye on. I'm not saying we won't be back, but they're are a lot of sushi places on Eastern that have great quality fish & pleasant staff. Pull it together, Inaka!
Valle Luna Mexican Restaurant=i hadn't been to valle luna since i was a kid, but we went here recently and it was so great. i mean, it wasn't like amazing mexican homemade food, but it's pretty darn good for what it is. their salsa is amazing. so amazing. the chips are warm and salty. the bean dip is pretty great. for a meal, their chicken fundido is awesome if you're feeling naughty. i had the fajitas and everything was fresh, not pre-made. you know how i have a weird thing about pre-made food. nope, not here. they were even able to cook my fajitas with water instead of oil which was a bonus for me because i make crazy requests like that. we sat on the patio and enjoyed the water fountain. all in all, it was good and i'd totally go back.There's different kinds of Mexican places around.  Type A:  Pseudo-Mexican fast food (Taco Bell, El Pollo Loco, Del Taco, etc.)Type B: REAL Mexican fast food (whateveri-berto's, Baja Fresh, Rubio's etc.)Type C: Various traditional taquerias (Los Favoritos, Rivas' Mexican Food, etc.)Type D: "Mexican Denny's" or chain-type sit down Mexican Restaurants--traditional-style or not (Chevy's, El Torito, Macayo's, etc.) Type E: REAL formal or semi-formal Mexican restaurants (I don't know any in the Valley yet, but in the Bay Area there is the now closed La Michoacana in San Mateo, CA, etc.)Valle Luna is a Type D, and a pretty good one as well.  Delicious traditional-style Mexican food.  The interior looks like what you usually see in a Chevy's or Macayo's.  It's visually pleasing, and service is friendly and helpful.  They have all the beers, margaritas, and tequila that you usually find at places like this (you know what I mean).  It's the kind of Mexican place you take someone for their birthday--exactly.Do you check in to places on Yelp using your iPhone?   Come to Valle Luna!  Show them the check-in on your phone and you get $5 off of a meal costing $20 or more.  Perfect for lunch with your co-worker.Valle Luna means good Mexifood.  If you're in the mood for a Type D, bypass the "Fresh Mex" and come here.
Sushi Bay=Should be advertised as: ALL-WE-WILL-MAKE-YOU-EAT.Yes, I eat a lot of sushi. Yes, the sushi here is good. Yes, it is all-you-can-eat for $21.95... For that, you would think there would be more stars, BUT READ THE FINE PRINT... YOU GET CHARGED FOR WHAT YOU DON'T EAT, INCLUDING THE EXTRA BITS OF RICE LEFT BEHIND.I can understand that if you order like 8 rolls and leave several pieces from each, it's a waste, but that was NOT the case for us. Out of the 4 of us, 3 (myself included) ordered all-you-can-eat, so they were already getting a decent amount of $ from us. What we didn't appreciate is that EVERY TIME the guy came to our table he would warn us that we HAD to finish EVERYTHING. "We charge extra for leftovers," or, "We charge extra for uneaten rice," or, "I told you we charge extra, right?" The worst part was, if he wasn't at our table warning us, he never stopped staring at us. He would stand at his podium and WATCH us eat. Then he'd go back to his sushi chef and make comments in Japanese. Specifically, he kept his eyes on me and it made me lose my appetite. He seriously made us feel like we were trying to pull some scam; it was ridiculous. Who wants to be stared down and made to feel uncomfortable while they're trying to eat? I've been a server and bartender for 5 years, and I NEVER treated any of my customers (even the deserving ones) the way the server there treated me. I'm a laid-back person and I'm generous with my reviews, but this was, by far, my WORST sushi experience. I will not be back.Weak. This place has gone down hill fast in the last year. The fish was not fresh -- the salmon had dark patches all over and the rolls kept falling apart. The chefs weren't even trying it seems, and the place was practically empty. I was a loyal customer for 5+ years, but with so many sushi options in this town there is no reason to settle for poor quality and mediocre service.A few years back I've reviewed this place a 4 star, and today is a totally different story. If there was a choice in putting zero stars, that's what I would've put for last nights dinner. I called a head of time to see how much AYCE was for adults and children and whomever answered the phone said $25 for adults, $12 for 10 and up and $6 for 5 year olds. As soon as we got there, my family of 7 were seated, and then ordered AYCE sushi dinner, so a total of 9 sushi rolls and Tuna Poke salad and few more appetizers for the first round. As soon as the Chef (main) saw what we had ordered he asked the waitress how much did you tell them the price for dinner for AYCE. As soon as she told him, he changed the price. Which was unacceptable, but we decided to stay since we were already there. As we were waiting, the SF Giants game was on and we asked the Chef if he can change the channel and he says "no we don't that" with a very rude attitude. Normally I don't take that kind of customer service, but I was hungry and was already there, so we stayed. As soon as we got our Tuna Poke. I can automatically smell the tuna. Which I'm sure wasn't fresh, just by the smell of it and I've been to almost every sushi bar in Henderson and never smelled and tasted the way Sushi Bay's is. Just as I take a bite of tuna, it was very stringy and tasted horrible. So that didn't work out. Then we got everything else, but we ordered 5 baked tempura sushi rolls which was rock hard almost as if they meant to over cook it to make it that way. They kept brining sushi we didn't order to our table and also had skipped 3 sushi rolls that we ordered and they said we had them. The first thing I order when I go to a sushi bar is Salmon Skin roll, so I know for sure they didn't make me that. No to mention, they never checked on our table and kept having to ask for water. At this point, I was already aggravated and not only did this place ruin my dinner, they ruined my ability to try new places. At least I know Island Sushi and Sushi Mon are still there to satisfy my cravings as I've been going to those sushi bars for years. Who ever is reading this, DONT COME HERE. Their fish is never fresh. TRUST ME when I say this. GO TO ISLAND SUSHI or SUSHI MON. I WILL NEVER EVER BE BACK TO THIS HORRIBLE PLACE. EVER.New Favorite Sushi Spot Alert!!We decided to try this place because we felt the need to spice up our Sushi schedule. We have three places that we alternate between and it was just time to switch things up!I am going to warn you that when you pull in here and walk up your first instinct is going to be to turn right back around and walk back to your car. Ignore this feeling, I promise you the looks are decieving. It is a very, very tiny space probably has five tables and the bar, but I am telling you the rolls are amazing and the service is incredibly friendly and welcoming!We opted for AYCE, obviously. Our rolls we tried:Screaming OrgasmNevadaDragonAmericanBaked SalmonBaked Wet DreamTako (Octopus) NigiriDynamiteWe also had Garlic Edamame, Seaweed Salad, and of course Tempura Ice Cream for dessert!I cannot wait to come back again, and again, and again!Saturday Solo Sushi-Round #21st things 1st...I can put down alot of food!...and can not justify a regular sushi restaurant without leaving broke and hungry...so I opt for All You Can Eat (AYCE) deals. Through trial & error, i've learned some AYCE sushi restaurants are very average at best, and some are truly a diamond in the rough.After a Yelp search for an AYCE sushi restaurant in Henderson that i've never been to, I went out this past Saturday 12/12th by myself for dinner, hence "solo." I arrived here after an unsuccessful attempt to eat at a nearby AYCE sushi restaurant, that I walked out of due to bad service, no oysters available on AYCE menu, and questionable sanitary practices. So here I am @ Sushi Bay, on Windmill & Pecos, for my 2nd attempt of the evening to feast on AYCE sushi.Conveniently parked right out front, walked into this very small restaurant, and was welcomed inside by a very friendly lady, who seated me at the sushi bar. The sushi chef immediately greeted me and asked if i've been here before. Nope, 1st time and looking forward to eating mass quantities of delicious sushi. The sushi bar that could seat about 8 people had only 2 other people dining. The female dining patron was loud and noticeably drunk, and he was repeatedly burping w/o the courtesy of saying excuse me. Not getting a good vibe here. I always begin my AYCE sushi adventure w/ at least a half dozen fresh oysters and at least a half dozen pieces of salmon roe. The friendly sushi chef advised me they have no fresh oysters and salmon roe is limited to only 2 pieces per AYCE.  Well, at the price of $23.95 for AYCE sushi, I know there are several other excellent options for AYCE sushi in Henderson and Las Vegas for only $2 bucks more! So I politely walked out, got in my car and began my 3rd attempt of the night for AYCE sushi.See 1 photo below...YELP 300 CHALLENGE 2015: #299

Venezia's New York Style Pizzeria=This is my 400th review, so I chose a good one.I keep getting coupons for this place. People I know(friends) say yeah, it is OK. Nothing great. It is alright.So one day it was raining and cold. I was out running errands and did not want to mess up the house cooking when I got home.So I had a coupon so I came here to Venezia's!First I called on the phone to order a large Pizza and some wings.I have been craving Wings,soooo.Anyway, I got there a little early. Parking for pick up right in front,very nice.As I sat inside looking around it was clean and well maintained.Counter for napkins, condiments and such, clean and well stocked. They were busy pick up orders, people coming in to get a slice, etc.They handle it very well. Everyone is calm and it runs very smoothly.One girl that was cutting Pizza and boxing every thing up made it all look so easy.She was wearing a hat and had tattoos,I say that because, I do not know her name.But, she was getting those orders out so quickly and efficiently/ I was amazed how she made it all look so easy. Bravo to her, she rocks.The smell inside was really good. Italian Food on a cold day smells fantastico!When We sat down to eat at home. It was fantastic! I love their Pizza. Their wings were meaty and spicy! This is it , I have found my new Pizza Heaven!I am so excited.Also I read the menu and took a to go menu home, I can't wait to try all the other items, I am sure they are just as wonderful!
Old Country Buffet=Big chains are important to submit reviews for.Even though the biz would have you believe that it  means you'll get consistent product and service across their multitudinous locations, has this ever been the case?  Even Taco DingDong taco meat is spicier in Phoenix than it is in Detroit.This Old Timer's Boofay is run sublimely compared to the metrocenter location. The service level and the quality of the food coming out of the kitchen is drastically in a different league.  Food is still pretty generic - lot's of starches and cheeses and such to fill you up.  There seems to be a bit more pride of execution here.  Yeah, I know, it's a chain buffet, practically a cafeteria.  No matter.  What many folks don't realize is the amount of food dishes in a place like this that are prepared in a traditional, homestyle way.  Things like homemade salad dressings, madaroni and cheese casseroles, etc. They do it to save money.  Reult is fresh, homestyle food for you. So they made it in a batch to serve 30 families, so what. Breakfast is the real deal here, and around $6 if you skip the overpriced drink. Huge selection of all the favorites, and they're busy enough that it stays fresh.I can't wait to be old enough to get my seniour discount here.Inside of this svelt, healthy body is trapped the wrinkly, grumpy soul of a 68 year old man.  You kids get the hell off my lawn.
Chizona's Pizza=Oh, hell YES! I am somewhat embarrassed to admit I have lived in the Valley since 1995, yet just today was my maiden voyage to the hidden gem known as Chizona's. As a Chicago girl through-and-through, I go through various stages of withdrawl for the culinary delights native to the city, including but not limited to pizza puffs and green and pink cookies shaped like leaves and dipped in chocolate, sold only at Jewel. (Although, apparently, not anymore, after I dashed in and out of no less than six Jewels looking for them during my most recent pilgrimage, eyes rolling back in my head from the tragedy of it all.)So, yeah. Chizona's. Total hole in the wall... but you're not coming here for the ambiance. The "side" salad/"one" slice and pop combo, clocking in at a staggering $6, gives you a ginormous fresh salad with crisp Romaine lettuce, chunks of tomato, black olives, and a handful of shredded mozzarella, served in a Styrofoam bowl, natch. It's practically big enough to be a meal on its own... but then you face the "slice" of pizza, which is really a quarter of a huge pizza, cut perfectly into the beloved squares. Gooey and greasy, with a thin crust that grows delightfully cracker-y towards the edges... we are talking down-home, for real Chicago goodness. The pizza puff (which I had to sample for austerity's sake) is a delectable deep-fried gooey handful of cheesy and perfectly seasoned sausage-y joy. Oh, heaven.The various hot sandwiches -- Italian beef, etc. -- are served on the Holy Grail of Chicagoland bread, Gonella bread, and they are humongous. The fries on the side are so-so, but you can bet your sweet ass I'm not wasting precious gastric space on fries when there's pizza perfection to be had.Oh delicious and heavenly joyousness. Next time you're too busted to spring for a Southwest ticket to Midway and are feeling the sting of homesickness... just pop in here. These creature comforts will dull the pain... temporarily, at least. Now, if they would only sell the pink and green leaf cookies!I'm not a fan of most chain pizza delivery spots. Because of that, I typically steer away from pizza delivery because I can't think of a good local spot that delivers in my area. But recently, I couldn't find it in me to leave my house and nothing in my refrigerator looked appealing, so I resorted to the quick and easy call to a pizza parlor. I did a Yelp search and found Chizona's which is practically down the street from me. I can't count the number of times I've driven by this little divey pizza shop and always wondered if it was good. Well, now I'm happy to finally share my report with the yelp world: it's more than good. It's delicious! The delivery process was pretty seamless. I called and ordered my pizza, paid over the phone and it was delivered to my doorstep in less than the 45 minute time frame they gave me. The delivery guy was clean cut and friendly which is important to me when I open my door up to a delivery person. So let's now move on to the food. The pizza was better than decent! It's cut into squares, with gooey cheese and nicely cooked bread. It's a couple notches above par but not quite gourmet level. It's pretty much ideal for a fatty pizza night. I ordered a side Cesar salad with it, but I should have asked for the dressing on the side because it was more like Cesar salad with a side of salad. After my experience and the quality of food, I will definitely become a regular of Chizona's and next time I will be sure to visit the restaurant itself and try the Chicago dog!Believe it or not, I haven't had the Pizza here yet.  I'm a huge fan of Pizza, but the reason for my visit is Pizza Puffs.  Yes, those mouthwatering pocket filled morsels of goodness.....it's one of the food items I associate with Chicago.When I heard this joint had Pizza Puffs, I immediately stopped by for lunch one day.  I ordered an Italian Sub & a Pizza Puff.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/6zincCvQTb9BsuK-GHZ4cw?select=Bb3c9tM6uvXJmgaiT9B8eAhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/6zincCvQTb9BsuK-GHZ4cw?select=32uwfuBXI-ig7g6METKPKAThe Italian Sub was served hot and came out first.  I kind of wish the Pizza Puff came out at the same time because it takes a little while for the Pizza Puff to cool off....but that's ok.The Italian Sub was very good.  It was a nice sized portion, not too big & not too small, just right for lunch.  The Deli Meats are tasty served hot and the Bread was very good!The Pizza Puff was brought out to me a short time later.  I couldn't wait to take a bite....hmmmm, it's just like they serve them in Chicago.  If you've never had a Pizza Puff, do yourself a favor and go out and try one as soon as possible....You'll be glad you did!Overall, it was a nice lunch, satisfying my taste for Chicago.  They also serve Pizza and Dog's here, so I will be back!Return Factor - 90%I drive by this place everyday and have never been inside, so yesterday I was feeling the urge for something new and stopped in.  Many items on the menu looked delicious and the pizza smelled awesome, but that sounded like too much food...I ended up ordering the Italian Sub and the Cheesy French Bread with marinara to-go.  I did not realize the sub came with a side of fresh cut fries, so it ended up being a ton of food, but I was not disappointed!  The French bread is made in-house and tastes good.  It came with Italian spices sprinkled over the top and the perfect amount of cheese, not to mention perfectly cooked (little crispy along the edge).  The only negative, it was a bit skimpy on the yummy marinara sauce.  The Italian sub was also tasty, no special meat or anything but delicious nonetheless.  The fresh cut fries were a pleasant surprise considering I didn't realize they came with my order :) The service was great and the gentleman at the counter was very helpful and informative.  Chizona's has been around 11 years and has a Midwestern vibe inside.  Lots of Chicago sports memorabilia on the walls and the smell of pizza, hot-dogs, and pizza puffs...yum!  I should note for all the Chicagoans that it is NOT deep-dish Chicago style pizza, but it looked good (have not tried it yet).  If you want to deliver, he informed me there is a $10 minimum. Also, they have walk-in specials (i.e.  Vienna beef hot-dog, fries and a drink for $4.99).  I have no doubt, I will be back for more!Had the opportunity to dine here with the famous Scott D and his lovely wife. We needed something quick to eat before the Doobie tribute concert and this is where we ended up. Sweet!Located in a small strip mall and easy to drive right past. This is a nice little hole in the wall restaurant with many of the all time Chicago favorites.Inside is decorated with all sorts of fun items that make you feel like you are back in the Windy City. You can order at the counter and get it to go or just sit down at one of their cozy tables and take the load off your feet.Ordered a couple of Chi Dogs and had them dressed to kill. Both my wife and Scott's went with the Chicago Dog special which comes with fries and a drink. Our traveling companion choose the Big Pizza Slice special and it was rather large. My main man Scott went with the Giant Meatball Sandwich and fries. It was HUGE!Really liked their homemade French Fries and had to grab a few from my wife's basket. The pile was very large and she insisted. Everything tasted really good and the portion sizes were quite large.Looking forward to trying out their Calzones and more of their other tasty treats in the future. Thanks Mr. Scott for recommending such a swell pick. Going to put this on my top secret rotation when in the area. CUBS WIN THE PENNANT!4.25 STARS
Tokyo House=I read all the yelp reviews. I told myself "No, Emily. You are going to try this place, you are going to eat the teryaki beef and you are NOT going to comment on the old man. This is about food damnit! YOU CAN DO THIS".*Sigh*.I love this old man. All my grandparents are dead and I want to secretly adopt him and treat him as my grandad, or just sit at a booth with my elbows out and my hands holding my head, just watchin' him work. Maybe he'd want an adopted grand daughter to tell life stories and provide asian food to? No? Maybe? Just a little bit?Well fine, I'm an independent woman and I will get over it. Maybe. My regular-sized beef teryaki was only $6 and it was a pretty big meal to eat for lunch. I really liked the sauce and the white rice, although I added some red chilli flakes in oil to give the meal a bigger kick. I thought the pricing was great, the food came out fast and you got exactly what you came for. Now lets go back to talking about the old man...I don't like to write bad reviews but this place managed to get from really good to just average to now being pretty bad.   I am giving them one star as the curry chicken is still passable, its a lot more bland and watery now. else It will be 0 star.My friend ordered and picked up our orders.  She had the terriyaki chicken and she said its watery now and it seems the taste is off.  I tasted a few pieces and the sauce is indeed very different.  Its watery and sweet and seems like something you buy in a bottle at lee lee.  FAIL, they used to claim they make the best teriyaki chicken back when the old man was here, but now I guess U can make the best teriyaki chicken at home, since it's a generic tasting sauce :)I ran into the old man that used to work here last week and his wife at lee lee's, they confirmed that they no longer work there and, whoever is writing about them being there is probably posting it in the hopes that, those who really loved his service would go back and give it a shot in the hopes of running into him.  Don't waste your time if u are hoping to do that as I think the old man and his wife frequent the fry's across the street or lee lee's more often.  If I see him again I will tell him everyone misses him and if possible get a number from him.  He is doing very well and enjoying his time off after being let go off by the new owners.   He is not interested in finding a new job for the moment as he is headed to Malaysia for a holiday in February. He is healthy and happy and glad we all remember him.  I did not have a chance to chat long with him as another former customer saw them and came over to give him a hug and chat with them.anyway, back to this place, I guess its time for me to move on to trying the food at red dragon or simply going north to aloha kitchen.  too bad this place used to be cheap and good but now I guess its just cheap.
Ray's Pizza=Knowing my love of pizza and my search for an AZ favorite, a co-worker highly recommended that I try Ray's.  Wanting to to see if the pizza was really as good as he claimed, I braved the never-ending strip mall/parking rodeo that houses this location and oh, I am so glad I did!  Walking up to the door, I nearly swooned over the beautiful aroma of baking crust, garlic and red sauce.  For me, it holds the same allure that "new car smell" holds for guys.  Inside is even better!  It is kind of a controlled chaos near the entry - lots going on but somehow it all works.  The guys behind the counter were taking orders, handing out food and working 5 ovens that I could see at the same time - very impressive!  Initially I was just going to try a slice, but decided I needed a whole pie all to myself!  It was ready quickly, and I am very proud of myself that I did not immediately rip the box open in the parking lot.  I managed to wait until I got home to savor the flavor!  Of course I went with the pepperoni and mushroom new place test combo and I was very happy.  Even reheated for lunch the next day, very tasty.  Yay!
JP Pancake=Found this place because I bought 3 Groupons.  The first time we came here was the week after the Groupon came out, which is always a mistake because this place was filled to the gills!  We were lucky to snag a table for 4 after only a short 10 minute wait.  However, several people ahead of us left because of the wait.  The other 2 visits here were no problem, but that was because it was 4+ weeks later and the Groupon rush was over.After 3 visits, here's my breakdown of the joint:+We enjoy the Mom & Pop feel to the place.  It's cozy and comforting.+The food is pretty good.  I've had the Pancakes, Breakfast Burrito, and Waffle.  All very very good.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/V81Ahkb9QFlbEx4PoeRiyA?select=rFCTC-tGavGymtsmc-ddHQhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/V81Ahkb9QFlbEx4PoeRiyA?select=MV3p0qgtMtc0j2wg-rItQA+There's Gluten-Free options.  The Better Half enjoys those options even though she's not allergic to Gluten.-The Coffee is terrible.  Watered down.-The prices are a bit high, but considering the quality of the food isn't too bad.  Just don't expect to come in and get Denny's or IHOP pricing.  Let's just say I'm glad I had the Groupon.Overall, we enjoyed our visits here.Return Factor - 60%12/03/12Hmm... I could've sworn I had written a review of this place before.  At the very least, I uploaded a few pics of our breakfast here many months ago.  Took my Mom to try the oven-baked pancakes once.  Do yourself a favor and pass on these!  Guess the review AND photos were taken down.  (Let's see how long this NEW review sticks before it's taken down, too.)Cousin texted me yesterday and asked if I'd join her for breakfast at JP Pancake today, and I texted her back guessing that it was too late to warn her not to buy the Groupon... Yes, it was.  I thought it would be a good opportunity to see if JP had improved on its service and food prep.  As you can see, it hasn't...We arrived around 7:35 am to see a deserted parking lot with the exception of one car parked in front of JPP.  It looked like we were the only souls there, besides our server and the cook in the kitchen.  I thought perhaps we'll get better service this time, since we were the only customers.  The young man asked us to sit wherever we wanted, handed us the menus and asked if we'd like some coffee or juice to start with.  I asked for coffee, while my two cousins settled on hot cocoa.  He said he'd see if they had any in the back first.  He came back a few minutes later with their mugs of cocoa (Swiss Miss and canned whip cream) and said he'd be back with my coffee.  Upon his return, we placed orders of a "Golden brown" waffle ($6.25), two full orders of French toast (one with strawberries, one with bananas, $7.95 per), and two sides of bacon (3 pieces each, $3.25 per).  I later asked if the side of ham is off-the-bone, and after consulting with the cook, he came back with a "yes."  I placed a late order of that, as well.  While the service was good (food arrived fast, server checked back to see how we were doing), the breakfast we had wasn't as good.  Our French toast slices http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jp-pancake-scottsdale?select=Q5s2HavHzD9RrGJOUbx0NA#Q5s2HavHzD9RrGJOUbx0NA were very dry-- the menu stated challah bread, but I think it was more like cake, and the slices could've used a longer soak in the egg batter.  Out of the six halves on my cousin's plate, she only had one (and all but one of her berry slices!), while I had one slice and a quarter of another of my platter.  I would've suggested we share a plate, but she didn't want to get bananas, and I didn't want any berries...  As I've said, the only winner this morning was the waffle, and I think the dollops of butter had a lot to do with its success.  (Also, I brought my own bottle of organic pure maple syrup, since most restos offer up a non-organic cane and corn syrup blend.  My cousin tried mine first before trying the restaurant's own syrup, ditched that, and then used mine until she was finished eating.)  Their sides of bacon http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jp-pancake-scottsdale?select=OP_6MgCnCpDWtxi8JJAijg#OP_6MgCnCpDWtxi8JJAijg were very costly, considering that these were very thin slices and VERY greasy (even for bacon!).  I wouldn't hesitate paying $3.50 for a very nice plate of THICK-SLICED bacon, all-natural even, but these were pathetic-looking.  As unfortunate-looking as they were, however, they did save breakfast for my cousins.  As for the miniature slice of ham http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jp-pancake-scottsdale?select=cHiSI19XYV1wUDemaXumCA#cHiSI19XYV1wUDemaXumCA I was presented with, I sent that back.  I may have been a fool to agree to waste my calories on a horrible breakfast this morning (thinking it was time to give JPP another chance for improvement), but I'm not that big a fool to allow my cousin to be charged another $3.25 for a paltry serving!Also, zero props to our server who freaked my cousin out by hugging the wall by the kitchen with what I thought was the hope of keeping out of our vision while being able to hear our conversation without success!  Her sister confirmed seeing this behavior and thought it was very creepy, too.  I wished they'd alerted me sooner (by asking me to switch seats) so that I could see what they were talking about.  Overall, what a lousy way to spend $35* and a breakfast meal out!  :(*Original ticket was just under $45, which showed the order charges totaling under $38 before tax.  If you account for Scottsdale's food tax of 8.95%, what was the extra $3, or so, for?  A hidden tip?  Finding this hidden charge was surprising, because our server did not know we were using a Groupon.  There was a sign on the door that stipulated that all Groupon customers will be charged an 18% tip at checkout, and my cousin did not mention her Groupon until we were given the check.  Perhaps, just perhaps, JPP assumes that all of their customers are Groupon-users?  Not far-fetched, since the Yelp reviews can't be helping JPP these days...
Pizza Hut=Everytime I eat at pizza hut/wingstreet I'm always disappointed. I mean how do they make a great personal pan pizza but everytime the large is undercooked and flavorless.The wings are nothing special-they charge extra for ranch etc.Way to pricy for realitively crappy pizza.$20 for pizza & wingsI hadn't eaten at this Pizza Hut location is over 10 years. I honestly didn't know there were any left in town with seating inside. I have seen them in other states and even with the lunch buffet, but sadly they have disappeared in Vegas. There isn't a salad bar or tabletop Pac-Man game like they used to have however the pizza still comes out piping hot and just tastes better than when you have it delivered or pick it up and take it home to eat it. Inside is spacious and it was really clean. Booths are spacious enough to fit the family and they have smaller tables as well. On the walls they have a few TV's mounted and the decor is cute and funny being themed around the wings they sell and pizzas. It was almost 10:30 at night (open until midnight on Saturdays) when we pulled into the parking lot and I figured hubby and I would be the only people there since there wasn't anybody inside but employees. Walking in we were greeted by Vanessa. They have a TV screen that shows how many orders there are and I noticed a couple other customers ahead of us. Vanessa took our order and let us know how long it would be. After picking a table and getting our drinks, it really started getting busy inside. There were customers picking up orders, placing dine-in orders and as well to-go orders. We beat the late night rush! Our pizza was ready in the time promised and plates, silverware, crushed peppers and cheese were brought to the table. We ordered the "Big Flavor Dipper Pizza" priced at $12.99 and our choice of 2 different sauce sets. One of eh sets just being 4 cups of marinara, we decided to chose the "explore" option which gets you 2 cups of marinara, 1 cup ranch, 1 cup BBQ and 1 cup honey sriracha. The pizza is almost 2 feet long and cut into 24 strips. Each strip had 3 pieces of pepperoni. Like I mentioned before, the pizza just tastes different when it's brought to your table piping hot and right from the oven and I like that. This pizza reminded me more of an appetizer since it's smaller than your average slice of pizza and being easily hand held with dip. It was far from any appetizer though for just 2 people and we had plenty to take home. The pizza box is also about 2 feet long, so I wonder how the delivery drivers have been doing with that?! Speaking of that, they do offer delivery here.Yes a 5 star Pizza Hut. This is is dine-in location with plenty of tables and booths. Inside is super clean and the staff is courteous. This is probably the only PH in town with a family feel to it. Pizzas are made fresh to order and are brought to your table as soon as they are finished being prepared. Any parmesan cheese, peppers, napkins, utensils, etc. you need will be brought to you by your server. Much different than delivery! I tried the 2 foot pizza and that was tasty and then just recently i had a stuffed crust with pepperoni and sausage, They have these flavor crusts now and the "hut favorite" is garlic butter with parmesan cheese and italian herbs. It's real good. They do have delivery and pick up ordering available here however I'll be dining in at this location.
Mikado Sushi=Mikado really surprised me.  I didn't expect to find a Japanese restaurant so close to home with a nice atmosphere and pretty good food...but here it is! Sushi is really the thing here.  The tempura is good although the shrimp tempura had an odd coating that didn't match the veggies and it didn't seem like authentic tempura.  Miso soup is pretty good too.But go for the sushi.  They're all about the sushi here.HORRIBLE SERVICE!! Although the food was quite delicious. I ordered a shrimp tempura appetizer, edamame and a spicy salmon roll. The total came to 18.00 even. I left 24 dollars on the table. When I left, as I approached my car, the waitress chased after me and stated "WAS SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE SERIVCE?!"Puzzled, I politely responded "no, why?"And this rude ass said "Because I thought you would have tipped more"ARE YOU JOKING ME? That is so rude and I almost wanted to tell her to give me my 6 dollars tip back because shoot, I could put that in my gas tank lady. Good food but not good enough for me to come back. Sayonara.Unfortunately we didn't have a great dining experience.  The service was slow but the portions were large.  I ordered the udon and it lacked everything.  The salmon teriyaki and pork cutlet were better.  They charge you for hot tea that tastes like hot water.
Back East Bagels=Back East is, well, not back East quality as I know it. I really do detest New York (except for the Metropolitan Museum of Art), but I have to say that the best bagel I have ever had was there. Back East is at least better than the limp sticky things from Einstein's, IMHO. I worked very near here for many years, and I would have to say that their lunch fare was better than breakfast. Their eggs are microwaved in a disposable plastic container, and I always pictured tiny little carcinogens gleefully nestling into my morning protein. I swear that the majority of the time, the early morning staff was in serious need of a caffeine jolt. Mmmmm, how I loved having some slitty eyed college girl yawn in my face and not cover her mouth. Wake up, bitch, and get my order right, for once!Lunch was far better with a wide variety of quality bagel sandwiches, so satisfying and filling I would never be tempted by the snacks in the breakroom for the rest of the afternoon. The BLT was super yum, with cream cheese, sprouts, and cucumbers as well as the B, the L, and the T.Drinks are are a little pricey, and I always found the coffee to be just alright. The best cup in the immediate area is Gold Bar, but in the direction I came, it was a bigger pain to get to most mornings. You have worse options in the AM on the corner of Southern and McClintock than Back East Bagels.
Ah-So Sushi & Steak=I'll start from the beginning... When this place is busy (for some unknown reason) the parking is a nightmare due to the lack of space and the inexperienced drivers. The absolute WORST thing was me witnessing the valet girl stalling someone's car. I really couldn't help but laugh - why would you be valeting cars if you didn't know how to drive stick?!When you walk in everything is kind of new and trendy looking. I noticed a lot of younger people like to go here so if that's not your crowd then this isn't where you want to be after 7pm. I personally don't like "trendy-young-and-cool" sushi spots. I've only gone for dinner time so I can't speak for what it's like at lunch. The few times I've been here the sushi wasn't all that great - and I feel I'm a pretty good judge when it comes to the sushi department. I try to give new places a chance so I've been here maybe 3 times. Sushi still wasn't all that, our service always left something to be desired, and the last straw....I COULD NOT BELIEVE after mediocre borderline poor service, our waitress had THE NERVE to hand me our bill and circle the suggested tip she wrote down. Seriously? I always tip my servers well and accordingly, and a whole lot more when the service is excellent. I rounded out my bill to the next dollar and will never come back here again.Horrible service. Very disorganized. It first started in the parking lot which cannot accommodate the number of customers for the plaza. So show up early and expect to have parking wars. Took me close to 20 mins and settled for an illegal spot by the dumpster. We made a reservation for 7:30 and weren't seated until 8:30. Finally ate around 9. When we asked initially when we would be seated no one could give us a time and the manager dismissed our complaint. To top it off a bartender asked why the other was miffed and she said "it's nothing, just that bitch wants water" as I saw her to deliver it to my cousin. I confronted her about it and she tried to play it off saying "oh I wasn't talking about her", uh huh. Horrible horrible experience for overpriced okay teppanyaki
Rock Springs Cafe & General Store=Rock Springs Cafe has a pie worth driving for. Believe the hype because it's true. When you walk into the store, you will immediately smell the baked goodness from the massive pies they have on display. They have everything from blueberry and raspberry to lemon meringue and of course the infamous Jack Daniel's pecan pie. Before I touch more on the pies, I'll describe the rest of the property. Rock Springs Cafe and General Store is adorable. The property houses a saloon (with $.99 PBR specials), a cafe, general store and a huge picnic area that hosts a variety of events throughout the month. I saw several picnic tables, a spot for live music, area for horseshoe tosses and more. This is definitely a spot to host a party or host out of town guests for a southwestern experience. Now moving on to the pies. Yes, the pies are as delicious as the other reviews claimed. I have tried the lemon meringue and JD pecan pies. Both are unique and both are delicious in their own way. The lemon meringue is topped with the egg whites that have been whipped to be as light as a feather. The meringue is tangy but not overpowering and I could probably consume and entire pie in one sitting. The Jack Daniel's pecan pie definitely has the JD twist, but in a subtle enough way. It adds the perfect kick to the pie and is a nice unique twist on the common pecan pie. Yes Rock Springs is about 40 miles outside of Phoenix, but it's worth the drive. It's on the way to Flagstaff and Prescott so you can either stop by on your way out of town, or you can take a drive solely for a pie! The only reason why I removed a star from Rock Springs Cafe is because of the price. $18 for a pie and $4 for a slice? As amazing as the pie was, I think that it's a little overpriced and it seems like they increase the prices because they know that once people have made it to them, they aren't leaving without a pie so they can charge them whatever they want. If they ever lowered the prices, I'd add a 5th star.Stopped in for  a quick dinner at Rock Springs.Really great service, but the food was just ok. I know this place is known for its pie, so maybe I should have had that for dinner.Had the chicken fried steak, and it was ok, but wasn't exactly a taste sensation. I would be back, because the service was fast and charming.Never in my life did I think I'd be eating breakfast at RSC at 7:30 on a Monday morning. And how I got there involves spinning a wild yarn about driving to Chinle, Arizona on the Navajo Indian Resevervation via Winslow, Joesph City, and Holbrook that started at 1:30pm on Sunday afternoon. If you've never driven through "the res" at night, don't. It's terrifying. Honestly. Scared me to death. And I don't scare easily.After waking up at 5:30am in Flagstaff, common sense says stop in Flag for a bite to eat before heading down the hill. Common sense failed us at 8pm the night before. We got to Rock Springs, and I was expecting it to be busy. Hardly. 1 group of 4 eating breakfast. After perusing the menu, I was in that state between hungry, and "ready to vomit and drool all over myself". The server was nice enough, and the coffee was good enough to stave off the vomit and drooling. I was hoping for pancakes, but since there was no real Maple Syrup, no dice. HFCS syrup is THE WORST. No aunt I've ever met would condone that. I settled on the Western Omlet. It came with "Country Potatoes", and toast. The "Country Potatoes" were the freezer stored, bag type, precut.... OMG, there's that vomit feeling again. Seriously. No honest to goodness home cookin country diner served me frozen anything. That's blasphemy, honestly. No hash browns, either. They were "out". How do you run "out" of Hash Browns? Get a potato, get a grater, and get to work! Coffee cake? No dice because they "didn't feel like making it today." I can't make this stuff up. The eggs were so weakly average, that I left about a quarter of it uneaten. It was just flat, and bland. And we paid $35 for the privilege. No thanks, Rock Springs.   About the fruit pies.... They're canned. The filling is the canned stuff that you can buy at the store. Crusts are flour, water, graham cracker. I've seen them make the pies, and my teeth hit the floor when I saw them pour canned filling into a crust. It was the generic, Shamrock/Sysco/Southwest Foods canned filling. I can't speak on the Pecan Pie, but the fruit pies are canned. Lemon Merangue, canned. Rave about them all you want, but know it's possible to make the same thing at home for a fraction of the cost. We had been buying pies here for the last 15 years on our way up to the cabin. The day I saw them pour that filling into their fruit pies, that was it. 15 years of loyal patronage, all gone.  I'm all done with Rock Springs. Pies and all.In one of my favorite movies Michael (John Travolta & Andie MacDowell) it has one scene in it where they are at a café and Andie's character sings this fun song about Pies:Pie Pie Me oh my Nothing tastes sweet, wet, salty and dry all at once o well it's pie Apple! Pumpkin! Minced an' wet bottom. Come to your place everyday if you've got em' Pie Me oh my I love pieSo I was with friends headed up to Flagstaff for some shenanigans and one said hey we should stop at Rock Springs Café for some pie, mind you we only been on the road for 20 mins and it was barely 11, but hey its perfect PIE time right???? So I got that Pie song stuck in my head and was thinking of all the glorious pies I get to try! Peach, Apple, Cherry, Banana Cream, Coconut Cream, Pecan Pies, Chocolate Silk Pies!! Oh I was very happy to be making that stop and was singing Pie Pie Me Oh My!!! I was ready to get a table at the café and share some pies with my friends!When we got there, how quickly things changed. My excitement for being there was swiftly killed by the lack of customer service and rudeness of people who worked there. I went up to the hostess podium and said we are a party of 5, we were asked what our purpose was, I told her to try some of your famous pies, we were told that they did not want us taking up tables in the Café if we were just eating pies. (Gawd forbid we would want to stop at a place that has FAMOUS PIES and want to try said PIES) We were directed to a stand to order our pies. Now I didn't come to get a piece of pie in a plastic container as if I was ordering it from Burger King or something. I wanted to sit down and have my pie presented on a plate, after all they say there pies are world famous, present it like it is, instead of fast food plastic stuff. The pie of the month looked really interesting and I would have ordered, but nope they are out. I went with the Jack Daniels Pecan Pie, it was $4.50 for the slice, now to me, it tasted like regular pecan pie, which by the way is my favorite pie, it was perfectly sweet and the pecans had a good crunch on them, but couldn't tell it was made with JD. It just didn't wow me.  And I now felt like this stop was a waste of my time, I don't see me going 50 miles out of my way to order a plastic container of pie, they might as well just open up a drive through, the staff is already rude like most fast food places and if I want a pie that will wow me I can pick up a chocolate silk turtle pie in the freezer section at the local grocery store for under 5 bucks! (Edwards Turtle Pie, if you haven't tried, you should WOW!) The 2 stars was for the pecan pie, it was good, just didn't wow me like a world famous pie should.If you're in search of food, keep driving.  If you're in search of pie, drive to the Pie Hole in Phoenix.  I used to go to Rock Springs Cafe on a monthly basis with my grandparents when I was younger.  That was our thing - taking a Sunday drive and stopping by RSC on our way back home to grab food and a piece of  "Penny's Pies".   Penny was the gal that used to make all the pies in Black Canyon City.  I learned while we were waiting for our table that there are new owners, and oh my how things have changed.  From the appearance and layout to more importantly - the quality of the food.   Keep on drivin' if you're hungry and in this neck of the woods.  J, Baby C, and I stopped by Rock Springs to get an early supper on Sunday after a day trip up north.  I told him about how good the pies were and the food was in general.  He was on board when it came time to figure out what we were doing for supper.   J ordered the meatloaf dinner and I ordered the chicken.  Our plan was to feed Baby C off of both our plates.  Good idea in theory.  When we ordered, I stated I wanted a baked potato (which was on the menu) and the gal said that they don't serve baked potatoes until after 5pm.  Ummm...Its Sunday and a holiday weekend.  If one was going to sell a baked potato, 4pm on a Sunday would be the right time.  No where on the menu did it state that baked potatoes weren't available until after 5pm.  J gets the soup (chowder) and I get a side salad.  You really cant screw up either of those.  J said his soup was pretty good.  Our dinner comes out a few minutes later.  We were shocked to say the least.  We both dig in and J immediately is repulsed.  His meatloaf was lukewarm, greasy, and the gravy on top was congealed.  GAG.  My chicken was more like a Cornish game hen.  See photo for the worlds smallest chicken leg.  It looked more like a drumette, you know, the kind you'd get with an order of chicken wings.  The vegetables that came with out dinners, a half ear of waterlogged field corn.  An ear of corn (a bad ear at that) hardly constitutes as "vegetables".  I was thinking we'd get green beans, peas, carrots, or something.  The waitress came by and saw J was not pleased.  So she took his plate and asked if he wanted anything else. I told him to skip the regular food and to just get a piece of pie.  If he was hungry, we could get him something at the outlets in Anthem (which was where we were stopping by on our way home).  J liked this idea and ordered a slice of banana cream pie.  When the pie came out, he took a few bites and that was it.  He said it tasted like imitation banana and was not cold, but slightly warm.  I seriously doubt this was a true "Penny's Pie".  More like a bad knockoff.    The only positive thing out of the whole trip was the waitress took his dinner and pie off our bill, without us having to ask or talk to a manager.  We stopped by the general store, but the guy there didn't seem interested in helping us.  Or at least helping me.  But yet he yacked it up with J for a minute.  When I walked over to the counter to try a sample he was pushing J, did he acknowledge me?  Nope.  So we left.And we wont be returning.  If we're out for a drive, and are in need of food...we'll drive to Anthem.  And - If you really want a GOOD (more like AWESOME) piece of homemade pie, go to The Pie Hole in Phoenix.  :)My wife, our friend Kathy R.and I came here for Karaoke and dinner again. When we arrived there was only a few people in the saloon having dinner.We waited a long time before someone came to our table and took our beverage orders. There was only one waiter servicing the saloon. After what seemed an eternity he eventually returned with our drinks and asked if we were ready to order.  Our friend Kathy R. ordered the fish n' chips dinner, a side salad and a piece of pie. my wife Carol ordered the honey fried chicken and waffles for her entrée. It came with a side salad, backed potato and corn on the cob. She also ordered a slice of coconut cream pie. I ordered the grilled liver and onions dinner. It came with a side salad, baked potato and corn on the cob.  When our meals finally arrived they were either lukewarm or cold. Kathy's told us to try a bite of her fish. There looked to be two small pieces of fish that wouldn't satisfy a child so we declined. We did try the "home made" potato chips. They were a little above lukewarm. Kathy said the fish was bland and if it didn't come with tarter sauce it would have had no taste at all.  She said her dinner salad was better than the last time she was there. But her apple pie tasted like it came from a can. Certainly not like home made or something that would be famous.Carol's dinner (honey fried chicken and waffles) and a slice of coconut cream pie - The chicken was cold so were the waffles, baked potato and the corn. She offered me a piece of chicken to try and sure enough it was cold. It tasted awesome and I'm sure would have been enjoyable if it was hot like it should have been. She only ate one piece and the waffles before becoming so disgusted she had enough. She ate her salad, a bite from the corn and her pie. She said her pie was very good. My entrée (grilled liver and onions) when my dinner arrived the baked potato was so cold it wouldn't even melt the butter so I didn't eat it. The corn on the cob was the same way and I left that as well. I did eat most of the liver but didn't finish it because it wasn't hot.  there was also a small dinner salad that came with my meal which I ate.We were all going to send our dinners back but our waiter disappeared for so long and we were hungry we dug in. Like I said we were all hungry.Kathy R. ate her salad. Her fish dinner was two pieces of small fish and lots of "home made" chips. She ate the fish after smothering it in tarter sauce, her salad and some of the chips.I'm surprised when our waiter finally came back to our table he didn't ask how our meals were or comment about all the food that wasn't eaten. Nope he didn't even bother. Maybe he figured it was better not to ask. I don't know.FOOD: Portions are OK although our friends Kathy's fish looked like it came off the kids menu it was so small. SERVICE: Slow, slow, slow but it wasn't our waiters fault it is managements. Our waiter was actually hustling and doing his best. CONCLUSION:  We all decided everything considered when we return here for  Karaoke we would stop somewhere else for dinner. None of us wants to give this place another try. Especially in light of their prices. I don't mind spending my hard earned money at a restaurant if the food is good. This place does not deserve our continued support. If I could have rated this experience on a scale from one to ten, one being bad. I'd rate it a - minus 20!!!! RETURN FACTOR FOR FOOD: 0%************************* What does my OVERALL rating mean?*************************5 stars -Highly recommended.  I would be willing to drive out of my way to this business. It is that good. This place represents their industry or cuisine very well! 4 stars - Highly Recommended. I would frequent this business. 3 stars - Not that good but not that bad. Just average. I wouldn't mind going again. 2 stars - I would not recommend this establishment to friends or family. 1 stars - DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND DO NOT patronize this business. I would RUN AWAY from this place and you should too! DON'T WAST YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY AT THIS ESTABLISHMENTRolled up to the Rock Springs Café (RSC) on the way back to Phoenix after a long day up in Sedona. This place came highly recommended by my Yelp bud, Laz C, and my sister had also heard great things but, sadly, had never been. As we pulled up the first thing you notice is the full lot; Harley's next door at the Biker Bar; and the huge sign with a picture of a pie staring you in the face--the whole scene is a bit surreal and looks straight out of a Patrick Swayze movie. So we sashayed our purty lil' selves in there and began to look around. They sell the usual road side attraction tchotchkes and knick-knacks here at RSC -and they also have a Diner- but we came here with one objective: Pie. After much debate we settled on ordering two different ones: Peach Crumble and Coconut Cream--because some people preferred fruit and others preferred cream.Peach Crumble- The crust and filling on this was fabulous; you could really taste the Butter they use in the crust and the Peach flavor was really strong--almost enhanced in some way. Also, the pie wasn't ridiculously sweet either. 5*Coconut Cream- Usually on these types of pies I end up scooping off the Whipped Cream on top and just eating the filing and crust, but this was a different story; the Whipped Cream was 100% real and delicious. The filling and crust were also quite good but I felt the coconut flavor was a bit much. With that being said it's still maybe the best Coconut Cream Pie I've had. 4*Service & Ambiance- The girls behind the counter were very kind and patient and didn't rush us as we vacillated on what to order. As I mentioned before the ambiance is pretty great; your really do feel like you've warped back in time in places like this. 5*Value- The first thing you notice about these pies when you get them home is they're huge! RSC sells a slice as 1/6 of the pie, but realistically you can get 8-slices out of it. They're actually not a bad price at ±$18/each--I've seen homemade pies of this caliber go for nearly $30 back home in Cali. 4*RSC was a terrific ending to a great day in Sedona. I highly recommend stopping by if you're passing through the area as they're conveniently located right off the freeway. So, come on in and grab yourself a slice -à la mode- and enjoy the time warp. Highly recommended!I've been meaning to try Rock Springs Cafe for their World Famous Pies for years now on my trips to Flagstaff or Sedona. Last Sunday after our weekend of off roading, hiking and winery adventures, Dude and I decided to swing by for a slice of that supposedly amazing pie - Jack Daniels Pecan Pie as specifically mentioned by some of our pals! When we got in, the store had all of your typical Southwest souvenirs, a variety of jams, candies and other cooking goods. We saw the place to queue up for slices of pie. And man, I have to say the attitudes of the team here could use a major facelift. Getting snappy with customers asking basic questions about your product? Wow! Also, the attire of some of these gals was awful sloppy. I don't say this to be superficial or petty, but a proper fitting shirt that covers your midsection goes a long way in a customer-facing role. Have a little pride in your appearance! Anyway, at that point we were happy to pay and hit the road home. Once we finally tore into the pie, I was highly unimpressed. The pecan pie filling was unremarkable, and despite following Jason B.'s advice on waiting for that subtle JD taste after you swallow ... I just couldn't detect any. But the crust was quite excellent! My Mom said we should have stuck to the Lemon Meringue and Blueberry Pies. Good to know now, but based on the nasty customer service here and the unexciting pie, I won't be going out of my way to try it again. Perhaps on another trip up North.Stopped here again a couple of weeks ago on my way back down from Flagstaff.  This is becoming a normal stopping point on the I-17 for me.  It's just far enough away from Flagstaff that it gives you a great opportunity to stretch your legs or get a snack.Anyway, this time I had my 2 littles; the 9 year old and the 4 year old, and they both wanted slices of the chocolate pie and I wanted a piece of the Jack Daniels Pecan Pie.We got our pie to go and were back on the I-17 before my boyfriend, whom I'd been following down the mountain, had even realized we'd pulled off the road!  Back at home we had our pie, and it was glorious.  Of course my pie was delicious, no surprise there, that's why I always get it.  But this time I also snuck a taste of the kids chocolate pie...  Full disclosure: I am normally not a fan of chocolate pie.  I think I had one too many crappy chocolate pudding pies as a kid and it put me off of chocolate pie forever.  This chocolate pie on the other hand was amazing: the crust was buttery and flaky, and the chocolate filling was smooth and slightly sweet, but not cloyingly so, with a slightly dark chocolate aftertaste.  The whole pie was garnished with delicately sweetened whipped cream that added to the velvety creaminess of the chocolate filling.  I'm telling you, they knocked this one out of the park!  I'm still not a fan of chocolate pie, but I am a fan of THEIR chocolate pies.  I may be more than a fan....I may become a crazed stalker...
McDuffy's-Peoria=This club was really creepy. Aside from the impressive two story set-up with pool tables and  loungey space upstairs, I was not impressed. Our group was really out-of-place. Our ladies weren't dressed sleazy or tacky enough with cheapy slutty clothing. And our guys weren't dressed generically enough (think black/white mall-wear). Drinks were much weaker than the previous establishment we went to (Fox and Hound).Ahh, the things I will do for friends. Going to Mc Duffy's for a friend's birthday night out is one of those gestures. My McDuffy's good deed has me off the hook for another year I suppose. I was actually having more fun at Fox and Hound and wish we had stayed there.An extra star for the doorman knowing one of the girls in the group, letting the guys in our group bypass the $10 cover. $10 too much in my opinion.
Jolta Java=Jolta Java. I've had you on my radar for a few months. I remember stopping by once a few years ago and had a pleasant experience. This time... Not so much.The coffee drink I got was tasty, and I'm very happy that they carry both almond milk AND soy milk for us lactose intolerant folk. This is where my happiness ends.This place needs a SERIOUS deep clean. The floor was covered in crumbs, the tables were littered with debris of various food and paper products. The fake plants were dusty and if you look up to their massive ceiling, all the huge pipes are COVERED in dust. It's an asthmatic nightmare. People would finish their beverage or food and then the table wouldn't be cleaned for a minimum of ten minutes.The staff were completely apathetic to all of this. It wasn't busy, so they stood around behind the counter either looking at their cellphones, chit chatting, or watching the Olympics. Sad customer service. The more I type out, the more I realize that this shop needs more than a cleaning. It needs an attitude and staff adjustment. I doubt I'll return.
Convenient Corner Market=Not only do these guys have the best subs but they know everyone by name and what they usually buy. And they can usually have me rung up by the time I make it to the register. I love these guys! I
Joe's Crab Shack=We've always liked Joe's Crab shack and the one at the Mills is really loud so we decided to try this one. Anyways, it's the normal looking Joe's with merchandise to buy. The music isn't blasting so it was better and better atmosphere to eat at. The servers dance as usual for all the customers every once in awhile. To start off, we had the Classic Sampler which included fried calamari, Jalapeno balls, Tortilla chips with a Crab dip. The calamari was okay and the Jalapeño balls had a really nice kick to it and the crab dip was pretty good. Nothing great. Nothing to write home about. Also, my wife and son ordered the clam chowder. They always have to try everyone's chowder. This was probably the most disappointing chowder. I tried it and it didn't have a lot of taste plus it was luke warm. Not good. For dinner, I had the Artic Bay Steampot. It had Lobster, Crab legs, Shrimp, Sausage, potatoes, and corn on the cob. It was okay. Not a lot of taste. At the middle of my meal, everything was cold. Not a real fan. Seafood was okay. The sausage seemed like it had a hard skin and wasn't very tasty. The best part of the meal was the corn in the cob. My wife had the Spaghetti Lobster. It was served cold. So she didn't eat it. Wasn't at all impressed. The manager came by to ask us about our food and we told him that the clam chowder and spaghetti lobster was cold when we got it. He apologize and took it off our bill. Plus he gave use a few coupons for free appetizers. So as you can see, we didn't have a very pleasant experience today. Food was so so and cold. Not impressed at all. If we do ever come back, it probably won't be for a long time cause there's just too many place to try. Good Luck at this place.It was the 1st month of year and it was already kicking our ass so some coworkers wanted to get together for an happy hour/dinner and the place picked was Joe's Crab Shack, alright I'm in.I was lucky enough to work the early shift that day so another coworker and I headed off and got there around a quarter to 5, just in time for happy hour! 5 dollar drafts & apps! Hello!! So I ordered a blue moon or 2 or 4, whose counting lol and some crazy good crab dip.  The crab dip was loaded with crab meat in a melted cream cheese & parmesan mix, it was great! Went well with the Blue Moon!Everyone arrived around 6pm so off to a table we went, I knew I wanted crab and that's what I went for!A bucket of Queen Crab but in the Cajun flavoring, came with French fries and hushpuppies, it was 1 ¼ pound of crab, and it was good! I enjoyed my dinner!Service was great, food was good! Great times were had!
Flo's=I've been to Flo's numerous times over the years, but there seems to be a downward trend.  It looks like I'll be finding a new Asian Fusion spot...The Man and I had a couple hours to kill and hungry bellies to feed, so we popped into Flo's for their (seemingly) amazing happy hour.  I ordered a froo-froo drink, which I'm pretty sure was half-price because it contained half the alcohol it normally does.  Tasty, but strong? Um, no.  We moved on to a bunch of appetizers: crab puffs, chicken satay, spring rolls, BBQ pork, and pot stickers.  The BBQ pork was yummy, but that is where our satisfaction ended.  All of the other items seemed no better than from-the-freezer snacks I can get at the grocery store.  Are they making any of these on site?  Maybe, but it sure didn't taste like it.  The crab puffs were the most disappointing.  So little crab, so much cream cheese.  They should definitely take a look at that ratio and either rename the dish or up the crab quantity.  Just a thought...Now I'm off on a journey for a new go-to Asian spot!2/28/14Called out sick from work, and I was craving for egg noodles with either beef, or chicken with ginger, so we ordered the Mongolian Beef (an entree I've already tried before), Thai-style Green Curry chicken (new to me!), and Shrimp with snow peas for Mom for pick-up.  Enjoyed the Mongolian beef (beef with onions, jalapeños, red pepper flakes, and something that looks like sweet potato leaves), but as always, I felt a little let-down when I bite into the pieces and did not find the satisfactory crunch of the caramelization of past Mongolian beef entrees I've had elsewhere.  I was looking forward to the ginger-hot spiciness of the green curry chicken, and while it was slightly underwhelming, which I'm sure is most likely from the fact that I'm suffering from a cold and could not taste all of the flavor notes, I was happy to be able to detect the ginger in the dish.  I loved the long beans in this entree, which also had basil, lemongrass, fresh chilies, shallots, galangal, garlic, and cilantro.  I had a taste of both dishes for lunch, and I would have to say that the beef was more flavorful- saltier, and definitely spicier!  The noodles were angel hair-thin and had not satisfied my dietary lust for stir-fried noodles I fancied while languishing in bed waiting for lunch time to roll around...  I offered to share my dishes with Mom, but she was too busy enjoying her Shrimp and snow peas!Dinner time came, and I enjoyed the noodles and green curry even more-- it tasted even better, or perhaps I was feeling better from the OTC medication and rest...   Wished this dish contained a LOT of long beans, as I find myself rationing the remaining amount...  Btw, each entree came with a side salad and the signature house dressing.
Thee Pitts Again=I'm no connoisseur based on living in a certain part of the country or anything like that, so I won't discuss regional styles or anything heady like that; I just know it's good when I taste it.Pulled pork sammy  on egg bread kaiser roll was really good.  Not too fatty, but enough for some juice and flavor.  Portion size that looked nicely 'good enough' to my extra hungry eyes, but quickly swelled into 'more than enough' once I was well into it.  Sauce was good - sweet and tangy - but I wished it were a little more smoky, since in it's current form it seemed to conjur in my mind the thought that it tastes a little bit reminiscent of McD's prepack nugget bbq sauce.  I stilll liked-ed it.I had to remind myself to put down the sandwich at about 2/3 finished with it, in order to eat some of my fries.  Putting down the large sized sammy was no small feat, since at this point in time my hand was basically the only thing holding it together!  I managed to put it down safely and get to the fries, which were thick cut and seasoned as if they were curly fries.  Okay, but not made here in the kitchen, that's for sure.It was important to finish the fries first, so that the tasty juicy pulled pork and sauce was to be the last flavor in my mouth, the one that would linger.  If you're like me, you put a lot of thought, as you eat a meal, into which flavor you'd like your last bite to be.  It's way more personally important than considering what your breath will smell like later to others.  If a part of the meal was good enough, and I know I want that flavor to be the last bite, it's worth it for me to skip dessert!Service was fast with not over the top, but subdued, friendliness.  Perfect tone for a solo late lunch diner.  I'm sure she would have bubbled right up for a family with kids.  All of today's daytime staff I encountered seemed to be experienced pros.Before tip and extras, the sandwiches are around 8 bucks.  The fact that I'm still full (satisfied, not uncomfortable) 4 hours later means it was certainly worth it.  The freaky decor will have you in pig-kitsch night-terrors.  Look for the flying pig attached to the pounded tin ceiling tiles, that is painted to look like a Hindu deity ~ bizarre even in this place.I really wanted to like this place knowing the owner is a world champion of bbq but obviously he isn't involved with managing the restaurant. The brisket was garbage, the corn bread was equivalent to a scotchpad and the beans were just ok. Their mac n cheese is kraft...??? Can't a bbq restaurant make their own? I thought they usually do.I did like the sauce. I may give them another chance and then edit this review after that but it may be awhile until I work up the courage to eat there again.A day after eating here, I nicknamed this place "Thee Pots" because that's where you will spend part of your day after eating here.Visited 6/2/12....So..... My quest for good BBQ in Arizona continues!!We actually took the time to drive across down just to visit this location.  My friend recommended it based on prior experiences from years ago.  And also because it made Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives.  Our hope was to find a better experience than our weekend prior. We were very disappointed!!  I had the meat combo.  It is a sampler of all the meats.  Brisket, Pulled Pork, Chicken pulled, Ribs - both Beef and Pork, Ham, and Chopped (a mix of chopped pork and ham?)  The meat had no appetizing appearance.  The taste was not much better.  The meat was dry on top and dry through out.   Ribs over cooked as the meat on pork ribs were falling off the bone. The available sauce on the table was basic. And when I asked for a hotter version of the BBQ sauce, I was brought another bottle that came cold (like out of the refrigerator) and it was not very spicy - even for my friend. The sides were disappointing.  The Baked Beans tasted much like they came out of a can.  The Cole Slaw was bad - like it went bad.  Tasted sour and bitter.  So bad that I sent it back..The only good thing were the Onion Rings.  These were very crispy and fresh.  We went in about an hour before closing.  There were very few people there.  But service was slow.  Took about 15 minutes just for the Onion Rings.  And another 15 minutes for the main dishes  Considering this is a BBQ meat that is supposedly slow cooking for hours, it seems like it would not take very long to prepare.  Unless you have to go back and reheat??  (Just thinking out loud here.)Over all this was a failure.  A wasted hour drive for BBQ that would have been better at some local chain locations. Maybe it was because we arrived close to the closing hour?  But then again, if you seat me, then serve me a good dish.  Otherwise, don't serve me!!Finally, would I return??  Maybe? For lunch and a quick sandwich.  Will I ever drive that far again.  NO.  Are there other choices in this area, YES.This place is gross their sauce taste like ketchup the food is alright but this is not award winning BBQ they must have stolen someone else's awards and put their name on them! We went here cause it was on DDD and boy were we disappointed not to mention our waitress was rude and took forever to bring anything to our table in the middle of the day the place was empty! If you want good BBQ don't come here because you won't get it!
Babbo Italian Eatery=Spaghetti... meat balls.  I stopped in here with a friend because we were both hungry and this place was convenient for us.  The service that I received was nice and I enjoyed my server very much.I was really sad that the place that advertises "Spaghetti ... meat balls" didn't nab at least 3 stars from me.  I suppose it is an uphill battle for any Italian restaurant because I don't eat pasta.  *gasp*  I know.  I just don't eat it.  I think pasta is a bunch of empty, tasteless calories.  Yikes.  So, when I go to Italian restaurants with friends, I always order any pasta dish w/o the pasta sub a veggie or lettuce.  I don't mind paying extra for what I want.  This is the first establishment that I've been told that wasn't an option.  I just don't see why not if you're making the ingredients to order to put OVER plain pasta or tossed with plain pasta.  Why can't I have it "OVER"/"with" anything I choose if I'm willing to pay?  I would have loved to have ordered the roasted asparagus with the Bolognese, I'd imagine if the Bolognese is half way decent, it would have been awesome with that bread.  IDK.  But, that's the way they choose to run their business and I was fine with that.  The server was kind enough to point me to some other options on the menu that did not have pasta in them. Great, I can work with that.  I went for the Asparagus Fra Diavolo with roasted chicken and the Mista Salad.  The Mista Salad was delicious.  I believe I had it with their house dressing.  YUMMY house dressing.  I also dipped their bread in the salad dressing.    Oh wait.  How could I forget the bread.  Wowzer!  Their bread that they serve prior to the meal is simply divine.  Warm, moist, soft and tasty.  Very good.  So, back to the Asparagus Fra Diavolo with roasted chicken.  I just simply didn't enjoy it.  It didn't taste good to me.  :-(  My friend ordered the Jambalaya and that tasted pretty good to him.  I have heard the east VAlley location was good, so maybe I can give that a try some day.Sadly, this was likely my first time and my last time here.  I didn't get to find out if Spaghetti enjoyed "meat'ing" Balls or not... So sad.BTW, they have a very nice patio dining space.
Buon Gusto Ristorante=*** #200 ***Mamma Mia!  Judging from my recent experience, this is a super-fine ristorante that serves up superior Southern Italian cuisine.  Diane and I have the good fortune of being friends with several married couples who are always game to try out the cuisine of new dining venues.  On one such gustatory adventure four of us took over a table for six at Buon Gusto, and filled it to overflowing with various dishes.  I appreciated that shakers of grated Parmesan Cheese sat at both ends.  The owners and head chef were not even around, and yet the coordinated operation of the skilled culinary team on a very busy Thursday night still hummed along beautifully under its very able management.  Service was friendly and efficient, with our table checked on several times.  I just had to ask for one water refill twice.We began with a loaf of excellent baked Italian bread that was both complimentary and warm.  It was so good with butter or vinegar and oil that my party polished off this and another 1-1/2 loaves by meal's end.  Next for me was a good but barely hot small bowl of Italian Wedding Soup with tasty but tiny meatballs and only bits of spinach.  This was really the only low point of my meal.A generous side Caesar Salad with excellent creamy Caesar Dressing, fresh chopped Romaine Lettuce, and crunchy croutons was presented next.  Crab-stuffed Mushrooms were simply excellent, and lightly floured Calamari served with a Sicilian Sauce that tasted like a slightly amped up mild Marinara was very good--one of the best I have experienced in the Vegas valley.A long interval separated appetizers, soup, and salad from the entrees.  But this was understandable, since by this time (about 7:30 p.m.) the place was packed with patrons.  Now we really put the table to the test.  Soon it groaned under the weight of Shrimp Parmigiana with Alfredo Sauce, Veal Parmigiana, Manicotti, Penne with Meat Sauce, a Meatball, Fettucccini Alfredo, and Penne Pasta with Alfredo Sauce.  The tomatoey, cheesy, thinly pounded, and double folded Veal Parmigiana was great.  And so was the Fettuccini, nicely tossed with thick and tasty Alfredo Sauce.  Portions were quite large.  I barely finished mine, but everyone else took home leftovers to enjoy another day.  All dishes on the table looked and smelled great, as did a pizza just across the way.  Ahh, that will have to wait for another day!  One can only consume so much at a time!We still saved a little room for dessert though.  Homemade Tiramisu was light and airy.  And, we rounded out a memorable meal by sharing generous portions of rich Chocolate Gelato and refreshing Lemoncello Gelato.  As a final whimsical flourish, 8 wrapped Mini-Tootsie Rolls were placed on top of the bill.  Even they were good: fresh and soft!  I will most definitely be back--the sooner the better!Great Italian. Very friendly service. Owner seems to genuinely care about his staff and customers. Waitress was very attentive, made sure to refill our drinks often.  She also forgot to ring in something that we ordered, but immediately told us once she realized. I appreciate when service staff is honest, and it turned out we were stuffed, so we decided to just get it to go. It's a small place, but they seem to be always busy. (may have to wait for a table, but totally worth it) Now about the food:Meatballs are very flavorful (I recommend adding them to the top of the manicotti dish, which is now my favorite. The soup of the day was chicken pot pie, and it was seriously one of the best things I've ever put in my mouth. Sooo yummy. Other entrees I'd recommend are lasagna, baked Ziti and the gnocchi. I haven't tried the pizza, but I'll definitely be back.Excellent service. The service is probably what stuck with me more than the food. The restaurant is located in the corner of a shopping center on Horizon Ridge and Eastern -- pretty difficult to spot unless you are familiar with the area.Inside of the restaurant is compact, charming, and homely (in a comforting way). The male server that greeted us may have been the owner. He was interested in hearing how we heard of the place, made sure to explain the menu and offer suggestions based on some of his favorites, and checked in on us regularly throughout the meal.We opted for the calamari "best in town" as an appetizer ($8.95). It was fine, cooked tender but overkill on the batter.The food, or perhaps what I ordered, wasn't mind blowing or innovative. It was simple chicken marsala, and sure maybe it is partly my fault for going for the basic, unimaginative option, but to my credit the menu did claim "best marsala in town". Not sure that I will agree there. There really is only so much you can do with a straightforward dish like that, hence why I will not dock them more than a star for the food. The chicken was cooked well, marsala wine sauce was fine, and the mushrooms were...mushroomy? The meal did come with the option of soup or salad; I opted for the chicken and mushroom soup. The soup was really, really good. I also opted for a side of baked ziti in regular tomato sauce. That also was not very memorable. But the meal was a great value for $16.95.I love Italian food, it is the first type of food I learned how to cook and excel in, so maybe I should just not go out to eat at Italian places because my expectations are really really high. I go as far as making my own homemade pasta and sauce with as many natural and fresh ingredients as I can.  I have yet to be wowed by an Italian eatery with the exception of Scarpetta.I felt inclined to write this review after my experience last night.  My friend and I wanted some good pasta so I recommended we go to Buon Gusto. My friend had never been and I'd been to Buon Gusto several times and always had wonderful experiences there - except this time. It took 10-15 minutes just to be acknowledged upon arrival. No host/hostess was in sight.  After we were seated, they took our order quickly and returned with our salads and then we waited...and waited...and waited. They didn't even offer us bread while we were waiting until we asked. The bread was fresh and soft but the oil was an overkill. Imagine 95% oil, 5% vinegar. 35 minutes later as we waited, a cockroach decided to join the party. It ran across the wall under one of the paintings and attempted to hop in my friend's purse. We let our server know but by the time he returned with something to kill the cockroach, it disappeared. That should have been our cue to leave but instead we decided to relocate to the front dining area. One hour and 15 minutes later plus 2 and a half loaves of bread, our food arrived. I ordered the sausage and mushroom rigatoni, and my friend ordered the champagne chicken. The sausage and mushroom rigatoni was subpar. It was basically rigatoni drowning in a store bought vodka sauce garnished with a handful of mushrooms and cut up sausage. The champagne chicken was terrible. The texture of the chicken breast was like plastic and it was pale in color. Neither of the dishes were hot either. It was definitely not worth $20.00. To top it off, the server was rushing us to pay our bill. They didn't offer to give us a discount on our bill and a manager didn't even come to our table to apologize for the cockroach or the wait for our food. It wasn't even that busy! Honestly, we couldn't get out of there fast enough. The only positive things about our dining experience was the bread and the salad.After an afternoon of shopping, my friend and I were famished and decided to try Buon Gusto for dinner since we had a coupon. We walked in at 8pm and it took some time to get seated since it's a pretty small place. We were finally seated and our waitress took our drink order. I ordered the baked ziti Siciliano and the Italian wedding soup. Our order took a pretty long time coming out and after about 20 minutes of waiting the waitress came out to let us know that she was sorry for the wait since they had apparently closed down the kitchen without letting her know and that they had to start it all up again to cook our orders and that of another table that came in before us. I'm a little surprised and disappointed that they decided to close down the kitchen a good hour before they were scheduled to close. Seems like a bad business practice. If we had known that the kitchen was closed, we would have found another place to eat, but after waiting so long we figured we might as well wait it out. The soup was lukewarm, not surprising after hearing about the kitchen snafu. Our entrees finally came out and they were decent. My pasta was good and I enjoyed the sauce quite a bit. The eggplant was overcooked and had an unappealing texture.Our server was sweet and she kept an upbeat attitude despite all the shenanigans that seemed to be going on in he kitchen. The kitchen staff seemed to be playing around and more focused on wanting to leave for the evening, which made us uncomfortable and we ended up rushing through our meal to leave.I see this being a decent spot for take out, but try not to come by too close to closing time.Buon Gusto. I'm very much in like with you. Knowing this place gets packed on Saturday nights and the fact that they only boast eight or so tables, the GF and I decided to call-in our order, thinking this would be faster, that was not the case. We went with Italian style sub sandwiches, one chicken parm and one meatball with a side order of sausage and marinara, the very classic and basic of Italian deli style eats. Once ordered we were told it would be about 15 minutes, upon arrival we found out our food was still not ready, but we were reassured that everything would be done shortly. Another ten minutes later, still no sandwiches in my hand. After waiting another five minutes and noticing the place wasn't that busy, we asked how much longer, "they should be done very soon... what was your order again?". Excuse me, how do you know if the food will be done soon if you don't even remember what my order was? Hearing this response and realizing that the fella behind the counter didn't seem to care about the tardiness of our food, my GF got a little heated and exclaimed that we had been waiting over thirty minutes for two sandwiches. The fellas response, "thirty minutes, are you sure?". I was stunned at that response and thought my GF was going to jump over the counter. After this delightful interaction our food finally arrived and we headed home. After unwrapping everything we noticed it was piping hot, this was good sign. The cheese was still melting and everything looked and smelled fresh. The bread was super soft and the sauce was flavorful and had some heat to it. The meatball sub was a very heavy meal, but the meatballs were great and a little misshapen, which hopefully proves the fact that they make them in house. I only had a bite of the chicken parm, but the chicken was tender and the breading was crisp. After a rocky start at Buon Gusto, the food more than made up for the wait time. This isn't me saying I like waiting thirty minutes for food, but if you're going wait that stuff better be on point!We've been waiting to try this place for a while so we found an excuse to drive out to Henderson, after going to the movie theatre we decided to check this restaurant out. It's a very casual setting, kinda like a pizzeria back east, with the red and white checkered table cloths and all. As soon as we walked in we were told to sit anywhere and the server took our drink orders right away. I ordered the chicken francese with a side of penne with marinara sauce. My meal came with a small salad to start which was really good. The chicken was rather delicious just the right amount of lemon flavor in it, not to much. I thought the size was small, looked like a chicken breast pounded out and cut into 4 pieces. I scarfed it down rather fast then worked on the side of penne which tasted perfect, if you ask for bread they will bring it to you to scoop up any leftover sauce. My only complaint is that IMO it's not worth what they charge, it's not fine dining. $15.95 for my meal and they charge an extra $2.95 for the side of pasta, pasta is customarily included with the meal at Italian restaurants. Don't like the nickel and diming. If the lunch portion was this much I wonder how much the dinner portion is. Not stingy so just saying. Other than the quantity and price the food was still good and the service was equally good to. Servers were very friendly and kept checking out table for refills. I will definitely give this place another chance, maybe the portions are better at dinner. I wasn't full when I left.
Golden Steer Steakhouse=A classic.Picture where players of the mobbed up Vegas (60's and 70's) met to eat and discuss "business" and you're picturing the Golden Steer.Don't let its location (the "bad lands" with its wedding chapels, strip clubs, sex shops) and dated exterior keep you from trying this  steakhouse.  Step inside and you're in another era.Table side preparation is a specialty and therefore a must try.  The Caesar's salad (traditionally made with the raw egg and anchovies) is as good as any.  The lobster bisque is sublime.  Classically prepared old school style.  The steaks are very good.  All of it is prime but unlike the top steakhouses on the Strip, the meat is not heavily trimmed.  There is a good amount of fat and grizzle on a perfectly cooked piece of beef.  Once again, classic and fitting for this restaurant.  The T-Bone is excellent as is the simply prepared prime rib.Do not pass up the banana foster.  It is prepared table side.  A great show and a great desert.Service is extremely friendly.  The highly knowledgeable servers make you feel like a returning guest.The wine list is OK.  Nowhere near as extensive as many of the other top steakhouses on the Strip but prices are very good.Only two visits so far but more to come.Recommended.OK so DON'T go here... it's that easy!!! There were so many things wrong with my dining experience it's hard to even figure out where to begin!1) SERVICE-- I went on a Sunday evening and sat at the bar so I could watch football. The poor bartender does everything here.  She had 9 people at the bar, was cleaning glasses, answering the phone,getting our food  AND she has to make all the drinks for the waiters. And when I say ALL the drinks, they come up to her for a COKE, they don't even have a fountain drink machine for the waiters to do it themselves.  Needless to say, it took her a while to get my food ordered. There also was a group of 3 guys that sat next to me that were ordering food and playing video poker too [hold that thought].2) DRINKS--They have video poker at the bar. Fine by me. THEY DON'T COMP your DRINKS at the bar. Unheard of in Vegas. I lost $40 bucks and still paid FULL price for my 2 glasses of wine.3) FOOD--Bread? They have bread here???? Based on the other reviews apparently they do. We didn't' see any bread at the bar- carb free for us! My meal came out before my salad. Noooo bueno.  Also, about 25 mins after I ordered my meal arrived. WHY so long you ask? Because the bartender has to leave the BAR and go get the food herself. I have never in my life seen a restaurant where the bartender goes and gets her own food.  The reasoning for my salad coming out late, the waiters were getting there before her, and since the Caesars are made to order I lucked out.  Let's talk about the food...I order the combination meal-petite fillet, salad, veggie, & shrimp scampi to the tune of $65. Outback has better steak then this place. It was really dry [see pix] there wasn't even any juice on the plate. When I think of shrimp scampi-garlic, white wine, shrimp, butter, and parsley comes to mind.  This was NOT that.  It was gelatinous kinda like shark fin soup & the tails were still on the 5 shrimp.  Side of broccoli extremely undercooked. It needed 2 or 3 more minutes in the microwave from where it came from.Guys next to me started laughing when my food arrived. Then I one upped them told them I bet their apps come out with their food....well I was sort of right. Their food came out, but there were no apps with it. So poor little bartender, now has to leave the bar, for about the 5th time [with 9 people at it PS-it only seats 12] and once again go get our food. PS- I complained about the order in which the food came out, hostess did come talk to me [she might have been the manager] instead of apologizing, offering me a dessert, taking off a glass of wine, she told the bartender if she starts to get behind let her know and she'll help out.  I mentioned to her too the same thing happened to the guys next to me. She offered no apologies and didn't even go speak with them.Mind you we are drinking, eating, AND playing at this place.  My meal cost me well over $125 and was worth about $30 in my opinion.Again STK or Botero are much better options. I also have no idea how anyone else had a GOOD experience here as this might be the worst experience I've had in Vegas and maybe in a restaurant period.I just received the worst service experience in my years of eating at high end steak houses. The food was good overall but I don't need to be disrespected and insulted on top of mediocre service when I'm dropping a grand in your establishment.We had a group of 8 get together for a post Viva Las Vegas dinner. Please note that while this is a rockabilly convention we all dressed up to the nines for a "classy" dinner experience at the Golden Steer. When we arrived we asked to have separate checks because as with many high end steakhouses, the items are served ala carte. Thus, it makes figuring the bill at the end a nightmare with this many people. The excuse was the computer system can't handle it..and apparently writing it down on paper is too hard as well for the 200 dollar tip. Our group was not loud nor over demanding yet had a lot of trouble getting service in general as others have mentioned in reviews recently. As expected, the chaos begins when it comes check time. We get handed one copy of the check and are basically told "you need to figure it out". After lots of asking we finally got multiple copies to try and make sense of the confusing bill. This whole process takes us 40 minutes of struggling with the staff to clarify the bill as if it just too much trouble for them despite the place being less than half full. We ended up missing a show in Vegas we wanted to attend dealing with this fiasco.As we start paying, the real fun begins. We are told by one of the servers in a very condescending and rude tone "well, maybe they do that at Denny's but we dont do it here" in regards to the poor service with the check. It seemed to be a personal shot based on being from the convention. Also, when asked why we are not being taken care of as is a servers job.. He replies "is it my job?" as if he would be doing as little as possible for the 20 percent tip. The older waiter over hearing the conversation was clearly embarrassed by his colleagues remarks.Sorry but there are too many other great steak houses in Vegas to deal with lazy and insulting staff. Perhaps he should not have been so judgmental. I work for a Fortune 100 company and like to take clients to dinner. I make a good living and I am highly educated, I dont eat at Denny's thanks.  I don't need this garbage. Guess who isn't taking any clients here anymore?P.S. Denny's probably has a spot on their overnight staff for your rude server. He obviously can't handle this gig.Now, I will admit; I am very generous when it comes to reviewing and rating, but I only write about things when true emotion and feeling are conjured up. It's not like I don't have the time, it's just that the inspiration is gone. Not within The Golden Steer.I will address the fact that I have been coming to and living in Las Vegas since the early 80s as a child. I have seen 90% (probably more) of the businesses come, flourish and then be gone. There are few places in Las Vegas that offer an AUTHENTIC old steakhouse, and even fewer near the Strip. Everything about this place, maître's d  and all. Other than Bally's, Circus Circus, Smith & Wollensky and Golden Steer, EVERY SINGLE other steakhouse (on the strip) doesn't pre-date 1989.I have been to ALL OF THEM. They all are 5 star worthy, But S&W can be a bit pricey... Golden Steer is far and away, my champion of Steak AND Service in Las Vegas. It sits in an inauspicious strip mall 1 block west of LVBLVD on Sahara. The best word to describe this place is Incognitus Majorus. It isn't pain-in-the-assedly normal "In the Rear of the Casino" Location, see: Circus Circus and Bally's. or tucked away in a location that is too crowded (everywhere downtown). Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr, Joey Bishop and Marilyn have their own booths. There is a Grand Piano in the front Lounge area. The décor looks as if it hasn't changed since 1957. It is reported that this was one of the frequents of aforementioned characters of yore. What a perfect spot, in close proximity to the Thunderbird, El Rancho and Riviera, and then later, Sahara.I came to dinner with the most obnoxious accessory to diners and servers alike: A BABY. They not only sat us immediately, but Our Hostess, Stephanie (?) offered a bowl of mashed potatoes before even handing us the menus for food or wine. That was incredible. Haven't seen that before, or since.It was my 5th time there overall and first time with my daughters. The prices were on par with every other steakhouse in town, so I don't mind. The food was not only phenomenal, but the service was incredible, and everyone was so polite about my baby girl. The same hostess even offered to hold her while we finished our last bites. The Crab Legs were huge, sweet and buttery. The steaks were cooked to perfection with the right amount of char and smokiness. The service was jaw droppingly amazing and we ended up tipping everyone that helped us. Not only was this my favorite steakhouse from this point on; but my favorite dining experience in Las Vegas. Hands Down. I hope that someone actually reads this from front to back. I am a local concierge and VIP Host in town, it is my job to report accurate findings out and about in Vegas. I pass over the mediocre and certifiable, I give Kudos to the businesses that inspire me. Golden Steer offered a dining experience that I will remember for the rest of my life. Not only that, they set the curve. I have eaten quite literally around the world, and experienced service at all levels of remuneration, but have NEVER experienced dinner like my 5th visit to Golden Steer.Spent our anniversary weekend in Vegas with another couple.  Husbands uncle is a local he says you gotta go to the Golden Steer forget about Gordon Ramseys place.  He says you get the same thing for $65 a person so we all gave it a try.  The atmosphere reminds me of an old time piano wine bar from the 70's/80's but a little run down in need of some updating.  Waiter was weird and had an attitude that kept growing throughout the night.  He told us how hed been there quite a long time but had left for a while and come back etc making a point I guess that most of them were there for 20+ years.  We got a bottle of wine and then ordered.  I had the filet which was nicely cooked and the twice cooked potato.  The potato was actually about the worst i have ever had because it was obvious that it had sat in the oven either all day or for hours.  It was completely burnt on the bottom but not in a good way.  You know how you can totally overdo a potato skin to complete crispy browness that its cracking apart but it still tastes good?  Ya well not like that this was BURNT.  Could not cut it with a fork burnt.  Had to use a steak knife to get through it sooo cuz our waiter was weird with attitude I wasnt going to say anything about my $10 potato.  The waiter came back at least 5 times aggressively asking if we wanted another bottle of wine.  It started to feel like it was a demand rather than a request which we all noticed.  At the end we all got dinner drinks/coffee and dessert.  The drinks came out right away and we had a nice conversation while we waited for dessert.  The restaurant only had 3 tables and I noticed 2 waiters and a couple bussers as well as the guy doing the salads and desserts so when we finished the drinks we asked where dessert was.  We were hoping to have it with the drinks but  its like 30 minutes or more later and the waiters response was really snotty that they only had one of those dessert trays and the guy was going to get to us.  We were there at 7 pm and the only people on dessert at the time.  We didnt understand the really negative reaction we were getting so we were doing our best to be respectful responding with yes sir etc.  Its almost as if he mistook our kindness for weakness which seems to be happening a whole lot these days when you go out.So I watched the dessert guy make our dessert and I noticed he was making cherries jubilee instead of the bananas foster we ordered so I said something about it in a very nice way LOL that doesnt seem to matter.  The response was almost like are you effing kidding me?  This bitch makes a mistake I gotta fix?  He didnt say that but his body language sure did.  The dessert guy went away the waiter comes back with more attitude and do you want another bottle of wine again.  He seemed pissed at us that the guy was making cherries and that we didnt want that as well.  They finally made it right and I tasted one bite and not good.  We make it better at home.  Everyone at table agreed we make it better so good thing I got the tiramisu because that was pretty good.This is the important part.  I would never have bothered writing any of this until this part happened!  The waiter brings the bill and most of the time my husband just takes care of it but this time I had a funny feeling about the waiter so I looked at it and thank the lord I did because that dude double charged us and charged us extra for stuff that already came with etc. For instance my husband ordered asparagus with Hollandaise sauce $11.  The waiter charged us for 2 of those $22 + Hollandaise sauce $5x 2 = $10 so his asparagus was $32.When we pointed out the errors to the waiter he seemed intensely aggravated.  He responded very quickly like he was expecting it.  I bet he was.  I bet they do that all night long.  He said oh when they put it in they must have made a mistake like someone else rang his order in and like it happens and he will have to go straighten "them" out.  Bill came back minus $150 but I am positive we still paid too much because that extra sauce crap didnt hit me til we got home that the asparagus already had Hollandaise on it and I just looked it up on the menu to be sure and yep sure enough.  Bottom line:  These people can cook a steak but so can the Keg and Firebirds etcDO NOT TRUST YOUR WAITER:  Go over your bill  -  They are looking for suckersFair restaurant prices on bottles of wineNONE of us would ever returnI love this fucking place.My buddies and I head to Sin City -- this is our spot.  Table for 8, bottles of Cab, cocktails, killer steaks, great sides . . . Old School Vegas.  Muhammad Ali celebrated his birthday here, the Rat Pack, Marilyn and Joltin Joe . . . LOVE IT!  You wanna know what I hate about Vegas?  How they import great restaurants from other parts of the country.  I don't want to eat at Nobu in Vegas.  I want to go to Malibu for that.  I don't want to eat at Carmine's in Vegas.  I want to eat at the one on 44th St in NYC with theatre tickets in hand.  I don't want the replica, I want the gawdamn original.  And that's what Golden Steer is.  Over 50 years.  est1958.  A Vegas original.For those complaining about the service, you've gotta understand where you are.  You don't trot your significant other or your family into Golden Steer on a Friday night and expect rush service.  If you do expect that, then go to Black Angus.  This isn't 'dinner,' it's an event.  Soak it in.  Chill for a couple hours.  Actually chew your food.  Order dessert.  Extend the evening.  Experience it.  I've found the cooler you treat the staff, the faster and more pleasantly they serve you.  We were joking with our servers, taking pics with one server who looked like De Niro, and tipped the shit out of em.  We were there for a couple hours.  We loved it.  It was incredible.  All 8 steaks cooked perfectly.  If it's overcooked, send it back and grab another drink.  Sure beats a ruined evening while you quietly bitch about an overcooked steak and tell your fellow diner(s) how you can't wait to get on Yelp and destroy them.Smile once in a while.  This legendary place rocks.Bon appetit, bitches.Going through the motions. Past its Prime. Simply awful. These are but a few of the things that cross my mind when I think back to what has to be one of the worst dining experiences we have had in some time. Having heard of the place from my father who had eaten there some time ago and having had a requirement for Prime Rib for my sons birthday, we thought we would give the Golden Steer a try. It was memorably bad, the kind of bad that has the whole table on edge and wanting to leave. Allow me to explain..... From top to bottom the whole experience was terrible. Service: BAD and got worse: . The waiter visited our table EXACTLY 3 times in the 90 minutes we were there. Since the wine list was spotty, I went for a beer. In this day and age it is not unreasonable to ask for the selection since no drink menu was placed on our table. More to the point don't roll your eyes at me either and look put out, how hard is it to say Bud, Bud Light, et al. (Seriously no local craft beers?).  The next and biggest sin in my book was not clearing the table between courses. When you see the appetizer plates, the salad plates sitting at the table, perhaps its time to clear before you try to WEDGE the next course in.  Clear the table BEFORE you ask about desert. If the service was bad the food bordered on edible. It was by far some of the worst food I have had in some time. The appetizers: Toasted Ravioli: Not only was it clearly a food service product (Sysco perhaps) it was not properly fried so the interior was not completely melted. (Food temp seems to be an issue with this place too) The marinara sauce had a canned quality to it and was pretty much lifeless. Shrimp Cocktail: Shrimp was decent and the cocktail sauce was just okay. I also appreciate the addition of horseradish which helped pump up the cocktail sauce. Bread: First basket was okay, the second clearly was old. I could have taken an at bat against Madison Baumgarner with it. Salad/SoupTable-side Ceasar: While they did prepare ours as part of the larger party next to us (and honestly I don't expect the poor guy doing it to make just two for us) it was dull and lifeless lacking much flavor. The croutons tasted like they were from a prior decade. Onion Soup: The broth was actually okay (more like an Au Jus) but again the issue of properly heating things reared its ugly head. The soup looked like it had been placed under the salamander and was never brought up to a proper temperature. The soup was just warm at service and that made the Swiss cheese clump within minutes into a curd like manner. MainsPrime Rib: Not a lot to say here but it was clearly NOT slow roasted but rather quick cooked. No seasoning and it was tough and quite chewy. The Jus had no taste either. No desert as we were thoroughly disgusted at this point. Its clear that this place is on its last legs and perhaps needs to a featured restaurant on Kitchen Nightmares or Restaurant Impossible.  Either that our closed to put and anybody who is thinking about eating there out of their miseryI've now been to Golden Steer twice. It seems like I'm being treated progressively worse. I live in the condo building next door so I try to support businesses in my neighborhood. I can honestly say I'll never be a patron at Golden Steer again. The first time I came to The restaurant the hostess tried to act like she couldn't seat me despite the restaurant literally being empty. There were literally 3 customers in the restaurant. I brushed it off. The servers were rude to me and practically ignored me and the prime rib was not good at all. I chalked it up to an isolated bad experience. I came back about 6 months later (today) and the hostess tells me there's a 1.5 hour wait. She later gets on the phone and tells another potential customer that they have space if they come now. I sat in the bar high tops area for about 25 minutes. Nobody brought me a menu or even acknowledged me. I literally had to go and find a server and place an order. This time I tried the ribeye. I asked for it medium rare +. They gave me a medium-medium well steak. When asked for another steak the server tried to blame it on the au jus. I eat at steakhouses weekly. Au jus had never made a steak more well done in my experience. As I type this I've been finished with my dinner for about 20 minutes and no one has come to offer me the check. I'm practically invisible. This is very disappointing. None of the other patrons are being treated like this. I'm the only Black patron in the restaurant. I hope this is merely a coincidence.Best steakhouse I've been to!  I've gone to other steakhouses on the strip, but wow, I was mind blown!  This is a hidden gem located on Sahara between Las Vegas Blvd and the I-15.  It doesn't look like much on the outside, but you feel like you're in a mobster movie and stepped back in time when you walk in.  This is the spot where Frank Sinatra and other famous people would go on the regular.  I've heard from others that Frank Sinatra has his own booth here.The servers were very friendly.  They definitely made sure we were taken care of.  At least 4-5 servers would come to our table just to make sure we were okay.  Their wine glasses are huge.  Their breads tasted like it was freshly made.  The steaks were juicy and cooked to perfection.  The whipped potatoes were light and fluffy.  We got the salad, 8 oz filet, 22 oz bone in ribeye, whipped mashed potatoes and creme brulee (with a hint of chocolate) for dessert.  Everything we tasted was purely amazing!This is my favorite steakhouse by far.  Can't wait to go back!A golden ex-steer-ience!The Golden Steer saved the happy hour day during the first trek at Rock N' Rio. After eating dinner at the SLS and finding that there were no happy hour specials on Fridays we wandered onto Las Vegas BLVD - I saw the Golden Steer in the distance and was drawn into the light. We walked in and were greeted by a tux with a furled brow. After explaining we just wanted few a drinks and we'd be out the door, he obliged and walked us over to the bar. This place is a true Vegas landmark with pictures of Mobsters, The Rat Pack, and Hollywood celebs adorning the walls. You get a real sense of old Vegas, where everyone knew your name and your drink. This place is so old school with the red vinyl seats and the golden accents everywhere; it makes the show "Mad Men" look like a modern day TV marvel. The bartenders Patty and Blake were awesome, very friendly and willing to chat with us about the place. We ordered vodka sodas and shots right off the bat and after our second round, I started eyeballing the happy hour menu... "One order of escargot please"... Yes. I'm a big fan of this land dwelling mollusk, and whenever I see it on a menu, I have to order it. The Golden Steer's versions of these are very good. Swimming in butter and garlic sauce and not too chewy either, the snails simply melted in your mouth. The only thing is, I wish they came in their shells. These snails were served pre-shelled for easy consumption, where's the fun in that?This was my first time here, but definitely not my last. It's time to make reservations and party like it's 1959!Impressive. There are a lot of great steak houses in Las Vegas. In fact there are a lot in this area... Resulting is stiff competition. This place definitely holds their weight. From the outside, it doesn't look like much, but the inside is nice enough. I called to see if a reservation was needed and the woman that answered the phone was a little punchy. She gave me the info but made me work for it. When we arrived we noticed a lot of the other customers were very casual. It was warm out so my companion was happy to leave his coat and tie in the car. I ordered the filet and crab legs. I think it came with a salad, or it was extra I'm not sure.... Either was the salad was over priced. Just a boring mix if basic lettuce and dressing. I will skip the salad next time. The filet was cooked perfectly and very tender. Crab legs were opened and very easy to eat. A lot of meat per leg. Steak fries were pretty good as were the asparagus. All and all a pretty nice meal, although slightly overpriced.Listen to me very carefully. There are three ways of doing things around here: the right way, the wrong way, and the way that "I" do it. You understand? - Ace RothsteinIt so happens that there are also three reasons to come here: 1. Old School Vegas (It's rightfully the most popular statement used to describe Golden Steer)2. Old School Steak...be it Steak & Potatoes or Steak & Lobster3. Old School Table-side Prepared Caesar SaladGolden Steer doesn't have the sophistication of a modern steakhouse. That's not necessarily good or bad, just a little more unique these days. They will tell you they let the food stand for itself. While, the're not serving the best cuts in town, they do serve a quality product. For me it is all about the atmosphere. The Golden Steer isn't the place I'm typically interested in settling down in to enjoy my dinner, but I can still appreciate the charm and appeal to others...It's Vegas Baby!...Old School Vegas...better days, when the Mob still ran The Strip and you were taken care of so long as you played by the rules. You are taken care of at Golden Steer as if you were an old mob boss. The staff is attentive and dressed to impress. The food is executed well. The bar tenders are lively and good for a story or joke if you're in off peak hours.
Hollywood Alley="Arizona's only Hipster Bar", or so the sign says.We discovered this place when they started doing a Tuesday night Drum'n'Bass night.  The bar is great.  Dark, nice round booths, good decore, tons of beers on tap, even more in bottles, great sound system with a stage.  They've got a few pool tables in a separate little area so you can still hear the music but still hear your friends.  Staff is friendly, courteous, and all in all pretty cool.I've eaten here once for breakfast where they screen movies on a bigscreen using a projector.  Omelet, Bloody Mary, Erin Brockovitch (ok, that part sucked) FTW.That being said, I will prob. never eat here again.  Last night we were chillin' wih friends enjoying music and they were enjoying some burgers when out of the corner of my eye I see a roach just waking along the top of the booth.  Cruising around from one side to the other, checking things out.  Now I'm not an idiot, I realize there are prob. roaches everywhere, but something psychological happens when you're two feet from a roach in a dining establishment.  Unfortunately, I'll never be able to eat there again, however I will return for beats and beers.  If you read this far you will prob. not eat there either but I encourage you to drink there (bottles).
The Good Egg - Thunderbird=I had a chance to just go out with my daughter today for a little father daughter time. So she likes the Good Egg and so it was. Walked in and it just reminds me of all those breakfast houses. Nothing really jumps out. Let's just say the decor is all breakfast(ie) like. Ordered the orange juicy and coffee with the Sun Devil omelette. The omelette had diced ham, peppers, and onions. Nothing special about this. All I really tasted was the eggs. Didn't have any flavor. Pretty disappointed. Hash browns and English muffin were the norm, but I did enjoy the OJ and coffee. My daughter had the Pineapple Upside Down pancakes. Two huge cakes taking up her whole plate with pineapples, grapes, and whip cream on top. I snuck a few bites and it was really good. Walnuts in the middle with a pretty good syrup. Pancakes were not dry at all and pretty filling. Our server was really good and very attentive to us. They gave us our own pitcher of water and coffee. So overall the food was okay with pretty good service. Not bad but I could find better breakfast joints to go to.
The Good Egg - Ray=10/22/10Yesterday (10/21), I prepared my own honey-buttermilk pancakes w/ Ghirardelli choccy chips, sliced bananas, and a handful of those cinnamon-roasted almonds I found at Costco.  While those hotcakes made for an excellent meal, they weren't the protein pancakes from US Egg nor the custom-made ones from Good Egg I've been craving for the past two weeks.  So, I decided I'd stop at Good Egg and claim my free entree w/ the customer appreciation card I've been holding onto for more than a year now.My server Bailey was amiable and attentive.  She suggested I try adding dollar pancakes to my entree since I couldn't decide whether to go w/ some pancakes or something off of the lunch menu.  Thanks to the two Diners, Drive-ins, & Dives' episodes on breakfasts I'd seen during Monday's treadmill routine, I also had a craving for some corned beef hash (or those wonderful hash browns from Matt's in downtown Phx).  I decided to go w/ a full stack of pancakes ($7.50) and a side of corned beef hash ($3.95).  While having breakfast, I looked over the dollar menu wedged conveniently between the condiments and saw that for a $1 more, I could have "today's sweet deal."  Well, Bailey, what is today's deal?  A choice between an apple streusel bread pudding w/ caramel sauce or a strawberry shortcake w/ house-made strawberry fruit topping, you say?  Decisions, decisions!  Thankfully, the caramel contained corn syrup, so that made it easier for me to choose... So there I was, for weeks craving for some of those blueberry-almond-wheat germ whole wheat pancakes and what did you think I ordered?  A stack made w/ sliced bananas, candied slivered almonds, and Ghirardelli chips!  Silly me.  But they were very, very good!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-good-egg-chandler?select=0Wuwde1B28GdL1HXRxQUBQ#0Wuwde1B28GdL1HXRxQUBQ  The toasted slivered almonds added a different texture from those whole candied almonds I have at home, and the chips at GE didn't burn on the griddle like those I'd made myself.  (I'd skipped the secret step to making great choccy chip pancakes... you have to coat them w/ flour first to keep them from sinking to the bottom when you add them to the batter!  Yesterday, however, I just topped my cakes w/ some chips, so no wonder they charred when I flipped them over.)  Um, but I digress...  The corned beef hash, ordered on the crispy side, was crisped nice and salty.  It could've been a little crispier, but these were good enough.  Loved the salt-sweet contrast- what a great meal!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-good-egg-chandler?select=Ojm8b8LkvBVqJ4D3Jrer9A#Ojm8b8LkvBVqJ4D3Jrer9A  The coffee was freshly-brewed and strong, and I liked having a thermos on the table for me to pour myself another cuppa.  Last, but not least, the strawberry shortcake was just the perfect way to cap a terrific experience at GE.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-good-egg-chandler?select=N_Uofl8oX8l-RQMZ6i39Dw#N_Uofl8oX8l-RQMZ6i39Dw  Well, that and the large cup of coffee everyone gets to take on the way out.  Now that's a nice touch!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-good-egg-chandler?select=LsiGK7lm6zIoeyI_8-cFcw#LsiGK7lm6zIoeyI_8-cFcwIf you're a Good Egg fan, you may want to stop by and partake in their giftcard offer to expire on 12/24- get $5 off your ticket when you buy a giftcard worth $25 or more!  [I got a better deal, though... ;)]Traveling from Los Angeles to Arizona in about 5 hours not bad. Now we must get good in our belly!! Got the lumberjack skillet, filled with potatoes, bell peppers, mushrooms, bacon, cheese and topped with gravy, served with a biscuit. The combination of all the ingredients in the skillet was good but too much potatoes. It was flavorful and hit the spot. Service was good and the waitress made sure she always asked if we were ok and had everything we needed.
Dirtwater Springs=We had family visiting from out of State. So Rawhide is closed on Monday and Tuesday now days. I guess they are not doing to well lately.So instead we went somewhere that I have never been either. A Ghost town out in Apache Junction. I never knew ,but it is a real Gold mine.Anyway, back to the restaurant. This place was recommended to us by the Train conductor.  We were so glad that we listened.It was a very cool little place with an interesting history. They too claim that it is haunted by the past owner of an old Shell station that used to be there.That is a fun little story that you can read about while there.The menu has a lot to offer ,all sorts of different choices. They have something for everyone. The server comes to your table with chips and salsa and your drinks.We all got something a little different and all of it was really good.They have a full bar ,and even chocolate milk for the younging we had with us. (She was very happy).We had the Philly with steak, Hamburger, Cheeseburger, and Prime Rib. Everyone really liked all the food. They even have a child's menu.After the kids are through eating they bring them a Vanilla ice cream cone. AWESOME!The prices are very reasonable as well. Plenty of parking in the front and the back.Decorated with lots of cool old things and it is clean in there as well. A major plus for an older place.I would go back any time. In fact we are looking forward to it.
Hiro Sushi=Saturday was a busy, busy day!There were so many moving parts to my day:* I rode my mountain bike to Tempe to see the Tour de Fat:)* I had to play Squash at the club:)* I had football on the TiVo that really needed my attention:)* Oh yeah, Carin had a pretty big photo shoot that she was managing, and she asked me to help her with "model wrangling" for a little while...(she didn't call it that...she's far more refined than I am...she asked me to help sign people in and make sure they got where they needed to be...but I call it "model wrangling":-)Where do I get the energy? :)After a busy day, it was time for a dinner party with the photographer, the owners of the business, and selected guests from the shoot...interesting people and a wonderful mix for great conversation...which makes for a great dinner party:)Hiro Sushi had been selected for the party and they did not disappoint:)Hiro San has been a sushi master since 1968 and knows his way around a sushi bar (as do all of his assistant chefs:)Hiro likes his boats, and all the sushi, sashimi and rolls were delivered to the table in traditional sushi boats...that's presenting your fish old school...and I approve (I have too...I went to an old school...back in olden days:)Fresh tasting and delicious, the food came in waves ebi, maguro, iki, ikura, uni and anago, along with Arizona Roll (vegetarian...not my favorite), Caterpillar Roll and Spider Roll while we all enjoyed Kirin and hot and cold sake:-)Hiro doesn't really have a party room, but they created a nice little spot for us all and we all laughed and talked and drank and ate and it was just a wonderful night.We've been to Hiro before and the food and service are always top notch:)The ambience in the restaurant is a little bit pedestrian...it kind of feels to me like a strip mall sushi bar (which it is, although the food is an order of magnitude better than most strip mall sushi:)And creativity isn't really Hiro's strong suit...good and fresh sushi always, but not always presented as art.Does that make a difference?...I don't know for sure...it can be an important part of the equation for me:)That said, I like Hiro's...a lot:)A lot better than I like model wrangling...it's really not my cup of dirty chai latte....it was like herding cats...pretty, pretty cats:)WoW!   So legit, the real Japanese sushi experience is at Hiro.  Without any special motif or hip Scottsdale decor, it's Japanese and sushi at it's BEST!  Chefs..Japanese, who greeted every person that was walking through the door. It's  pretty small place, like ones found in Japan, and has one of the longest sushi bars I've seen in Arizona.   With daily specials written on the wall including conch (From Florida) in miso to spicy scallop rolls that are sweet and spicy.  The seaweed salad is always a great way to being your meal, Hiro's tempura was crispy and light, and the sushi was very fresh.  It is so hard to find a REAL sushi house and this one that I will be going back again and again!  The service was great all in all from beginning to finish.  We walked in not knowing what to expect, the prices seemed reasonable for sushi and we walked out knowing this hidden gem, is the place to be for sushi !  P.S.First Asian restaurant I've seen in Scottsdale, that I've seen alot of Japanese go to, AWESOME cause I know it must be fresh and good! And it was.After a long afternoon lying by the pool, hungry, looking for happy hour deals, we found Hiro Sushi in N. Scottsdale.  No happy hour here, but they offer high quality Japanese food at an affordable price. My favorite was the tempura dish. It was perfectly fried and so crispy.  You can taste that they used clean oil to fry, not like other restaurants.  The sushi rolls were very fresh and well prepared. This is my new favorite Japanese restaurant in N. Scottsdale.Before I delve into my personal experience at Hiro, I will discuss the important factors of, what makes a good sushi restaurant, according to my criteria. For credibility I've eaten sushi my entire life, everywhere from Cali to NYC to Tokyo . I believe I can distinguish between the different levels of superb sushi grade fish. - Fish Quality    I ordered the dinner sashimi platter ($21), 2 orders of the spanish mackeral nigiri($11), 1 order of the giant clam nigiri ($11).              *The sashimi was average, and the tuna had a distinct "fishy" smell to it. The portions were of average size, and the layout was aesthetically pleasing. The Spanish Mackeral was OUT OF THIS WORLD GOOD! I highly recommend it, albeit the cuts are small, the fish is delicious. The giant clam was overpriced based on its size and freshness. - Rice Quality    This is pretty hard to mess up. The rice is perfectly balanced as it should be. The fish to rice ratio was good. I went into this restaurant with high expectations, first from the high reviews on Yelp, and second upon entering the restaurant you are overwhelmed by an abundance of Japanese celebrity pictures plastered all throughout the entrance. They are all somehow affiliated with the restaurant/owner. The pictures suggest that these Japanese celebrities have eaten at this restaurant and give their thumb of approval. 3 stars because this restaurant, in regards to nigiri and sashimi, were just average. The problem with sushi reviews on Yelp is that you get a lot of yelpers reviewing based on rolls and sake bombs. It's sad but true that so many people will judge a restaurant based on how good their rolls are when the true judgment of a sushi restaurant should be in the quality of their nigiri. I have given up on sushi in Phoenix. From now on I will get my sushi fix elsewhere.Hiro Sushi is a traditional sushi bar/restaurant in Scottsdale.  It's a popular place where you can get a true Japanese experience.My Overall Rating - 3 Stars (Atmosphere, Service, Food, Return)Atmosphere - You'll find a long, traditional sushi bar along with several tables & chairs.  Now, it's not a large restaurant, so you can expect it to be full of patrons.  It can be a bit cramped in certain areas.  You're best off in a party of 4 or at the sushi bar when it's crowded.   1/2 Star.Service - I like sushi restaurants where the server speaks Japanese.  It always makes me feel like getting authentic sushi.  Hiro Sushi passes this test.  Service was a bit slower when it got busy, but we were able to get all our orders in, order more, etc.  Great stuff here.  1 Star.Food - We ordered the Chirashi special, which provided us with a large assortment of sashimi.  Honestly, from the ratings we thought we would be blown away, but it was good.  Also ordered some Udon noodles which provided a nice broth.  We continued with several other rolls - again solid but nothing memorable.  The entire meal is good not great, which isn't a bad thing.  1 Star.Will I Return? - Only if I'm craving sushi in Scottsdale.  We made it here due to the high ratings, but honestly I didn't find anything so outstanding that I haven't had at many other Sushi restaurants.  There's no doubt Hiro has a loyal following, but I would only come back if sushi was the only type of cuisine I was craving.   1/2 Star.My Yelp Rating Scale (Sum of all parts):1 Star - Atmosphere - Is it a cool dive?  Perhaps an upscale place?  No matter the type, atmosphere plays a big part and I'll give a star if I like it or thinks it has great charm.1 Star - Service - You can have a great meal with bad service.  But that's also what can make a five star joint drop to four.  It's important to the dining experience that service is great and on point.2 Stars - Food - I'll award up to two stars for the food, since this is the main reason we dine out.  Sometimes the extra star is given for value, but it's really all about the food.1 Star - Will I come back? - If I know for a fact I'll return, I'll give this a star. A place has to make an impression for me to return. Each Category can be given up to 1 star except food (2 stars) because I consider all these categories important to the overall dining experience.  I will sum them up to provide my final Yelp score.
Rinaldi's Italian Deli=I've stopped by this Deli for lunch and breakfast.  When I came for lunch, I ordered a 10" Italian Sandwich ($6.79)http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/UkqdcwYv6_c-yW1JPCKlUA?select=FvhTfKVsGt5FXtfjL7dgEwhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/UkqdcwYv6_c-yW1JPCKlUA?select=qaOSRK-FMOUZgooSqY8R4wThe Sandwich was very difficult to eat because it was served open-faced with the Meat pushing the Bread open....very strange as it made it difficult to fold back over and hold.  Also, they douse the bread with the Oil/Vinegar, so it gets soggy and breaks apart....WTH?  The taste was pretty good, but the experience sucked.  You can see what I'm talking about in my pics.The 2nd time I stopped here, it was to try their Breakfast Burritos.....since the Max Burro was priced at $4.29, I only ordered 1 because I thought it would be huge....I was wrong, it was just a Med sized Burrito.  It was pretty good....Eggs, Bacon, Cheese, wrapped in a Tortilla.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/UkqdcwYv6_c-yW1JPCKlUA?select=8gpyTOcWz6BWYTxxTc-UnAI was disappointed with the size though.....I was still hungry after I finished it....bummer.  I didn't think the $4.29 was worth it...I think $3.50 would be a more appropriate price for a Med sized Breakfast Burrito.Overall, I think this place has potential....right now, it only gets 3 Stars from me.Return Factor - 67%This place is a little pricey, but I work in the area so its become my place for breakfast on Sunday mornings. So far I've had the bagel and locs with cream cheese which was delicious! They definitely don't skimp on the amount of salmon that they give you, its jammed pack! I've also had the turkey sandwich where I just added onions (extra) and avocado (obviously extra) and it was a little more than 9 dollars which I mean JEEEZZ! Is this sandwich coated in gold? Also if you want any other type of roll that isn't a Kaiser roll its extra money. When I got my sandwich at 8:15am (they open at 8 on Sundays)  my avocado was already browning which ..... Wth! You've been open 15 minutes and your avocados are already browning!! So that was a disappointing experience. I don't choose to dine here because I think the service isn't the best. Whenever I walk in there in the morning I get the vibe that I'm bothering the employees with me ordering food. I'm never greeted I just get a "what do you want to order?" No good morning, hello, how are you, etc. So, bleh. Order to go or delivery for the best experience.
Kathy's Southern Cooking=Have to completely disagree with the first reviewer -- as a Southerner, this place is an insult -- a total sham -- 1) it's FILTHY  2) it's FILTHY and 3) it's totally overpriced...oh did I mention how dirty the joint is?Took some Southern co-workers all the way from UNLV for lunch -- won't do that EVER again.  The wait was 20 minutes for the gal to step out from behind a counter to bring us a menu... we were the only ones there....!    Hello?  The menus were sticky -- the place smelled bad -- they had cleaning chemicals out on the same counters where they serve food -- finally put them away about midway through lunch service.We were hoping for something authentic lunch-wise -- like a "meat and 3" plate -- in the South, it's easy to find about 20 mom and pops that offer this for oh, anywhere from $3 inclusive of tea and pie (!) -- to $6 (for a fancy joint) where tea and pie are extra...No meat & 3 here (all a la carte) -- so to replicate that, we're talking you're in for $20+ easy for lunch... I'm serious.  Bad fried chicken, bad mac & cheese, bad greens, bad canned beans, bad bad bad... tea that was so sweet my teeth still hurt.Shame on you, Kathy -- real Southeners know better...I would love to bring my Mama here when she's feeling homesick -- but this will just make her sick... and break her heart...this place truly has no soul.To add insult to injury, when it was time to pay the check, they have this ancient system that charges a set amount -- plus a service charge to run your card... it's such a scam. I really wanted to love this place -- as it stands now, it's probably tops on my list of places that I'll NEVER give a 2nd shot... Hope this saves you a trip!
Mint Thai Cafe=So I surveyed my family as we dined and here are the results:Appetizers-  *Mee Krob  (crispy,sweet noodles with pork & shrimp)   Audrey - 4 stars   Emma - 4 stars   Abby - 4 stars   Jim - 5 stars     +selected comments - "The texture is almost like...rice krispy treats!"                                       "It's almost too sweet"                                       "Unusual."  *Satay  (marinated chicken skewers)   Audrey - 4 stars   Emma - 4 stars   Abby - 4 stars   Jim - 4 stars    +selected comments - "Very tender."                                      "Can I have the last one?"Entrees-  *Pad Thai  (we all know what this is right?)   Audrey - 4 stars   Emma - 4 stars   Abby - 5 stars   Jim - 4 stars    +selected comments - "Too many sprouts."                                      "This is good!"                                      "Chunks of cabbage don't belong in here."  *Panang Curry with scallops and shrimp (self-explanatory)   Audrey - 3 stars   Emma - 5 stars   Abby - 5 stars   Jim - 3 stars   +selected comments - "Scallops are a miracle to this world."                                     "Are scallops rare?"                                     "Thai food is getting up there with                                        Chinese food for me!"                                     "I would give this 5 stars if it weren't for the price                                      versus the quantity."Service here was great, food was overall good quality and yummy.  I thought the seafood (panang curry) was overpriced and under quantitied with 3 shrimp and 3 large scallops and steamed rice for *drum roll* $16.95.I picked up some takeout here this evening.  I wondered if I had gone to a totally different restaurant than the 4 star Mint Thai I had visited several months ago.On the one hand maybe they are having an off night.On the other hand maybe they have dropped significantly in quality since my first dining experience.If you would kindly lend me yet another hand, I have run across restaurants where the take out food is like a totally different restaurant.  Maybe Mint Thai is one of those places.There is a trend down and to the right in the reviews...
Gianna's Pizza=I got a Groupon here in May and figured I would use it when traveling to Vegas. Driving here wasn't too bad and finding the place was pretty easy as it is located in a shopping center. Our Groupon was $10 for $25 so we got a medium Villa Special pizza for like $15, chicken wings for $6, fries for $3, and a drink for $3. Total was like $4 with the Groupon.The place was pretty clean and had a lot of seating area. The World Cup was showing at this location which was kind of cool. They have 3 TVs there to watch the game. I did see signs for beer specials that was 5 for $10.  The Chicken wings were the best. It was crunchy just the way I like it and very flavorful. The fries was good but nothing too special about that. The pizza was pretty good too. I like my pizza with flavors of the sauce that is tangy with a kick. The meat was good I think I must have ate 4 pieces since it was that good. All in all a good place to go to just eat or watch the game. I would definitely go back again for their wings.Favorite Villa Pizza in all of Vegas. I drive out of my way and pass another Villa next to my office to dine at this one. It's got the golden ticket.Why? Because when Carmine (the original owner of all the Villa Pizzas in Vegas) sold most of his Villa pizza shops they were not allowed to continue using his secret recipe which was the main reason Villa was so popular. Kim and Kanye should consider naming their love child Carmine after him because the sauce is THAT amazing. THIS location however was one of the only ones who were special enough to get to keep the recipe! Their sauce is money up in here! All of the other factors of the pie are high quality to make it one solid pizza.Also get their chicken fingers and ranch. It gets the job done. All white meat, crispy, humongous and just right.Prices and service are decent, too. They currently have coupons in the Entertainment book and also run specials. The restaurant is small, but I don't expect the Ritz when I'm grabbing a slice. It's clean and smells of garlic and red sauce and that's all I need to give me strength to return to my cube and face my never ending Inbox of work emails. If you are in the neighborhood or live on the Moon. I don't really care. Drive over here and try this mystic pizza. It's golden and just might make your day a little brighter.Needed some printer ink from Office Depot and was famished, so I popped into this pizza joint. Apparently I was there during happy hour #1, which is 2-5pm, and rocks $1.60 slices. Nice! I ended up getting a slice, salad and drink for $6. The salad was legit too. Roasted red peppers, olives, hot peppers, cukes... this wasn't your average pizza place salad (you know, when it's large chunks of unripe, random veggies). I was very, very happy with the slice as well. Def NY style aka very thin, cheesy, greasy and made to fold. It's my fave slice I've had in Vegas thus far (!). Not a greasy slice fan? Still come here, just rock the dab. No one will make fun of you. Well... Anyway, it's a heavy slice and will sag in the middle, so, take a few bites before you fully commit to the fold. Yea, I eat enough 'za to comment on that. Ah, can't forget, there's a TV on the wall if you're dining solo and comfy booths if you're in for an extended drinking session :)Was pleasantly surprised and I'm looking forward to returning. Other specials...*5 beers for $10 if you purchase any food (nice)*2 slices and a soda for $5*Sun-Thurs 4-9pm (happy hour #2) - $9 large pies and other specials.
Teakwoods Tavern & Grill=All right.  It's come-to-Jesus time.  It's hard to watch a thriving business implode, but that's what is happening here.  I've been a regular at this Teakwoods for about 7 years now.  My husband and I liked the atmosphere, food and friendliness so much that it's safe to say we even considered this when we bought our house (within walking distance) back in 2007.  Everyone who worked there was welcoming and hard-working, from the bartenders to the servers to the bussers.  The wings (and other dishes) were great (especially as sports-bar food goes), beer selection was good, prices were reasonable.  We've seen staff (and management) come and go, but we've remained loyal, and actually have stayed good friends with many current and ex-employees, who have become like family to us.But things have been steadily going downhill, and now I think they've nearly reached rock bottom.  It started with cosmetic stuff.  Leaky ceilings, scruffy empty shelves behind the bar for a long time, mismatched and shabby (and some downright uncomfortable) furnishings, tatty bathrooms.Then, the food.  We used to look forward to the daily specials; now it seems management is finding ways to "repurpose" leftovers or overstocks in new and unappealing ways and, frankly, in weird combinations.  Sliced hot dogs on a lavosh? Really?  Even one of my previously favorite appetizers, the caprese (oh--now spelled "caprice" on the menu) tastes bland and worn out.  I used to LOVE the creamy, cheesy, meaty cheeseburger soup when it appeared on the menu, but I had it just a couple of days ago and was disappointed to find it watery, virtually tasteless, and sorely lacking in the meat department.Prices were raised (during the recent Arizona Beer Week; talk about opportunistic!), and a rash of regulars left in protest, and have stayed away.  But I and a dozen or so other regulars remained, largely because of the friendly and efficient service of a few remaining long-time servers there, along with a few awesome bartenders and wonderful bussers.  The service in general had also gone down over time, but management seems to want to drive it right into the dirt, as they decided this week to get rid of two of their best servers.  That was the last straw for pretty much all of the regulars who had remained.I feel like I'm going through a divorce.  It's sad and depressing to watch, slowly but surely, a decent business and a fun place run into the ground (going much the same direction, apparently, as the recently closed Maricopa and Phoenix locations of Teakwoods have gone) by bad management and poor decisions, who put "profits" over people.Why did I even give this place TWO stars? For the handful of wonderful staff who remain--AND for the wings, which are still great.  But if you MUST have them, I'd advise you to get them to go!Teakwoods is another great place for wings in this area. Seriously, if you're thinking about going to Wing Stop, turn around and go to Teaks. Come on. You're already in the area, right?Chill ambiance. Enjoy some peanuts and drop your shells on the floor if you please. Great spot for a casual workweek lunch, live music on the weekend, or just catching a game. Plenty of beers on tap for everyone's taste.I haven't ventured much beyond the wings, but with good reason: They're delicious!Two of my favorites are classic Hot, Suicide. Plenty of sauce and finished just crispy enough.Don't forget to check out their unique wing combinations! The Jess Jess is a combo of their Medium sauce and BLEU CHEESE cooked into the wings. And it will blow.your.mind. Since I carry the "Yelp Torch" in our relationship, Dude approves of this place. Not so sure if it's the wings, or the t-shirts with the Teakwoods Moose you can purchase that say, "Nice rack!" but know we'll be back -  Wings for sure; maybe I'll finally buy one of the shirts.Check out Teakwoods on your quest for great wings in Chandler.
Handlebar-J=What a great bar!  I have spent many an evening here drinking their inexpensive beer while watching drunk people dance.  This is not the "pretty people" bar, this has the feel of a neighborhood bar.  Everyone is mostly friendly and I've never seen the place packed to the gills.  The decor is sorta old west, meets Hawaii.  Very strange.On occasion they have cool theme parties (cool because of the FREE food) on the weekend.  I didn't see any happy hour specials the last time I was there but I didn't look.  There is easy access to the 101, but don't drive drunk, Snobsdale cops will catch you.This place has a lot of regulars, but after a few visits you could fit right in.I was up there last week with a group of friends and volunteered to be the designated driver for the night. It was a $5 cover to hear the house band, which was no biggy and then I asked for a diet coke which was another $3. Again, no problem paying for the diet coke. After about 30 minutes and some dancing, I went up to the bar for a refill of the diet coke expecting the refill to be free. The bartender told me it would be another $3. I mentioned that I was the responsible one for a table full of people drinking and that I thought the point was not to encourage drunk driving and to encourage people being responsible. Well that got me nowhere so I asked for a glass of water instead. I was told that the bartender couldn't give me water because it was a two drink minimum to get water.Now it's July in AZ and I had been dancing. We had a table full of people drinking and ordering their drinks from this same bartender who can't give me a glass of WATER. Really? I don't mind paying the cover and the cost of the first diet coke, Im not being cheap but the point is that most bars appreciate and take care of the designated driver. I was being responsible and they couldn't even give me a glass of water!Really?I came to Handlebar J tonight for the first time with one of my friends to take some line dancing classes that they host every Tuesday night for $5 per person. As we walked in and started making our way towards the dance floor, the owner stopped us and asked if we wanted a table. Not understanding her, she bluntly stated that the dance lessons are separate and if we want to join in, we have to sit down and order food (two drinks per person or a meal and a drink--mind you, it doesn't say this ANYWHERE on the website. A warning would have been nice. And, it's not to say that we wouldn't have ended up ordering a few drinks or getting some food at some point during the evening, but the way she told us was quite rude.) Since it seemed that we had no other choice, she showed us to a table in the dining room and gave us a couple menus. When our waitress arrived, she explained that these particular menus were only for the bar or patio areas, and that we couldn't order from them. But, once I told her the owner gave them to us, she reluctantly obliged and allowed us to order, ya know, because we are trying to give them our money, I didn't think it would be a problem. Once we got settled at our table and ordered, it was pointless for us to join the dance lesson as it had already started and we wanted to get our money's worth (I know it's only $5, that wasn't the issue--it was merely the principle of participating in the entire lesson and since we had an awkward start to the whole experience, we didn't even want to bother at this point), so we just watched the other folks enjoying some fun dancing and good music. After we had gotten our food and were halfway through our meal, our waitress asked us if she could move us to another table....um WHAT? As we are finally beginning to somewhat enjoy ourselves, you want us to get up and move because you have a party of 5 that needs this table? I don't think so...but since you're already picking up my drink and my food I guess I'll follow you. She seats us elsewhere and doesn't come back for another 30 minutes. We danced for a little bit and joined in on some of the line dances to try and brighten our situation, but we couldn't get the sour taste out of our mouths. We decided after an hour of nonsense it was time to leave. Our waitress finally gave us the check; I needed change, and had to hunt down the owner to take care of it for us. She ended up chatting with some guests and seemed to forget that I needed change back. Our waitress finally came to our table and couldn't find our check. She estimated the total of our bill and just handed me my change out of her pocket (definitely didn't give me exact change, but at this point I was so over it.) With a smirk she said, "here," and walked away. I took all of my change and we got the heck out of there. So extremely disappointed in this joint and it's such a shame because the ambiance and decor are quite nice, as well as the spunky gal who was teaching the lessons--those are about the only two things that Handlebar J has going for them.Friends of ours invited us to join them for dinner and a night out dancing.  We have never been to Handlebar-J, but heard it was a Scottsdale institution, so we were excited to give it a try.For dinner, we ordered:Steak and Enchiladas, $12.75Sliders, $8.95CoorsI had the Steak & Enchiladas and they were very good.  It exceeded my expectations.  Even though it wasn't a premium cut of Beef, it was cooked perfectly and had good flavor.  The Enchiladas were out of this world...wow!  All I can say is wow!The Better Half had the Sliders and she was very happy with them.  The portion comes with 2 Sliders, which is perfect for her.After dinner, the music started to play.  We then got our groove on and danced to country & classic rock songs.  The bar also filled up and there was a nice crowd there.  We all had a blast and worked off the calories we ate.We heard they have country dance lessons on Wednesdays, so we'll be back.Return Factor - 90%
IHOP=Is attention to detail important? Apparently not during my visit :(Waitress: would you like fruit?Me: noWaitress: sausage or bacon? Me: baconWaitress: what to drink?Me: coffeeWhat I got: fruit, sausage & during my entire visit NOTHING to drink. When I asked about my coffee I was told it was brewing. No one remembered anything about it again until it was time to put it on my check... seriously. I asked it be removed since I never got it and she just laughed and said, "oh, I'm so sorry about that". Really? Because she didn't seem like she was. Especially when it took her almost 10 more minutes to get me my corrected check. I won't be visiting again.
Arrivederci=Arrivederci, a southern Italian enclave in the midst of a strip mall in the desert, can boast the rare designation of a dining choice that was not a compromise candidate between members of my family. Granted, I might have just been weak from the travel, but I was enthusiastic to satiate a hunger difficult to address in my homeland.I was not disappointed with what we found. An owner who greets patrons with "buena sera!" in a thoroughly non-corporate, warm, mood-lit setting is always a good sign. Many patrons who respond back in Italian and conduct themselves like they're at their second home are an even better sign, even if the restaurant was a bit empty.The true test, of course, is the food. No amount of show or neighborhood family feel could compensate for a massive kitchen deficiency. Fortunately, it wasn't required:- Bread: Uninteresting... except I could drink the accompanying pesto and oil mix.- Minestrone (~$5): The lowlight. A case of nothing ventured, nothing gained. Skip it.- Gnocchi in pink vodka sauce with salmon (~$19): Let's just say I was highly looking forward to the leftovers as two separate snacks. - "Choco"misu (~$7): Much hullabaloo is made about the addition of the ingredient, but it really just came off as above average tiramisu.- Cannoli (~$5): Always ridiculously unhealthy, but here it's made properly with ricotta and the texture is spot on enough to justify it.Arrivederci is an excellent "corner" restaurant in a land lacking a bit in both deviance and corners. More importantly, it clearly passes the "would survive in NJ as-is" test. There is nothing left to say.Lobster Ravioli... I saw yelpers' check in and read reviews. I came here to try for lobster ravioli.  I studied the entire menu but can't find lobster ravioli on lunch menu.... I picked my backup dish... I asked the server about the lobster ravioli and she said that is on dinner's special but since they have them ready, they can serve during lunch too!I started my lunch with caprese salad, which I split with my friend.  They were kind enough to separate the plate after I told her I wanted to split the salad.  I enjoyed the fresh taste of mozzarella cheese.I also liked the pesto served with bread.  Bread was freshly baked and went really well with homemade pesto sauce.  I never though of using pesto for bread, but they went well together.Lobster Ravioli.... pasta was very good and enjoyed generous portion of lobster. Unfortunately sauce was a bit salty for my liking.  I still ate all of them as pasta tasted good, so I asked for the second bread and ate the sauce separately with my bread.Excellent service. We both had bags with us, and the server brought extra chairs for our bags next to our table.  When we ordered espresso, she brought one at a time as she wanted to serve the coffee hot.  I saw chocomisu on the desert menu, I would like to come back to order chocomisu (their menu said only one in the US to serve chocomisu, to the best of their knowledge).
Weiss Restaurant Deli & Bakery=NOTE** The Yelp map location is wrong.  Weiss Deli is in the shopping center on the South East Corner of Sunset and Green Valley, NOT the North East Corner.After trying all the famous delis (Carnegie, Stage, Canter's, etc...) in the big Casinos and noticing they are all a shadow of the originals that I love, I set out to find a real deli in Las Vegas.  Delis are best when they are being run by deli people.  And that's the problem with the casinos.  They are being run by people that don't know the difference between deli mustard and Dijon.  I'm dead serious, I once had someone at the Carnegie argue with me that grey poupon was a brown deli mustard, and my only choices were yellow and Dijon.  If they pulled that at the original Carnegie in New York , there would be a riot.  So although it's a little off the beat and path from the strip, Weiss Deli is well worth the trip.  Only in business since 2006, Owner Michael Weiss is using his Grandma's recipes.  Which explains why Weiss' tastes like it's been around for 60 years.  As I always do when trying a new deli, I went with pastrami on rye.  This is the best pastrami you'll get in Las Vegas folks.  Sure the Carnegie is starting off with a great product, but I've had it tough, cold, and sometimes they get lucky and make it right.  But from the first bite of this sandwich, I knew they were serious about how to prepare pastrami.  It was piping hot, it was perfectly steamed, it had plenty of fat on it (which adds to the flavor).  Even though it was my only time eating here, I can almost guarantee it's great every time.  The guy cures his own pastrami, enough said.  The flavor was perfect and while I might prefer Langer's in LA just a little better, this is a good 2nd.  Every bite of that sandwich was a joy to eat.  Also we need to talk about one of the most impressive rye breads that I've ever seen.  Each slice of rye is about 8 inches high and 10 inches wide.  Freshly baked on site, I'd love to see a whole loaf of that rye.  It had a nice crunchy crust, but with a rye bread that large, even with a huge pile of meat in it, the crust was almost a picture frame surrounding the delicious soft seeded rye.  Served with National Deli Mustard, I can't wait to enjoy this sandwich again.  Also not to be missed was the side of potato salad (which I couldn't keep my wife from eating - I think I only had like 2 bites of it before she claimed it as her own).  It's almost like a mashed potato salad since the potatoes are so soft and mashed together with egg and mayo.  It reminded me of the flavor of the famous Rascal House Potato Salad, and that's the highest compliment I can pay it.The wife had "The Remington".  It was hot roast beef, melted swiss & cheddar jack, grilled onions, on grilled rye bread.  It was supposed to come with horseradish sauce, but she isn't a fan of that, so we went with a side of brown gravy to dip it in.  Excellent sandwich.  They messed up a little bit, since we ordered it open face (which is usually how it comes) but it was still good as a sandwich.  The roast beef was very tasty and their brown gravy outstanding.  Her side of french fries were pretty boring however, but so what, the sandwich is so large, you don't need them.  Each sandwich was served with a half a pickle and half a pickled tomato.  I wouldn't be surprised if they pickled them on site.I also tried a combo appetizer of chopped liver and white fish salad.  What a great idea to be able to get a scoop of each right next to each other.  I was surprised it was only served on a large lettuce leaf with a black olive and a pickle spear.  It wasn't brought by our waitress, so when I asked her where all the veggies were, she was shocked that they sent it out like that.  So she rounded up some tomato and red onion.  I'm used to carrots, and cucumber, maybe bell peppers as well.  The presentation wasn't very good, but since it got messed up, I'm not sure how it's supposed to look, or what's supposed to be on it.    I preferred the white fish salad to the chopped liver.  Excellent whitefish salad!  Not too salty, nice and smokey with plenty of mayo.  The chopped liver was just ok, but still better than most places.And last but not least, the prices.  Only $10.95 for a huge Pastrami Sandwich.  I was shocked.  For that quality and size, that's $15 anywhere else.  And if you get one at a deli on the strip, maybe it will be $20. (Of course it will have even more meat than Weiss, but you'll most likely be throwing half of it away which is a shanda).Went in for breakfast today and forgot to check in cuz I was so busy eating.Got 2 eggs scrambled with egg beaters and they also offer egg white only for .95 extra. With country fried potatoes seasoned and they are extra tasty.Also comes with any bagel and huge cup of cream cheese. All for 4.95 + .95 Then it's mandatory to get a small bowl of the absolute BEST chicken noodle soup on the planet ( just don't say that to your mom ) but it rocks!Service is pretty good but don't expect gourmet because it's a deli style place.Always a good experience here. Food is always very good.I remember when a couple of other businesses occupied this location that Weiss Deli is at so I was skeptical about if Weiss was like them or not. The reviews and delicious pictures on yelp got my to finally try this Jewish deli. It is tucked in the corner of a shopping center. They have a decent amount of tables and chairs outside if eating outdoors is your thing. Inside is clean, but the decor is dated. The booth I sat at had gashes in the seat. The inside isn't very big so I imagine trying to eat here on the weekend is a zoo. When you walk inside towards the left they have bagels & pastries for sale. I took a look but the case was empty and I was told by our server that they sell out quick in the mornings. They have a board when you enter that tells you what specials are going on that day.They have a section on the menu that says "not so hungry" for those feeling like they can't tackle a whole sandwich themselves. You get 1/2 of a sandwich (your choice from the sandwich station area on the menu) and your choice of either a cup of soup, fries, coleslaw,  potato salad or fresh fruit on the side. I decided to order this priced at $9.95 and I can assure you that you do need to be hungry unlike the menu claims because the portions are generous. I decided to try the "Chicken Noodle Soup" and it was the best I have e-v-e-r had in my life! It was hardly a cup like the menu suggests and was filling all by itself. I could just sip on the broth for days! The soup had a couple bagel chips on the side that had such a nice garlic flavor. For my sandwich I went with the "Roast Turkey" on challah bread. The 1/2 sandwich was so big that I had to cut it in half just to eat it. The bread was seriously delicious!  I could only eat a portion of my sandwich and took the rest home for later. My hubby ordered a "Pastrami Burger" priced at $9.95 that came with a side of fries. He said the pastrami had good flavor. I saw on the menu they offer catering. The next time I stop in I will be trying out something from their tasty looking breakfast menu. I would stop in when working on this side of town just to get some of the soup to-go!Very taste. Many corn beef. Such amaze. Reuben sandwich is much wow. Very customer service. Much nice. So experience. Such New York.So early close in 7:30. Wow.The End.I like this place for a once in awhile go to for homemade matzah ball soup! You can get it without noodles and just enjoy the goodness of soup. Probably best in town. They try to give you that deli feel we get back home but they don't put pickles on the table anymore and it's gotten further away from a NY deli thru the years. The sandwiches however are nice and thick loaded with fresh meats. The bakery section is quite small compared to others and the challah is better other places. But the food is good and enjoyable, if you get deli food, not a burger.... (Like someone at our table did....)The customer service has been variable the times we have been there and the cleanliness has varied too. Not sure if because of how long they have been there or what but hasn't been remodeled. Depending on when you go, you can be waiting awhile too as the place is quite small. I like this place and the local business but overall it's changed a lot thru the years!Oh my lord- East coast Jewish delis are amazing, and this place can holds its own with the best of them. As soon as I saw the menu here, I started (favorably) comparing it to Miller's on Polk Street in SF, where I first had matzo ball soup.The soup here, which we started with, is just as legit. And the portions are just as huge, too- the one pictured is a cup. It could easily be a lunch, and is served with a couple of tasty-ass bagel chips too. Rye flavor, natch.BF opted for one of the most expensive (and largest) sandwiches ever, the JR Boucher, which is a triple-layer with pastrami and liver. Yeah, that didn't sound tasty to me at all, and it's $18. But we got it, and it's frickin' delicious: all the components work so well together, they harmonize like a choir of angels. Oh and one sandwich is easily like three meals. We shared it and still had half for dinner.And, because I'm a total glutton and never on this side of town, I had to get my own dish, too. I got the Ceily's stack- latkes stuffed with brisket, topped with two types of cheese and brown gravy. It's even more amazing than it sounds, priced at $12, and is also easily split into thirds. Just finished my order for lunch today.With two heavy take-out boxes in hand, we rolled ourselves out the door... And promptly axed any plans of looking for a rental property in Henderson, because I don't want to weigh 400 pounds and if this place were nearby, that might be a serious possibility.I've been wanting to take the bf here for quite some time. I used to eat here all the time several years ago, but for whatever reason it had been a while since I'd been back.  Food is exactly as I remembered it. Actually better. At first I was planning to order the pastrami burger, then the open face turkey sandwich.... But thank goodness I kept looking, because I found the open face brisket with mashed & gravy and immediately remembered why I love this place. This is totally a cheat meal for me, but who cares when it is this delicious! The bf also had difficulty deciding on one thing. He kept going back & forth between the sandwiches named after famous people. He ended up getting the pastrami sandwich with Russian dressing & liver pate/mouse (not exactly sure but that's what it looked/tasted like to me. *He's asleep so I can't ask him. Anyway whatever it was, the sandwich was ginormous. Crazy big. When I took my obligatory I have to try everything bite... I actually had to first bite the bottom pastrami part them go back for a second bite of the list pate. After I took the bite... The bf said it didn't even look like I had taken a bite. Seriously the sandwich was big. He also ordered a black/white shake, and I love a place that has fresh brewed ice tea.  I know it's common... But  I consider iced tea to be a treat for myself so I'm always sad when the place has that fake soda iced tea nonsense. Our service was quick & friendly. It took us longer than normal (which is usually typical for us) to order, but our server was very good. And came back right as we had just decided. Kept our drinks refilled & brought us to go boxes without us having to ask.Also the French fries (served with his sandwich) were quite good. I liked dipping them in my gravy.A taste of the old country! I love Eastern European goodies & we've been coming here for years to have some classics like potato latkes, matzo ball soup, chicken noodle soup (like grandmas), cheese blintzes, challah French toast, potato  knish, fresh bagels, amazing omelette's with anything you want (my favorite is ham & swiss) and the home fries are amazing! The food is excellent. The ambiance is pretty basic & maybe one day they'll improve upon it but I can let that slide because the food reminds me of home. The service is always friendly & it's a very casual spot. They also have a deli area for fresh breads, bagels, cold cuts & sweets. This place is worth the drive across town for me :)SERIOUS DINERS ONLYOrdered from "Bradley Beach Legends" section the following:Overstuffed combination sandwiches are served on triple decker rye:Mickey Ansell:  beef tongue, chopped liver, roast beef, lettuce, onion and horseradish sauce and cole slaw side ... served in three portions, while one is plenty filling ... 5.75/5 stars ... not a chopped liver endeavor.Clary Silver:  pastrami, corned beef, Swiss cheese, cole slaw and Russian dressing and French fries (crisp side ... this is a meat lovers dream come true). 5.65/5 stars. Just like eating dry aged filet mignon. Our sandwiches looked larger than anyone else's simply for one reason. We were the smallest diners in the restaurant.I know I can eat here everyday, but then I would have to change my name from Momo to SumoA few months back, my fella wanted for me to try pastrami for the first time. We asked for suggestions, and while the great sandwich debate of 2015 ACTUALLY ended in a showdown about homemade/vs restaurant sandwiches, and someone getting mad that we don't subscribe to the "Get in the kitchen and make me a sammich" mentality...we DID get some good restaurant suggestions, and Weiss was one of them.We found ourselves on this side of town on Saturday, after a movie, and even though we had eaten a HUGE breakfast AND popcorn...we had to stop in.When I was younger, my mom used to make "Jewish Penicillin"...aka Matzoh ball soup. I saw that this was on the menu, and I almost died.  We ordered a whole pastrami on rye, and a SMALL cup of the chicken noodle with matzoh balls.  Holy generous portions, Batman.  For real, this sandwich was as big as my head.  Fella and I split it, and I STILL couldn't eat the whole thing.  Huge, heaping portions of flavorful pastrami and delicious rye bread...they offered standard yellow mustard, and whole grain mustard (of course I used whole grain). This sandwich was perfection.The soup made me cry.  It tasted JUST like my Uncle Sherwin's recipe that my mom used to make when I was younger.  I haven't had matzoh ball soup in probably 20 years.  It was amazing. Service was super polite.  I will DEFINITELY be going back to try some other offerings!
Bangkok Orchid=I had wanted to try Bangkok Orchid. Trying different Chinese restaurants has been one of my interests as of late. So, this past Tuesday I took a break from errands to make this my Birthday lunch.   Bangkok Orchid is in the Mountain Vista Shopping Center, a mall that has seen some better days, with the large hobby shop and shops between Barley's and Smiths vacant. When I stepped inside Bangkok Orchid at 3:30 pm on Tuesday, it was vacant of customers.   The nice woman who was my waitress offered me the table of my choice then presented me with the menu. From going on Yelp, I knew all the $5.95 lunch specials. I'd order the chicken chow mein combination with hot tea. The tea was so delicious that I drank the tea kettle worth. It was worth the $1.50 extra. The egg drop soup that was included tasted different from the style I am accustomed to. I am aware that this is mostly a Vietnamese restaurant.  The presentation of the chicken chow mein luncheon was different from the way that restaurants have served it. It was served on a large black tray style plate with salad, a bowl of duck sauce to compliment the egg roll on the bottom left, a scoop of rice on the top right, and on the bottom right were two slices of oranges. The chicken chow mein took center stage on the black tray. It featured bean sprouts, nice chunks of white chicken, cabbage, carrots, and broccoli. The food was good. I appreciated the nice presentation at the same time I would have enjoyed more of the entree over the salad and oranges.   Dining here was a laid back experience. It was quiet. The soundtrack was instrumental versions of the classics including "How Deep is your Love"  and "Love on the Rocks."   Overall Bangkok Orchid is a good restaurant. I could see a possible return check-in if I am leaving the close by  Ethal M Cactus Gardens on an empty stomach.
Fausto's Mexican Grill=The IN and OUT of mexican food.Gotta love Fausto's specially their breakfast burrito. You get your money's worth. This thing is HUGE and will make you full all for $4. If ever your on a budget and your craving mexican food go to Fausto's. Their prices are pretty decent and I assure you, you will not be disappointed . I also recommend getting the taquito's and the chicken quesedillia.  And of course for your drink the Horchata. It will satisfy your thirst.The atmosphere:  I wouldnt count on this place being a fancy sit down. Like i said its good for take outs just a quick grab and go type place.Location: The location i went to was in henderson and really convenient.I would highly reccomend this place for people that just want to grab quick mexican food. Don't expect anything fancy.
Pita Jungle=I tried Pita Jungle for the first time and I am deeply disappointed that I was not greeted with: "Welcome to the jungle."What a missed opportunity! Seriously!I found the food to be pretty OK, not outstanding.  I had the chicken schwarma (aka Mediterranean chicken wrap on the menu) and it was no schwarma from Al Hana at Biaz Market, my friend.The chicken was plentiful, and cubed. The lettuce was fresh and plentiful.  The sauce was some kind of garlicky-tahini-hummus tasting concoction that was fine.  The portion was just fair for the nearly 8 dollar price tag.My server Valerie was a real treat so I would rate the service as 4 star even though that doesn't seem to jive with other reviews.The best time to go to this Pita Jungle is happy hour (3-6).  Their happy hour menu was larger than I have seen at other locations.  A small plate of three different hummus? $1.  Two falafel balls?  $1.  Garlic chicken? $2.  Streamed mussels? $2.  Plus tons of other options...you could easily eat an entire meal there for just a couple of bucks.The service was fine when we went - not even the slightest delay - but it was also in between meal times and not crowded.  However, the strip mall itself was packed.  It is always packed.  The parking lot stresses me out.  So, go at your own risk, and don't bother trying to park close.Food.......4 StarsTakeout service...... 1 StarPita Jungle has tasty fresh food, it's just getting to it at this location is a consistent challenge. Ordering over the phone is easy- but when you get there to pick it up- it's a total joke. Only once out of the last seven times was the experience timely. Last week I went there and after standing near the bar for five minutes I was finally acknowledged. Here's a pro tip- don't say "I'll be right with you" and then disappear.  Oddly- they are worse here when it's slow, which you would expect to be the opposite. I hope they can get it together soon, it's unacceptable and the food and takeout service are incongruent.
Buca di Beppo Italian Restaurant=Buca Di Beppo is literally, italian restaurant hell. You know how all big box chain restaurants throw junk up on the walls in an attempt to make the space feel vintage? Buca Di Beppo throws junk, and knick knacks and statues and anything else 'italian' they could find in the chinese warehouse where they loaded up these goods. It's a terrible horrible mess and you end up sitting in a yardsale of italian paraphenalia while eating your very bland pasta.It's embarassing how truly flavorless the food is here. Thin, flavorless alfredo sauce. Thick slabs of lasagna with less taste than what I can get out of the frozen section at Publix. I went with a large group and across the table, bland food.When they seat your party, they guide you through the kitchen area where the cooks play along and say a welcoming hello. Deep down you know they hate this. Why are we in the kitchen? Sure it's nice, but I'd rather have them concentrating on making the food, and making it good. Of course, the food at Buca Di Beppo seems to be far beyond any point of return to tasting good. It's just dead. Dead food. No life, no flavor, not emotion. I get more flavor from the $.99 Michelina's frozen lunch package.Far from claiming anything authentic Italian, Buca Di Beppo even pumps out bread with no taste. Eating at Buca is like eating food from an assisted living facility. No salt, no sugar, no butter, no fat, it's all gone along with anything resembling taste. Sure, Buca has huge portions, and the setup is nice for large parties and families - but they might as well just buy the family-size pasta packs from the frozen section and bake it at home, even that would be better, and they wouldn't have to the mandatory gratuity. Say what you will about other italian chains like Macaroni Grill, or Olive Garden - at least their food taste like something.Reviews are all over the scale for this demi-Italian joint, but my experience here puts it on my Mediocre List.Remember Leftover Night as a kid?  You'd ask your mom what's for dinner and she'd open the fridge and say, "Whatever you want -- we have spaghetti, salad, bread, there's a piece of fish, and some kind of meat.  Go to town."Buca is kind of like that.  The selection and portion sizes available to you are just wierd.  Plain and simple, I like getting what I want, not choosing from among the things that THEY want me to have.  I know all places have their menu's, but any illusion of getting something the way you want it is gone at Buca.That makes me change my mind.  Buca is more like "Leftover Night" at a friend's house, choosing from among that other mom's dishes, which while familiar to you, were prepared in a way that just "isn't like my mom makes it".The food is pretty good: hovering around average, but hearty.The service is the standard fake-friendly.  I can't be sure if the extra touch of douchebag that our server exhibited was a personal trait or something they train.The restaurant itself is oh so very annoying, with enough distracting wall decorations to paralyze a hard ADD case.  The layout is a bunch of ridiculous rooms, with doorways and stairways like a maze, and they march you through the kitchen to get to your seats -- an obnoxious bit of pretention that should be saved for an establishment that deserves it.
Enzo's=After reading fellow Yelpers praise this long-time pizza-making fixture in Henderson, I decided to give it a shot--which is a big deal for me, because to cut down on cholesterol, I generally limit my pizza eating to a pie every two months.  So, the pizza must be very good, or I will waste 1/6 of my annual allotment on an inferior product.  And, that I do not ever want to do.  So, you will never find me ordering pizza from a national chain.I was quite pleased with Enzo's pizza.  The whole dining experience did not knock it out of the park, but I found the pizza I sampled by and large to be excellent.  The interior of Enzo's is not really pretty, but it has functional, comfortable booths.  My foursome ordered Garlic Knots first.  The knots that arrived were hot and oily but contained very little taste of garlic.  The dough was tasty, but I believe Garlic Knots should feature garlic.  A small Iceberg Lettuce Dinner Salad, with Italian dressing, that included a few hard carrot chunks, cucumbers, and tomato slices, was tasty but fairly ordinary.Now it was time for the pizza!  I did not scrimp on ingredients or size, ordering entirely for myself a 16", four-topping Pizza Napolitana beauty.  My choices of toppings this night were sausage, pepperoni, mushrooms, and cooked sliced tomatoes.  The table groaned under the weight of this pie that somehow was fitted beside another all-cheese 16-incher for our friends, and a third 16" pie that sported sausage, ham, and extra cheese for Diane.  Besides their large pie, my friends also ordered Chicken Fingers.  We were a serious group of diners, intent on eating!  And, to my own shock, I ate three Garlic Knots and my whole 16" pizza in one sitting.  There were no leftovers for me.As for the pizza, the crust was perfect.  It was thin but not too thin, and did not resemble the cracker bread variety found in Italy.  The pizza slices were just saucy and cheesy enough; unusual crumbly mild sausage tasted good; and I found that the unusual-looking disks of mild pepperoni got along famously with my taste buds.  Pizza slices folded somewhat in the hand as is desirable.  I didn't mind that more sausage congregated in the center of the pie, so that the tips of slices were denser in sausage than other parts; I just moved some of the sausage over by hand.  I was prepared for this, because one Yelp reviewer had said that a trademark of Mr. Enzo, who was the pizza maker this night, was unevenly spread toppings, and advised to just accept it.  So, I did.  The only thing a bit displeasing was that a few cooked tomato slices on my pizza were orange rather than red.You would think that we ate enough.  But we were not through yet!  How is a meal complete without a fine dessert?  And, Enzo's had them available--in spades.  Diane and I enjoyed a Manhattan: merged Vanilla and Chocolate Ice Creams highlighted with chopped almonds and a cherry center, and dipped in a hard coating of dark chocolate, with some Chocolate Sauce ladled over that.  C'mon!  How could we pass this up?  The sweet concoction was decadent and luscious, and its taste a contrast of excellent creamy ice creams and delicious flaking sections of hard chocolate melded together with superior Chocolate Sauce having the thickness of hot fudge.My dining companions and I made this pizza night count!It sounds like the food here is spectacular and I wish I'd have been able to try it. Unfortunately, I'm not cool with being pointedly ignored when I walk in somewhere and say hello to the person behind the counter. Long story short I walked in, was ignored. Went to counter, was ignored. Got order taken, tried to use a coupon, the lady said "No." "I can't use it?" "No." Oh. Alright.I was ordering the daily special and wanted to use an Entertainment coupon. I'd have understood if she had been really nice and just let me know that she would be losing money on a coupon. Then I'd have pocketed the coupon and went about with the order. I just don't like being treated like a stupid jerk. I get ignored and given attitude like this when I wear a name badge, I don't need it when I enter an establishment to spend money. So I told her I'd just go somewhere else and she shrugged.No big loss for either of us, I suppose!I recently enjoyed two meals at Enzo's.  On the first occasion only Enzo and I were present after I asked at the door at 9:10 p.m. what time the restaurant closed and was told, "Ten minutes ago.  But come on in and I'll take care of you."  The second was for pizza with Diane and friends just a few days ago.On the first visit, after a Dinner Salad with Italian Dressing I enjoyed some complimentary Garlic Knots (since otherwise they would have been thrown out) and a filling meal of Sausage & Peppers.  Chef-owner Enzo does not scrimp on portions, and I had an ample amount of sausage lengths to devour, along with both Green and Red Peppers nicely enfolded together in a tasty Pomodoro Sauce.On the second stop, the Garlic Knots were big, freshly made, and chewy.  Another Dinner Salad with Italian Dressing, greens, and a few pieces of tomato and carrot was nothing special but a serviceable beginning.  The pizza, however, was sublime.  A great thin-crust Neapolitan pizza with supple dough, plenty of sauce and melted cheese, and this time five ingredients: tomato, mushroom, sausage, pepperoni, and cashews.  The cashews were brought in by Diane, and Enzo graciously accommodated our request to add them as a topping on our 16-inchers.  Our friends split an 18-inch pizza, so pizza was omnipresent on our table top.  The pizza was delicious, even though the sausage packed a spice that lingered in the mouth for awhile.  To offset the sausage's kick, the pepperoni was mild.Service was very good; our waiter somehow remembered me from a single stop over 3 years ago.  The ambiance inside our dining room was casual, and our booth seating was quite  comfortable.  Food came out quickly, too, even though the place was humming with several diners in our midst.4-1.2 stars overall for the Sausage & Peppers, Garlic Knots, and fine pizza!
Z'Tejas Southwestern Grill=My rating is based on this first review... not on the second.On my first visit to Z Tejas, I went at lunchtime with 2 guys from Boeing.  We had to sit at the bar since the restaurant was so crowded.  As I scanned the menu, the Grilled Green Chile Pork Enchiladas with green chile sauce and a tomato-avocado chopped salad caught my eye... and I'm glad it did.I dont necessarily consider myself an 'enchilada' type of guy, but this dish provided me with the best I've ever tasted.  I recommend this dish, with no reservations.Now for my second review.My boss and I headed to Z Tejas today.  I figured that I'd mix it up and try something new.  Bad choice.I was feeling a bit famished, so I ordered the more expensive menu item, which was Jack's Five-Cheese Macaroni Achiote.  The grilled chicken with bleu, Jack, cheddar, parmesan and romano cheeses and bacon gratin sounded like a complete winner.Where to begin?The dish incorporates real cheese, which I would normally find appetizing.  However, in this case, the entree was served piping hot, causing the cheese to string everywhere.  Kind of messy for a lunchtime meal.  So, I ate slow, in hopes that the threadlike curd would solidify some.  Well, it did, but it also left, what can only be depicted as an oily scramble, in the bottom of the bowl, due to separation.  Delectable!Well, I decided to ease up on the 'roni, and move on to the chicken, which was served with skin on.  Visually, the skin looked crispy... but I realized my peepers were punked when I chewed up on some rubbery epidermis.Swoop Says: skip the mac 'n cheeze, go for the whole enchilada!In other news, the server at the bar was top notch.  She refilled my palmer again and again, until my bladder shouted: 'Uncle!'.  When you need some pampering, saddle up to the bar.BIRTHDAY BONUS: Signup for their birthday club and get an annual $10 coupon in your email.~Swoop
Chung Ming Restaurant=Among the many nuances of American culture that I have yet to grasp is the fucking obsession with crab puffs.With the way people chomp at the bit for cream cheese and imitation crab you'd think it cured herpes (oh, btw, if you're reading this, I tested negative, so yay!).Like pringles and ritalin on a day "you really need to concentrate", people can't seem to pop just one. What initially appears to be [insert Chinese eatery]'s attempt at offering you a robust and well-rounded combo becomes a cruel and vicious taunt. Yeah, looks like you're getting a bag of those to go, champ. So much for your "Ethnic food is healthier than McDonald's" approach to dieting.Some people are willing to endure some pretty tedious inconveniences in the name of these morsels. Clarice W and I once waited for 25-30 minutes after our meal was finished for an order of puffs at Hope Kee, our brilliant plan to eat lunch at a supermarket and spare ourselves the lunch crowd thwarted by hordes of crab-craving take-out customers.Last week, my boss suggested we order lunch from Chung Ming, because, according to the coupon, if your order was over 15 dollars you got a free order of crab puffs.Three people ordering lunch barely put us at the 12 dollar mark.Let's get soup. No, fried wontons. No, bbq pork ribs.I got it. Let's get an order of crab puffs, so we'll get TWO orders of crab puffs.Yo dawg. I heard you like crab puffs so we put crab puffs in your bag of crab puffs so you can eat crab puffs while you eat crab puffs. The real zinger in this story is that the crab puffs at CM kinda suck.They aren't bad, but compared to the sweet tangy-ness of their orange/lemon chicken or the robust spice of their kung pao or their eggrolls that would make Chipotle blush, a gloop of cheese and crab doesn't really cut the wasabi.Still, it's a staple of Americanized Chinese cuisine and is helpful in getting your order to the right total cost so you don't have to pay a "delivery fee". So, come because the crab puffs lured you in, but for the love of Eris find a different reason to stay. Your nutritionist (i.e. bf/gf who took a nutrition class in college) will thank you.
Crackers & Co Cafe=In exchange for watching our little one, my in-laws proposed that we meet up at Crackers & Co to make the switch. A new breakfast place AND we get a date day? I'm game!When we first arrived, I was a little skeptical. The Cafe is located in a little strip mall behind the Home Depot, right next to a cabinet place. But, I'm learning to be adventurous, so I decided to not judge this place by its surroundings. Wise decision!We showed up during what I thought would be prime brunch time on a Sunday morning. Surprisingly, there was absolutely no wait. We were ushered to our table by the hostess, where we were greeted by, arguably, the most cheerful, interactive, and helpful waitress I've ever encountered. Thank you, Luana.We looked over the menu for a few minutes, it didn't really take us long to figure out what we wanted. My daughter got the kids pancakes, and my wife and I each ordered the Healthy Scram.  For the so called "kids" portion of pancakes, my daughter received three full grown pancakes. Of course, she couldn't finish them. If she had, I imagine she would have been in a coma for the next two days.As for my wife's and my meal...absolutely delicious. We each opted to have two extra egg whites scrambled in with our orders. Essentially, it ends up being an oversized egg white omelette. Couple that with a cup of fresh fruit and a dry English muffin, and you've got yourself an amazingly healthy and filling breakfast/brunch/dinner... whenever you decide to eat it, I assure you, it will be delicious.The three of us ended up spending about $40 for our meals. The price is a little bit inflated, though, as it does cost $1.00 extra per egg white added to our omelettes. But, whatever. you pay for what you get...and we got an awesome meal!If you're looking for a cozy breakfast place with a great menu with healthy options, awesome atmosphere, a patio, and (in our case), the greatest service we've experienced in QUITE some time, then you should definitely stop by!
Asian Grill=I am removing my good rating. The kind of service I received this last time was OUTRAGEOUS!! We decided to order delivery this time. Locating a complete menu online was a HUGE pain. We knew they had combo plates though and knew that's what we wanted. My husband searched for at least thirty minutes for a menu listing the combos. When I was finally ready to call I couldn't understand what the lady said at first. So I responded that I wanted to place an order for delivery. She asked me what I wanted. I told her a number one and a number eighteen. The lady asked me "what?" so I repeated. Then she, clear as day, asked "what is that?" I responded the number one, it's the chicken and broccoli combo. Then the number eighteen the spicy honey shrimp. Then she asked me my cross streets, THREE TIMES! The third time I even asked her if she was listening that I had already told her twice. After that we discussed phone numbers and addresses. Then she asks if I want to pay by cash or card. I said card so she asked me for the card number. Worried she might have messed up the order I ask to know the total first. She told me it was $21. The number 1 is about $8 and the 18 about $10 so I thought that seemed right with taxes. I said ok and prepared to give her the card info and she hung up on me. I was angry by that point. She refused to listen the whole time and then hung up. So my husband called back and told them we needed to pay. She argued that I said I wanted to pay cash. He said "no she said card." THREE times she repeated him saying "oh you want to pay cash" and he had to yell to stop her from hanging up again before he could get her to understand we were paying by card. ONE HOUR later the food shows up and it's WRONG. Not combos at all but just the two meat dishes. So I called back AGAIN. I told her we ordered combos and they weren't  combos. She told me she repeated the order to me twice and I confirmed. She did not repeat the order even once! She proceeded to call me a liar and hung up!!So I took the food back to their shop. I told her I wanted my money back. She said why, I  told her it was because it was wrong and she has poor customer service. She then called me a liar and told me how I was trouble, to get out and never come back. I told her I wasn't going anywhere until I had my money back. She then told me she already voided it. Who's the liar now? She didn't want to give me a refund when I walked in. The delivery guy was visibly shocked when he heard her refuse to refund me. Then she says she already did it? BS. I told her I didn't believe her and I wanted proof. I argued in full view of all the customers for over fifteen minutes. She told me I was a liar over twenty times. Then it turns out she's not even the lady I was talking to on the phone! All of a sudden it slips out someone else does the phone. She's not even really 100% sure what was said! This was the business owner! And the business owner was the lady I talked to when I called about our missing food! The business owner lied about repeating the order to me twice on the phone. And the business owner is the one who called me a liar and hung up on me. She told me she's never had a problem in ten years and I was trouble and a liar over and over. Finally she printed me a receipt saying she had voided our transaction. As I walked out the door she was SCREAMING "You are a liar! Don't come back!"This lady is insane!! She has an elderly Asian woman answering the phones instead of someone more fluent in English. But if there is a mistake it's all the customer's fault. This only happened tonight so I will have to wait and see if we really are reimbursed for our food!! If we aren't I will be reporting then to the BBB.
Coyote's Cafe & Cantina=I agree with the reviewer who said "no value at all." That statement pretty much sums up the food at this restaurant. I wanted to like this place. I thought the decor was very cute with a southwestern theme throughout. It felt cozy and quaint. The decor earns the one star. Our server was pleasant, but once bringing over our food didn't really ever come back to check if everything was ok. The food was average at best. The prices were ridiculous. My carnitas "platter" was $16.99 and it was a handful of meat, a tablespoon scoop of guacamole, a tablespoon of sour cream, some tasteless beans and rice. The pork was not dry, but it was very flavorless. And being limited on guac, sour cream or any type of sauce to add for flavoring due to the server never coming back around to check on us, my plate was left half eaten. While still a solid amount of food on my plate, another female server comes from behind and asks if I am done. I say yeah, probably....does she offer a box for three quarters of my meal? Nope. I, in nicest way possible, reclaim my plate and ask her for a box. She trots off and drops one off at our table.Boyfriend had a "macho burrito" which was $14.99...pretty standard, average burrito - in portion and taste. We didn't bother waiting for someone to come by to ask for another box, so we just piled it up in mine.We ordered a strawberry margarita to share..it was ok tasting..they of course use low quality tequila like cuervo in it, but the price was $11.99!A simple bean and cheese burrito was $10.99. Beans and cheese and a tortilla...$11 bucks.  They need to truly re evaluate their prices or really improve on their food if they plan on sticking around.
Flancer's=It's a shame I haven't eaten here in a while because the food is great!  It's a quaint cafe with excellent pizza and sandwiches. The interior is cozy with old album covers on the walls and the servers are super friendly.  They also have outdoor seating available.  It  can get crowded at lunch time so plan ahead.If you are in the area I highly recommend you trying it.~~~sticker shock~~~Three of us ate here and we all really enjoyed our sandwiches...in fact they were darn good!                                     ~~~sticker shock~~~We passed the sandwiches around and shared so we could all try each others.  The prime rib was very good (no sticker shock for a prime rib sandwich), the club was very good and the patty melt was very good.                                    ~~~sticker shock~~~The bread was very good and all the ingredients were high quality.                                   ~~~sticker shock~~~A soda is nearly $2.50 and we got nickeled and dimed a bit...leading to us trying to figure out how 3 sandwiches and 2 sodas came to nearly $40 bucks!~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~sticker shock~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~I have driven by Flancer's so many times and said "I need to try that place" to myself every time I do.  Well the time finally came!  My friend Robyn N. had a Groupon and invited me to luch. For some reason I was thinking it was a tad more upscale than it actually is but that's not a bad thing.  I only really say the front half of the restaurant because we were seated just inside the door. It's sort of a divey little place with the kitchen visable as you walk in. It could be a little cleaner for my taste. Don't get me wrong, we didn't stick to the table or the seats but I then I grew up with a mom who was a little OCD and our kitchen floor was so clean you could eat off of it.  The service was fast and friendly.  We had the goat cheese bruscheta and it was yummy!!!  There were 5 good size slices.  That was pleanty to share.  For lunch I tried the cheesesteak.  Oh so good!!  The bread was so fresh and yummy and the cheesesteak had great flavor.  The cheese was nicely melted and the meat was tender.  I also had sweet potato fries that were a lovely crispy treat!  Will I go back....you bet!  I won't be so apt to drive right by now.
Samurai Sam's=Come on folks! How can you go wrong with affordable, healthy and quick! Oh and let's not forget to mention their addicting teriyaki sauce and low-fat egg rolls! This is a healthy fast-food shop and one that I would frequent much more if it was closer to my hood. But, I will say that it's worth the drive in my eyes because it's not everyday that you can find healthy food that fills you up and tastes unhealthy. It's a win win situation! Get the chicken teriyaki bowl with spicy teriyaki sauce and brown rice and make it a meal because those egg rolls are tasty!
Ninja Japanese Restaurant=Ninja has become, as of May 2012, the frequent haunt of my fiancé and I, and I probably should have posted this review looooong before now. However, I've also now experienced Ninja on pretty much every kind of night, so hopefully I'll be able to write a better overall review. Or at least a longer one. haha!To begin, my fiancé and I are drawn back again and again not only by the delicious offerings on their AYCE sushi menu (which they have recently updated to include a few more options), but also by the incredibly welcoming and always-helpful chefs and wait-staff. We now know everyone who works there by name, and I'm excited to go back to Ninja on our sushi nights not only because it's freaking yummy but because I'm excited to see everyone again!I'm actually very confused by all the negative reviews for Ninja on this site. I'm not going to deny that it gets incredibly busy on Friday (and some Saturday) nights lately, most likely due to the sale of an incredible number of Groupons, and that service slows down as a consequence. That IS a fact. However, the people that work here are hardly at fault for the fact that the majority of their customer traffic is concentrated on one or two nights per week. :P The last few Fridays, every single table in the place has been filled up at dinner time, with more and more people lining up at the door, and there are so many sushi menus stretched across the LOOOONG sushi bar that, once spread out, they need to be layered if they're gonna fit. Yes, it gets crazy, but the servers and the chefs really are working as fast as they can. Conversely, on week nights, the place is DEAD. As an additional note, my fiancé and I bring our own chopsticks when we come, and this is the first place where our waitress has ever washed them for us!oh, and another warning to keep in mind: sometimes the music does get a bit loud. However, if you express displeasure to a server, they're always prompt and ready to turn down the volume. My impression has always been that they honestly care about their customers, and they truly want them to be happy and comfortable.I've eaten a LOT of sushi in my time, and my fella and I have prowled loads of establishments in the Phoenix area, in Tucson, and in Washington state, and Ninja honestly reigns supreme. We've loved a couple enough to become regulars, but we honestly don't care to go anywhere but Ninja anymore. Tried polyamory and failed. Oh Ninja, you make an honest woman out of me. On the topic of the food, nigiri is my personal weakness, and the nigiri here at Ninja is exceptional. The amount of rice that they use is quite conservative, with a proportionally generous slice of melt-in-your-mouth sashimi on top. Further, the pieces are quite dainty compared to what I've been served elsewhere, which makes eating them a much more pleasant experience. And their albacore... They serve their albacore like I've never had it before, topped with minced garlic, scallions, and a light drizzle of ponzu sauce. It's absolutely spectacular, and you MUST order it if you go.As for maki, if you like spicy or fried, my fiancé swears by the calamari tempura roll. According to him, the spicy sauce is an amazing complement to the overall flavour, and MUCH better than the stuff we've been served at other restaurants. As for myself, my personal favourites are the rainbow roll and the alaskan roll (the latter is one that has been recently added to the AYCE menu, and is basically a california roll topped with salmon, masago, scallions, and ponzu). I personally order it sans masago. Speaking of ordering things special, the chefs and wait staff have always been incredibly accommodating when it comes to removing certain ingredients from the rolls. To cite an extreme example, I really enjoy salmon and avocado rolls, but there is unfortunately no such roll offered at Ninja. However, those ARE the ingredients in a Philly roll if you remove the cream cheese, so that's just what I do. It's a little ridiculous because a Philly roll gets its name from the cream cheese, but it doesn't matter: the staff at Ninja are happy to bend the laws of the universe for my sake, and I get my Philly roll without the Philly whenever I go. ;)We've brought scads of friends with us to dinner here, and everyone becomes an instant convert and starts bringing THEIR family and THEIR friends. Sure, I might be a bit biased in their favour, but I'm biased for a reason: they've earned my loyalty, over and over again. And besides that, AYCE sushi for $20 is a flipping AMAZING deal -- especially when you consider the quality that Ninja delivers. You don't have to sacrifice quality for quantity in this case.Can you see why I'm surprised that so many people have had unhappy experiences at Ninja? I really don't get it.Its funny how all-you-can-eat Sushi can sound so amazing when you just hiked 6 miles and are completely starving. 20 sashimis later, your perspective starts to change a bit.The main problem with Ninja isn't its sushi, its people's expectation of the sushi. Price is a key setter of expectations, so if you are paying $19.99 for all the sushi (AND sashimi) your hungry little stomach can provide, maybe you shouldn't be expecting the fish to taste like it just got sliced off the coast of japan by Shiro himself.That being said, 3 stars is an evening of satisfaction without completely flipping about the amazingness of the food. The price/food ratio is amazing, the service is good and the food itself is very decent. I was not fond of the volcano rolls but my friends swear by it. The classic philly, salmon and spicy tuna rolls were prepared well and some of their more inventive rolls (like the spicy New Mexico) were interesting and worth trying. My favorite part about all-you-can-eat at Ninja is when the server starts coming around to see if we want to order more... smiling hard because she can obviously see in our faces the look of defeat and gluttony. As we stare at the leftover rolls on the plate, we become incredibly strategic about our every move. "Okay man, you eat that one, I will eat this one over here and he can have those 2 because he ate less overall." "No man, I can't do the spicy one. I will trade you if I can poke the cucumber out" "Fine. Deal" *Gulp*. Ah, all done.You're the salmon to my sticky rice."You" as in the reader... not Ninja Japanese Restaurant.  Not gonna sugar-coat it, at first glance, this place looks seedy.  It's cluttered with neon lights, chinzy paper lanterns, and your typical Japanese decor like fans and umbrellas.  The ceiling is painted pink so everything that's served looks as suspect as the establishment itself.  Service is lacking and they badly need more servers and bussers.  I saw one waitress clear out a lone patron's spot at the sushi bar when he went to the bathroom but was still eating.  How rude.What can I say about the food?  The fish for sashimi and nigiri are sliced uneven and thin and the salmon skin hand roll looks like taco meat yet smells fishy.  I did like the Hipster Roll and the Shake-and-Bake seemed interesting until the over-powering garlic got to be too much.  I also found the color on the salmon nigiri to be startling.  Remember how I mentioned the pink ceilings casting a weird pink light to everything?  If it wasn't for the lights, I could almost swear that the salmon had no color to it.  The wait time for food is ridiculously long and the rolls are a bit small.What more can I say?  I don't think I'll be back.
Golden Dragon=After attending a meeting tonight nine of us went to the Golden Dragon for dinner. They serve  "American Chinese food". Everyone got something different and everyone agreed the food here was outstanding. Here is my take on this place....I always start my meal with the soup. If the soup is  is good usually the food is good as well. Tonight was no exception. The Wor Wonton soup was excellent!   In addition to my soup I got a vegetable dish. The sauce on it was superb. Everyone commented how their entrée had good flavors, was served hot and the ingredients used seemed fresh. No one was disappointed with what they got.     prepared perfectly. The food here is great and while it isn't 100% authentic it's very filling, not expensive, had large portions, was served fast and every dish was delicious. I can't emphasize enough how inexpensive it is! ************************* What does my OVERALL rating mean?*************************5 stars -Highly recommended.  I would be willing to drive out of my way to this business. It is that good. This place represents their industry or cuisine very well! 4 stars - Highly Recommended. I would frequent this business. 3 stars - Not that good but not that bad. Just average. I wouldn't mind going again if a friend or family member wanted to go. 2 stars - I would not recommend this establishment to friends or family. 1 stars - DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND DO NOT patronize this business. I would RUN AWAY from this place and you should too! DON'T WAST YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY AT THIS ESTABLISHMENT!
Kyklos Greek Cafe=Mad props to Kyklos for giving me healthy and delicious mall food. They are my current crush. I am not a huge fan of the Galleria for several reasons starting with the temperature and the lighting. It's always way too warm and bright for my comfort level leaving me irritable and sweaty and hungry. Ugh. But, now there's hope in the form of a gyro. Kyklos had me at the picture menu and the enormous slice of  homemade Baklava on the counter. It's nothing new or revolutionary, but they serve all of my favorite, authentic Greek grub with quality ingredients. We ordered the chicken gyro with the yogurt sauce on the side, Greek salad with the dressing on the side, and chicken with rice with extra vegetables. Simply scrumdiddlyumptious! The homemade vinaigrette and the moist chicken made me fall in love. Every single item was full of flavor and cooked to perfection restoring my faith in mall food in general. Kyklos belongs in the Fashion Show Mall or Fashion Island in Cali. The food is above average and the service is pimp. How refreshing to not have a high, teeny bopper with braces and skinny jeans carelessly taking my order. At Kyklos they care and it shows. Lastly it is clean. I am always scared to eat in the food courts because without fail the food spots constantly get Health Department demerits. While we were ordering and eating I noticed the staff cleaning. Boom. This meal is part of what made yesterday magical to me and I already want more! The Golden Arches and all the other processed food choices at the mall can suck it. I'm all about the Golden Gyro!This is my "go-to" fast food. It is sooooo YUMMY! It is located in the food court at the Galleria mall.....I know...but don't let the screaming kids and crowds of people stop you for going there for your next meal! The food is amazing!This placed is owned by a group of brothers. The food is authentic and everything is homemade...including their baklava and tomato sauce. They will usually give you a sample of whatever they are currently grilling while you choose your meal.We always get either the gyro plate or a plain gyro. The food is so fresh and flavorful. I like mine with crisp, ripe tomatoes and yogurt. The pita bread is warm and chewy and holds the rice and homemade tomato sauce just perfect. HEAVEN. They are a bit on the pricey end. We usually spend almost $25 for two of us....a bit expensive for mall food....but it is still worth it. You get what you pay for. HINT: They have recently posted a groupon TWICE so keep your eyes out. We always buy the max each time. Yeah, that is how we roll!When it comes to mall food I am officially a GREEK geek....with baklava on the side yo!
Chipotle=Oh my god... I used to hate Chipotle. HATE! Hate. When asked why, I said, "Because they offer rice burritos to vegetarians." I thought the burritos were 90 percent rice, 10 percent goodness, even when I asked for light rice. I was, as it turns out, save-ably stupid. Because redemption is mine every time I eat here. They get it. They "Get It" get it. They GET IT with a capital GET IT. Oh, I shall explain. Worry ye not... I want the world to stop eating meat. In fact, it is my destiny, my very purpose, to rid the world of Fear (i.e., meat). It's true, all you're eating when you're eating meat is fear. 98 percent of you will have no idea what I mean when I say that but I can promise you it's true. But I don't want Chipotle to stop serving meat because people like you would stop going there and it'd go out of business and I would die because there would be nothing left for me to eat, because lately, it's all I eat. Yes. I ate twice today. Both times, Chipotle. If I lose weight, I'll become the next Jared. Gain. Ignominy. Whatevs...It's delicious.So here's what they get: The freshest ingredients.The meat, if you care, is straight up not injected with growth hormones or bull shit. Portions are huge. Almost too big. But the technology OOOOOHHHHHHH the technology! Like Chuck R said... YOU CAN ORDER ON YOUR iPhone! It's ridiculous.And our office orders as an office. ONLINE! Individually! Again, ridiculous! We can order exactly what we want, pay separately. The orders are prepared with love. They'll bring it out to your car. They'll even occasionally call you to make sure everything was amazing. It was! It always is. I love you. Smooch.Chipotle is the best business model of the 21st Century, and this location wholly embodies the Chipotle perfection.Chipotle uses naturally raised meats, hormone free dairy, no eggs or nuts, organic beans, seasonal produce, and promote recycling within the restaurants. This means that they care what you are putting into your body and what it is doing to the environment!! (score!)Their simple menu makes ordering easy, but still allows you variety (Burrito, Salad, Tacos, Bowls) and caters to a carnivore, vegetarian, or vegan. In fact, they are pretty "food-allergy" safe in general. (Believe me, I have experience)As if the food wasn't enough, they have two amazing ordering systems: Iphone App and Online Ordering. Let's talk about this online ordering system here for a minute, because it is what I think really sets the bar high for their competitors and other restaurants in general:I run a medium sized business and when lunch comes around, my Operations staff of ten has the WORST time executing something as simple as a lunch order. I know this sounds ridiculous, but believe me, it is as true as the day is long. This all changed when I discovered Chipotle Online Ordering. Anyway, I go online, login, and tell the system I want a group order. It then emails each of my employees giving them a link to order or a link to decline. If they choose to order, the link takes them right to an online order page with pictures, places for memos, etc. They select exactly what they want and it gets added to our group order.Once everyone has ordered, I hit submit, pay by credit card, and fifteen minutes later you arrive at Chipotle, give them a jingle, and they will actually bring the food right out to your car for you. They call this the "valet" service. Perfect if you can't find a spot or it is raining out!!Chipotle Executives must have sat down and thought of every pain a company could have in ordering lunch because I honestly cannot think of one thing that would improve this process. (Well, delivery would be nice... but that is what I have a receptionist for)I want to take a second to recognize this particular location, on 54th Street. Let me start by saying, I believe that you can taste the love in food... as in, if someone is cranky as shit, making your food, it is not as good as if they are smiling, enjoying their lives. I know this probably sounds crazy, but I swear on my right hand it is true. EVERY time I have ever eaten here (we are talking dozens of times) my food has been fabulous! I can taste the LOVE! Oh, and about two hours after pickup, someone calls to ask how everything was and to let you know that they took special care to pack it up and make sure everything was right. If there is a Best Chipotle award, this location deserves it!My final note: I get the salad with black beans, rice, tomato salsa, green tomatillo salsa, and guacamole. 100% vegan, 100% delicious. Under 500 calories, 17g of fat, and 14g of protein. And I am full. REAL full. Since I have started eating Chipotle 3-4 times a week, I have actually started losing weight. Perhaps I will be the next Jared!Eh, the food is okay.  I really like their carnitas and their cilantro lime rice.  The black beans were pretty damn flavorless though.  I think for what you get it's a bit too pricey.  About a buck and a half too much in fact.And for God's sake, why the hell does every Chipotle have to be so deafening??  Did the architect that designed Chipotle not consider acoustics when they designed the place?  My lunch was fine when I started eating at 11 AM, but by the time I was leaving and the lunch crowd had filtered in, the din of noise was like being verbally assaulted while underneath a tin pail in a hail storm.  There are no noise baffles anywhere and the corrugated tin walls and booths and concrete floors make the place uncomfortably loud.    This is not the first time I have noticed this in a Chipotle location either.  They are all like this. Decent, if over-priced, food in an awful setting.
McDonald's=3 Stars for the food, 5 Stars for the unique experience.....I stopped by this McDonald's location for a quick lunch one day and ordered 2 Double Cheeseburgers and Large Fries.  While I was waiting for my food, someone told me about a free car show they host in the parking lot every Saturday night.My food was ready and I had a decent lunch.  It's McDonalds, so my expectations are pretty low.  Not bad for a quick meal.I then returned the next Saturday night to check out the car show.....it was pretty cool!  There are probably close to 100 cars here....everything from old classics (Chevy's, Corvettes, Camaros, Mustangs) to newer rice rockets (Acuras, Hondas, Toyotas) to exotics (Ferrari's, Lambos).  I was amazed!  Best part....it's FREE!By the way.....the McDonalds was packed and making tons of money.....great idea!Return Factor - 100% (the Car show was a lot of fun, will definitely be back)This McDonald's venue is about as great as McDonald's can get.  The food is consistently quality, hot and yummy.I have eaten many a breakfast here and nurtured my coffee in the bar high to seating they have out front.  Their staff knows how to run a great show.  Fast service and super friendly and competent.  They do a great, great job. Little funky sometimes navigating the parking lot with the twists and turns when Las Vegans are feeling testy and pushy, but other than that, great place. On the extra points side, they have a PlayPlace!
The Cheesecake Factory=1/12/10I try not to visit chain restaurants as much as possible, but when Mom texted that she could meet me somewhere for a bite to eat, it was much easier to tell her to meet me at The Cheesecake Factory at the mall than it was to give her directions to try a local place in downtown Phoenix or elsewhere.  (Believe me, I've tried.)Since we were there during happy hour, we decided to share the Spicy Ahi Tuna Tempura Roll and she wanted the HH caesar salad.  The ahi tuna roll and the salad came out fairly quick, and no wonder, since the roll only consisted of four tiny pieces!  We were hungry, and the pieces were so diminutive, that I didn't even get a chance to take a photo of the dish!  It was very tasty, but certainly not substantial, so I took another look at the HH menu and settled on the hummus.  While waiting for it to arrive, Mom and I shared the nicely-sized caesar salad, which was crisp-fresh and not overly-dressed.  We decided to hold off on the salad for awhile, so as not to fill ourselves up on it.  The hummus and grilled pita bread arrivedl, and they too were flavorful; We couldn't get enough!  While we normally would've stuck w/ the happy hour menu, Mom had caught sight of a neighboring table's two platters and admired one of them, so I decided to order not the one she thought looked appetizing (the menu description turned her off), but what I had originally wanted to order instead of the hummus plate- a chicken pasta dish from the seasonal menu.  Two chicken breasts, pounded thin, battered, then fried, sitting atop of spaghetti w/ a basil-pesto cream sauce.  On top of the chicken were slices of prosciutto and dressed arugula greens sprinkled w/ grated parmesan.  This dish tasted fabulous, and the different textures it offered made me swoon!  (I knew Mom enjoyed it as well, for she repeated at least two times how great the food was!)  However, I knew that the greasiness of this dish would haunt me after.  Still, a great savory dish, and next time, I'll just skip the happy hour menu (save the caesar salad, that's a must!) and order from the dinner menu, instead.Great service, as always, although I just remembered that the honey wheat bread I had asked for arrived stale.  Funny that the server had even bothered to serve it, as she did warn us that it wasn't as fresh as it could be and that a new batch was baking in the oven.  Why even bring stale, hardened bread to the table?  It's the reason why I downgraded from the previous four-star rating to a three..."Oh Ma, a Cheesecake factory gift card! You shouldn't have" no, seriously. She really shouldn't have."Nesto, take Helena out for a nice dinner" Mom says beaming.At the Cheesecake factory??! But I love her...Cheesecake factory is ok.  For the record I am not a cheesecake fan, so that being said...I took my mom out to lunch with the gift card, because she appreciated it, and Helena passed. LOL can't say that I really blame her.The place has issues with identity...and size. Basically Cheesecake factory is a bisexual man with a small penis, metaphorically speaking.I get the feeling that even their staff selection is based on this premise. All very nice folks, but somehow not decision makers in this world, so stuck in limbo. I had a Monte Cristo. It was very OK. My mom could make me better...hey there's an idea for next Christmas! Mom had the lettuce wraps and a gargantuan salad. I had Merlot, my mom had Gin and Tonic. It's a solid safe bet if you are from out of town and don't want to chance it on a better independant restaraunt--Although if you are on Yelp, there really is no excuse. We will steer you to a great restaurant. Other than that I can think of no real reason to frequent here. There are just too too many great restaurants that I want to try in the Phoenix area.I met a girlfriend here around 8pm on a Wednesday night. She was in need of a nosh and I was in need of an adult beverage. We knew CF was open later than a lot of places and I have typically had decent luck here. This location is better than some and not as good as others. I think it is probably hit or miss depending on what time of year and what time of day you come.It was during this visit that my friend and I realized we have been legal to drink for 20 years now but have had been "drinking" together since we were 15 or so(shshsh-don't tell my folks). I am a cheap drunk-or shall I say a lightweight. My friend ordered Vodka/Cranberry (aka-a Cape Cod) and I decided to join her but to make it a better vodka for both of us. The drinks were weak. Seriously weak. I am typically a 2 sip and buzzed gal and yes, I said something. Our waiter apologized, made sure my friend had extra goodies for her meal and for just a meager $2.00 extra, I added a shot (split between our cocktails) and voila, we were able to make a decent drink. Don't worry CF-I am sure I will be back though you are located in the same vicinity of nearly every chain restaurant. If only I could get Grandma to come here with me instead of Red Lobster...but CF doesn't do coupons!
China A Go Go=Faster than you can say "a go go," China A Go Go will have your food on your table. Maybe I am exaggerating. However, based on my two recent experiences dining in a China Go Go, my food was delivered to my table at a remarkably fast rate. So fast that I now regard China A Go Go in the fast food Chinese food category where the Panda has dominated.    It was a sunny Sunday afternoon, and I was living the dream hiking on the windy and rolling pathways of the Seven Hills trail system. By the time I returned to my car I had built up an appetite for Chinese food. I cruised along the sinuous and hilly drives of Seven Hills to the Von's anchored shopping center off Eastern and Reunion. This is where Eastern Avenue changes from a linear city of shopping centers into a residential thoroughfare overlooking the Las Vegas valley. This China A Go Go is a familiar storefront. It has been here for years way back when the bakery was an It's A Grind.    The first thing that is striking when stepping inside this location is its tiny footprint. In comparison it is far smaller than the majority of the China Go Go's. Regardless there are a few tables.    I had made the daily lunch special when delicious Chinese food is in the same price level as fast food restaurants. Then again I regard China A Go Go as fast food. I handed over $9.32 for the shrimp Chop Suey lunch special with a fountain drink. This included fried rice, soft chow mein noodles, and soup of the day. Prior to February 6, 2011 on the day my Yelp profile was born, the soup of the day has been egg drop soup.    The egg drop soup served in a styrofoam bowl was decent. When the soup arrived on my table, I decided to take in the soup before checking in on Yelp. But it seemed that faster than I can say  "a go-go" my lunch arrived on the table. I appreciate speed of service at the exact time that my mind is questioning why is this food served so fast? In all honesty I don't want to know. The styrofoam box of Chinese food was good. But not GREAT like New York Chinese Restaurant to the east and China Tango Bistro to the south. I felt that there was a sufficient amount of shrimp to compliment the vegetables. The fried rice was likewise good as the filler soft chow mein noodles was.     In conclusion, China A Go Go is a China A So So in my book. When I am in the Seven Hills area, I will most likely concede future China A Go Go check-ins to New York Chinese Restaurant and other restaurants. Faster than I can say "A Go go," I say "3 stars."
Pho So 1=Pho So 1 has become one of my favorites for Vietnamese food in Vegas.  Our first visit, we stuck with the basics...* 10. Pho Dac Biet Xe Lua "Special Combo with Rare Slices of Steak, Well-Done Brisket, Flank, Tendon, and Tripe with Rice Noodle Soup" ($6.95) - A generous amount of food, one of the first times I ever had leftovers to take home from a regular order of pho.  * 40. Mi Bo Kho "Beef Stew with Egg Noodles" ($6.95) - The Husband was impressed with their version of one of his favorite dishes.Service was good too - tea comes out automatically, unlike some other restaurants we frequent and they are quick to take your order.  Food comes out promptly too.Within the past week, I've been back twice for this:* 85. Bo Tom Muc Nhung Dam "Beef, Shrimp and Squid dipped in Special Vinegar Sauce" ($25.95) - A platter of raw beef, shrimp, and squid and a pot of hot vinegar broth are presented before you, along with a plate of veggies (various greens, bean sprouts, cucumbers, and pickled daikon and carrots), a plate of rice noodles, rice paper, and a bowl of hot water.  For you first timers, you dip the rice paper in the hot water to get it soft, then you start to load it up with veggies, rice noodle and whatever you cooked up in the hot vinegary broth.  And of course, be sure to dip it in the tasty pineappley sauce thing they give you.  Oh so good!  It's another way for  me to enjoy hot pot - but Vietnamese-style!Last night we had this one:* 84B. Bo Tom Nhung Dam "Beef & Shrimp dipped in Special Vinegar Sauce" ($23.95) - Same thing, but without the squid.  I just love it because it's light, and you can ask for more veggies and rice paper if necessary.  That dipping sauce has a sweet and sour quick with a fruity twist and just good!* 89. Bo Luc Lac "Diced Beef Salad" ($9.50) - This was a semi-raw beef dish with lettuce, cucumbers, tomatoes, lettuce, limes, and peanuts.  Be sure to dip this in the fish sauce too for that extra tangy bite!  Yum!There are a bunch of other items in their Special Dishes section that I'm anxious to try.  It's a generous amount of food though, so it's better to go with a group of at least three.  (I think #s 84B and 85 are decent portions for a party of three, add some eggrolls if you're still hungry.)The first two times we went late at night, and they had a steady stream of customers.  But yesterday during dinnertime, it was packed!  They sure do get a lot of business here, from the Vietnamese community (always a good sign) and outside as well.  We did have to wave them down for more water, tea, extra condiments, etc.  But it was no big deal since it was busy.  Definitely one of my places to go for Vietnamese food beyond the basic pho.They are open late too!So you are craving pho after a night out and about all over lost wages... what are you going to do? go to chinatown (err asiatown???) and get some Pho...The pho is ok, the other stuff is ok also it seems a bit pricey on some items like an extra buck or two over So Cal prices, but it is vegas so yeah... Pro Tip: Make sure that the waitress completely understands your order, ours was wrong in 3-4 places out of a group of about 15... Since they do not speak english very well here be warned. The food is very average as well. I have had much better and much worse. None the less a bowl of pho in lost wages can be a very good thing, even when its very average...Also they dont take all credit cards, I think just Mastercard and Visa.OK AFTER MANY VISITS AND NUMEROUS AMOUNTS OF MOUTH WATERING PICS, I AM FINALLY DOING MY REVIEW ON THIS PLACE.Whenever I come here, I get one of 3 options.1. Pho (Beef Noodle Soup). I get the rare steak, flank, and brisket option. If you dont want your broth as greasy, minus the brisket. Just your basic pho with nothing but meat. No tendons or tripe. This would be a good choice for you first timers that dont wanna second guess what's in your soup. For you adventurers and seasoned vets, the combination has everything in it. Don't forget about the bean sprouts, cilantro, mint leaves, and sliced jalapenos that come on a separate plate for you to throw in there at your discretion.2. Rice Vermicelli. I usually get the Charbroiled Beef or Pork with Egg rolls and Vegetables. I get this because it comes with the crispy egg rolls that they make so good. So instead of ordering it as a side item, it already comes with it. They give you a small cup of sweet n sour fish sauce to mix in your bowl for that complete flavor.3. Rice Dish. I get the Diced Beef with Grilled Onions accompanied by Tomato Fried Rice. Very tender cuts of sirloin pan fried in oil and soy sauce. Very flavorful.I have also have tried their Seafood Barbeque Combination. When you order this they bring out a portable grill heated by a specific gel. On a separate plate they give you raw shrimp, beef, squid, and tripe. You cook these items yourself. So basically, this is their version of Korean Barbeque. It's pretty much guaranteed this is what you will be smelling when you walk in there. This is what parties of 3 or more usually get because for about 25 bucks you get a decent amount of food.Last but not least, I have heard great things about their Beef Salad. Eventually I will get it and it will probably be my fourth option.These guys are open until about 3 am 7 days a week 365 days a year. I know this because Christmas Day nobody wanted to cook so we went here. Their service is very efficient and they always seem to be fully staffed every time I go.The only negative thing that brings them to 4 instead of 5 stars is that the floor always seems to be littered with misc things. Not to the point where its piled up but if you look hard enough, you will see it. I will give them a pass because everything else makes up for it. Any questions? Message me and I will tell you everything I know! You can also check out their website: www.phoso1.comKeep in mind, not all they have on their physical menu is on their website menu.Probably the worst Vietnamese place, I have experienced! When it comes to costumer service this hits a all time low. After being seating at a booth for 15 minutes, I had to flag down a waiter for the menu (Minus a star)! It seems the like the waitress and waiter are all gathered around the cash register talking amongst themselves to care! We have to inform the waiter that we never got any cold water (Minus another star). The waiter decides to gives us an attitude when we was placing our order (Minus another star)!WARNING: The establishment itself is a OVEN!!!Lacking AC in this weather is not a welcoming place to dine. When I ask about the AC the waiter claim it is working (on) and the heat is cause by the weather outside! Sorry that was a load of crap! I posted a picture of the thermostat of the restaurant and it reads 90 Fahrenheit. I am not a high maintenance person but temperature that high ruins the dinning experience. The food is nothing to rave about! The chicken dish was dry! The grill pork and egg roll with vermicelli was decent! You could have gotten this in another Vietnamese restaurant. I could not imagine eating Pho here because of the heat! Personally with the lack of AC (Las Vegas being so hot) with bad costumer service, I would NOT RECOMMEND this place based on today experience!I used to come here very regularly, but it's been a minute since I've been back to Pho So 1 and I have to say they have remained consistent. The food wasn't as good as I remembered but it was still really solid and service was on par. We were served quickly and our server was friendly.I haven't tried their pho recently but the vermicelli bowl was good and had lots of fresh veggies, which made it all the better.UGH NO! Today I ordered  chicken pho and when I got to the bottom noticed something brown in  the tangle of noodles I put in my spoon and saw it was indeed a small roach. The BF didnt say anything ( he shouldve) while we were eating but he wasnt touching his water because something was in it as well.If it wasn't for ordering chicken, maybe I wouldnt have noticed the roach until it was in my mouth if it was with little  brown beef bits like well done brisket.  It was also filthy in there too. Sticky bottles, the floor a mess, etc. It was busy, but there was quite a bit of employees so downtime could be used to maintain cleanliness.NONONONONONONONONO. it sucks because they weren't taking our order for the longest time and I decided if they didn't come after this last order they were serving we were going to walk out as 10minutes just sitting there after it's clear we were looking around and put down the menus. I wish I didn't have decent patience today as I could have avoided roach soup.We didn't pay, but that is not the point. It's the cost of fucking fastfood so it doesn't mean a lot. It shouldn't be happening.If there was a possible zero, this place would get it. But, Yelp felt the need that all business deserve pity stars. From upon entering, we're greeted by an Asian fellow with glasses. There were two-three tables open for 10...he reluctantly seated us and was about to put us on a waiting list. If not mentioned, we would have wasted our time. Soup is less than mediocre, broth was bland and constumer service was blatantly disrespectful. We asked multiple times for simple sides like onion, and waiters would not acknowledge our requests. Just to top off the cake, there was curly hair in my #10 soup. The cashier was apologetic, but not by nature. She looked at my wife and I, trying to find out if the hair belong to one of us. The hair was curly and short, possibly armpit hair. For her to stare up and down at us, it was very offensive, we did not plan to eat someone else's pubes. For a restaurant that cries it is the number 1 soup restaurant, they sure treat us like we are the last people to come back."My mom just stomped on a roach in the bathroom and when I asked to speak to a manager about it.. They never brought one out to me and had me just tell a server.. Not coming back and telling my friends and all of yelp" - this being my most recent TIP posted for this establishment. Again, another establishment I hate to do this to since I was such a regular at this place, but in all honesty, when you see a cockroach in a place where you like to eat, it really does make you want to never come back. Last night 12/8/15 I was dining with a large group of friends (about 18 people) and a manager of some kind (he was not wearing restaurant uniform) made his way to even greet us and thank us for coming to their establishment. Everything was fine, until my mother and I decided we needed to use the restroom. My mom has said to me several times that she even though it's cheap and the food is decent, she doesn't like coming here because she always sees small cockroaches in the bathroom. I had personally never seen them before, so I would continue to come here whenever friends would want a pho run. This time on 12/8/15, it was a different story. My mother and I walked into a very dirty restroom and as she entered the handicap stall, she yelled at me on the other side, oh man.. see there goes one cockroach. and then I hear "stomp" and she goes, "I killed it." She allowed me to come and see for myself, and that is the pix I have recently posted. We even saw another small cockroach on the floor near the sink, but I wasn't in the mood to stomp on another one, because quite frankly that's not my responsibility. Seeing a cockroach in an eatery establishment, it does something to your stomach thats hard to describe. I enjoy the food here, and even my meal that night was delicious, which was number 71 btw, the diced beef with onions and tomato rice. I very politely asked to speak to a manager, and the server asked if everything was okay, and I kindly responded, "yes, it has nothing to do with the food or the service, that was fine, but there's an issue with the bathroom and I just wanted to discuss that with a manager" the server nodded his head and said okay. and while we were still packing our left overs and splitting our bill, I was waiting for a manager.. none came. I kept looking at the server I spoke to, and it's almost as if he was trying to ignore me/ avoid making eye contact. I finally after patiently waiting and still no manager came out, I approached the server and asked if he was going to get the manager, or if he just wanted me to tell him. So I ended up just telling the server, and he responded, "Oh well we sent someone to the bathroom already and they didn't see anything." and I responded, "oh really? because here is the photo proof. and I can tell you exactly where it's laying." What's really poor service and disappointing is that instead of just being like, "I sent someone back there and we didn't see anything, but we apologize for that experience and we will look into it more and making sure we better attend to our restrooms..." they kinda brushed it off like, "oh well, we didn't see one, so no there's no cockroaches here.." I insulted because it was like they were saying or making it seem like I was making it up. but no I have picture proof.. and I would post this kinda stuff unless it was true. I even said to the server, I like the food here and I like coming here, but I cannot continue to come back if you guys don't care about your bathrooms and the cockroaches. and honestly the lack of interest in fixing the issue is enough to make me want to never come back. There's plenty of good pho and Viet food in this city. This is the last time Pho So 1 will see me, my business, and those I associate with.3.5 starsPho So 1 is one of our two Pho spots when we visit Las Vegas. The restaurant is located in Chinatown - not too far off the strip. This particular pho restaurant is located inside a plaza with the Asian supermarket.Pho Tai Nam Gan Sach (7.99): Rare steak, well done flank, brisket, tendon, and tripe. Good amount of meat and soup inside my bowl. Broth wasn't as flavorful as it once used to be..Weekends are normally packed during peak times. We were seated right away but it took a while for our food to come out.
Native Grill & Wings=I don't know how people can eat here. The food is all grease and fat. The grease in which they deep fry everything is 'off' I think - like they haven't changed it out since the 1980s... everything tastes the same and not in a good way. In fact, everything about this place is like a blast from the past - it's like walking into a museum featuring restaurant cliches from 25 years ago.I felt dirty and greasy just walking into the joint. The entire place is covered in a layer of film that's neither sticky nor slimy, but truly disturbing. The smells emanating from this place both inside and out are all pretty offensive too. The quality of the ingredients used is all very low. I wouldn't ever recommend coming here to eat. We sampled quite a few different items and they were all vile and made me both regret their consumption and consider regurgitation. The sliders were a joke - how do you make greasy bread? Fries are made more of oil than potato. Pizza puffs are basically a twist on a mozzarella stick only wetter and less healthy (however healthy deep fried cheese could be).  There was one saving grace though - the salads seem to be decent. I won't be returning though.
Claim Jumper=I used to come here when I wanted a free meal, because they screw up your meal everytime. They literally comp meals left and right. I went there with friends they got an ore cart (which is a whole dried out carcass) and we got a chicken. They came out soo dry.I mean like dry dry. Like it was beef and chicken crackers. The waiter came over and said he would comp it and he could see how badly dry it was. Then he said free dessert.So we naturally each ordered our own personal dessert :)My mom went there and there was a waiter some how broke a glass on her lap. Dont ask how that happend but they tried to giver her a free Claim Jumper shirt!!!!My mom was like Wtf! you jus ruined an expensive shirt and I have glassshards in my arms and legs. So they gave her a free meal and a $100 gift card.The french onion soup was all I used to get there before I was aware what was in food. I cant vouch for whats in there, but it doesnt matter anyway the food is bad.They are really really accomodating but I think its because they are used to fucking up all the time. If you want a free mediocre meal, come here.
Omelet House=What a refreshing change of pace. Have car, will travel and find more interesting food. The Omelet House reminded me of some of my favorite diners. Little hole-in-the-wall places that have been doing their thing for decades. Long list of omelets with silly names and unapologetically dated décor with knotty pine walls. Not far from the glitz of the Strip, we found people of all ages from bikers to college kids tucking into piles of food. It felt like a glimpse of the real Vegas.Their standard 'O-Boy Omelets' are made with SIX EGGS! Totally insane. We ordered 'Baby Omelets' made with three eggs for a little bit less money since there is no point having leftovers when you're on vacation. For choice of bread, my favorite was the pumpkin bread served piping hot. The thinly sliced side of potatoes were on the verge of being potato chips and just as addictive.I enjoyed The Guac, but had plate envy after I tasted Mr. K's Cowboy Special (chili, cheese and onions) and kept going back for more. This isn't the best place in the world, but I am tempted to give it five stars because it is just what the doctor ordered. But, the coffee is weak (even though the refills were plentiful) and I've had better versions of this style of cooking elsewhere. Still, damn fine.I just love this place! I have been eating here since I was a wee little girl. I love taking people here who haven't been which is usually someone who has moved here from somewhere else because what true native hasn't eaten here?! When family comes to town this is my go-to place to go out for breakfast.I can't go and not get an order of "Fried Zucchini Sticks". They are the best I have ever had! They come in a half or full order and you can get cheese sauce or ranch or both for dipping. If you haven't tried them yet please do! I always get the "Green Hornet". It has avocado and cheese and tomatoes. I am notorious for it and just can't change it but do take a bite off my families plates hehe!Just so you know, the omelets are made with 6 eggs so if you don't think you can eat that much you can just ask for a "baby" and they will make it with 3 eggs. They also give you a little off the cost for using less eggs I think it is like 75 cents or something. The spuds are so good too. I usually ask for them with no salt and love to dip them in ranch dressing.The lines can be long but you don't wait for long and the wait is more then worth it! This last visit we waited maybe 5 minutes. They are only open for breakfast & lunch. During the week it isn't as hectic as trying to eat at Omelet House on the weekends but still consistent.Our first visit to the Omelet House and I am sure happy we went! We were in the mood for breakfast so Omelets we got as that is what they are famous for! I decided on the "Mile High City" which is basically a Denver Omelet, ham, onions and bell pepper and it was delicious. The side I ordered that came with my meal was the fresh baked walnut banana cake, mmmm so hot and flavorful! I like that they have other choices than the typical option for toast.My boyfriend got the "Bugsy Siegel" which was very tasty, generous chunks of moist roast beef, Italian red sauce, sour cream and jack cheese! The Omelets are huge to say the least, I think the Server said 7 eggs? I took a bite of his Omelet not really sure if I would like that combination however it blew my mind it was so damn good!The portions are generous, the prices reasonable for what you get! They even have a coupon in the Entertainment book for $7.00 off. We love to eat out and save money so that was a nice added bonus, I am just shocked they have a discount coupon with how big their portions are! It did the job it got us to try a new breakfast place that really delighted our taste buds! We will be back for sure!My only dislike is that they pair their Omelets with homemade thin potato chips instead of hashed browns or Country style potatoes. The homemade chips I might like better paired with a sandwich for lunch rather than a breakfast omelet. That was just the opinion of my boyfriend and I. We will ask next time if there is a substitution option available instead of the chips. The service is Amazing, good old fashioned kindness at this restaurant and is very comfortable as it has a Country thrift store theme with all of the decorations on the walls.I woke from my Venetian slumber hungry and thought where can I get a good AM meal that will not leave me wanting throught the rest of the day. So I Yelped and  the Omlet House was the first to pop up on the radar that wasn't a new kid on the block.  If this were a truck stop the economy would seriously slow down to a crawl.This is the real deal. A local big boy breakfast establishment that has been dishing out the goods for almost 35 years.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Qc0l8rZ3nvrcERitgxu8XA?select=x0qFaEDDU9rjoIY0c8WQsw#6zAZ_w1PQ4sThfUhAH2ZLA   You are in Country royalty as Presidents and kings have dined here.  http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2003/Feb-18-Tue-2003/news/20702658.html   http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Qc0l8rZ3nvrcERitgxu8XA?select=x0qFaEDDU9rjoIY0c8WQsw#y2tBxR3WW0bxKh_zW0z3igThis is my kind of family run mom & pop shop.

But this is just a decoy, the real country goodness is in the menu and on the plate here at the Omelet House. With 39 lumberjack sized 6 egg omelets on its menu including the #33 &1/3 Flatlander Special that includes :Raw Liver, Parsnips, Peanut Butter, Organically grown Black Jelly Beans, Sauteed Grunion Lips (2), Gardenia Petals and topped with Mint Ice Cream (Subject to when the Grunion are running.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Qc0l8rZ3nvrcERitgxu8XA?select=x0qFaEDDU9rjoIY0c8WQsw#EiX9sk-Ft9an7KqO2NRYaQIn addition to omelets they of course serve large portions of other breakfast and lunch favorites http://www.omelethouse.net/Menus/Charleston%20Omlet%20House%20Lg.pdf  and a great cup of coffee.A great menu with a sense of humor!

It's tucked away in some tiny mall, out of the way, and completely unassuming.  Inside, the place is surprisingly HUGE, and very homey.  You can tell the place has been there for a while.For starters, we got hooked up with a nice slice of pumpkin bread.  It's not overly sweet, but it has a nice amount of spice to make it incredibly tasty.  Then the meal came.  The missus got chicken fried steak, and it was delicious.  I got lobster eggs benedict.  Honestly, I was expecting something lame and wimpy, as every restaurant thinks a few little sprinkles of shredded lobster here and there suffices in any related meal.What I got was CHUNKS.  Big, wonderful chunks of tasty sweet lobster on both parts, and the entire experience was just awesome.  I more than got what I paid for.Prices are great, service is fast, the staff is friendly, and the wait time to be seated was surprisingly short.  It was nice to eat in  place that had a little personality, and you could tell they've been around for a while.  After eating breakfast there, I could see why.This weekend, "whims" paid off, and I have a new place to frequent.  It's nice to know that I can still find "new" things in the neighborhood.Recommended.Omelet House rocks! Over 30 different and unique varieties on the menu, all with clever names, a gut-busting size, and crazy-low prices! Even the varieties with fancy fillings like asparagus and lobster are still around $11, and the sheer size makes them more than shareable!THE SPARTACUS: Asparagus, mushrooms, and cheddar, with cheese sauce on the side. You wouldn't think to combine a classy veggie like asparagus with the white trash favorite condiment of nacho cheese, but it works! Even without a protein this packs a punch, if you can eat the whole thing, it'll fill you up all day!CHILI VERDE OMELET: pork, green chile sauce, and jack cheese. It's just slightly spicy, super meaty, and full of flavor. The green sauce is done well here, and you can add on various hot sauces at the table if you need extra heat.SIDES: Omelets come with a bread choice and "Rip Taylor's favorite spuds", which are house-made potato chips, and they're pretty decent. Good mix of soggy and crisp potato slices to pick out the kind you prefer, but I wish they were seasoned better. Of your bread options, the Pumpkin Nut Bread is off the chain. Get it.Service was attentive throughout, the whole staff hustled to flip tables and help each other out. Interior is bigger than the exterior suggests, and it's decorated country-style with homey knick-knacks and antique furniture. Definitely coming back to this spot, gotta try their (current featured special) chicken fried steak omelet (with gravy inside!) on my next visit.Wack is the word that comes to mind from my experience here. Walking in this place is country cute and felt like an old grandmas home, I enjoyed the very cozy atmosphere. As we sat down we ordered two orange juices and as they were brought over by a young kid they both slipped out of his hands (maybe because he was attempting to carry 2 waters & 2 juices at the same time). All 4 drinks landed on my lap...down my legs and into my ballerina flats. What a way to start a Sunday morning off! FML!After basically washing my ass & legs in the bathroom and my ballerina flats now squishy from taking a full bath I was pretty bummed. I decided to stay because this place was bookmarked forever & I was really hungry for some great breakfast food. I need to also point out everyone apologized & the manager came over & said my breakfast was on him. That helped but now I'm sitting here soaking wet. We ordered banana nut & pumpkin bread which were both great. I ordered a Black Forest ham omelet & it was massive. Unfortunately I took a few bites & was over it. The entire thing was in a puddle of grease & butter and there must have been a pound of Swiss cheese on this thing. Just a bunch of thick wads of cheese everywhere. So gross and it felt like a heart attack on a plate, no thanks. My man did enjoy his polish sausage & eggs and luckily my plate was free because it would have really sucked to pay for that.Here's the worse part. After getting 4 cups spilled directly onto my lap they didn't charge me for my food however they charged my man for his and guess what, they also charged us for the drinks. What a joke. I could definitely get over the accident but to be known for the omelette's here and to have one of the shittiest omelette's I've ever had was too much. Next time when you spill anything on your customers, just a piece of advice DON'T CHARGE THEM for what was spilled on them. Common sense...
Giant Hamburgers=I'm gonna go against the grain here and recommend something on their menu no one seems to say anything about. The hot dogs.What's that you say? Why eat the hot dogs at a place called Giant Hamburger? Because they use the best all beef dogs around. I don't know where they get them from, and quite frankly, I don't care because they're big and delicious. This isn't a shriveled up little wiener you find as a side item at most places, it's a big juicy 1/4 lb dog. Pair that up with always crispy and tasty fries and you have yourself a meal. I've also had their hamburgers and they are as delicious as they say they are, but the home style breakfasts are a favorite for us. Eggs cooked to order, sausage, bacon, or ham, on the side with hash-browns, OJ, toast, and an orange wedge to sweeten the deal. A friend took me here 6 years ago and I have become a regular ever since. Oscar knows us by name and is a great guy. Highly recommended.It's cash only, and decent price for the amount you get. We usually get out of there for around $12-14 for the two of us. This place is built in the old diner style with booths, small tables in the aisles, and a counter lined with barstools. If you go in the off hours, it's generally easy to find a place to sit, but the place is usually packed during regular breakfast, lunch, and dinner hours. (Side note: they'll make breakfast anytime of the day you want it. I know this because my girl had a craving for their french fries and french toast at 8PM one night... yeah. And she's not even French. ;) )I love this place, and if you went there, you would love it too.One of the (many) things I miss about Southern California are the (usually)Charbroiled Burger spots that blanket the entire area from Ventura down to San Diego:  Legends like the o.g. Astro Burger, Galaxy Burger, Douglas Burger, Tam's, etc.   These burger joints served awesome burgers, great grilled sandwiches (Patty Melts, anybody?), and almost always, a great, greasy breakfast on the cheap.  Oh, and they made their food proper.... American Cheese on all burgers and sandwiches, thousand island on the burgers, no up charge for grilled onions, yadda-yadda-yadda, you get the point.  Sadly, AZ seriously lacks in these types of establishments.Enter Giant Hamburgers.  While their burgers aren't charbroiled, they're wonderful.  Their Grilled Ham and Cheese is out of this world (just remember to order it "plain" with only the ham and cheese on buttery, grilled sourdough... YUM!).  Try an open-faced chili burger, or maybe even a gardenburger, if you like retarded shit.  Their Chili-Cheese fries are a real treat, especially since they melt a few slices of American Cheese on top instead of that bullshit cheddar some places use.  Thirsty for something sweet?  Try a hand-made, uber thick shake.  Still hungry after all that?  Have a jumbo slice of homemade pie.Wait!  What if it's 9am and your stomach's not ready for Chili Cheese Fries?  No problem, their breakfasts will surely satisfy any cravings you might have.  Sold as a Single, Double, or Triple, their egg combos come with eggs, hash browns, toast, and your choice of chorizo, ham, sausage, hamburger patty, bacon, or steak for an additional charge.  Don't want eggs?  No problem, they've got pancakes and the best looking biscuit and gravy plate I've seen in years.You order at the counter and they bring the food out to you as you're chillin' in 50's-style booths enjoying the music and ambiance of an old school diner.  The place is always busy and the staff is always very friendly, but not in an overly friendly, obnoxious way.  A Triple breakfast plate will set you back about $8 with tax.  Burger, fries, and a drink will get you for about the same.  They are more than willing to substitute or customize your order however you want it, usually at no charge.  You will enjoy this place, trust me.Delicious burgers, great service, what else can you ask for??? Prices are fair, it's located on the corner of broadway and Lindsay tucked away in between a subway and a massage parlor. Thought I already reviewed this place before but here it goes...I ordered a double cheeseburger w/ onions, jalapeños and bacon. Delish! Everything worked together in a symphony of flavor. The meat to bun ratio was perfect, and the fries were crisp and fresh. My daughters got a hotdog each and both finished theirs in record time! Hubby got a plain double cheeseburger and he loves the charbroiled flavor. We called in our order and it was ready in 10 mins and no mistakes on our order. Thumbs up!!Giant Burger is a good+ hamburger.  I could never give it 5 stars, as it is a typical diner burger; but, for what it is, it is very good.When I saw the cook slap the patty down, I automatically thought this was going to be a cheap, frozen, ground beef patty.  Wow, I was definitely wrong.  I asked for the burger to be cooked med-rare, and although quite thin, it came out as ordered.  The meat was definitely not frozen, I could sure taste the freshness of the meat with the fist bite.Cheese options are limited (american / swiss).  Again, typical diner burger, just better quality. I recommend trying Giant Burger is you are in the mood for a standard, not fancy, high quality burger.
Organ Stop Pizza=Organ Stop is like a trip down memory lane. Our family used to go a very looooong time ago, in the early 80's, when they were located in far West Mesa. As a child I  can remember this giant organ bursting out of the ground like magic. As it towered over the audience, complete with lights and sounds I was mesmerized by its beauty. It's a childhood memory that is seared into my brain. I'm sure many of the children that go will find it truly magical. The food is not what you go for, it is the entertainment and novelty of seeing this incredible organ being played, and the experience of enjoying something that you won't find many other places. *****PLEASE NOTE******They DO NOT accept credit cards!!! Cash or check only. There is an ATM on site if you forget this.This place really is quite special. It's a natural tourist trap, so expect to see plenty of pasty, obnoxious Canadians and so forth, but from what I hear it is a sort of local landmark. I went for my birthday this year at the recommendation of a few work friends, and I had an incredible time. The pizza gets alot of flack, apparently, but I enjoyed it just fine. It's not likely to be mistaken for gourmet brick-oven pizza that snobs in Sedona eat, but it's still rather good from what I remember.The organ was incredible. Gigantic. Played by a really good musician. The song selection is pretty universal, showtunes and the like, but just seeing the thing in action is remarkable. I highly recommend it. Now stop bashing the pizza!Such a fun bit of Americana! A friend had his birthday celebration here and  I must say that it was quite the entertaining experience. Food's OK and not too badly priced, considering the entertainment that comes with it; and, $2 mugs of beer on tap ... yes!The Wurlitzer was impressive: around 6000 pipes and 4 large turbine blowers make it one of the largest theater organs in the world. The pipes themselves, as well as accessory instruments - piano, percussion instruments, even a mechanical quacking duck - are scattered around the interior of the building and displayed and lit to become part of a grand light and sound show. I thoroughly enjoyed the organist's performance, which ranged from folk to pop (including adventure and sci-fi movie themes) to classical pieces. The performance ends with a sing-along.Pretty much all ages are represented in the customer demographic, from toddlers to seniors, but leaning heavily toward family groups. Kids definitely love the place, as I saw many of them break away from their families to go beside the organ platform and spontaneously dance to the music.CASH ONLY, PRICEY, LEAVE IT FOR THE TOURIST!Some friends wanted to eat here, because their senior parents love this place and would be dining with us. So we met friends and senior parents here for pizza. Let me just say this was not my thing. CRAZY setup, you wait in a line and order your pizza. Then you go wait in a second line to order your beverages (paying separately). Then go sit at school cafeteria tables, in a VERY crowded, VERY loud dining room. Can't talk to anyone, the music is deafening. Packed WALL TO WALL with senior citizens. Which explains the taste.Now I've had Chicago style, New York style, and even California style pizza. But this pizza is Nursing Home-Hospital style pizza; it's not good, taste a little better than a frozen Red Baron.Organ music is good, would be better if not SO loud. Would be better if you only waited in one line for food and drinks and paid for them together. If these two things were different, I'd say worth a trip in for nostalgic reasons. Oh and it's CASH ONLY. So stop by the atm and pull out plenty, it's also pricey!!!Stay with me, this might get confusing for ya, my daughter (3rd oldest) was in town for the weekend for a visit and my other daughter (2nd oldest) said we should go somewhere where it doesn't matter how loud the kids get, where it's fun and entertains them and allow us to visit and for others to join us, I told her I had my fill of Peter Piper Pizza for the year not going there, she said Mom lets go to Organ Stop Pizza, I laughed, no really I laughed, Organ Stop has never been on my list of places to go and its sort of a running joke on YT,  my daughter then told me that she has been before and my grandson loves it.  Come to find out, most of my kids (have 4 total and not so much on the kid side anymore ranging frm 22 to 17) have been to Organ Stop and do enjoy it. (I fully believe they live a secret life when my eyes were closed, I thought they were out running the streets, but nope it was hanging out at Organ Stop haha) So Organ Stop Pizza was the place picked, time to meet up was a Friday night at 6:30pm. Off we wentWe got there a little before 6:30 because wanted to make sure to get tables and set up for everyone, and damn the parking lot is FULL, Yep I was shocked! Didn't know it was such a hot spot to go to.  Prior to coming my (2nd oldest) daughter told me to find tables on the 1st floor (1st floor??? WTH this is a pizza joint right??? 2 floors?) And after walking in I saw what she meant. When you 1st walk in you are facing the menu board to order pizza, I'll get back to that, but if you go to your right you will see the dining room, and low and behold it has 2 floors of seating. 1st floor was completely filled up, so I went upstairs and found us 2 long tables.  Then I stopped and really looked around. 1st observation, DAMN THAT'S A HUGE ORGAN, and not so much a HUGE ORGAN, it's the pipes, they are in the walls, and all over, is this a sound proof building? Can you hear it on the street??  2nd, this must have been an old church, that's the feeling it gives from the 2 floors and seating arrangements.   I have to say hearing scores of the Phantom of the Opera played on that bad ass organ sounded amazing and the light show that went with it, I liked it. Ok like I said when you 1st walk in you are faced with ordering your pizza. This is where the place loses points, it's all scattered. In one place you order your pizza and pay for it, then get into another line, order your salad and pay for it, then get into another line for drinks and pay for it.  Why can't it be one stop shopping experience?  Oh and everything is CASH ONLY.  I ordered 1 large Hawaiian, 1 Large Combination, 1 medium Spicy Italian for 54 bucks, then ordered 3 pitchers of soda (MT Dew, Root beer, Sierra Mist) for 15 bucks. I tried the Hawaiian & Combination, the Hawaiian had chopped ham throughout the pizza and good amount of pineapple, the combo pizza wasn't lacking the bell peppers, for that's all I remember from it, but the pizza itself was not that great, it's like Little Creasers pizza but with a car dealership sticker price. Do I feel like I got my money's worth? No not really, but what I did get was a meal with all 4 of my kids, 3 of my grandkids, tons of family and friends, some laughter and smiles, and that right there is what counts.   Return factor though is really low.I finally know the irony behind "Phoenix's most romantic restaurant." If you've ever had the pleasure of asking Yelp Talkers for a suggestion on where to take a first date, second date, anniversary date, valentines date, or date of any type where romance is foremost on your list - you may have incidentally ended up here dressed in your best duds. I fortunately, didn't fall into that particular trap, I did however, show up here cause a friend had some family in town and invited us all out to dine with her.What fun, I thought, I'll finally get to see what all the hubbaloo is about, I finally get to experience romance at it's finest. Secretly, I never really checked the place out at all, I didn't read about it, I had no real clue as to what this place was. I always just assumed it was some weird mixture of pizza joint, strip club, and themed in hospital recovery room and left it at that. Boy was I wrong, and not necessarily in a good way. I will say that this is certainly an experience, one that you'll not have anywhere else, in town or out of town, except maybe unless there's another organ stop pizza somewhere. Touting the worlds largest Wurlitzer pipe organ, the name finally makes sense. Organ has nothing to do with the male organ, nothing to do with greasy pizza stopping your organs as you eat it, nothing to do with stripping, boy was I wrong, but I'm still not sure if I was wrong in a good way or bad.Either way you 'slice' it, the pizza here is less than mediocre, but the ambiance! The ambiance less than makes up for the mediocre pizza. The thrill of pipe organs lasts only so long, and I think I clocked it at about 3 minutes and 47 seconds, but the kids all seemed to love it. I guess if you've got kids, feel like seeing the worlds largest Wurlitzer in action and in all it's glory, then you know where to go this Friday.So Phoenix Yelpers, I hope I left you with some insight into Organ Stop Pizza and hopefully you don't get trapped in the age old Phoenix Yelp Talk question of "Where's the most romantic place to take your girl?" because unwittingly, you'll be sent here.Happy Yelping Phoenix!If you are into sitting inside of a giant pipe organ while being pounded with renditions of every show tune, movie soundtrack, patriotic song, service song or favorite from the past century, then this is the place for you.  You don't even need your hearing aids.Biggest organ in the world, only two dozen people on the planet capable of playing it, has every instrument sound known to mankind (and then some) and the organist takes requests.  This place seems to be a favorite with the elderly crowd for the reasons stated.For me it was loud.  And I'm hearing impaired.  I even took my hearing aids out and it was still loud.Oh, and they serve pizza, salad, beer, soda and have a sundae bar.  I had the pizza, it wasn't bad if you count frozen pizza as delicious.  The salad greens were fresh and industrial quality, the dressings were the big four, Blue Cheese, French, Ranch and Italian, all apparently coming from a jug.  maybe the same jug - as I tried the ranch and the blue cheese and there was no discernible difference other than the blue cheese had some soft lumps of something in it.  The iced tea was watery and instant, but made recently. If you have never eaten a tasteless salad and mediocre pizza washed down with watery beverages while being pounded by organ style show tunes sound, sitting at cafeteria-style tables, then you gotta try this place.  If you go back it's your own damn fault.
Goldie's Neighborhood Sports Cafe=I love Goldies! Its like the "Cheers" of Scottsdale, but everybody doesn't know my name there yet.  Gotta try the Goldaritas. Great place for happy hour, and to watch a game. Can get crowded, hard to find a seat at the bar. Tip- pretty decent buffalo wings
Sweet Tomatoes=I've become a fan of Sweet Tomatoes.  This location is the 2nd location I've dined at within the past 2 months.  I love the huge Salad Bar and the Bread station.  However, the discovery of the Froyo station was the find of the day!  AYCE Salad, Bread, and Froyo?!  I can deal with that!**Hint** - Google "Sweet Tomatoes Coupons" and you'll find a ton of coupons on the web to use for discounted prices.  I took the family here for dinner and we only paid $7.99 each with the coupon....awesome!Return Factor - 100%This place has not MOVED! It is just changed names back to Sweet Tomatoes again.OK, here is a word to the wise. If it is not broken ,do not fix it.This was one of our favorite Sweet Tomatoes to go to. We really liked it , plus it was close  by.Then they changed it to Test Kitchen or something, and it flopped big time.So now they have changed it all back to Sweet Tomatoes, or so they say!We came here last night for dinner. We were pretty excited because, we really liked Sweet Tomatoes.Well, now it looks very industrial. The lovely plants that are growing outside on the planters are all starting to die. This is an indication of what is going on inside.Everything is tin now. TIn strays and ice cream bowls and all the containers they put the soup and other items in to. Nothing looks like it used to. It all looks cheap, like they have changed the ingrediants.Because, it certainly tastes like they have.They have glass glasses now,which I do like better than the plastic.The Pasta looks aweful, we could not even try it. It just looked bad.The salad was good, but they have taken away things like the chickpeas and the kidney beans. In its place they have a 3 bean salad type thing.They did still have sunflower seeds and raisins  which  is good,as well as the Joan's Brocili dish.But, even the soup seems differant. The lemon Orzo tasted like fake flavors and hardly any chicken. The Chili was a little better with more meat. But, I have to say I was in no way impressed.They do not even have real Butter anymore. It is margarine and flavored Butter, I just want the real thing.  What they were presenting as Ice Cream was not, More like an Ice Milk that had an artificial taste to eat.No one ever came to clear a single dish away from our table. The staff used to be so good about that. Maybe most of them have left because, it has all changed and they are losing money as well. With no so much tipping.I can honestly say we will never be back to this location,if it stays as it is. I guess we will drive out to Phoenix, or Awahtukkee. We used to go to Sweet Toms once a week.But, not know. The have ruined it.Oh I forgot to mention that they now serveAlcohol. I just do not see why that is needed at all. This is suppose to be healthy dining.I went to Sweet Tomatoes last night at the Scottsdale location.  And it's not even worth reviewing that location because it is so normal.  There is nothing particularly good about it, nor bad about it.  But THIS location, THIS location has things worth mentioning. And so here I  go:1) They have a super soda machine that makes 100 flavors. I always do the diet mellow yellow grape.2) They have abnormally fancy plates.3) They have cottage cheese at the salad bar. I like cottage cheese.4) They have chocolate (or sometimes strawberry) mousse at the salad bar. Other Sweet Tomatoes have this as well, but they put it by the ice cream, alluding that it is a dessert.  Moving the mousse to the salad bar implies that it is meant to be eaten with your salad.  CHOCOLATE MOUSSE FOR DINNER. I should just end this review right here.5) They serve beer.6) They serve meat on wooden sticks (but you have to pay more).7) They changed their corn muffins into delicate little corn cakes.8) It is by a very interesting pond that has an abundance of turtles. One day, they make take over the world.4 Stars? Put down the bongs everyone, come back to reality and look at what you're giving 4 Stars to. Sweet Tomatoes is what  happens when a bean counter accountant looks at a Golden Corral or Sizzler type salad bar and says what if we could build a restaurant around just the salad bar with a few non-steak extras thrown in to spiff it up? Imagine the cash we'll rake in. Hello Sysco, I want your cheapest product line....If you haven't got my point by now you never will. Seriously, it's freakin cafeteria style food. I don't know about you but I have very bad memories of school cafeteria food. So handing me a tray and sending me down the line to pick out my choices brings not so good flashbacks. In this case of Sweet Tomatoes you get picked over greens, a bunch of Sysco cheapest product possible bulk food service toppings, more bulk food type salad dressing, and all set in a decor that is circa 2010 but yet would not feel out of place in 1982. This is a place where I had an OMG WTF was I thinking moment when I tried to be polite to the people I was with and choke it down.Toss in staff that are slow to clean the place up, screaming kids, and ho-hum bakery offerings and I see absolutely no reason to think of turning off Stephanie Street into a tight, usually packed parking lot to come here again. 4 Stars? Maybe if someone slipped me special brownies and I had the worst case of the munchies ever. Otherwise it's not only no but hell no. I love salad but every time I think it's a pain in the rear to round up all the ingredients I like for mine I just think of this place. I won't grumble when I go to the store and achieve a sneeze guard free salad experience after coming here. Oh and this is another place where you'll be glad to know there's CVS and Walgreens locations close by for all of your upset stomach needs.This location of sweet tomatoes is very favorable to me.  Located on the corner of Stephanie and Warm Springs, it's easy to find.   You'll notice there isn't a plenitude of parking but there isnt really any space to expand.  The restaurant has been newly updated.  New floors, paint, dishes and decor.  The salad bar is your first stop before paying.  Several pre-made salads are available if you don't want to build one.  The toppings are abundant in a clean buffet area.  After paying you can then visit the soup/pasta/bread area.  The specialties change from month to month depending on what is in season.  Leave room for dessert as well! Ice cream, pudding and dessert breads are there for your enjoyment! If you sign up on their email list, you can get pretty good coupons.  Otherwise just look one up on your phone before heading in.  They are more than happy to scan a coupon from your phone.  As far as buffets go, I don't feel as guilty for eating at this one.
Great Wall Buffet=Where do you go when you are extremely hungry, have a yen for asian food and only have $13 to spend?  As long as you don't mind the sparse and tacky feel of being in a place that looks like it used to be a dime store in it's prior life then The Great Wall could just be the place.Hey, ambience costs more.  The buffet is $9.95; drinks (soda, milk, tea) is extra.  The waitresses are very attentive and refill drinks without being asked at no additional charge.Come when they first open.  You may have to wait a few minutes for them to finish bringing out all the food but it's worth the wait.  At least you will have first pickings and it's all fresh.Lots of dim sum in addition to what you expect to see at Panda.  They throw in a little Japanese tempura and a little Thai just for good measure.  All the dishes are marked clearly and indicate whether it's hot or spicy.  Personally, I am partial to the baby octopuss, crab puffs and baos.  For the kiddies there is some "American" fare like salad, jello and egads, chicken nuggets.It's kinda funny really, but if you are not picky, what the heck.This is not gourmet by any means, but they won't try to chase you out and they are kid friendly.If buffet is not your "thing" they do have a regular menu, but why bother?
Guido's Chicago Meat & Deli=I have eaten at Guido's several times over the past few years and was always impressed with the food, but not so much with the service. Just recently, we visited again and we were so DISGUSTED with how bad the service was that we didn't even stay and eat this time.For example, the waitress never came to our table initially. We had to go the front of the restaurant to try and place an order. This did not work, as we were told to go back and sit down and wait some more. I must also say that as we were waiting in line, the owner, I  presume, ignored us and spoke with some customers behind us in line, putting their orders in immediately. So, in the end, we waited a bit more at our table and then got up and left. Even though the service has tended to be slow and rather inattentive in the past, we have never experienced this level of rudeness before. We will not be back.
El Paso Bar-B-Que Company=Okay I know you aren't going to believe me but I had a tasty lunch at EL Paso Bar B QUe today..Yes, I know it's kind of a chain ...but I think I might go back. You still don't believe me ,do you? My  co-teacher friend and I went  out for lunch today during our first week back at school , before the kids start. Our school is close to El Paso  and BBQ sounded filling for lunch. We don't get to leave for lunch during the school year so it's kind of a last chance deal.We were greeted by a host who had a nice calm style and quickly seated us. The smell of smoked meats had me the minute we walked in .I  am a sucker for the smell of smoked meat . My previous dining experience  had been terrible here but I was reassured by the great host and the fabulous smell that this might be a better meal than last time.  Waitress was courteous , speedy and didn't mess around trying to be overly friendly which I liked.  She promptly brought us our drinks and corn bread muffins which tasted nice according to my friend. I ordered the Brisket lunch  which came with my choice of two sides. There were many choices but I settles on coleslaw and sweet potatoes fries. The portion of the brisket was way more than enough served with a sweet BBQ sauce. Lots of  good taste. Not earth shaking but solid and worth the money . Coleslaw was the way I like it not to greasy, lightly sweet and crunchy. The sweet potato fries were a nice extra, not highly seasoned but not greasy either. They were a good accompaniment  to the sweetness of the sauce. My friend had the turkey wrap which looked great and was grilled ,interesting... While this is not the best BBQ in the city , the strong points may be the good ,fast lunchtime service I experienced today . The food was tasty and not expensive considering the time it takes to smoke and cook brisket.  Great place to take mom and dad for BBQ or the family after church on Sunday.  Grandma nd Grandpa will love it! Considering its proximity to a Super Target and my work , I can see it being a place totake  the family for dinner when I have a busy day and have to go back to school at night for meetings.Also noted they had a large Patio like room  that would be great for large groups...It always seems like when you had something for along time you take it for granted , then it is taken away and you miss it. So it is with El Paso , I haven't always liked El Paso as much as the last two times I was there. The last two times great food and service.Great conversation with the Manager, then bam the doors are closed. Talked to a friend in the know who had done charity events with them and he says that the chain has been hurting and the two AZ locations were the only two left. They say there is a small chance they may reopen but it doesn't look good.  Fair thee well El Paso , I barely knew you.
Aloha Kitchen=You know that hole-in-the-wall Mexican/Chinese/Italian/Indian/Etc place you love that has pretty solid food and reasonable prices, the people are friendly and the decor is...hole-in-the-wall?Well, add Aloha Kitchen to the list as your hole-in-the-wall Hawaiian place.  The are friendly, relatively fast, priced for the beer budget and quite tasty indeed.Like a ripe pineapple ready to be eaten, Aloha Kitchen, um, Aloha Kitchen...I really have no idea where to go with the pineapple setup there.  The whole pineapple thing just seemed apropos to the Hawaiian theme and, oh well.Try it, you'll like it.
Los Favoritos=I am ashamed...ashamed to say I had the best carne asada fries last weekend, and it was NOT in San Diego. There are a lot of taco shops in Chandler. Apparently, word is they are not very good, except for Los Favoritos. I scoffed. My San-Diego-friends-now-residing-in-AZ kept trying to convince me how good it was. I scoffed again. HA! Finally, I decided to go, just to compare. What a snob.Looks like every other taco shop I've been to, maybe a little cleaner. Carne Asada fries is not on the menu, so you have to ask for it. I opened up that styrofoam box, and it was pretty. No, really. I haven't had carne asada fries that good...ever...so far...Recommendations:Chicken rolled tacos, quesadilla, pretty much carne asada anything.Sigh.  The taco plate was skimpy and bland.  I don't mind getting a small portion, but don't charge me $8.21 for it.Get ready to drench your flavor-challenged tacos in hot sauce.  Maybe try a burrito instead?One word: disappointing.This place is usually infested with high schoolers and that makes me stressed.  Have I become a bitter old lady?  Bah hambug!Anyways, I've been coming here for years.  I was introduced to this place some time during my ASU days by some guys I use to hang with.  While their food might not be traditional, I always enjoy my meal.  The place is decorated sparingly and the tables aren't the cleanliest [high school hangout, remember?], the portions are great for the price you pay.  I usually get the carne asada burrito combo,the California burrito combo, or the shrimp burrito.  You get moist fluffy rice, decent refried beans, and a giant [not Chipotle giant or anything but a good size] burrito for the combo.  I love how they don't pack their burritos with cheap "filler" ingredients.  They seriously stuff your burrito with a ton of flavorful meat!I'll probably keep coming back for many years to come when I need me some Americanized-Mexican eats although I rather take my food to-go because high schoolers are the bane of my existence.  Wee!  If only their red sauce was spicier...
Fleming's Prime Steakhouse & Wine Bar=I have to say that I fought going here tonight for dinner. I mean, I am in Arizona and there are Fleming's restaurants in California, so like any good yelper of course I'm going to want to experience the best and most unique restaurants that Arizona has to offer. However, this just so happens to be my brother's favorite restaurant so he won because this was our family's last supper, of sorts, before we leave him by his lonesome in Phoenix. Well off to Fleming's we went and it was fabulous. For a chain restaurant Fleming's does it right; nice decor, impeccable food, excellent service and over 100 different types of wine. Our server was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and the wine list and checked up on us at all the appropriate moments. The additional support wait staff was very attentive so much so that when (like the klutz that I am) spilled the last sip of wine all over myself, he quickly took my sweater to the bathroom where he blotted it with ice water and handed it back to me in a Fleming's handle bag and recommended that I take it to the dry cleaners and ask that they treat it with the spray that removes wine stains. What a sweetheart! We ordered the sweet chili calamari to start along with a bowl of roasted corn chowder soup with lobster, shrimp and potatoes. I ordered the petite fillet mignon cooked medium rare, my bro had the 20 oz steak and my mom had the Mahi Mahi. All of it was amazing. We finished it off with creme brule and our bill was about 2 bills. Overall it was a great experience and I'm glad my brother won this round.My 100th Review~ Dear Fleming's,Thank you for another unforgettable evening of being wined and dined.From the moment I walked in you gave me your undivided attention.In fact I don't think you ever left my side the whole time I was there.My glasses stayed full and the food was splayed out before me in perfect succession. My compliments to the Chef for the flawless preparation of my Sweet Chile Calamari, Corn Chowder with Lobster, Crab and Shrimp, The Mix Grill (Lemon Pepper Mahi Mahi, Poppy seed and Pepper encrusted seared Ahi and Lemon Pepper Scallops), 12oz Filet perfectly rare, the Chipotle Mac and Cheese,  your signature Fleming's potatoes and the cutest accompaniment of "F" shaped butter served with Hot bread.(see pics)Just when I though it couldn't get any better you end my feast with a dish of the most  heavenly creme brulee and chantilly cream I've ever put my lips to,complete with a candle to celebrate my Anniversary! You made me fall in love with you all over again. S.W.A.K!Once upon a time Fleming's was the place culinary dreams are made of, but alas things are a changin'! The last couple times I've visited I was increasingly unimpressed. Just last week I took my husband for his birthday dinner as we do every year. Boy what a let down. Lets start with the raggedy family wearing their beanies and Harley Davidson baseball caps that was seating right in front of me............ Hello Dress Code......Manners......Anyone?? Why did I bother dressing to the nines? I could have worn  my pajamas and nobody would have cared. That right there just made me feel I might as well have went to Black Angus. Now for the waiter who lacked the experience and training to be serving in a fine dining establishment. He was HORRIBLE!!! Unprofessional, Inattentive, and Careless to sum it up. He was so interested in my nationality that he had to ask me my heritage, then made a point to reference something Greek each time he returned to the table.......So Annoying! Not to mention bringing me dirty water and wine glasses, even the little wine decanter they bring your wine in was dirty. Now for my salad, I always order the Fresh Mozzarella and Tomato salad, this time it was apparent they improvised, the mozzarella was not near the quality it usually is and instead of sweet sliced tomatoes and fresh basil it came with chopped grape tomatoes on top of shaved cucumber. (see pics) I really should have complained, but being the Hubby's birthday I wanted to spare him the scene. For my entree I decided on the Chefs Mixed Grill, Petite fillet, Tempura Shrimp and Seared Scallops. Although as always I asked to replace the steak with an extra shrimp and scallop as I don't eat beef. I got a plate of SIX GIANT scallops and three shriveled shrimp. I had to send it back because I was told I was getting Tempura Shrimp and these shrimp were not. They returned it to me quickly but still was overkill on the scallops (see pics) in the pic you cant see the other side of the plate had 3 more scallops. I would have like another shrimp instead. My Hubby's steak was perfect for him, but he too was very disappointed in all the things I've stated above. Now for the biggest let down of all. Normally for Special Occasions they will bring out their signature Creme' Brulee and Chantilly Cream with a candle. NOT ANY MORE! BOO! We got a cheesy little gold box with four tiny, crappy chocolate covered strawberries....Not a Fan. After this experience I'm sorry to say that we will not be going back ever again. They are lucky to be getting these three stars.09/01/10My first, and (so far) only, visit to Fleming's.  I give it 2.5 stars...First thing I noticed was that it was very dark inside- a pet peeve of mine.  Second, the service looked either harried or aloof.  Where were the smiling faces?  It was 4:15 pm, which meant the doors had just opened 15 minutes ago, and there weren't many guests yet waiting to be seated.  (There were about eight people at the bar area.)  I soon met my server, whose cold gaze and unsmiling face already had me thinking maybe this place was not such a good idea.  After studying the menu, I decided I'd try the Prime Burger for $6. I also asked if I could sample a couple of red wines before ordering a glass of one.  I've been to many venues where this is not a problem, and sometimes, when I can't decide, even willingly offered!  This Fleming's location isn't one of these venues.  My query brought about a more negative change of attitude from my server, but I did get to try two very small samples before choosing a glass.While I waited for the burger to arrive, I began to boot up my laptop- thank goodness I brought it, bec. the burger took a long time...  The bar area was filling up fast, and the servers started to look even more agitated that I was starting to wonder what was all the fuss?  Finally, just under 20 minutes later, my beautiful burger arrived.  Huge patty, smothered w/ cheese and topped w/ thick-cut, peppered, and smoked bacon, tomato, onion, lettuce, and a pretzel bun.  The one huge onion ring was a nice touch.  The burger was juicy (cooked to my specified medium), quite substantial, and delicious w/ the cheddar, veggies, and bun.  The thick-cut bacon, however, was so salty, that I had to take the slices off!  I was a bit disappointed, since it was such a hearty portion of bacon.I wouldn't mind having another Prime burger, minus the bacon, for happy hour again, but I'd choose another location. BTW, as I was enjoying the burger, I finally figured out why all the harried faces and the servers' hustle and bustle-- it seemed like everyone in the bar area had chosen the burger!  The table of six in front of me all had burgers... At $6, it's a steal for diners, but perhaps not expensive enough to garner a nice tip?  Hmm... well, not if the servers' attitudes continue to be cold and distant!I came here recently for a special occasion dinner with my office staff and it was very nice.  The restaurant itself is well designed, with muted colors, dark woods and dimmed lighting.  The wait staff was neatly presented in crisp white shirts and clean, black service aprons.  We prearranged for a pre-printed dinner menu that was labeled as being for our party that night.  I thought that it was a nice touch, and I am well aware that it was also a clever cost containment measure since it also kept our staff from wildly ordering off of the regular Fleming's menu.Our servers were all very gracious and attentive and took very good care of our party of about 25.  Our food was all brought out at the same time, which was no small feat on the kitchen's part.  Everyone seemed genuinely happy with their food, I didn't see anyone complaining about anything.  I ordered the petite filet, medium rare, and it was absolutely perfect in every way.  The meat was cooked perfectly and was tender, moist and delicious.  There were various sides served 'family style' raging from buttered corn to asparagus, and they were all very good as well.  As a dessert I ordered crème brulee, and it was deliciously creamy with the perfectly sugar crust on top.  My only complaint about my food, and it is minor, was that the crème brulee wasn't the ice cold temperature that I usually prefer.  I like my crème brulee pre-fired so that it has time to cool off before I eat it.  I don't care for warm custard, but it's purely a personal preference and I still thought the dessert was fantastic.The only other thing I would point out is that many people aren't fans of the a la carte menu system, it can be annoying, and ridiculously expensive, to order every side dish seperately from the main entree.   That said, this was still a great experience in a wonderful restaurant.  I highly recommend it for any special occasion dinner as long as your budget will allow it.I came because AMEX gave me a $40 gift card, but I stayed because I was totes hungry.It was very fancy, from the moment I sashayed my pretty little self in, to the time I was escorted to my white linened table, with their newfangled iPad wine and dessert list.The parmesan crusty loaf was accompanied by both a feta and sundried tomato spreads, but I like Firebird's bolero loaf better.  The water tasted chlorinated though.  I could understand maybe bleach, ya know, for whiter teethOnce again, I chose the wrong venue to sport my lederhosen and ICP mesh half shirt.  This place was popping, at 9:30pm.  It's nice to see the older generation still having date nights... with what appears to be their granddaughters.  :/My waitress, Megan was an old soul and classy delight.  I am nearly transported to the days of old Hollywood, when people had nannies and rode elevators.  This is surely out of my element, but tonight, I'm self medicating, without the alcohol or Mexican quaaludes.The bone in ribeye was near sheer perfection, with a taste that eschewed my typical topping of gefilte fish with cream.  The Thai green beans were a lil spicy, and a lot of fun.  And I'm pretty sure my Spidey senses were tingling thanks to some green Chile in the taters.  You know... PO-TA-TOES... boil em, mash em, stick em in a stewIs it Five Star day or am I just in a good mood?PF Changs...PeiWei...Teneko's...Flemings?How does Fleming's fit in with the whole asian themed restaurant empire thingy that Peter Fleming put together?I don't know...more importantly, I don't care...Fleming's Steakhouse is the best of the lot by my lights:)Does Fleming's make the best steak in town? Well no, the best steak in town comes off my grill, when I'm in the mood to grill:)But I'm not always in the mood to grill my own steak and when I'm not, Flemings consistently puts a very solid medium rare Rib Eye ( with a little salad and a few string fries) right in front of me (along with a couple of well made Grey Goose marti's:)They do it in a friendly style with  exemplary and easy going service in a warm and welcoming atmosphere...lighter décor than some of the very low lit/dark wood/red velvet steakhouses (BTW...not enough light to read the menu doesn't make the steak taste any better:)Flemings has never done me wrong...I have never felt "optimized" like I do at Ruth's Chris...I haven't felt that I overpaid for mediocre food like I do at Morton's or Mastro's...I never feel that I'm out of place when I show up wearing my shorts, sandals and golf shirt (exquisitely tailored, highly expensive shorts, sandals and golf shirt, but nevertheless:)Flemings is a comfortable and pleasant place to grab a steak:)The Beautiful Carin and I wandered over the other evening, intending to take advantage of the current Happy Hour specials (5 items for $6...5 wines, 5 cocktails and five small plates, each priced at $6...all of which are phenomenal, BTW:)But after a couple of well crafted and astonishingly cold marti's, we decided we wanted dinner:)I had the bone in Rib Eye and Carin had the New York Strip (my girl likes her steak:)We split some shoestring potatoes and grilled asparagus:)Everything was essentially perfect...a little too much food, but we took it home and DeeDee continues to believe that we are The Best People Ever:)The next time you're in the mood for steak and you don't feel like heading out to your grill on a balmy 112 degree Scottsdale evening, put on your shorts and golf shirt, slide into your sandals, get comfy in a booth at Flemings and build yourself a $200 credit card bill.Hey, I never said they were cheap...just good!Courtesy of @Shwaag, I dined at Fleming's with @CaymusCabernet, @RussellOnSteak and @MarianOnWine.I should have written this sooner, but this is my 100th review, and I wanted to reserve that spot for this.I attended an Interactive Wine Dinner, which was an amazing event, and I highly recommend attending one.Our evening began with an amuse of Danish Bleu Cheese and Red Onion on Flatbread. The caramelized onion contrasted with the bleu cheese was phenomenal! I think I ate about 7 of them!This was paired with Caymus' 2008 Conundrum; a blend of Napa and central coast varietals. This was my first experience with a blended white, and I am a fan! Vanilla, melon, pear, mild acidity, really amazing.The combination of the sweet onions, and the vanilla and citrus of the Conundrum, made for a fantastic finish. Yumm!Out next course was an heirloom tomato salad with burrata cheese  (mozzarella), arugula, and diced beets.I'm not a fan of tomatoes by themselves, but these were delicious, hearty, and very fresh. And the spice of the arugula paired with the acid of the tomato, and the creaminess of the burrata, made for a delectable salad. I finished it off, even the beets.This was paired with the 2007 Mer Soleil Silver Unoaked Chardonnay. Very fruity, creamy, beautiful golden wine.Paired with the acid of the tomatoes, and the creaminess of the burrata highlights the richness of the wine wonderfully.For the main course we were served peppercorn-crusted New York Strip with Bordelaise Sauce, Sauteed Escarole and Fingerling Potatoes.The strip was what other cuts of beef aspire to be. The preparation is what other chefs aspire to accomplish.Simplistic, subtle, yet very powerful in both mouth feel, and flavor.The escarole was topped with shaved hard-boiled egg, which was unique, and definitely changed the impact of the escarole. (I'm not particularly fond of it myself)The fingerling potatoes were perfect.The bordelaise could have been delivered in a cup and I'd have happily drank it up.Paired with this course were two Cabernet Sauvignons; a 2000, and a 2008.The 2008 had far too many tannins for my liking. I don't want to pucker up like I've just eaten sand and have dry mouth.The 2000 was much more mild, and was rather delicious.Both paired wonderfully with the grilled meat, and the saltiness of the herbs on the potatoes meshed well with the reds.For dessert we were served Berry Trifle with sour cream pundcake and amaretto mascarpone Cream.OMG. I died and went to heaven. Which I don't believe in. But almost could have.Topped with toasted almond slivers, this dessert was pure bliss. The berries floating in the rich mascarpone, resting atop that delicious yet sinfully good pound cake.As if that wasn't enough to knock your socks off, they paired it with a 2004 Mer Soleil Late Viognier that alone could make you think you were drinking pure sugar, with great flavor.Apricot, honey, orange, balanced acid make for a lush and long finish.An amazing dinner and dessert, but in addition to the fantastic food, we were connected via videoconference with Chef Russell Skall; Fleming's Executive Chef, Chuck Wagner; owner of Caymus Vineyards, and Marian Jansen op de Haar; Fleming's Director of Wine. They fielded questions from several locations that were all conferenced in, making it feel a bit more personal. :)As if all that weren't enough, one of the servers mistakenly switched my tab with another party's. That didn't really bother me, as I understand that mistakes can happen.How it was handled made me want to reserve my 100th review for them; Mike Head, one of the Operating Partner's for the Fleming's in the Scottsdale Hilton, had introduced himself during the event, and had provided me his business card.I was expecting a deposit the night of the event, so the next morning I checked my account, which was how I noticed the disparity between my tab, and the amount my account was debited. (It was a triple digit charge)I emailed Mike, explaining the situation, and requested he contact me.Later in the day I hadn't heard from him, so I called him.Long story less long; he was going to contact my bank and, calling as a merchant, attempt to reverse the charge. He called me back to inform me that, rather than take a chance on there being any delay in me getting my funds back, he just went ahead and took cash to my bank, and deposited it in my account.Nobody does that. Ever.Mike Head of Fleming's did.He even returned my gratuity for the mistake having been made in the first place.And after all that, they still gave me a gift card to entice me to return.Mike Head, and Fleming's of Scottsdale, epitomize what customer service should alway be about.Thank you Fleming's, Caymus Vineyards, Chef Skall, Mike Head, and most importantly, Shwaag, for such an amazing evening.And thanks especially to my date, for being so beautiful. :)If you haven't been to Fleming's, do so at your earliest opportunity.I'd like to share a secret with you. Contrary to common belief, Fleming's is not just an option for a special night on the town! Believe it or not, they offer things like happy hour, prix fixe meals and specials all week long!One of my favorite things is the happy hour. Every weekday they offer five for $5. That means, they offer different appetizers for $5, the burger for $5 and several drinks for only $5. In addition, they have a specialty cocktail every month that has only 99 calories!Met some friends for Easter Dinner here.  I thought it would be packed, but it wasn't.  Since I hadn't had Meat for a while, I was looking forward to this dinner.After browsing the menu, I decided to go for the Porcini Rubbed Filet Mignon (center cut, grilled high country Asparagusspears, Gorgonzola Cream Sauce).  For a side dish, I selected the Chipotle Mac & Cheese.  My friends ordered a bottle of Wine and we were good to go!The Filet was soooo good!  The Gorgonzola Cream Sauce added a rich, creamy flavor to the succulent center cut Filet.  I requested it Medium and it was cooked to perfection.  The Chipotle Mac & Cheese was a perfect complement to the Filet.....I highly recommend it.The service was pretty good to.  Our glasses of Wine were never empty and we ordered a Chocolate Lava Cake w/Vanilla Ice Cream & Whipped Cream and split it between the 3 of us.  It was awesome!Overall, it was a great dinner with good friends.Return Factor - 100%Was at Flemings attending an event and even though the event had some amazing food and great wines, we were wanting something a little bit more, so we spoke to the manager (who was in the party) and told him we would like a table for 2 for dinner, and he was delighted and got us seated pretty quickly.Once we were seated our server came by, he introduced himself and offered us a glance at the wine list, but we had to let him know that we just came from the private party were the wine was flowing, but we did order a large bottle of Acqua Panna. If God were to cry, Acqua Panna would be his tears, it's just one of my favorite bottles of water. Some great tasting bread was offered as well.After checking out the menu I knew what I wanted. I ordered the main Filet Mignon with a steak companion of King Crab with Herb Butter topped with Caviar. We also ordering some sides, the Fleming's Potatoes & Grilled Asparagus. Let's talk about the steak, this was definitely the star of the plate, I like my steak still pink, and this was cooked perfectly, oh and it was so smooth like butter! The king crab was the perfect side to this great steak, it picked up the flavors of the herb butter very well, and who doesn't love some caviar! This was a great steak! The grilled asparagus was cooked just right, tender yet not too much so, can't believe I didn't like them as a child, now I can't get enough of it! The Fleming's potatoes oh they were a surprise, they are a potato au gratin style with cream, jalapenos & cheddar cheese, oh they were divine! I think potatoes should come like this all time. We had great service, excellent dishes, l look forward to my next visit!Just came over for HH on the patio.  First off the service was awesome.  My favorite of the four appetizers I ordered was the homemade burrata.  The prime burger is very filling and a popular choice for the night, at least one person from every table ordered one.  The calamari was soft and sweet but I think crispier may have been better.  The carpaccio was good but not as savory just creamier.   Regardless the red blend was a great pairing for the above appetizers.
Ajo Al's=I am completely and utterly confused about these reviews?!! For years I have heard about how great the food is and how people always by the salsa and chips. I ordered a burrito of some type and cut it open and then water yep..water poured out of this burrito. I was like WTF?I regretly tried a bite and it was dry flavorless and the little flavor it did have tasted like fish!!! The water must have been from it being premade and frozen, Or almost rotten and frozen to save it a few extra days.The chips were stale and thick gross had a strange flavor. The salsa was so gross it was unedible. What is wrong with you people, did you drop acid before you ate here?
Viva Zapatas Mexican Restaurant & Cantina=My Son and I were in the area volunteering at Three Square and decided to stop by here during our lunch break.  The parking lot was packed and we had to wait around 10 min for our table....this was at 12:10 pm, the worst time to be heading to lunch.  The wait was worth it though.Once we were seated we browsed the menu and decided to order the Queso Fundido w/Chorizo appetizer ($6.95), Beef & Bean Chimichanga lunch special ($8.25), and Pollo Amador lunch special ($10.25).  I also asked the waiter if the cook could put together a really spicy Habanero Salsa for us....he said sure.  We were served complimentary Chips, Salsa, and Beans while we waited for our food....+1.  The Salsa reminded me of the Salsa at Lindo/Bonito Michoacan.  I read the menu that had the story of Zapata, but couldn't find any connection between the restaurants.....the Salsa was that close to one another.  Anyway, it was really good.....had a nice kick to it.  The Chips weren't as fresh as I like them to be....but they were good.After a short wait our Queso Fundido came out....again, it reminded me of the one at Lindo/Bonito Michoacan.  It was very delicious.  On top of the dish is an extremely hot Pepper....I think it's a grilled Jalapeno or Poblano (see pics)....whatever it is, I like it.I ordered the Beef & Bean Chimichanga and it came out a few minutes later....along with the Habanero Salsa.  The Beef was shredded and very delicious, not greasy.  Sometimes when you order a Beef Chimichanga it can be very greasy....not here.  It was a nice size too.....must be their lunch portion.  The Habanero Salsa was really spicy....just how I like it!  It added to the flavor.  My dish also came with Guacamole & Sour Cream and a side of Refried Beans & Rice.....all very good.My Son enjoyed his Pollo Amador.  He gave me a bite to try it out.  It is Chicken marinated in Amador Sauce (whatever that is).  The Sauce had a slightly sweet tomatoey flavor to it.....it was very good.Overall, it was a nice lunch.Will we return?  If we're in the area and in the mood for some Mexican Food....you can count on it.In Love again!I asked around for a good romantic place to take a date. The name Viva Zapata's kept coming up by friends recommending it. The name didn't sound very romantic, it sounded more revolutionary, but maybe that's what I needed some kind of revolution in my life since nothing else was working out, So I decided to give it a try.  We agreed to meet there at eight, but I got there at seven, I didn't want to be late  and I wanted to get a feel of the place and make sure it met my expectations. As i walked in i knew i would like the place, nice decor dim lighting and live music. I proceeded to the bar and ordered a margarita and listened to the guitar man play someone Else's life with his fingers.  it was a really good margarita it actually had tequila in it. The bartender brought some complimentary chips and salsa and some bean dip. I didn't want to start eating since my date hadn't arrived yet, but one chip loaded with bean dip wouldn't hurt. After two bowls of chips and bean dip and three margaritas I decided to order an appetizer, Something light, so I ordered the seviche and let me tell you, it was the best seviche I have tried this far from the ocean, it couldn't be any fresher or tastier. It was soo good I decided to stick with the mariscos (seafood) and ordered the camarones borrachos, (like me)  Shrimp sauteed with garlic, spices and tequila, the perfect combination. You just can't go wrong with that, It was out of this world goodness! All in all I had a wonderful time.  When you get caught between great food, a nice romantic ambiance and a guitar, you can't help  It but to fall in love. ....My date? Didn't make it.....But I fell in love nonetheless..... with the food at Viva Zapata's.                                                 PS.  Don't text and drive. You don't want to miss dinner!I came in for lunch and just barely beat the rush. It was just after 11 am and the parking lot filled up quickly. Inside the dining area there is an okay amount of room with options for a booth or table, but sometimes there is still a small wait to be seated since it gets so busy. There was a good amount of staff on hand to take care of the customers and during my visit our server checked on us often. We started with complimentary chips, salsa and bean dip. The salsa had a fresh taste, but I didn't care for it and it was think instead of thick which I personally prefer. Chips and bean dip were great. The beans really had a nice flavor. The menu has a lot of options. On the back of the menu there were over 30 different combinations for lunch specials. The specials run from 10 am - 5 pm Monday thru Friday with prices ranging from $8.95 - $11.95 and meals include rice, beans and drink. Priced at $9.95 I chose a beef taco and cheese enchilada. The taco was filled with a nice portion of shredded beef and had tons of freshly grated cheese. I loved the taste of the taco shell and all of the cheese, but the beef lacked flavor for me. The cheese enchilada was really good and they didn't skimp with cheese inside or out. The beans like the dip didn't disappoint however there could have been more cheese on the beans. The rice was a bit dry, so I'll just get all beans next time. I was stuffed at the end of my meal and satisfied. Solid spot for lunch or dinner and great for the whole family.
Fado Irish Pub=If this place were a bar by itself on a street somewhere, I'd probably be considering it for 4 stars.  Unfortunately, like many things in Las Vegas, it is tucked away in the corner of an obscenely large casino.  The casino in question is WAY off the strip.  The pub is up on the second or third floor and way off in the corner.    Our search for this place felt like an episode of  Lord of the Rings:  Following signs, backtracking, splitting up and meeting again, etc.  We had a great advantage over the hobbits in that we had our cell phones to keep in touch.  Furthermore, we could stop and rest along the way with booze, food, and of course craps.  Those poor little hobbits...Our 8 person party was escorted to a table through a labyrinth of small rooms/anterooms and seated for dinner.  We drank like fish, ate lots of fish and chips, and enjoyed the band.  It was for the most part a great bar band, the kind you often see in Vegas if you're just walking around.  It was a little jarring to have to leave the nice dark wood and dim lighting of the pub to go out into the casino and find the restroom, but we all survived.  Unless you're already out in Green Valley for some reason, I can't imagine any great reason to hit this place.  However if you are already in the building, it's a decent place to drink.  They also show lots of Rugby, Premier League, and other European/International sporting events at the usual early morning time if you're so inclined.
Gyros Express=Not much for atmosphere, but there is a reason they have been here for so long. Fantastic Gyro meat, and their lunch special which includes a Gyro, fries and a drink for only $8.95.Glad I found this little lunch spot.
La Fonda Del Sol=This is really good Mexican food on a budget. The decor is standard, the service is wonderful, and the food is amazing. I have been to this location several times and have been pleased with everything I have ever ordered. The tostadas and the chimichingas really stand out in my memory.Their chips and salsa are some of the best I have tasted.We were in the mood for some Mexican food and stumbled across this joint.  It's a casual dining place with 15 or so tables and a small bar.  Complimentary Chips & Salsa are included with your meal.  They give you 2 types of Salsa.....Mild and Spicy.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HTlsBAd9j1wlWDHxnYczBw?select=7TDycarU8SKS1PQzilc2_wThe Spicy Salsa is very good.....the Chips are very thin and break easily....so they got 1/2 of that right.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HTlsBAd9j1wlWDHxnYczBw?select=9NUxLme4YMrPXxSrw5vkHwFor dinner we ordered:Cheese Crisp Appetizer - $7.25http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HTlsBAd9j1wlWDHxnYczBw?select=W6kOQlY8S8ke97Of4UQkFg#11 Cheese Enchilada Combo (Enchilada, Beans, Rice) - $11.50http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HTlsBAd9j1wlWDHxnYczBw?select=UJEi2YPoYm73iJrXOdz1lACarnitas Burrito - $9http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HTlsBAd9j1wlWDHxnYczBw?select=1_A4f--rniKJFcd3UfGG5ASide of Sour Cream - $1.352 Glasses of House Cabernet - $6.75The Cheese Crisp was very good.  It's like an open faced Quesadilla with the Tortilla cooked nice and crispy.The Cheese Enchilada was OK....kind of salty.The Better Half enjoyed her Carnitas Burrito, but she said it wasn't anything special.  She only ate 1/2 of it....took the other 1/2 home.  The glasses of Wine was hers also....and thought it was ok, what could you expect from house Wine?Overall, it was an OK dinner....did not 'wow' us.Return Factor - 40%If La Fonda Del Sol existed in New York City, there would be a line around the block waiting to get seats. The irony, of course, is that Arizonans consider this to be perfectly passable Mexican food, but a far cry from palate-pleasing perfection. I suppose I find myself bitter knowing that such deliciousness could be viewed with such a blasé indifference by Phoenix's elite critics; in New York, we still seek out the one true answer to the Mexican food problem, yet in Phoenix, the answer is so abundant it produces disenchantment.Well, friends, we'd gladly take your La Fonda Del Sol. You get to keep the rest of those Mexican restaurants you love, so it's only a minor loss. In exchange, you may have a Rosa Mexicana and a Dos Caminos. Nay, don't thank me.So, La Fonda.... Truly spicy, homemade salsa; perfectly crisp chile rellenos bathed in cheese, crusty chimichangas battered in love and ambrosia, husk-wrapped tamales that taste homemade; huge portions, incredibly low prices. This is what it's all about.Yeah, the tacky pastel Mexican decorations are unnerving and the service is slow and often panicked, but these are minor gripes.When it's all said and done, these idiots forklift themselves into the waiting lines of NYPD Pizza (HA! HAHAHA!) and Oregano's (BAHH! HAHA!) while overlooking the real gem that sits in between them. Well, if you're a New Yorker like me, you're not gonna try either of those wrecks anyhow; go get some Mexican.
Roy's Restaurant=Technically, Roy's is outside the northern boundary of which I would drive for a meal, but since it was to be a free meal and I wouldn't be doing the driving, how could I say no?  It is a chain, but in Roy's defense, the majority of the menu items are created by the local chefs with only a portion of the menu available at all restaurants.  Roy's is billed as Hawaiian fusion, but my first thought was "oh no, there's sushi on the menu, I won't like this place."  I am happy to say I was wrong.  Don't let my husband read this.  He thinks I'm never wrong.My husband also always says I'm stuck in the 80's, so I ordered the 1988 cocktail (grapefruit and pomegranate with a grapefruit vodka and lychee liqueur).  Since I was the lone drinker, I stuck with one, but could have easily had 2 or 3 more of these, especially with a little Duran Duran background music.  We started with Roy's Canoe Appetizer for Two, adjusted for three.  It includes lobster potstickers and teppanyaki shrimp, both of which were really good.  Also on the boat were Thai beef satay and spicy tuna roll, neither of which I tried.  My husband vouched for the tuna roll, however.Next up was the grilled endive, apple, and bleu cheese salad with pomegranate vinaigrette.  If you're a salad lover, you would probably love it.  If you're a salad hater, you would probably love it, too.  For my entree, the pancetta crusted Alaskan halibut with tomatoes and chevre, mushroom ravioli.  This, too, was fantastic, although there was a little too much oil on the plate, maybe from the pancetta??  But the fish was nicely prepared and the ravioli was excellent.My husband insisted on the chocolate souffle which must be ordered at the start of your meal, but due to a glitch with our pregnant server needing a bathroom break, it didn't get put in early enough.  We waited and were given a starter dessert on the house, and both the server and the gal who forgot to put the order in both profusely apologized.  Hey, I would gladly welcome another screw up if a second dessert was involved.  The souffle was lick your plate good and the blueberry tart (I think that was the name of it) was incredibly good as well.  So good, I may have to break my driving rule and have dessert there again.Probably 4.5 stars, but I'm feeling stingy today.Every once in a while, I will be treated to a nice dinner and a medical talk - this was one of those times.....Let's just start with saying that rollin up to a JW Marriott in a Chevy Cobalt really makes all the Beemers and Benz's pop out. After non-valeting my ride and walking the mandatory 100 yards to get to the resort, my breath was already taken away by the sheer grandiosity of the resort and the colorful flowers. Roy's is on the first floor of the resort...which will throw you off because the ground floor is considered the 2nd level.Hostess and wait staff were super friendly, I wasn't sure what the reservation was under but they made the situation light and directed me to where I needed to go. Started off with the Crunchy Golden Lobster Potstickers in a Togarashi Miso Butter Sauce...Yeah, I don't know what togarashi is, but I think he was in the hot dog eating competition at coney island last year. Either way, it was good - the perfect amount of sauce to complement the lobster meat. Definitely a must try. Also had the Golden Coconut Shrimp that came with a Mustard Mango Sweet & Sour Sauce and that I could've done without. The shrimp tasted fresh, but overall I thought it may have been a little bland. I guess I like a little bit more spice or lemony kick to my shrimp. I probably would have like to try the calamari instead.The last appetizer I had was the Crispy Spicy Ahi Sushi Roll with Ginger Wasabi and I could have eaten this all day long. Hands down the number one appetizer to try. I never eat Ahi, but the wasabi kick did just enough for me to go back for 2nds and 3rds.For the actual dinner, I started off with what seemed like the house salad. For this salad, you will need a knife in addition to your fork. It's not often I get confused by food, but I literally had to slice each piece of lettuce because it comes as one big piece. The herb dressing was super good and made the salad. You only get a couple of tomatoes and cucumber slices, but hey - your salad isn't supposed to be filling, so I was okay with it.For the main entree, I got the Roy's Roasted Macadamia Nut Crusted Mahi Mahi....and with that I will make a qualifying statement that I don't eat much fish. I prefer beef and chicken over fish during every day of the week, but since the ahi sushi roll was so good, I decided to get a little fishy. I will also say that I've never had Mahi Mahi before, but for as much fun as it is to say Mahi Mahi, it tasted just as fun as it sounds. It has the perfect amount of "crusty-ness" and it just flaked and melted in my mouth. The Mahi Mahi comes layered on top of grilled asparagus, which is layered on top of medium sliced roasted potatoes. One bite - multiple tastes - and it all works. Usually I'm a little hesitant when chef's try to combine too much different flavors into one bite, but it really worked with this entree. Finished up with a dessert platter and the best one was the cheesecake, the crust was the best part. Pair it with the coffee and you've got a great ending.P.S. Just because it's a chain, doesn't always mean that the restaurant is bad!We have eaten at Roy's all over...IL, AZ, CA,  HI. Since Outback has bought them, the food has denigrated to average to below average to poor. And the waitstaff has become inattentive at best. Ate at the Roy's in Desert Ridge at the JW Marriott in Phoenix. Sat outside where it was a beautiful evening. Had to ask the waiter for any specials. Wife and aunt ordered seafood trio of butterfish, mahi mahi and salmon. Butterfish, their signature dish was mushy and tasteless, not dry and flaky. Mahi was dry. Salmon not cooked thoroughly.I had the scallops. Three sea scallops over something non-descript. Not even any rice or veggies. Delicious, but a small portion for over $30. Usually, midway during the meal the server asks if anyone wants a lava cake or upside down cake, as it takes time to prepare. This time nothing. After finishing the entrees, server comes over and asks if anyone wants dessert, then omits the upside down cake from the offerings. I had to remind him. Eaten at Roy's oodles of times before, but now its a very pricey Outback. Awful and won't be returning.
Princess Market=I tried the Friday buffet here with fellow yelpers Rand, Mike, and Robyn. There are just a little over a dozen items but all were really good, and the grilled chicken deserves special mention - it was fantastic, like no other grilled chicken I've tried anywhere else. The other items were mostly standard dishes found in other Mediterranean restaurants, but prepared very well here. Also, each person who partakes of the buffet is served a tender, very nicely seasoned lamb shank - that alone would already justify the price of the whole buffet!  In all it was a really delicious meal, and a really great deal at 10 bucks.This place has the greatest chicken kabobs ever, they are never burnt and always super juicy. The marinade is delicious! They say it takes 15 min because they are cooked to order, but I swear I have never waited more than 8 min for it to arrive. A plate comes with 3 sides and is usually always choose tabouli, hummus and baba. It's always served with just enough pita and the plate is filling for $9. It's really hard not to come here every day for lunch.  I crave the tabouli, they make it the best, just a little bit of bulgar wheat and lots of lemon juice and the onions and tomatoes are expertly diced. The service is unbelievably friendly and parking is adequate. The place is super close to asu and mcc so it's a great spot for lunch or study break food. I notice you can also call ahead and order pick up. They grocery also has great products and some fun frozen foods to try. Now if only I could just eat more I'd order the princess platter all for myself!
Cyclo Vietnamese Cuisine=The food at Cyclo is entirely over-shadowed by its outrageous owner, Justina Duong.  If Justina was a gay man, she would make a great drag queen.  I think she's a hoot, but her outlandish behavior and brash comments do not work for everyone.  I have a very dear friend who lives in Chandler and she and I would go into Cyclo quite often.  My friend is married with three kids, but just she and I would go in.  She would always tell Justina about her family and show her pictures of the kids.  Justina really gets into teasing the customers and after a couple of years, she told my friend, "You crazy fag-hag.  You never bring your family in here.  You just come in with your gay friend.  You don't even have a family.  Crazy Lady, you just carry around those pictures to make your lonely self feel better."  Justina also plays up the Vietnamese accent.  She can be off-putting at first if you don't know what's up, but the floor show never disappoints if you're willing to play along.The food is good enough now, but it was better when the restaurant first opened.  The star dishes include Tom Rang Hat Tieu, an appetizer of shrimp on toasted baguette slices with a savory black pepper sauce that is plate lickin' good.  Another delicious starter is Banh Xeo.  It's a crispy rice crepe with shrimp, pork, sprouts, and lettuce leaves for wrapping the crepe slices before you eat them.  For entrees, Ca Ri Ga is a tasty chicken and pineapple curry and Com Tam is a mixed grill of a marinated pork chop, beef, shrimp, and egg over broken rice.  As a side dish, the Dau Xanh Xao Toi is a sublime preparation of spicy garlic green beans with chili and sweet soy.  However, the quality now varies.  The last time I went the pineapple curry was totally bland.  Even though I have eaten at this place many times, I didn't say anything because I didn't want to be bothered with Justina's reaction.  Instead, I haven't been back.  I have been into Cyclo when Justina was not there and the quality of the food was nowhere near the same in her absence.  My concern is that Justina has announced plans (yet again) to open a second Cyclo in the Valley.  This time it's supposed to be on Central Avenue south of Camelback and across from Brophy with a fall 2008 opening.  Once that place opens, I assume Justina will move her floor show to central Phoenix and I am left to wonder if the quality of the food will continue to slip in Chandler.Cyclo has a BYOB policy and some people are really into it.  For me, it's not a huge selling point.  I prefer not to schlep my own booze to a restaurant, but it's cool if you're into it.If you go to Cyclo, hope that Justina is there.  You're really going to Cyclo for Justina's antics rather than the food.What the pho, man?!The food is bland.  It tastes like they cater to the elderly.The prices are high for the type of food you are getting.  Nobody should have to bay over $5.75 for ANY type of pho.  I've gone there 2x and I don't know if it's just me, but the hostess there just rubbed me the wrong way both times.  She was cracking jokes and making comments that were borderline inappropriate.  They focus more on decor and trying to "entertain" their patrons rather than focusing on what's really important... the food.You want a really good, AUTHENTIC bowl of Pho?  Go to Saigon Pho on Alma School/Knox.  It's not as ritzy and refined, but the pho and other menu items there are less expensive, tastes better, and they serve you much larger portions.  Eat at Cyclo if you want to have a SEEMINGLY over-attentive hostess bothering you while you try to eat.  (I say "seemingly" because while you may think she's over-attentive, in reality, she hasn't even done as much as refill your water glass.)My family went here for dinner and I am 100% sure the staff, especially Justine, was prejudiced against us because we were Vietnamese.  The Pho was mediocre and all the food we ordered were overpriced.  While Justine made her rounds to chat, flirt, and engage all her Caucasian guests, we were ignored and forgotten.  And by "forgotten," I mean, they didn't bring out our food until we reminded them we existed.  Yes, the greens and food were fresh. However, calling this place a Vietnamese restaurant would be comparable to calling Taco Bell a Mexican restaurant.We didn't care so much about the price as long as the food was good. However, since both the food was sub-par and the service was terrible, this is one place we will not be returning to.
Wonderful Wanda's=Wanda's is a basic Diner with a Mexican twist.  I've eaten here once and it was good enough that I'll be back.  The food was fresh, fast and good.  I had a very basic scrambled eggs with cheese, hash browns with onions, toast and bacon.  This breakfast for me is the yardstick for judging Diners.  The eggs were perfect-not firm and overdone, not the least bit runny.  Toast, bacon, potato's were just right as well.As Amy B said, the space is on the small side and seating is limited.A hands down winner over IHOP, Denny's or any other chain Diner.
Graziano's Pizzeria=If I didn't have a big pizza in front of my face, I would have thought I ordered a big serving of attitude with a side of screw you.Maybe it's because we came in with a coupon...but this place had more ego than a 15 minute celebrity.  Not to knock small, family owned places (usually I love going to places like that, because USUALLY you get a friendly family feel), but for a pizza joint located in a shopping center next to Albertson's, they sure wanted to make you think you were eating caviar.Things not so awesome:1.  Whomever answered the phone didn't know East from West to be able to give directions2.  Our waitress couldn't give any suggestions on the food3.  They can't do a half and half pizza unless you paid extra4.  You pay a charge if you want to split a plate of food5.  ATTITUDE, ATTITUDE, ATTITUDE6.  Tip was already included in our billI've never been to a family run pizzeria that can't do a half and half pizza, and the only restaurants I've ever been to that charge to split a plate of food are ones where you'd feel more comfortable wearing  a dress - definitely not one in a strip mall like this one.I swear if the two waitresses rolled their eyes or huffed any more than they already did, they probably would have fainted from lack of oxygen and vertigo.And last time I looked, I believe I was old enough to do my own math for your tip.  If you were so scared we were going to stiff you on your tip, maybe you should learn a little something called Cuss-toe-mer Sur-viss.Foodwise, the pizza was not the best I've ever had, in fact it was a bit on the dry side.   I can't say it was absolutely horrible, but neither can I say I was in heaven.  The wings were much better, in my opinion.For the pain of the drive and having to dodge eye daggers, this is a definite no-peat.RUDE OWNER!We have been going to Grimaldi's now Grazzianos for 10 years.  We are a family of 5 and My stepson who is 26, and husband are BIG eaters. They can easily eat enough food for a family of 6 all by themselves. Today, we walked out and vowed never to return because of the owners rude behavior. We love the wings and the happy hour specials and always support a family business over the big boys. Anyhoooo....If you order hot wings it must be in increments of at least 6 and you get a dressing. If you order in increments of 12, you still only get one dressing. So my stepson has 2 orders of 6, just so he can get his 2 dressings. Well when they refused to give him 2, without charging him the extra .59 cents. I mean the money won't break us, but the principal of it all is crazy. So he calls the owner over and asks her. As soon as she got to our table she was rude and told him in a tone "so basically your wanting to get out of paying the extra .59 cents. No" I have never seen a restaurant owner speak to someone like this. Then we called her back when the food arrived, and she struts over to our table and first thing out of her mouth was "Now what?!" Really? That left a bad taste in our mouth and he told her "forget it. Give me the check for the drinks and salad. We are leaving" She argues and says "over .59 cents?" He says "No. Over your attitude, I did not need to be talked to like that" She says "You don't understand how expensive ranch dressing is!" In her condescending tone. I was floored. She lost our weekly business for sure. Now, as a restaurant owner she should have written off the ranch dressing as we have been loyal customers for YEARS. The other people who work there are nice and I feel bad for them, if she treats her customers like this imagine how she treats them. I hope she sees this review and responds with her feedback. SHE has no one to blame  for lost business but herself.
Uss Fish N Chips=Yet another decent hole in the wall/mom and pop type of place to check out if you're in the area! Before you come here, let be known that its CASH ONLY!Just like any new place I check out I usually go with the namesake of the place if it applies. So what I got was the Fish, Chicken, and Chips Combo ($8.25). You get two pieces of battered fish and chicken along with potato chips. The fish was tender and flaky. The chicken was bit chewy because it was a bit dry. The potato chips are comparable nilla wafers thicknesswise but were just a tad bigger. Im thinking if dude  makes it with some kind of seasoning, it would surely be a hit for it was already decent the way it was.If you refer to my pic, when the guy brings it out to you on a tray, it comes complete with ranch, ketchup, tartar sauce, and hot sauce. That's awesome! You have all the condiments you need!While I was eating, I noticed that other people that came in ordered Korean dishes mainly Bulgogi and Kim Chi Soup. Man, all it did was give me more incentive to come back and order those very same items. Oh, before I forget, this place is an American/Korean/Chinese type of cuisine. So basically, you can eat here every day for about 6 months and not have the same thing. Here are just some of the things that you would probably catch your eye after looking over the menu. Frog Legs, Oxtail Soup, Fried Pineapple, Kalbi Short Ribs, and Deep Fried Eggplant.Minus 1 star because of the cash only policy and the location. Quick story. As I park my car and get out, this guy comes out of nowhere asking me if I wanted to buy some weed from him. I said, no thanks, I am here for the fish and chips. He responded with oh yeah, the fish and chips are bomb here. Then off he went like nothing happened.In closing, food and service here is great. I just dont think coming here at night would be a good idea especially if you are alone. Which reminds me. The business hours are Monday thru Saturday 10:30 am to 8 pm. Closed sundays. These guys are located in a strip mall on the corner of Las Vegas Blvd and Cheyenne Ave. Check them out.Yelp 2014 365 Review Challenge #129 "Fish n Chips and other stuff"
Uncle Sam's=A friend of mine introduced me to this place several years ago before I moved here.  Since I moved here, we've dined here three times.  It's a fun, casual place to take your family and enjoy bar food.  Here's a breakdown of what I've had:Philly Cheesesteak Sandwich (Whole, $14.95) - Really good.  The Bread is decent and the Whole sized portion is enough for 2 people.Uncle Sam's Special Pizza (18" Large, $23.95) - It has virtually every topping on it.  Because it's crammed with toppings, it tends to get a little soggy even if it's ordered well done, which is how I order it.  Flavor is pretty good.  We always take a few slices home and it heats up well for leftovers.Wings (Baker's Dozen, $7.95) - Our friends don't like the really spicy stuff, so we always order the Medium spice level and the Spicy on the side.  The Wings are really good.  Always served hot and they break away from the bone well.  The Spicy sauce isn't too Spicy....I like spicy food, so it's about average for me.Large basket of Fries $3.23 - Decent sized basket.  Can serve 2-3 people.  Average flavor, reminds me of Wendy's Fries in terms of size and style.Large basket of Fried Zucchini $4.95 - Can serve 2-3 people.  The flavor is average.  Always served hot and crispy.  I've never had soggy Zucchini here, which is a pet peeve.The restaurant has plenty of seating and can easily accommodate a large group.  During one visit we had 8 people and it was very comfortable.  The Happy Hour here is pretty good, but I've never been able to try it because I'm always working.  The wait staff is young and relatively inexperienced, so you have to stay on top of them...however, that's to be expected in a restaurant like this.Overall, we enjoy this place and will definitely return.Return Factor - 90%
Farrelli's Cinema Supper Club=If AMC, the $1 cinema and Denny's were able to birth a baby from a menage a trois, it'd be this. Farrelli's shows not so new yet not too old movies while serving mediocre food. It was very distracting to watch a movie while servers walked throughout the area serving Denny's quality food. I took a few bites of my food and left it. I've managed to repress the memory of what I ate so I'm sorry I can't warn you all about it. The concept of dinner & a movie, at the same time, is awesome, but unfortunately, they failed to deliver.
On The Border Mexican Grill & Cantina=Went here last Friday night and was very impressed. The last time I had been out to this restaurant was about a year ago and it really didn't seem too great to me, hence the reason it took me a year to come back. Im not sure if they are under new management, have a new chef, or are just improving. Friday night was of course a busy night so we had to wait about 15 min for a table for 2, not too bad. Our server greeted us right away and we had our drinks and appetizer ordered with in minutes! I love fast service! We ordered the Firecracker Stuffed Jalapeños. I wasn't sure how different they would taste from original Jalapeño poppers, but I am so glad I ordered them! They were delicious! A mix of cheese, cream cheese and chicken stuffed in a jalapeño, then deep fried! Add the cheese dip they give you with the order and your mouth is in Jalapeño heaven! I decided on an appetizer as my main dish also, for I wanted a variety of food dishes, I ordered the Sampler Platter and SO glad I did. It comes with chicken flautas, chicken quesadillas and steak nachos. It's the sampler so it's a pretty large portion, you get a few of each item, the flautas are my favorite. The chicken had a great taste to it, mixed with the different seasoning, cheese and peppers. My bf ordered the chicken chimi, obviously you can tell we like our chicken. I tried a few bites of his dish and it was also pretty tasty. I like my chimis to be very crispy, so was a little disappointed that the tortilla on this chimi was semi crispy, when they aren't crispy they get a little soggy. It was stuffed with chicken, seasoning and peppers, not a bad combination with the rice and beans.The staff was very friendly, courteous and quick! We had a great evening!
Wildflower Bread Company=Not long after I moved to Chandler I was looking for a good place for a salad.  I had been to the Wildflower in Tempe so I checked to see if there was a location closer and this is the one that came up.  I plugged the address into my trusty GPS and off I went.  This location is in the mall.  Yes there is a door that leads into it from the outside but if you didn't know that, you would never find it and that night I did not find it.  Flash forward to walking around the mall one day and VIOLA! there it is.  Boy did I feel dumb.  This location is clean, the staff is friendly and accomadating and the food is good.  The area in front of the counter is large so that you don't get in anyones way while looking at the menu or the baked goods.  They even have a few chairs there so you can sit and wait for your to go order.  There are plenty of tables and some booths.  I have never had a bad meal here.  I love the oriental chicken salad and the potato cream cheese soup.  I have purchased bread and other baked goods and they were always fresh and delicious.  If I had to choose between Wildflower and Paradise, it would be Wildflower hands down.11/17/10And yet, another WBC update- this time it's regarding the "Thanksgiving" sandwich, which was basically oven-roasted turkey, sage stuffing, and cranberry jam on delicious whole-grain bread.  Had the opportunity to try bite-sized samples at a Yelp event a few days before this visit and enjoyed it so much, I had to have a full sandwich soon after!  Well, OK, so I shared the other half w/ a petite cousin of mine-- she absolutely loved it! We swore that the next time, we'd get our own Thanksgiving sandwiches.  No sharing!12/23/10Doing last-minute Christmas shopping FOR MYSELF, I soon felt hunger pangs and WBC was calling my name!  (It's so nice to know that I can always count on WBC for a tasty meal for those times I don't feel like hauling across the valley in search for good eats!)  The aromas that permeated the air as I approached its warm and intimate setting told me that I made the right decision to eat here.  I quickly peruse the menu, thinking I'd have the Butternut squash ravioli that appeared in so many OYEs this year, but lo!  What do I see?  WBC's added a few new sandwiches, and one hot option jumped at me, and its name was "Braised Beef," ($7.99).  I'll try that one, please!The braised beef was TOPPED w/ rosemary-gorgonzola mashed potatoes, served on a grilled ciabatta roll, and accompanied w/ au jus and horseradish sauce, w/ a side of both regular and sweet potato chips.  Let me tell you, the beef and mashed potato combo was incredible!  I ate the whole sandwich!  (Well, all of the beef and potatoes and half of the ciabatta roll.  Gotta keep a svelte figure, y'know?  LOL.)  I'm going to have to order this again the next time I visit!I've only had breakfasts here, but they do a really nice job.  I love the ham and brie frittata.  So simple, but always tastes good.  Every time I eat one I think I could make one at home, but I never do!  The bacon breakfast sandwich is delicious as well with the fresh greens and fluffy bun.  My husband always gets the 2 egg breakfast and enjoys that as well.For the longest time I forgot they were over here in the mall and we would head to Chompie's.  But now if we feel like a quieter atmosphere in the morning we'll hit Wildflower.  I really need to come back and try the lunch stuff.  It all sounds really good and I love a good soup and sandwich combo.  The staff is really friendly and helpful here and they have good coffee that will pry my eyes open in the morning.  All in all, it's the simple things done well.  Definitely a fan.Dear Wildflower,Have I told you how much I love the Hot Cross Buns you sell only during Easter?  I was at work last night chatting among the guests, greeting them a happy holiday, when I realized that it was that time of the year again when those sweet hot cross buns (called that bec. of the white icing placed on top of each bun in the style of the cross to commemorate the holiday) are only available from WBC and I better find an open WBC (I get off at 8p) to buy them ASAP!  Sadly, I have to swipe off as much of the sweet icing, which makes the buns positively sinful, as I can before tasting because my immune system can't handle it*, but I've found an equally delicious new way to enjoy the buns-- pop 'em into the toaster oven for a few minutes, just enough to make them flaky on the outside, and very warm and aromatic on the inside (how else would they get with all of those dried cranberries, golden raisins, and figs in there?!?!) and slather on some organic sweet cream butter.  Mmm... incredible!Is it too early to place my order for Hot Cross Buns for next Easter?  :)*Could I suggest that the company create a granulated-sugar based icing for customers allergic to powdered sugar-based icing?  That way, not only would we be able to enjoy the hot cross buns as intended, but we could also try your wonderful-looking cupcakes, cakes, cookies, muffins, and other pastries!  Just a suggestion...03/13/13Got out of bed this morning specifically to go and pick up the special order I'd placed for Currant-caraway Irish soda bread, which was slated for 8a.  I arrived around at around 830a, but none of the bags already prepared had my name on it.  After checking and re-checking the bags for my name and not finding any, the mid-50s to early-60s' female clerk finally grabbed one out of the shelves.  She then asked if I wanted it sliced, and I said yes, but quickly asked if I could get half of the bread sliced up now.  She said she could cut the bread in half, and I thought that she would follow the instructions through.  When I saw her package the two halves together in one bag, I asked if she could take half of the bread and put it through the slicer, and she said "whatever you want."  To round out the transaction, I had a cranberry scone added to my order.I had a little sample of the bread while driving back home, and it was good, but not as great as those tiny rolls I tried at the Yelp party eleven days ago.  I much-prefer the smaller ratio of crust to tender bread.Here's to healthy eating!  As with most things in life, enjoy carbs with moderation!  :)
Kai=I ate here for a business meeting - I knew it was a nice restaurant but am ashamed to admit I did not know it was a AAA 5-diamond. I was a little taken aback but the decor is so simple so you would never know it when walking it. What you immediately notice is the service and attention to detail. The hand-painted menus, Pima language in your introduction, and courses representing life's journey. They had me at "would you like a slice of key lime, cucumber, lemon, tangerine, cucumber...for your water?" ....now that's attention to detail. The chef sent out a special amuse bouche of buffalo tartar - I don't remember .I had the heirloom tomato, goat cheese & marscapone tart - it was the size of a muffin tin but I could have eaten a pie plate full. It was a delightful layering of sweet, creamy and tangy and the "black ice" was black gold - sprinkled ice crystals of reduced balsamic magic. Another special chef treat was a palate cleanser of pomegranate and pepper sorbet served in a small metal bird's nest like dish. I skipped the rest of the journey and went straight for the buffalo tenderloin. I have never had buffalo like this...buttery medium-rare with local flavors of saguaro blossom and cholla buds. Coffee was served tableside in individual French presses - my favorite. (Maybe I'm not such a country girl after all)  3 hour dinner, too bad I didn't valet park and get the thank you gifts mentioned in other reviews!Most people probably can't get over the price - it was amusing to see different guests (ages, socioeconomic status, etc.) and their attitudes toward the experience.  All dress seems to be welcome - I had to laugh because there was a couple that totally looked like the Carl's Jr .steak sandwich commercial - she's in a bright blue spandex dress and he's in campshirt  and shorts....Arizona is casual but have some respect. My country upbringing and lack of exquisite dining experience was growing uneasy with the constant service, being called Ms. all night long, etc. but I slipped into the luxury quite easily...life is good, exceptional food is bliss and Kai should be a goal for everyone to splurge on.When I travel, I always try to eat as much native food as I can. Otherwise what's the point of travelling if you don't try to experience some of the local culture and cuisine. I was therefore excited to find a fine dining restaurant offering local native Indian cuisine rather than the ubiquitous tex mex of the southwest.Well, I enjoyed one of the best dining experiences of my life here, not just best native Indian dining experience.The restaurant is located on the Wild Horse Resort complex, which is a native Indian resort offering casino & golf as well as hotel facilities. My only problem was navigating the huge complex and my only criticism was that the signposting to the hotel/restaurant was poor, something which I mentioned to the staff and received a promise that the problem had already been identified and was being dealt with. Just in case it still hasn't, head for the golf clubhouse and keep going beyond that despite the lack of signage!There is valet parking available but self parking is no problem. The hotel itself is spacious and Kai is located on the ground floor. Kai is the Pima word for seed and there are many obvious native Indian influences, reflected in many aspects of  the design and architecture - this is all explained in the restaurant menu and is obviously an aspect of the experience that they're very rightly proud of here.The restaurant has been recently refurbished to a very high standard. The tables are well spaced out and everything reeks of top quality - for example, the menus are printed on embossed paper.I think the way to sum up this amazing restaurant is 'attention to detail'. I've been lucky to dine in 3 Michelin star establishments but nowhere in the whole world I've visited beats Kai for attention to detail. Everyone knew my name from my reservation. Cutlery restocked from different sides of the table. New napkins for every visit to the restroom. Crockery and cutlery warmed or chilled to appropriate temperature for every dish!!The service is also friendly and very informative. There is also great drama with the food and choreography to the service. Foie gras is bruleed at the tableside. Soups are decanted into bowls from pitchers. Multiple waiters coordinate simultaneous delivery of dishes to multiple diner tables.My server kindly arranged a fresh orange juice. Then came another moment which sums up this amazing restaurant - I was offered fruit accompaniments with my glass of regular water!Onto the food.  I went for the tasting menu with its interesting choice of ingedients and combinations. I was pleased to see that the choice of breads included local Indian flatbread - a local Indian chief came into the kitchen to show the chefs how to make it. This was served with a first rate fruity olive oil.1. Amuse of buffalo tartare with cornbread crisp, crisp microgreens and balsamic vinegar. The buffalo was more gamey than normal beef and the balsamic vinegar was an excellent foil.2. Avocado panna cota toped with shrimp ceviche. The server poured over a papaya and mango soup at the table. My first huge smile moment when I found my chilled spoon! This was a dish which intrigued me from its unlikely combination of such disparate ingredients and it worked!! The smooth avocado was a perfect base for the tangy ceviche and the fruit soup wasn't too sweet but the subtleties of the papaya and mango were definitely evident flavours.3. For a carnivore, I was amazed at the great salad which followed -  the menu told me that the lettuces had been picked by local farmers and children of the Gila Crossing School. The salad had a chilli dressing. It was accompanied by date cake with foie gras (yum!), Humboult Fog goat cheese and heirloom tomato with candied walnut.4. Baja scallop topped with dried mango and sandalwood dust. The sandalwood gave the dish a powerful aromatic introduction, which activated all my salivary glands. An unusual use of what is usually used in incense sticks. The giant sweet scallop was served with bean puree, fried salsify and fennel pollen.5. Seared foie gras with macerated huckleberry and a fig in filo pastry. If you've read my other reviews, you'll know that you can't go wrong with seared foie gras with me!6. Palate cleanser of guava with fennel sorbet and mango sauce.7. Grilled tenderloin of buffalo from the Cheyenne River Tribe. The meat was open and evenly textured, tender with a nice gamey flavour. The plate was completed with a chorizo and corn cake and a morel mushroom mix.8. Lamb with pecan crust with chocolate and chilli sauce. Chocoalte with chilli has become mainstream and I wonder if this is where it originated.9. Cheese. Belgian soft cheese and a Tasmanian cheddar.10. Medley of desserts. Corn creme brulee. Fig bread with chocolate ice cream inside. Italian meringue bruleed tableside with fruit.Also lovely to chat to chef de cuisine Jack Strong after the meal.THE FINEST THE SOUTHWEST HAS TO OFFER. A life-changing culinary and spiritual event. Redefines the southwestern style as the highest-of-high in haute cuisine. An adventure of detail down to the individual salt grains. (That's for the iPhoners... now for the Rest... of the story...)This review has been percolating in my head for six months, almost to the day. With the recent tighter link between Yelp and Facebook, I realize it is time to promulgate the News that is the New Gospel of Southwestern Cuisine as bestowed on us by Chef O'Dowd. You may have read his praises in the local media these past months. Just one week after I dined there, Mobil granted it five stars -- the only Arizona establishment in any category to have this rating at present, and one of only four restaurants in the USA given the designation this year.But my introduction to Kai was nothing so grand. It began as a destination to commemorate a friendship I hold dear to my heart and to celebrate her birthday. As is our custom, I called Maitre'D to make several special requests including one for our dessert. It was a night I shall remember for decades to come.I may say the evening began the moment I crossed the property line and made my sojourn along a mile-long road and through a manicured yet natural presentation of desert flora. When I arrived at the hotel building entrance and stepped out of my car, there was NO ONE anywhere to be found. No bellman, no valet, no guests. The dim light of the entrance welcomed me as I walked into the grand lobby. I could hear a waterfall but there was no one anywhere in sight. Then from nowhere a valet greeted me and took my name. After that introduction, Ritz-Carlton style, every staff person I met knew my name. TRIPLE BING!!This place celebrates the Story. It provides little spotlit nooks for two, three or more, or even seating in front of a fireplace. And that's just Kai's bar area! We waited over a round of drinks (including a perfectly made Sapphire martini) because we were told that a special table awaited us.The celebration continued with the most unique and moving presentation of a menu I have ever experienced. Covered in textured rose-fuchsia-colored fabric and inlaid with watercolor from an artist in residence, our captain placed the table candle in front of it and let its flickering shadows on the fabric backlight the story of the land and the history of this property all the way to the selection of locally-grown (yes he pointed in the direction of the gardens) vegetables and herbs. My eyes were welling up as he finished.Our pour of sparkling water was complimented with our choice of garnish including blood orange and peach among the "usual" lemon, lime or cucumber slices.(getting this out of the way) Sommelier was the only distraction. Clearly not at his best, his bumblings included improper pouring etiquette, coming back to ask which Duckhorn we wanted, Merlot or Chardonnay, leaving the Champagne bottle on the table after the pour, and not refilling our empty wine glasses when checking in on us. UM! OK, back to the bliss. Of course we had to order the 12 course tasting menu. Each course was a sublime tapestry of flavor sensations. Even the one-bite Amuse was a symphony of 15, all working in careful harmony. I got to have two courses of fois gras (DOUBLE BING!) and the duck was so perfect, mild and elegant that even the three salt crystals intruded on its divinity. Second time 'round I had no salt. Heaven on earth. (see my profile's last meal preference)The final blow was our dessert. Although it had the ingredients I requested, it was entirely new. The strawberries had been infused with a candy-like vinegar and must have been several hours in their preparation. The fresh mint with the presentation was merely a garnish; the strawberries were as full of mint as if they had spent their lives in the same soil -- maybe they had! The balsamic was carefully chosen and perfectly matched. Like the perfection in every other detail, small pepper grains lined one side of the rim and dared us to pull them down. The dish's coronation was the creme fraiche executed at the exact moment, seconds before the presentation. Chef had to have stayed all the way to the end to make that execution.With all my heart I thank Chef for sharing his talent and craft. These few words only vaguely illuminate the wonders that await you at Kai. I hope that you find your way there for a special meal; it'll be one you won't soon forget.Kai truly is an "experience" with the mini history and the indigenous menu; each explained by your waiter in limited detail. I highly recommend this as a destination with your out of town guests.  Fun place to show off Arizona's Indian culture.The menu had something for everyone unlike some five star restaurants. Bread: Great! Focaccia w/ corn & peppers, baguette w/ seeds and grains, scones and keep 'em coming.Salads & soup: Highly recommend the Heirloom Tomato Tarte-YUM! It had something called basil foam; sounds scary, but amazing!Did not care for the cold avocado/cucumber soup that had a fishy fish in it.   Lobster trio good.Amuse-bouche very tasty custard and lamb.The New York Strip was melt in your mouth tender!  Also at our table we ordered the grouper, buffalo tenderloin and lamb...no disappoints.The staff does make sure you have plenty of time between courses, maybe a little too much time, by the time the main course came we weren't hungry and they served big portions (hate to waste food!)  Also, when your on the patio and in the corner it's a little intimidating when 4 waiters converge on you all at once.  Maybe try 2 at a time or something different. Seriously though worth the trip and the money for great quality fresh food!We tried the 13 course tasting menu with extended wine selection. The service was wonderful and 100% spot on.The food however, was quite a let down. Some dishes really excelled in their taste and presentation, while many were just a puzzling question mark followed by a mediocre taste. A few memories include a shot of squeezed juice which is considered a course which is more suited as a canape. A salad which included a few leafs of lettuce with two small slivers of cheese. I appreciated the craftsmanship of the 30 year old cheese, but it in no way complimented the lettuce and left you wondering why it wasn't paired with something more suitable or to paraphrase, enjoyable.Out of the 13 courses, there were 3 or 4 that really shined.. the buffalo being one of these. When you average in the odd interior decor it's apparent that attention has not been paid to all the details.. and that's what a fine dining experience really should include. If you're aiming for multi-michelin star experience, detail detail detail. On another high note, the wine pairings were absolutely wonderful and the sommelier was both informative and wonderful in not only introducing each pairing, but being able to provide excellent alternatives when pairings didn't go quite well.The card which gave us a list of all the courses + pairings was a nice touch at the end.For Arizona this is a step up in experience and i'm happy to see restaurants of such caliber really offering alternatives to places such as Binkley's.It's worth trying, but for us there weren't many dishes we'd be craving on a return visit for. After reading other reviews, it may be an issue that Kai has invested a good amount of time in perfecting the smaller tasting menus and main entrees but struggled to fill the larger 13 plate experience.The first thing you will notice about this review is that I'm giving the highest rated restaurant in Arizona a 3/5. This place is the only 5 Diamond restaurant in Arizona. That's a pretty heavy distinction to live up to. I can't say they didn't live up to it, but I can't say "WooHoo" about my visit either.I want to point out that this place has what I can only imagine is a true 5 Diamond experience down to a well orchestrated and choreographed science. The menus came with a story - as did the food and everything we consumed. It was a little heavy-handed. Hand-painted menus and live pan flute music playing in the background along with a waiter/narrator/story teller coming to our table every few minutes to be our personal wikipedia for the evening.The food was good, but this is one of those places that has tiny portions presented on big plates. Most courses were mere bite-sized morsels. Many were complimentary as some of us ordered items with more courses than others. I wouldn't ever again go out of my way for the food here. Nothing spoke to me. In fact, I don't really remember much of what I ate. I know I had a steak at one point. A bone-in rib-eye that had quite a bit of gristle. The service was incredible. It was over the top. That was the biggest problem here really. There were four of us dining, and they kept referring to us by our last names - Mr. and Mrs. so and so and Mr. and Miss. such and such and whats her face. It was off-putting enough to all of us that we requested they knock it off. Every time they brought out a drink or a course, there was a brigade of waiters carrying shit. Six people serving four. It was too much. I guess I'm just not the type of person who needs that much pampering. It makes me feel uncomfortable. Maybe I need to seek therapy for it - they'll tell me I don't love myself enough and make me cry about my dad because I don't feel like I deserve that kind of service. But seriously, it's overkill. This is the sort of think that people with too much money and not enough self-esteem need to do to feel powerful and important. I've heard that sometimes rich billionaire oil barons just shit in the bed instead of going to the bathroom and they have people who clean up after them. They apparently keep these habits when they stay at hotels sometimes as well. It just all reminds me of the gap between the super-rich and the rest of us... the elimination of the middle class. The whole thing is overpriced if you're not all about every bit of it. You have to like the pampering, the stories, the food, and the special imported drinks. If you appreciate all of that, then you will enjoy yourself. Most of it just made me feel like a pretentious asshole.For me, I'm happy if you don't spit on my food, make sure I have my refills on my drink, and that you don't seat me next to the bathroom. The food is why I go out to eat - not to have someone serve or entertain me. The food here just wasn't strong enough on its own to warrant a return.I will say this though - the view is amazing and the place is beautiful, tranquil, and classy.Decided to take the drive out to Kai and try out what many consider the best restaurant in in the State.We arrived a little early for our 9pm reservation and were greeted first by the valet, then by the 2 hostesses at the entrance. We requested a window table, popped into the bar for a couple of very interesting and delicious cocktails, and were promptly seated at our requested window table. We thought it was really weird that they assumed my date and I were married by calling us Mr. and Misses (insert last name here) - this happened all throughout the evening, despite the fact that neither of us were wearing wedding rings. We never bothered to correct them but we both thought it was unusual to make such an assumption.DECORE: After reading so many negative reviews of the decore, I had been prepared for the worst. It did have a "cafeteria like" feel to it, but overall not as bad as I expected after reading the reviews. Probably helped we were placed next to the window in one of the few window tables available.SERVICE: The service was absolutely outstanding. At least 3 Native American waiters doting on your every need, ever present yet not intrusive. Our waiter took the time to explain the philosophy of the restaurant, it's history and ingredients.At the end of the day we're really here to EAT - after studying the two tasting menus we decided that the mains and appetizers of the tasting menu were probably the best bet for a-la-carte so we started with the tomato gazpacho and a lump crab appetizer. We preferred the lump crab concoction to the gazpacho.Second course- we had the escargot, mushroom and caramel goat cheese. Totally about 4 escargots here, not a lot of food, but very tasty with the escargot's cooked to a perfect texture.For the mains she had the butter basted Potpourri of lobster/scallops/shrimp over a black squid pasta. This was delicious but small from a portion standpoint.I had, of course, the Tenderloin of Tribal buffalo- now I'm not sure how many buffalo are running around on the tribe these days so I would guess that's a stretch. What I can say is it was tender, delicious, not too gamey. Probably about 8oz in total.VALET: It was VERY cool to see my car already waiting at the valet, with chocolates and waters in the car. Great service.BOTTOM LINE: Been there, done it, not sure if I will be back. Total check was $270 including a $65 bottle of Cotes Du Rhone

It's a chicken bowl from Ross J's!Ross J's is hella cheap, hella tasty and the service is hella friendly. Total island vibe I am feelin' up in here.  I could roll up all sweaty from the gym (which I have), roll out of bed with drool crust on my face (which I haven't) and I think the people would still be cool to me. They treat everyone like family. Hell, half the people there probably are related!GRUB ON THIS: It's all about the Spicy Korean Chicken Bowl for $3.65. No, it's not that spicy, but it's moist and action packed with Hawaii 5-O flavor. Yes, the chicken has skin so I try to pick most of it off. The portion sizes are for sumo wrestlers and circus elephants so it can no joke feed me for 2.5 meals. Do add extra veggies for $1.10 more. I've also had the lumpia and although it is fried to perfection the guts just seem flavorless and not worth the extra fat and calories in my opinion. The chicken bowl alone is a mouthwatering meal not worth missing.PEEP THIS:http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/SueEpC916vd8Lo3Lyl9_pQ?select=ZcrwnR6ltufG0cOoIfwGew#SsckYmGiLl6vAjmFl0kLLAFYI: Take it from me. Takeout can be REALLY messy. The savory sauce MAY leak onto your leather car seat. Since it is 198 degrees outside here in Africa, Nevada you may want to keep an extra beach towel and swimsuit in your car. The towel will come in REAL handy about now. (The swimsuit is for spontaneous pool parties and/or mud wrestling.)  Ross J's is saving lives one bowl at a time, people. If you can't afford to take DA PLANE DA PLANE to the islands to get your Aloha on well whip out your board shorts and flip-flops and roll up here. It doesn't get cooler than this.I know that Ross J's has been around for quite some time.  Shame on me, that it took me this long to eat here. I'm in the area from time to time and have been to Blue Fin and Sumo, but never here until recent.  The food at Ross J's is comfort island food to me.  Here, you can get pretty much the same dishes that the rest of the Hawaiian joints have.  But here, the prices are cheap and the portions are huge. We arrived one early evening for a quick dinner with friends.  I ended up getting their Loco Moco and Portuguese Sausage Masubi.  Total came to about $7, which is a steal.  Both were full of favor and did I mention the servings?  My Loco Moco had enough rice that was drenched in gravy, topped with eggs, and complimented with two hamburger patties.  If I'm in the area, specifically in this side of Henderson, I now know where to go if I'm craving some comfort food at a great deal.

So when I jus happened to be in the area, there was no doubt what I was gonna have for lunch.Came here at 11:30 and there was a little line forming already. Ordered my Spicy Korean Chicken with Mushrooms and onions. Threw some sriracha on there (which was on every table) and enjoyed how crispy the chicken was. The onions and mushrooms were the cherry on top. All of this was sittin on top of steamed white rice. I love the teriyaki sauce they put on top. It was just the right amount to bring all the flavors together like a very good orchestral symphony. Service was surprisingly fast based off of the customers that ordered before me. Im actually glad I got in at the time I did because around 12, the place got packed quick! That's always a good sign of a good establishment.Prices are really good for the portions that you get. What I got was supposedly one of the bowl options. Seemed more like a stretched out oblong plate. Mind you they have actual plate combos that give you even more food.Since all I had was the chicken, I know I have way more reasons to come back here to try out the other great items. 4 solid stars.Ross J's Hawaiian Barbecue is where the ninth island meets the sunset and mountain Vista. Las Vegas is referred to as the ninth island. The Las Vegas valley is interspersed with outstanding restaurants serving Hawaiin barbecue. At the northwest corner of Sunset Road and Mountain Vista Boulevard in the Smith's - Galaxy Theater anchored shopping center, Ross J's Hawaiian Barbecue has built a reputation for their plate lunch Hawaiin barbecue dishes.    A plate lunch consists of two scoops of rice (usually white), macaroni salad, and an entrée. The plate lunch tradition dates back to the 1800s when the Plantation workers sustained on leftover rice with food such as canned meat, teriyaki, and cold meat. In 1999, L&L made the plate lunch popular on the mainland. In 2015, I developed a taste for the plate lunch thanks to L&L Hawaiian Barbecue. It is this taste for Hawaiian barbecue that has led me into Ross J's a few times recently.     Everytime that I stepped inside, it has been abuzz with people. Ross J's obviously has a good name in the valley.     In contrast to L&L and Island Flavor, the Ross J's system is different. Here you order the food and pay. From the point that you pick up your beverage cup, you seat yourself and they deliver the food to your table. Plus they will bus your table. The delicious food that they deliver to your table is presented on a plate instead of a styraphon box. Every table features condiments that include chili sauce, soy sauce, Sriracha sauce, salt, and pepper.     The restaurant itself is nothing beautiful. The shopping center could use a remodel. The restaurant interior with its sufficient seating is ordinary. Many times in life it's not the beauty on the outside that counts but the beauty on the inside that counts. The beautiful taste of the abundant portions of good food is what counts with me.     On my first visit, I enjoyed the mixed plate. In plate lunch terminology a mixed plate is a plate lunch with more than one entrée. This mixed plate featured teriyaki steak, chicken, Machi, lots of white rice, and macaroni salad. I enjoyed it so much that I'd return to Ross J's a second time. This time I experienced the mochiko chicken plate lunch. Six pieces of chicken occupied a good portion of the plate, white rice nearly half, and macaroni salad a quarter of it. Following this visit, some of my Yelp friends boasted about how great the Spicy Korean chicken was. In Yelp friends I trust, and made a third visit for the spicy Korean chicken. These Yelp friends were right on the mark because the spicy chicken with some Sriracha sauce over it was my favorite.     Ross J's Hawaiian Barbecue lives up to its name. I see myself returning, especially since I frequently shop at Smith's. The next time I will most likely take out a plate lunch to enjoy across the street in the Ethal M Cactus Gardens. Before I return I give Ross J's Hawaiian Barbecue my stamp of approval with this four star rating.
Little Dumpling=FINALLY! A Chinese place that doesn't suck in Henderson, and they offer Thai food too! With a house full of hungry people wanting Chinese food and not wanting another lame experience I turned to Yelp! (of course) but the reviews for Little Dumpling left me unsure. But I took a chance and ordered. Sometimes you swing and miss, but once in a while you can knock one out of the park and Little Dumpling was a home run with everyone. In depth details....here we go. Straight from the Eat24 online order receipt which made ordering a breeze! 22. Chicken Lo Mein  - My 2 year old loved it. So much so that when we took his plate away thinking he was done he asked me to bring it back. That's ultra rare.  35. Sweet and Sour Chicken  - Premium chicken, great flavor, no skimpy food here.  79. Vegetable Egg Foo Young  - When this gets compared to our gold standard Chinese place we used to love in Denver, and is ranked even better than that...what else can I say about it? They loved it!  92 Thai Tea   - The nice lady at the counter almost forgot this until I asked her to double check the order. I'm sure glad she did...it was pretty dang good if I do say so.  42. Kung Pao Chicken  - Good, but not great. Why? It needed a bit more spice. Every dish seen here was medium spiced...but Kung Pao needs to be hot. Fiery hot. This one...was just good. Still loved it enough that I'll order it again.  38. General Tso's Chicken  - My wife puts me to shame when it comes to being a critic and when she says it doesn't suck and she smiles from ear to ear...yeah, this one made my house happy let me tell ya.  8. Pot Sticker  - OMG. These ain't the crappy potstickers other places try and stick you with. These are premium meat hand made masterpieces with a little kick of spice that slapped my tongue around.  3. Crab Rangoon - Holy crap, they put the crab into the crab rangoons and you can taste it. This ain't the cream cheese wontons that other places call crab rangoon. This is the good stuff.  9. Chicken Teriyaki on a Stick -  Good, enjoyable, will order again, but not my personal favorite. If you've read this far know this. They are hidden in behind Starbucks and tucked in behind Walgreens. If you can't find it go to Walgreens and use their driveup pharmacy lanes. When you are at the window for Walgreens your headlights would shine right into Little Dumpling. Will I go back? Heck yes. I dropped almost $70 on Chinese food here and this is the first time I've finished eating with everyone and nobody said it sucked. That's ultra rare as I seem to live with a lot of critics. And when they compare it to our all time favorite places...enough said. For a first impression Little Dumpling made one heck of a good impression. Add on Service with a Smile, and they boxed everything up and it was easy to carry it all out...oh and one last thing. Their spicy Chinese mustard will sneak up on you and kick your ass. Sorry for the profanity but you've been warned. 4 Stars...don't want to jinx them with a 5, I'll save that last star for a review of their Thai offerings. If they nail the Thai food...that 5th Star will be posted.The lunch specials are great here! I had the "Pineapple Chicken" lunch special priced at just $5.95 and it came with soup and fried rice. The "Egg Drop Soup" was fantastic! It was a comforting soup on a chilly day. The amount of chicken surprised me. It tasted very good. The outside was crispy and the center tender. The rice was cooked perfectly and there was a good amount of that too. I had a coupon that gave me 2 free "Egg Rolls" with a purchase of $15 or more. The egg rolls (veggie) were a bit on the greasy side, but tasted good. I was having lunch with friends and stopped in to order the food to-go. When we were about to have lunch and the food was getting set out, we noticed some "Fried Wontons" with our food that I didn't order. I have no idea what was in them, but they were greasy and good! Everybody enjoyed them so it was a nice and unexpected bonus!They deliver and lunch specials are from 11am - 4 pm.Dumpling is in their name and I didn't try one! Darn it... next time! I did try their Kung Pao Triple lunch special. For $6.25 I got a combination of beef, pork & shrimp along with fried rice and soup. Not bad! It tasted good too. I felt my wife got a bigger portion in her lunch special that was mere .30 less than mine but I had a nice combo of meats. I have eaten at another little Dumpling location across town and have no idea if they are connected but this location is much better. This is a great place for lunch.I have a yelpy resolution to dine at several Chinese restaurants in the Las Vegas Valley. As 2014 transitions into the New Year, my Chinese restaurants list will grow. I aim to review fifty Chinese restaurants by 2016. This review of Little Dumpling Chinese Restaurant is my most recent fulfillment of this yelpy resolution. It is based on my recent visit during lunch before Acacia Demonstration Gardens.   Little Dumpling is actually the Hidden Dumpling. It is buried in the small Starbuck's strip mall on the Northeast corner of Horizon Ridge Parkway at Stephanie Street  by Walgreen's.   The parking lot is too cramped that there is a greater risk of a car dent. Just as I do when I visit the Starbuck's here, I walk a short distance further to park by Walgreen's.   This is essentially a take-out setting with a handful of tables and unadorned walls. The silverware and plates is throwaway paper and plastic. This is the quintessential setting for a Chinese restaurant lunch special.   The lunch specials that end at 4 PM cost between $5.95 and $6.25. The shrimp based entrees cost $6.25. The lunch specials include chow mein noodles or fried rice with the soup of the day. Of course the soup of the day is egg drop soup. With the addition of a beverage, the lunch special comes out to $8 and change. I ordered the shrimp chop suey. It was okay. I have tasted better, that is for sure. They did give a fair amount of shrimp.   There is a flaw in the design of the restaurant. That is that the restroom is too close for comfort to the tables. Little Dumpling ought to invest in a louder vent or something to block out noises that are not conducive to the customer enjoying their meal.   In my opinion Little Dumpling is an okay Dumpling. I have no urgency to return.
Jason's Deli=I have a Love/Hate Relationship with Jason's.I LOVE that:~They have a Huge Menu of sandwiches, salads, soups, pasta etc.~They have baked potatoes bigger than my head~Their simple but perfect salad bar~The ginger bread muffins at the salad bar * 1 reason alone to go*~The assortment of wrapped crackers at the salad bar~Everything  looks so good and is so big~They always have some new "special" when I go in~If you have room after lunch you can help your self to a soft serve ice cream coneI HATE that:~They are always packed liked sardines~They aren't very clean~They serve a pile of greasy broken ruffles with the sandwiches~The Tuna isn't good~There is barely room to walk between the tables~The sandwiches aren't ever as good as I want them to be, but are OK nonetheless (see pics)***3.5 starsI routinely order Jason's Deli sandwich and wrap trays for working lunches at my office.  Ordering from their online site is a cinch and delivery is always a few minutes early, or on time to the minute.  Their delivery drivers are also professional and friendly as well.  The food is always fresh and delicious each and every time, and it always comes with all the plates, napkins, utensils, ice, cups and other accoutrements needed to serve it too.  Among my personal favorite items from Jason's are their wraps, and in particular their vegetarian wrap with mushrooms, Asiago cheese, bell peppers and Romaine lettuce).  Their Chicken Alfredo pasta is just amazing for lunch on a cold day and another favorite item for a cold day is their Tomato Basil soup which is absolutely delicious and served with a side of soft bread.  Another big plus about catering from Jason's Deli for work lunches is that you accumulate 'Deli Dollars' with each order and over the course of a year's worth of office lunches I had accumulated enough Deli Dollars to pay for all the food for my teenage daughter's 15th birthday party.  Then by the next year I had accumulated enough Deli Dollars once again to cater the food my baby daughter's 1st birthday.  It was wonderful to be able to hold each birthday party for the girls and not have to worry at all about preparing the food.I had Jason's Deli catered in today and the only thing wrong with today's lunch was that the pasta salad was very oily (which isn't normal for them) but aside from that I have absolutely no complaints about today's lunch delivery...Rock on Jason's, rock on.Met Rand H and Mike C and Jackie C here for lunch today.  For a chain they do a pretty good job of making sandwiches, salads and soups.  And in the American tradition almost anything you order is more than you really need.  But it is good and you keep eating! :)Jason's Deli never disappoints..One of my go-to's when choosing a place to eat for lunch!Items I choose are : Soups - Tortilla Soup, Broccoli Cheddar or Tomato BasilSandwiches - Tuna Melt, Reuben, Beefeater (roast beef on French bread to be dipped in a cup of au jus), or Wild Salmon-wichPasta - Zucchine Garden PastaMixed Fruit - served with their creamy, fruit dipThey do a half-half deal.. Half sandwich & cup of soup OR half sandwich with side salad! And they also do a build-your-own sandwich! Most of the menu items come with a side of chips and/or fruit! Good price for quality and quantity you get!
Abuelo's=This was really good! I have passed by here a 100 times and never been in. I was missing out! I love the cheesy decor that others have talked about in their reviews. I like it, gives it some charm and family feel for a chain. Almost feels like you are outdoors. Lets start with the Sangria. Mmmmm. That was some good stuff! The chips come out with three differnt salsa's. I loved 2 of the 3 and there was nothing wrong with the 3rd, just not my cup of tea. I had a shredded beef burrito smothered in cheese with guacamole. It was really good. Very flavorful and I would get it again in a second. The rice and beans were very good as well but next time I want to try the potatoes with chili. I had a bite of someone elses plate and they were fantastic, I was very jealous! Server was very friendly, fast, and kept our water filled and checked on us. Prices were reasonable and they have an email club that you get buy one get one free for your birthday. I will be back to try more menu items soon.Typical suburbanite "Mexican" food with no fresh ingredients. If you're looking for something like Macayo's, but less tasty, this is your spot. It was very crowded today, which was a good sign. I saw tons of seniors here (that makes sense, given the name), and it's because they have a huge senior menu for them. They come from a time where food was not nearly this fake, so I refuse to believe they actually think this is good stuff.Let's get the good stuff out of the way--the bar. $3 margaritas made with 1800 tequila? Perfectly blended in a 12 oz.. cup? Yes, please! It's awesome seeing a happy hour on Sunday afternoon, so this was a pleasant surprise. They also had the "cerveza rita", served in a goblet with a coronita (7 oz. corona bottle) stuck in it. Outside of the blended drinks, it looked like nothing special. You're out of your mind if you think I'm paying $17 for a bottle of Sutter Homes. Most of their wine list is the swill I'd use for wine pong, but that's another story.The chips and salsa were decent. The hot stuff is one of the better salsas I've had in the valley, perhaps it was made with smoked poblano? I want to buy a bottle for myself. The seven layer dip was tolerable since I was so hungry. refried beans, ground beef, sliced green chili, sour cream, guac, and of course, cheese sauce. Perhaps the seventh layer was the suspicious film on the dip when it was brought to our table. Questionable.My entree arrived, and I was disappointed just by looking at it. Why did the beans already look dry? Perhaps they were overcooked? It was as if they were sitting under a heat lamp for quite some time. The rice was decent, but also dry. My fajita chicken chimi looked a bit...narrow, and the tortilla didn't look properly fried. I freaking love chimichungas, so I had to dig in post haste! Most disappointing chimi I've ever had. Once during finals week, I was so busy that I bought some fajita chicken in a bag, complete with the fake grill marks. I recognized the taste right away, and proceeded to dissect my meal. There were cubes and 'strips' of chicken...and eureka! The fake grill marks. At home, this is tolerable in a pinch. For $11 at arrowhead? This is a piece of shit!If you EVER see me check in here, it's for the tapas and margaritas during happy hour. I'll be sitting at the swank bar, flirting with some octogenarian's daughter who came here against her will. Outside of that, Abuelo's ain't up to snuffBar-3.5Food-1I had a date with Mama Jo last night and she chose Abuelo's. Though she pronounced it Aruba's. And the Ablegos. We finallly figured it out and arrived to a very bustling restaurant.It definitely has the look of a medium end Vegas casino restaurant meets Macayo's...but all in all, I liked the decor, very bright and "atrium" like. We were greeted & seated, immediately and with kindness and professionalism. As we were being escorted to our table, I'm taking in the ambience, VERY busy and a HUGE crowd of SMALL little girls, half dressed in tu tu's. I kid you not. I thought it was teen drag night at a gay bar for a moment. As we nestled into our booth away from the screaming tweens, our delightful, delightful server, Ashley, informed us they were on the way to the Justin Beiber concert. How cute is that? Cuter that they were finished and leaving, but I digress.I have to say, I truly appreciate a lot of chain restaurant requirements of the service staff. I like being asked if I've been in before. The specials. Soups of the day. Etc., etc. As long as they are not robotic and comfortable and smiling, I'm all ears. Five stars for Ashley.Mom & I hadn't been out in awhile as we've (aka, ME) have been busy packing up for our move to Minneapolis. But she is as charming as she is lovely and it was nice to spend time with her outside of the house. We started with chips, three kinds of salsa (all explained, which I really appreciated) and an order of guacamole. I loved the THIN, crispy and fresh chips though they struggled to pick up the yummy, chunky guacamole without breaking. Oh, the problems we have!!!We both ordered enchiladas, mom had ground beef and I went for cheese and a carnitas. Carnitas was sad and dry. Much like my Aunt Helen towards her final years. But the sauce was pretty flavorful. A big plus for the frijoles which had a great pork flavor infused and Papas Chiles...amazing, mashed taters with cheese. Carb city!We finished with the obligatory chain chocolate lava cake. All in all for a chain restaurant, it was dang good. Ashley checked in when appropriate. I noticed two other nearby servers and their demeanor with guests and was most impressed.So, Aruba's, er um Ablegos or wait Abuelo's, I might see ya before I move!
Brewer's Cafe=The salad bar is legit! Fresh, crisp veggies, variety of cheeses, egg, grilled chicken, homemade dressings AND they have brick oven cheese pizza, soups and a baked potato section. All you can eat for $5 plus drink purchase. Why do I choose this place over the "Sweet Round Red Things" place? -No wait usually. Great service.-No screaming, coughing maniac kids rubbing boogers on the booths-It's dark, but light enough to read-If I am with someone who doesn't do salad bars they can order a burger and I can steal their fries:)It's nothing fancy, but it's just right for me when I am eating clean.What's the best beer? Cold beer.Now and then after a 1 star day at work I visit Barley's to enjoy a cold microbrew draft beer and Caveman Keno. The atmosphere and beer elevates a 1 star day to at least 3 stars.  Barley's is an institution at Sunset and Mountain Vista that dates back to the late 90s. Barley's website alleges that it is the Valley's oldest and Henderson's only microbrewery. Barley's attraction is its microbrewery. It is a microbrewery that produces Black Mountain Beer, Boulder Gold Hefeweizen, Blue Diamond Beer, and Red Rock Original. For the record my favorite is the Blue Diamond Beer. The bartenders or mixotoligists serving the beer have been friendly, going so far as to introduce themselves. The upshot of this popular institution, is that the bar is often filled-to-capacity.   In similar fashion to several small businesses, Barley's sold out to a bigger company. Today Station Casinos owns Barley's. The Station preferred card is as good as gold in Barley's. Not only does Barley's gaming machines accept the Station preffered card, they also grant players a "get out of paying for a drink pass" when you put money in the machine. In my case, it works out. I put $5 in the Caveman Keno machine and when all is said and done, I break even because the $5 really paid for the open beer that is elevating a 1 star day to a 3 or above star day.   Gaming is fun in Barley's. This is not one of those bars that only offers video poker. This is a bar that features the gaming machines with a spectacular selection of Keno games. And these machines are not stiff. The last time I played at Barley's, Lady Luck struck and I won $100s. That is about the equivalent of 50 Happy Hour Barley drafts. So, sometimes Barley's has the power to elevate a 1 star day to a 5 star day.  Currently,  Barley's Happy Hour is Monday through Friday at the hours of 4 to 7. $2 drafts are the stars of Happy Hour. The Station Preferred card is the star of Barley's. If your gambling, the drinks are on the house.  Barley's is more than a casino, bar, and microbrewery. It is also a restaurant. In recent times I dined there once. To put it nicely their beer is better tasting and a better value than their BLT. A glance away from the restaurant is the brick oven pizza. Although I never tried it, the scent from the brick oven adds a nice scent over the bar.  When you visit Barley's you will come out a winner. That's unless you drink and drive. If the Red Rocks and Blue Diamonds are so good that you've had way too many, there are a few nearby sobering up opportunities. Nextstore is the Galaxy Theaters. Nearby are some decent restaurants including Olive Garden. There is a Smith's. And the CAT bus travels along Sunset Road to Town Square and the Galleria.Hate to give this place 2 stars. In actuality, the service here definitely deserves 5. But unfortunately, the food here was not up to par with the great service that I had received.This cafe is inside of the Barleys casino, a legendary ol school mini casino which brews its own beers. It's a very simple place and its serves a fairly basic menu. The waitress that took my order was great, she was helpful and friendly.The first thing I ordered were the shrimp cocktail. The shrimp were either undercooked or just the frozen ready-to-eat ones, but they were sorta slimy and not sweet at all. The cocktail sauce was gross, it tasted basically like bottled ketchup.The next thing that came up were the chili fries. It was canned chili beans on not-so-crispy shoestring fries. I had about 3 bites, and I was done. One of the hardest things I've ever had to eat.The Reuben was next. Ok, so it wasn't that bad. I thought that the rye bread could have been crispier, but the flavor was pretty good. The corned beef tasted like it was premade, and so did the dressing. I was thankful that they had at least rinsed the sauerkraut, because it wasn't too sour. The coleslaw didn't taste like anything at all, probably came from a jar.The food tasted like it was all made a while ago, and probably came from a can. I prefer things that are made fresh. But the food is nostalgic in a way. And it reminds us how far we have gotten since then. Too bad that the food couldn't hold a candle to the amazing front of the house staff that works there. But as I always say "Que sera, sera".
Buster's On the Lake=Hidden in the shopping center just north of Via De Ventura on the West side of Hayden is Buster's.  Buster's, along with a Chipotle, a flower shop, and some other businesses that I hope to make a better mental note of next visit... I could easily have gone along with my life and not noticed Buster's although I drive by the area all of the time.  But, when my friend Allyson suggested it as a central spot for a few girlfriends to meet for dinner one Tuesday night, I went along with the plan.  I'm always up for trying some place new!Buster's offers traditional bar food along with some seafood, steak, and specialty items.  We chose to sit in the bar although none of us partook in their happy hour (which goes until 7).  Aside from the waitstaff, we were the youngest people in the place (by a decade or two).Nothing really stood out, and the food was fine.  Not amazing.  Not bad.  Just fine.  I had a Greek Salad with chicken and my two friends each ordered 1/2 portions of the lavosh pizza and side salads.  They seemed happier with their orders than I was.  I will point out that the lavosh pizzas do not come with any kind of sauce on them but marinara is available for dipping upon request.The bill was under $20 a person out the door but then again, we didn't order much.  I wouldn't choose Buster's as a 'go-to' place again, but I wouldn't be opposed to giving it another shot sometime either.  PS - I didn't notice the musty and damp carpet smell (maybe they replaced it, Natalie!)Some colleagues invited me for lunch the other day and decided to pick this place.  It was my first visit.  After browsing the menu for a few minutes, I decided to order the California Wrap (Spinach, Tomatoes, Avocado, Feta Cheese, Sun-Dried Tomato Vinaigrette Dressing, Tomato Basil Tortilla, $8.95) with a side of Cole Slaw & Iced Tea.I took one bite out of the California Wrap and was in Heaven!!!  The sweet flavor of Sun-Dried Tomato Vinaigrette Dressing was a perfect compliment to the Feta Cheese & Avocado....the Cole Slaw was amazing too!  What a great combo!The only knock on this experience is that the service was kind of slow.  We had to constantly look for our waiter....to order.....to ask for extra napkins.....to get refills....to get our check.  Maybe we caught him on a bad day?  Because I enjoyed my meal so much, I'll give him the benefit of the doubt.Return Factor - 92%
Pinnacle Peak Patio=After a day of climbing Tom's Thumb at the McDowell Mountains, we decided to sit our butts down here and have some beer.  Taylor, Travis and I were bellying up to the bar, and there wasn't another patron there.  Still, it took the bartender 5 minutes to come over and say hello.  We asked for menus and said that we were hoping for delicious beer.  He then walked away.  %&$*@?  Why?  He was the only one and he was making drinks for the entire restaurant.  This was a Saturday evening at 7pm.  Again, WTF?   It took another 10 minutes before we could order food.  Beer was good, food was good, not going to bother with the details though because this is where it gets odd.We asked for the check and I went to the bathroom.  When I returned, (5-10 min later), he then TELLS us that we owe $33.50.  No check printed or presented.  Then we hand him 2 $20's and get $3.50 in change back.  I'm no accounting wiz, but he is WAY off.  This guy was judging us by the time we sat down.  I will never return to this place.  It is a shame that dress dictates service.Another tourist spot. This place is not about the food as much as it is about the novelty and character. Fun spot for kids and families!And, even if you've been there a million times, SOMEONE ought to wear a tie just for giggles.How can you not love a Phoenix classic? Yes, this is a tourist establishment. Yes this place can get pretty cheesy with a huge play on western life. And yes, it's not five star dining. But here's why Pinnacle Peak Patio will always hold a special place in my heart. It's a Phoenix right of passage for anyone who remembers Phoenix when there was nothing but desert past Frank Lloyd Wright Road, driving to Pinnacle Peak Road felt like going on a road trip to the middle of nowhere and the only restaurants to choose from were spots like Durant's, Pink Pony and the Sugar Bowl. Yes, Pinnacle Peak Patio is a tourist spot, but it's always a great family spot and even just a fun spot to make it a night out and act like a tourist in your own city.So what's Pinnacle Peak Patio all about? Well, there's a faux western village, there are hay rides, there's a "pretend like your a saloon girl/cowboy" photo opportunity, they have saw dust on the floors, live country bands and picnic tables/benches for seating. Oh and definitely wear a tie when you go. Just do it, make sure it's not your favorite tie and enjoy the ride. The food is sub par and exactly what you would expect from a place like this...one or two steps above your backyard BBQ food. It's lively, you can be casual, you can bring as many kids as you want and whether you admit it or not, you'll have a good time as long as you walk in knowing what to expect. Yeehaw, I'm out!
Burger King=The snowbirds are back to the Sun Lakes area in force and the inept and overwhelmed staff at this Burger King couldn't handle it.  Not that they were that busy but these guys needed about 20 minutes per order and were only hitting accuracy at about 40% or so.I haven't been to a BK in a long time so my FFF radar was down (Fast Food Fubar).  A buy one get one coupon lured us in.I actually felt bad for one guy that seemed to be in charge.  My daughter and I stood back and watched the carnage for the first fifteen minutes waiting for our order.  Then we received our sandwiches that were not the right sandwiches.  Then we returned them and waited some more.  Then we just got a refund and left.But during that time we watched the cashier wander around and attempt to help in a hesitant fashion as if she had never been behind the counter before.  The one guy in the kitchen seemed overwhelmed, easily confused and uncertain what the difference was between say bacon, sausage and eggs.  And the guy I felt bad for kept flitting from the drive up "Oh my God that guy has been waiting 14 minutes!" to the kitchen "No, this goes here.  We're out of biscuits!

Blue Burrito Grille=I like this place.  It has so much potential.  The concept is 1/2 Fast Food & 1/2 Full Service Restaurant.....it's a 'Tweener'!  Let me explain......Fast Food Elements+ You order at a counter, menu on boards against the wall.+ They call for your number & you pick up your food at the counter....food is served on plastic plates & trays, like many fast food restaurants.+ Food comes out relatively fast.+ Self Serve Salsa Barhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/emtAyZPvp_0b40levOzcnA?select=bJL2f4dqLkQZePWU13UCswFull Service Restaurant Elements+There's bar seating w/Alcohol service.+ Food quality is a notch above Fast Food.+ Food prices are nearly the same as full service restaurants.+ Complimentary Chips & Salsa.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/emtAyZPvp_0b40levOzcnA?select=0LCjnbhWGXS6ZMtp_137eAI've been here a few times....being on my no Meat diet, I have some good choices here.Bean & Cheese Burrito, $5.49http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/emtAyZPvp_0b40levOzcnA?select=hJcWsnkgB9Br9ZnpFV7NLANachos w/Cheese & Beans, *Hint* Get the Kid's Meal for $4.99http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/emtAyZPvp_0b40levOzcnA?select=yrX3FWg6cyzFNi5HvQuwEAQuesadilla, $4.99http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/emtAyZPvp_0b40levOzcnA?select=OgFy34v2UTeOvSSc4ffy0gThe food is pretty good....not great.  I enjoy coming here to grab a quick bite.  The other big bonus for me is that they have Arizona Gunslinger Hot Sauce available here....http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/emtAyZPvp_0b40levOzcnA?select=FJbrO9TXOs5J-gp_psFn0wThis Hot Sauce packs a nice punch and I pour it generously on my food....yum!Overall, it's not a bad joint......way better than Taco Bell, just under Full Service joints.Return Factor - 90%I was a little hesitant to try this place, as it hasn't really been reviewed well. However, I'm glad I trusted my gut (not the hungry part, the sensible part)!When I walked in, the dining room was absolutely packed! Obviously, it's a popular destination. So, I took a minute to see what looked best to me. After a few minutes perusing their menu, I opted for the Shrimp Burrito. The young lady behind the counter informed me that it would take about five minutes for my order to be ready. So, I took my drink to the dining room and waited.As I was waiting, I passed by their full bar. I wasn't really in the market for an alcoholic beverage during lunch, so I didn't really price anything. The fact that this bar exists, though...that's the important thing! The self-serve chips and salsa bar was really cool! It's similar to ones that you would find at Baja Fresh, except for the endless chips. That's a pretty nice touch, in my opinion.After about five minutes (a touch longer, but I wasn't in a hurry), my burrito was ready. Size wise, my burrito was comparable to ones that you find at Chipotle or Qdoba. However, the difference maker for me was the actual content. I made sure to pay extra close attention to the amount of shrimp contained in my burrito. I've been burned at places before when they skimped on contents. Not here. EVERY single bite I took was accompanied by a full shrimp...and I don't take small bites. For $8.85, I was definitely impressed. If you're in the market for a sort of change of pace with regards to your Mexican food, you should check out Blue Burrito Grille. If you need more incentive, they do have a couple of televisions, free Wi-Fi, and a nice patio. The patio is covered by umbrellas, but it doesn't have misters or anything like that. So, if you want to sit outside, make sure you get in on the action before it gets hot!
Firebirds Wood Fired Grill=This place is the rip off of all rip offs. My boyfriend and I decided to go there for lunch over the summer. We ordered drinks from the bar, ridiculously priced for a restaurant during the day, $9.50 for some mojitos? Come on. They weren't that good. Now we were starving when we arrived, I ordered the tilapia and asparagus and he order the meatloaf and potatoes. We received our food and he dug in right away. I just sat and looked at mine. "Fourteen dollars for this? How much was yours, eleven dollars?" My boyfriend looks at my plate and could only say, "That's it?" He received a FULL plate of meatloaf and the other half of mashed potatoes. I had six stalks of asparagus and a piece of fish the size of a child's hand. That was it. I called the waiter over and asked him if all the fish were this size and he said he thought so and there was nothing wrong with my meal. I asked him if this was worth $14 to him and he said he thought so. I told him, "I'm not from Scottsdale, I would like to see the manager." The manager walks over and proceeds to actually argue with me about the food saying that it is perfectly fine. I said, "It may be fine, it may taste great, but I'm still going to be hungry after this $14 meal. I would at least like another piece of fish." He tells me for $6 he could get me one more piece of fish and I tell him I'm not paying that for another piece this size. At this point my boyfriend is offering me his food, but that's not what I wanted. Finally I tell the manager just take it back, I'm sorry to see you toss that but you are doing nothing to satisfy this customer. He literally did nothing but argue with me. I wasn't trying to get a free meal, I just wanted to get what I was paying for. Rude people, overpriced food, crappy bar. Take your business somewhere else.Damn I failed my own suggestions. We had some drinks here... the billreflected it too. I had a burger, which was perfect. Baked spud. 1 Captain and Coke which seemed a little lacking, so I asked the waitress to have them make it a little stronger the next time. Yep... charged for a double. So MY drink tab was almost 20 for two drinks. My beautiful wife had a killer salad, added chicken and split a bottle of wine with a BFF. $34 for the bottle. Some how the bill was $95 including tip. WTF 95-20-17=58 For a salad and a burger??? I am calling the manager.The daughter and I made another trip to Phoenix last week and we did what we always do while in AZ:  we tend to frequent a lot of chain restaurants and this is a chain that we had yet to try.We came here with my Mom for a late lunch (after being picked up from the airport) around 2pm to a fairly empty restaurant. This place is land locked in between PF Chang's, Cheesecake Factory, Buco De Peppo, Elephant Bar, Red Robin and a slew of other fast and non fast food chains. Our waitress was really nice and we were all glad we brought in sweatshirts because like all AZ restaurants, it was freezing inside. The menu had a lot of great offerings and my Mom and I both chose wood-fired grilled salmon served with perfectly al dente veggies and for me, Parmesan mashed potatoes and Mom's with a baked potato. Daughter opted for some kind of salad with stinky cheese and a cup of their tortilla soup. We were also served fresh baked sourdough bread with cornmeal crust that had Kevin been with us, would have been replenished many many times. The bread was AWESOME. My salmon was cooked perfectly and was delicious. I was super pleased with my meal (it was huge for lunch and at $14.00 including the large helping of fresh vegetable was better than my favorite chain salmon that only comes with rice and 5 or 6 snow peas). The daughter LOVED her salad (I didn't taste it due to the stinky cheese) and the soup was flavorful but thick like the kind Chili's serves and not in a good way. I would come back here in a heartbeat and avoid some of the other monstrosities  around.
Einstein Bros Bagels=I agree with Dani. This Einsteins Bagels is slow! I went here this morning just to pick up a Hate to Wait Basket and I had to wait for the Hate to Wait Basket. First,  I had to wait in a long line until the Bagel Man decided to take the guy's order 3 people ahead of me. Before than he was dilly dallying around throwing bagels in the slicer. Second, it seemed that they were preparing a big order, because I had to wait again until the manager was free to pick the bagels to throw in the basket. Does it really take 3 people out of 5 to prepare one order. To top it off, the cashier was making small talk to the police officer in front of me. He was telling him his woes of ringing up the order and how sometimes how he needs to be creative in typing in the order. PLEASE, shut up and let the man pay for his grub!! Don't get me wrong. I like small talk, but not when folks are trying to get their day started.Bagels are great. We love this location. My child goes crazy as soon as we pull up. Super helpful and cheerful employees. Overall great store.
Tokyo Lobby Sushi and Grill=Lali J. and I took a road trip to Tokyo Lobby last night. We'd heard about it through excellent reviews in the New Times and the Republic (a positive review in the Republic is often a neon sign that says "stay away," but we decided to risk it). As a transplanted New Yorker/San Franciscan/Los Angeleno, I have to say Tokyo Lobby has been my favorite sushi experience in the valley. If you're used to Ra or any of the other McSushi places, it's worth the schlep up to North Glendale (which is almost as far as the Yukon from where we live) to check this place out.T.L. is a small, 10 table joint, but it's crowded in a vibrant, fun way. Service is fast and friendly. It's in a strip mall, but if you keep your eyes left of center as you approach from the parking lot, you won't see the WalMart on your right. The usual/traditional suspects are brilliant -- stunning unagi, maguro, tobiko, etc. The sides and appetizers were fab, too: great seaweed salad and gyoza. Tokyo Lobby is creative with the specialty rolls -- the Marilyn Mon-Roll (not kidding) was terrific: a spicy tuna roll wrapped in albacore with an elegant topping of crispy/crunchy onion.There's also a full menu of earthbound flesh and assorted other goodies. Everything looked great. Really -- check this place out!"I've cut a bitch for less..."This is the response I received from my Partner in Culinary Crime after demonstrating my mad chopstick skills to scoop up a wayward spicy scallop.   You see, the creations at Tokyo Lobby are worth fighting for.  Every last morsel.  Of course I am going to risk life and limb!!   :)Before moving AZ, I was told by friends who were familiar with my sushi-loving ways that I had to try Tokyo Lobby.  Nearly two years later, it was finally time to take their advice - we headed west into the uncharted territory of... Glendale!That first visit was spectacular, and since then we have been back multiple times for both lunch and dinner.  Sometimes twice in the same week - it is really that good. We have tried a variety of items, but so far the favorites are:- Hamachi Toro - yellowtail belly sashimi- Spicy Scallops- Chicago Roll - salmon on spicy crab and scallops- What the Heck Roll - I can only describe this as spicy tuna heaven, with some jalapeno tossed in just because it is fun...Try any and all of these with their fresh wasabi and citrus-infused ponzu.  Amazing!!Top this off with a large beer (Ichiban, please!) and hot sake for only $5.From the fresh and perfectly prepared fish to the friendly and attentive owners and staff, a visit to Tokyo Lobby is really a pleasure.  If Glendale is not what immediately comes to mind when you think of sushi, it will be soon!  Tanoshinde!!Craving some sushi, I got a chance to go to Tokyo Lobby for the first time the other night.  After reading a few of my fellow Yelper's reviews on this place I was excited to find good sushi and sashimi on the West Side ~ in Glendale of all places!To my amazement and bewilderment Tokyo Lobby serves some of the freshest and most delicious sushi I've had in the Phoenix metro including Scottsdale!  Wowsers! Why did it take me so long to find this place? Well it's a tiny place joined to a shoe store located in front of the "super-duper-take-your-money-and-run-Walmart-center" at 57th & Bell.  Since I hate shopping at "wally world" I have been driving past them for months not knowing about this little gem of a sushi restaurant. I sat at the sushi bar where I could have a better view of the sushi maestro Kelvin Kim create the most wonderful sushi concoctions. The restaurant is very clean and nicely decorated with Asian art and a few TV's to watch the games. The sushi bar is the main attraction with Chef Kim and another sushi master working their magic.  The service was top notch, very accommodating and eager to please their customers.Food: Started with Hamachi Belly sashimi ~ very tasty, sweetest tasting tuna ever.  I ordered some fresh wasabi and ponzu sauce to go with my sushi rolls. I ordered the "what the heck" ~ nice punch of heat with great texture from the tuna and jalapeños and the Chicago roll ~ great blend of spicy crab/scallops with salmon.  Both were unique and outstanding!  Topped it all with a $5 sake bomb special ~ large Ichiban beer with hot sake.  "make it a double sake bomb pleeeeaaasseee!" Huge THANKS to my fellow Yelper's for recommending this little sushi gem! I am looking forward to my next visit and trying another one of Chef Kim's sushi creations. I recommend you try Tokyo Lobby next time your craving for sushi and hope to see you there!

Fanny's Bistro & Deli=Fanny's has some BOMB food and Bomb service. Actually everything about them is BOMB. (I'm using the word bomb because I'm currently obsessed with Bomb Pops.)Mom & Pop locally owned sandwich shop/deli doing everything right from the minute you walk in to the second you walk out the door.Walk in, sit down. Boom. The menu is on the table waiting for your hungry eyes. If you are smart you will order the Soup of the Day. My favorite is the homemade Chicken Noodle Soup. A cup is $2.99. My favorite sandwich is the California Club which has Turkey, Bacon, Avocado, Tomato, Swiss Cheese and Mayo. I always substitute the Swiss for Cheddar. You get your choice of bread for every sandwich. They have Rye, Sourdough, White, Wheat, Baguettes and Hoagies for you to choose from. The sliced breads which are INSANELY DELICIOUS are from Bon Bread Bakery. The hoagies and baguettes are from Great Buns and y'all already know how much love I have for that place. I go with the Rye toasted. It's sandwich perfection. Meats are Boar's Head and with that good bread this is a win-win situation for me every time. Sides are homemade Pasta Salad which I love or homemade Potato Salad which I haven't had yet. I also have to add I am in love with their strong Brawny style napkins. The food alone is worth five stars to me, but throw in friendly, fast service and they fall under Henderson All-Stars to me. Jill is the owner/waitress and you can tell she's been doing this for a white hot minute. She does the extra things such as putting your check face down to pay when you are ready. She also OFFERS you a To Go cup of your beverage without you even having to ask. Who does that? Jill the greatest waitress ever. That's who.Overall I am always, always impressed and satisfied when dining at Fanny's. If you ever happen to be in the neighborhood at the right time (Mon-Fri. 10-5p I think) make sure to stop in here for a bite. You won't regret it. Unless you are a weak person with no soul. Then you might regret it.
Red Lobster=I had the opportunity to try out the Red Lobster Lobsterfest the other night, my server was Jeanne! And she is amazing! Loved her and the great service she provided!Started the night out with lobster, crab & seafood stuffed mushrooms, Lobster pizza and Sweet Chili Shrimp, now everything tasted great but I have to say my favorite of those where the Sweet Chili Shrimp, holy cow those are great! Stop ordering the coconut shrimp (don't worry I love those too) and get these Sweet Chili Shrimp.For the entrees, get ready for this, we tried: Lobster In Paradise, Ultimate Surf & Turf, Dueling Lobster Tails, Lobster Lovers Dream, Seaport Lobster & Shrimp, Bar Harbor Lobster Bake   Everything was amazing!   Lobster in Paradise is split Maine Lobster tail fried in coconut batter, spicy grilled shrimp & lobster & shrimp bake topped with toasted crushed macadamia nutsUltimate Surf & Turf  is a Maine lobster tail stuffed a crab stuffing & baked with a peppercorn grilled sirloin topped with Maine lobster meat in a citrus hollandaise sauce comes with mashed potatoes roasted tomatoes & green beansDueling Lobster Tails are 2 Maine lobster tails, one topped with tender shrimp in a creamy garlic sauce and one stuffed with crab & seafood stuffing and comes with mashed potatoes, roasted tomatoes and green beans.Lobster Lovers Dream is Rock Lobster tail & a split Maine Lobster tail, roasted with lobster & shrimp linguini alfredoSeaport Lobster & Shrimp is wood grilled split Maine Lobster Tail, shrimp scampi, and skewered garlic grilled shrimp on a bed of wild rice pilafBar Harbor Lobster Bake is split Maine lobster tail, shrimp, scallops, mussels & linguini in a garlic & white wine brothWhile all these dishes are amazing, and every dish had something unique that set them aside from the other dish, my personal favorites where the skewered garlic shrimp, the Maine lobster tail, didn't matter if it was stuffed, baked, sauced, grilled it was DELISH! I also learned that I prefer the Maine Lobster over the Rock Lobster (Rock rock Rock Lobster Down down! B52's Rock Lobster)  I had lobster for days, and I still am craving the sweet Maine lobster & sweet chili shrimp!  And if you love the coconut shrimp you should for sure try the Lobster in Paradise, omg the lobster in the coconut batter was amazing!! To end the meal I tried the Red Velvet Cake in a Jar that was the perfect ending to a delicious feast! Also was able to meet the Manager Carrie and many other staff members including the chefs! It was a wonderful night and had fun trying so many dishes! I cannot wait to go back!Treated aunt to a belated birthday dinner (three other adults and two children dining; I only had a cocktail and two teensy flakes off of the top of a cheddar biscuit.  BE AWARE that EACH biscuit contains 8 grams of fat, 2.5 grams saturated, and a total of 150 calories.  They ordered *Berry-Mango daiquiris http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/red-lobster-chandler-2?select=d3bUfGn-UZ1bEq99wODlTg#d3bUfGn-UZ1bEq99wODlTg and I a *classic mojito. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/red-lobster-chandler-2?select=iNV2KvaH87Oqi9k_JefLFA#iNV2KvaH87Oqi9k_JefLFA  I heard that the berry-mango was a balanced mixture of fruit flavors, but the alcohol was hardly-detectable.  The alcohol flavor wasn't missed at all, though.  Everyone who had them "ooh"ed and "ahh"ed.  I wished a simple mango version was available, but I'm also glad it wasn't, or else I would never have found out that RL, or more specifically the bartender working that shift, served a TERRIFIC mojito!  My first sip disappointed, but once I swirled everything a few times with the straw, the drink actually turned out to be one of the best mojitos I've ever had!  It's a classic version, made with Bacardi Superior rum, muddled mint, pure cane sugar (don't like ones made with simple syrup-- too sweet), freshly-squeezed lime juice, and club soda.I would never be able to dine here (aversion to farm-raised fish, intolerance/allergy to whitefish, shellfish allergies, and Blue Bunny ice cream choices contain corn syrup), but I wouldn't mind enjoying a mojito while everyone else dines!  :)*Berry-mango daiquiri = 350 calories*Mojito = 190 caloriesI have to upgrade this place a star due to dealing with the Sun City crowd, let alone my Grandmother! This RL location is close to where both my Mom and Grandma live and as far as chain restaurants go, is pretty consistent where everyone can find something they like to eat. When we stayed a couple of nights in August, we came here as a family (husband, daughter, mom, G-ma and one other) and my Grandma arrived with the other party and lo and behold, she had forgotten her teeth at home! Our waitress was very understanding and suggested a couple of soft things for my Grandma to try. Needless to say, no one left hungry and Grandma like the lobster stuffed mushrooms she ordered and some of the shrimp pasta that came with my meal. Just recently, I was in Phoenix for a couple of nights before heading to Tucson for my cousin's wedding. Since my mom was working on my first night there, I asked my Grandma where she wanted to go for dinner letting her know I was not interested in her other "favorite" Elephant Bar, so this is where she chose to go. It was a Thursday night around 5:30 (late for her) and we were seated right away(there was a huge wait by the time we left). I made sure Grandma had everything she needed before leaving (including her teeth which we now joke about) and after debating the menu choices, decided that I would order the "Endless Shrimp" (knowing she would eat the salad and some of the shrimp that came with it) and she ordered  the lobster pizza. The rolls of course are the main draw for me at RL, and I was good and only devoured one! Grandma took one bite of the lobster pizza and decided she didn't like it and sent it back and ordered the lobster mushrooms she had enjoyed in August. While waiting for those, she ate the salad and some of my fried shrimp and some really tasty and very fattening shrimp pasta thing. When her mushrooms arrived, she decided she was no longer really hungry, took one bite and sent those back too! Our waiter was great. I mean super great. When she advised it was her 87th birthday (her actual b-day was about a week away) he asked what dessert she would like "on the house". He ended up comping us a dessert and took both the pizza and mushrooms off the bill. I tipped him HUGE for all of his patience and accommodations and seriously wanted to hug him for being so great. All in all, this must be my favorite RL location and I am grateful for the times I get to spend with my Grandma!
Filiberto's Mexican Food=ALWAYS PAY CASH HERE.This review is not about the food at Filibertos. I love their food and have had many meals from different locations--I need my Filibertos Fix at least once every couple of weeks. Their portions are big and grossly delicious. This review is rather about a shady credit card charge at this particular location.I drove through, ordered my usual #16 (2 fish tacos with rice and beans), and pulled up to pay. $7.26, as always, awesome. I gave them my card, they swiped, I signed a receipt, got one back, drove off, life is wonderful.2 days later, I'm checking my credit card charges and I see a charge for $9.26 from Filibertos. WTF? Thankfully, I found my receipt from that purchase. Oddly enough, the receipt they gave me listed that I had paid with $7.26 in "Cash"--it wasn't a credit card charge slip. I should have looked at what they gave me, but who really does? I just assumed it was a credit card charge slip, crammed it into some orifice in my car and drove off. I don't really feel like printing out my credit card statement and arguing with them over $2, especially since this is the closest Filibertos to where I live and I don't want them spitting in my food if they see that it's me in the drive-thru. So the bastards will get away with overcharging my card this time. But I definitely did just want to warn you all about this shady business. I know I will definitely be paying cash for my meals here now. And counting my change.
Florencia Pizza Bistro=With as many good pizzas as there are in Phoenix you would think that we share a border with the wrong country.  Florencia is another great example of the good pies that are adorning our eateries.  While not quite in the same league as Bianco, LGO, or Humble Pie they still make the trip to Ahwatukee worth it.  The crust is light and very tasty.  It holds up very well against the big boys with their coal or wood fired ovens.  The margherita is simple and allows the crust to shine.  My only complaint would be that the sauce can really make the end of the piece very soggy.  We've tried several combination's and they all pass muster.One of the better spots to eat in that part of town.How amazing was the Bravo, a no sauce, chevre, sausage, and fennel on a medium thin-crust ($16.25)?  Well, have a look at the photos and see just how much I had!  Florencia's thin-crust pizzas normally contain cornmeal, but I was able to specially-request one without.  Fabulous!  The bruschetta was oh, so very good-- the tangy-sweet balsamic vinegar is key in making it so tasty.  :)  Liked the fact that it had a lot of garlic, too!  The only downside, so far, was that the desserts I inquired about were all pre-made [cannoli shells came dusted w/ powdered sugar from the supplier (Kim wasn't sure that the pastry cream had powdered sugar in it, but w/ the shells being pre-dusted, the point was already moot!), the caramelized walnuts, for the Apples and walnuts w/ ice cream dessert,   didn't come w/ nutritional info (were they made w/ granulated or powdered sugar?), and ice cream wasn't homemade...  I wonder if Florencia makes its own cookie batter for its chocolate chip cookies (freshly-baked and then topped w/ ice cream)?  Again, w/ the ice cream not being homemade, this scratched out another dessert option for me.  With desserts being a non-issue, I'm able to eat more crusty pizza to my heart's content!  A very glittery silver-lining, which you'll soon agree with!  :DVery patient and fast service- ask for Kim.  Nice, non-intrusive music playing in the background, but the restaurant got a lot noisier as the room slowly filled w/ dinner traffic, so come in early to avoid it.  Restroom was clean and very spacious-- there were two stalls when three would've easily fit!  I dare anyone to feel claustrophobic in there; Not gonna happen.I'll definitely be back!I've been eating food from Florencia Pizza Bistro for over 10 years now, and not once have I actually dined in! *gasp* Every single order has been pick-up. Never have met any employee here with a bad attitude, on the phone or at the bar. I will say though, inside the decor is cute. Various wall hangings, somewhat dark for mood. So yeah, my suggestion will be pretty simple. If you're here for pizza and you order anything but the Putanesca Pizza: You're doing it wrong! Garlic and olive oil instead of traditional sauce, chicken, a generous scattering of capers and kalamata olives, red onion and sliced tomatoes.  It's the perfect combination of savory and salty flavors. The crust is melt in your mouth status. What more could you ask for? Oh wine, duh. Pizza and Netflix night is incomplete without my old friend Pinot Noir. Check it out for consistently delicious pizza! Hope Florencia stays open for a long time. Maybe we'll finally dine-in one of these days we're paying a visit to the ol' 'Tuke.
Aloha Kitchen & Bar=So "Aloha" means both hello and goodbye -- now how can I work that into my review?Here goes:To begin with it, I've never seen a combination bar and Hawaiian fast food place.Aloha (Hello) Kitchen reminds me of a typical Hawaiian fast food place: well lit with a lot of cheesy decor.Besides having the basic plates, they also carried some unique stuff. I tried the Adobo Fried Rice and the wife tried the Saimin soup.  The food wasn't really anything to yelp about, but since it is a chain kinda place, you shouldn't expectation too much.I'd be willing to go back just because they serve poke (one of the items I don't find at a fast food place) on Friday and Saturday.So until then, Aloha (Goodbye) Kitchen.Aloha (Hello) Bar is right next door to the Kitchen but is a 180 from the Kitchen: dark with a dive feel to it.  But it still gave off the laid back Island life vibe.Bartender was cool and even spoke to me in dakine.  Thanks.She stopped though when my face went blank and didn't respond.  Sorry.The music had the kinda beats I could groove to for a couple hours, and the crowd was chill.After a some drinks and a couple games of pool, I was saying Aloha (Goodbye) Bar.  Good thing since they just fired up the karaoke machine.Overall, I'll be saying Aloha (Hello) sooner to the Bar than the Kitchen.A special aloha to all the Vegas Yelpers from Hawaii.There are a bunch.Late night munchies after you hit the clubs? This is the place to be! Along with the good food, there is also an annex type kareoke bar you can enjoy after the food! Please do not come in intoxicated and annoying though, because you will get kicked out!! No soliciting please!My gal pal and I stopped by for a quick bite while in the neighborhood. We placed our order at the counter, our first time so my friend asked how did they do their macaroni salad. My friend is from Hawaii originally and has had macaroni salad many different ways. She was curious so asked as she did not want to regret a double order of a style of mac salad she may not like...you catch my drift.The clerk replied that she had no clue, however she added she "thinks" it may have chopped cucumber in it? She also stated she had never tasted it before. Ok so being the type we are, we go for it, and wield the consequences later...so double order of the "Mystery" mac salad it is.It was a bit bland, not made with best foods, most likely store brand mayo. Not sweet, not very flavorful, however if mixed in with every other item on your plate, it does the trick.We ordered the the Pork Lau-lau, served with Rice and Macaroni Salad.This dish was good, the lau-lau was a great presentation, very tender, juicy and tasty. It was a nice portion indeed. The sticky rice was good as well.I also ordered a side of lumpia shanghai w/sweet chile sauce the way I like it. Mmmmmm yummy.I make chicken lumpia at home, I will come here for my pork lumpia!All in all was an ok meal, some goodness balanced with some blandness rates this review with a 3 Star.Suggestion is have your employees know the food, questions about their menu is something they should be prepared for. Just saying...I hate to do this -- but here goes . . . . I was totally craving local food (aka Mom's cooking) and thought I'd get my fix at Aloha Kitchen.  I'm from Maui, so . . . there's nothing quite like Mom's, but I thought this might come close. Our group had the chicken katsu, teriyaki chicken and teri beef plates with the rice and mac salad.  I can't say any of the above was worth a repeat visit. The katsu - I make better katsu myself and with that being said, I think L&L's katsu is better and . . . that's still L&L, not Mom's.  This was very garlicy, small strips of thin chicken with more crunch than chicken.  The sauce was ok, not best ever, but ok. Honestly could not finish it, I threw 1/2 of it away and I never do that. It was THAT bad.  And for the record, I had the bubbly stomach (gas) effect all afternoon.  Gross.I think I have a problem with their teriyaki sauce.  The chicken was average and teri beef was chewy.  Sauce was ok, but like a 2-star says . . . "Meh. I've experienced better".  I was most disappointed with the hard, dry rice - it's not hard to cook rice!!  Even my 8 year old makes better rice - cmon now!!  And then came the mac salad which again, L&L does better.  It wasn't awful, but it wasn't great either.  And it certainly wasn't Mom's.  Would I go back?  Nope.  It's close to my work and I'd love to say I would.  But nope.  Place was pretty crowded though and I've been told to "order breakfast next time", but I wasn't feeling breakfast at 12:00 Noon.Good grubbing of the island kine.We had a quick breakfast pick up here during a recent visit in Vegas with friends and ordered up a lot of food.Breakfast spread http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/aloha-kitchen-and-bar-las-vegas?select=_A6eqibhsvixKCuL55KR6g#zJ1UnVQ_qWLwg_wxRC-UXA  We got the basics Portugese sausage and eggs, lots of Spam musubi!  You cant go to a place called aloha kitchen and not get musubi's!  These were of good size and a nice thick cut of spam unlike same places there the ratio is more rice than spam.Adobo fried rice http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/aloha-kitchen-and-bar-las-vegas?select=_A6eqibhsvixKCuL55KR6g#7HB73c6cPjKml2mVyEt2kw  This was a pretty tasty omelette with lots of adobo inside.  Def a must get!I didn't actually go to pick up the order so I cant speak to how the place is.Eyes ~ Wow that is a spread!Nose ~ Smells Yum!.Ear ~ Everyone happy with the food.Mouth ~ These are all pretty ono!.Tummy ~ Full and ready for the day!
Micky's Hot Dogs=This place is the SHIT. I just recently found it driving through Mesa, went home and yelped it  And found out they were making sonoran hot dogs ( ***Lord, please let these be good so I don't have to drive 220 miles roundtrip once every 2 or 3 months by myself just to have a proper sonoran hot dog and drive straight back***) and these things called caramelos.These sonoran hot dogs were just as good if not better than el guero canelo down in tucson. In fact I would say they were better. I never had a caramelo before, and I still don't know what the technical difference between them and a quesadilla is, but after eating one I will now be naming my first child Caramelo, boy or girl. Eating these two food items were far and above more satisfying than having sex with a chick who is a 10. In fact I almost busted a nutt after my first bite of the caramelo. Which ironically will end up saving me a trip to the doctor because I was beginning to think I needed Viagra as of recently. Oh, and this place is cheap as fuck. If our currency ends up experiencing hyper-inflation and losing almost all its value, this place will probably still be affordable.The reviewers below, geoff, kelly, and gary who gave this place only 3 stars must have brain damage.Located in a colorful Small Shack on side of the road in a sadly depressed industrial area of Mesa. You may see people pushing a cart with their belongings or scrap metals at a slow pace while humming a cosmic tune or talking to an invisible companion from outside this realm.Inside this small wonder they offer an assortment of tasty Tacos, Burritos, Tortas, Quesadillas, and Sonoran Hot dogs. Fresh Salsas are made daily and displayed along with pickled red onions, radishes, and other yummies at the Salsa bar.I had to try the bacon wrapped Sonoran Hot dogs loaded with everything and some Tacos al Pastor on the side just to see if I was missing anything. I really liked the Mexican style hot dog bun that was used. It was sweeter than your normal grocery bun. Very simple and tasty. Don't forget a trip to the salsa bar to dress up you dog or tacos which helps kick the flavors up a notch. Service was friendly and quick and inside was clean and tidy.Definitively A-OK and then some. Worth the drive when you need a Mexican Style Hot Dog. CASH ONLY. Delicioso!
The Keg Steakhouse + Bar=I just had one of the best dining experiences I've had in a LONG time. We went to the Keg with their birthday club coupon (see instructions below) and had a great meal for a steal of a price. I feel like I got away with something to good to be true, so much so, that I want to go back to make a deposit in my karma bank. First of all, Keg has a great happy hour that I always seem to forget about until I go there for dinner. This time, we remembered right as we were walking in and decided to sit in the bar for dinner (good decision #2, #1 was going there in the first place). Briana was our server and she was great! Very friendly, the perfect balance of attentive but not overly so. Never seemed like we were annoying her with our "one more minute" or "on the side" requests. Nor, did she seemed bothered by the fact that we had the email birthday coupon for a free prime rib dinner ($23 value). The best part is you don't even have to get the prime rib, you can get anything you want want and they credit your check for the $23. Happy hour is M-F 4-7 with a few $5 appetizers, half price wines by the glass, draft beers, and $3.75 Orange Crush Martinis (one of the best martinis ever!). The only thing is that HH is only in the bar or the patio. So, if you'll take a moment to connect the dots with me, I can have dinner in the dining area and pay full price for glass of wine, or I can eat dinner in the bar and get the wine for half price. Um, I think the answer is obvious. Dinner was great. We both ordered from the seasonal crab menu. I got the mushroom and crab crusted sirloin and the birthday boy got the sirloin topped with crab and roasted red pepper sauce. Both came with a potato side (baked for me, mashed for him). Everything was cooked perfectly to our request and so delish! Toward the end of my meal, I reached what I like to call the "point of no return." This is where there is not enough to take home, but just enough to push me over the edge of way too full if I eat it all. While I was just about to go in for it and stuff myself, Briana showed up to check on us. She easily made the decision for me and said "Take it home!" Maybe three to four bites of my sirloin left and she not only didn't make me feel like an idiot for wanting to save it, but she encouraged it. I heart her! Added half of the baked potato, a piece of the delicious soft bread, and the thick tomato slice garnish from the boys plate.  Plenty for lunch tomorrow!Oh, and one more thing I love about the Keg; Keg size glasses of wine. A nine ounce pour at a great price. Perfect for two people to each get one when they want a little more than one glass, but not quite enough to finish a whole bottle! And with the 1/2 price wines by the glass during happy hour, it's AMAZING!! OK, here is what I think you need to do. 1 - go to kegsteakhouse.com and sign up for their newsletter (birthday club). 2 - check your email at the beginning of the month of your birthday. 3 - go to the Keg (with the coupon, if you can wait that long, or when ever you just want a good meal) 4 - sit in the bar, M-F, from 4-7, for happy hour drinks and appetizers. 5 - if you're still hungry, order dinner and eat in the bar area, getting the best of both worlds! 6 - don't forget about the draft beers for $3, the Keg size wine pours, and the ultimate Orange Crush Martini!!! 7 - rinse and repeat, I mean go back again and again . . . I'm going to!Came here for my Birthday dinner. They do have the greatest Birthday deal in town for sure. If you sign up on their website, they will send you a certificate for $25.00 off one of the best dinners you will ever have.So we got the full works, starters, dinners, a bottle of wine and dessert.French onion soup to start. Fantastic, we have been here a few times before and knew this was a winner.Next I had the steak and Crab legs, and T the Filet mingon and lobster. Also wonderful. The bread was even good at this place.After a wonderful dinner,we thought we would have dessert. Major dissapointment!I got the chocolate Brownie with Ice Cream. It was a cheap Ice Cream, almost like an Ice milk, and the Brownie had no flavor. T got the Key lime pie. She said it tasted like she made it herself from a keebler pie crust.She gave me a taste and it was awfully sweet,Both came with canned whipped cream.It was a wonderful dinner just spoiled by the dessert.Next time eat everything just not the dessert portion of it. Just skip it.Our experiance was good other wise. Our server was a little pre occupied with the table next to us. She knew them( one of them worked there or used to). So she was busy talking to them. luckily we were not in a hurry. Still a good place, been here a few times and will come back for sure.
Barro's Pizza=I originally wanted to get some pizza from the competitors by this Hawaiian BBQ place nearby but Mr. W. wanted to try Barro's.  Driving by numerous times, I had always assumed Barro's was the same as the mall food-court place "Sbarro."  If only!We had ordered their special of an XL one-topping pizza with 24 wings for $28.  We ended up with a pepperoni pizza, 12 fire wings, and 12 BBQ wings.  I don't know if I was experiencing a lost of taste but everything tasted bland to me.  It had a good amount of cheese and pepperoni but there seemed to be a lack of seasoning.  The crust was almost a punishment in itself.  Although it was a chewy crust, it ended up being something to mindlessly gnaw on while staring at the television.  I do enjoy the portion size for the price and they weren't stingy with the ranch [although I wanted blue cheese sauce].  Mr. W. said the fire wings were outrageous but he also said the pizza was pretty good so I'm not sure what to say to that.  The BBQ wings did taste better cold out of the fridge the next day though. All in all, I'm not sure we'll be back again as there are many more options around that delivers more bang [and flavor] for the buck.Before reaming these guys, I will start by saying I really appreciated the Friday night quick delivery and thought the wings were good.  With that said...If you like thick doughy pizza, defrosted translucent-wilted salad, and rude customer service from a manager by the name of Kendra, then BOY do we have a pizza place for you.Pretty much, everyone knows that salad is one of the riskiest items on any menu, being one of the biggest bacteria carriers.  Our disappointment with this order began with what we found in the garden salad container.My wife, being ServSafe certified, noticed a significant portion of lettuce (which seemed to have been frozen and thawed) which was translucent and visually unappealing.   We've posted the photos so you can see for yourself, but unfortunately Yelp removed them on 12/14/12 because "...your photos looked more like they captured your personal experience".  Umm k.My wife phoned to bring this to the attention of a manager.  She politely explained that they may want to check their salad, to keep other customers safe, and requested a refund (for the price of the salad only).  I listened in, and can confirm how polite she was.  The manager, Kendra, wanted to give us credit instead.My wife explained that we don't plan on ordering from Barro's in the future, and would just like the salad price refunded.  The obviously annoyed Kendra replied "OK!" and then hung the phone up.  No apology, no thanks for reporting potentially out of temperature food.  Nothing but the echo of a dial tone in our receiver.The pizza tasted good, but the texture is accommodating to those who prefer a thick and doughy crust.There are too many other pizza places to put up with potentially tainted food and substandard customer service.  No thanks Barro's.Barro's is the best pizza in the valley, and a local chain that made good!This is a newer and cleaner Barro's than i've been used to going to, so points for that.The fake brick walls kind of close in on you, so I advise not to ingest any hallucinogens prior to your coming in.
Elephant Bar Restaurant=So, I love happy hours. Beyond explanation. You can imagine my excitement to find out that happy hour is from 7 to close. Needless to say, we ordered. A lot. Too much. BUT, in my defense...it was like impulse shopping - impulse dining. Anyways. I ordered a bloody mary, to get my tummy prepared for the onslaught of food that it was about to receive. Also, the artichoke dip, sliders and tacos. Clock ticking. Excitement fading. Tummy growling. Irritation growing. Finally, the bloody mary arrives! Or should I say tomato juice. No celery salt, hot sauce, worcestershire sauce, ANYTHING. Except for a whole fucking celery tree that was engulfing the glass. Boo hiss. The rest I shall summarize: Artichoke dip = large jar of mayo. Again no flavor. Tacos = soaked in "sauce" (aka mayo)...couldn't taste much besides that. Sliders = ok. Just ok. Meat reminded me of what I imagine wet dog food to taste like. So, why the two stars you ask? Well..I added one star for the cheap drink prices during happy hour (stick to beer, maybe). Now I shall find my giraffe and ride off in the sunset, in search of some good food.Yelpers, If you don't read only one review this year, don't read this one; the service was bland, but so was the food - this review can't be much better.Quick tip, Phoenix in the summer months is not ALWAYS hot, carry a light jacket or sweater in your car, sometimes it's coooold, brrrr. Why some establishments think that 100+ degrees outside means it should be 65- degrees inside is byeond me. We visited on a Saturday before a movie and they seated us just under what seemed to be an ice vent, I was glad I had that sweater in the car.My first impression of the Elephant Bar was "What type of food do they serve here?" Are they Mexi-merican, Italian, American, BBQ, sandwich, Asian Fusion? I'm not sure, and neither does their 30+ page menu. They've got the most confusing menu I've seen from just about any restaurant. I think I saw the same menu item on three separate pages with at least two separate items, why? Don't ask me.I FINALLY, after about 25 minutes, ordered a barbecue glazed chicken sandwich with the macaroni and cheese side - which they touted all over the menu and table top flyers (the mac n cheese that is). By the way, turns out that their idea of barbecue glazed is a bland piece of chicken with barbecue sauce added after it's put on your sandwich. I could have sworn that barbecue glazed means it's cooked in a fire roaster / oven with the sauce.I ended up sending the macoroni and cheese back after 4 or 5 bites, the noodles were way over cooked and the cheese was bland, I guess I could have added salt, but didn't really feel like paying for mediocre macoroni. I also requested them to add jalepenos to my chicken sandwich, and they sent out basically an entire jalepeno pepper on the side not peeled, not chopped, not diced, but sliced about 5 times - I ended up cutting it into smaller pieces myself with the butter knife they supplied me so I could actually add it to my sandwich.The chicken wasn't pink, so I THINK it was cooked, but it was walking the line of cooked and not cooked. After about one fifth of the chicken sandwich I decided the flavor wasn't going to get much better and ended up sending that back also. The bill arrived and to my surprise the chicken sandwich was still on there. I asked the waitress "are you really going to charge me for that meal?". She went and found the manager to which I had to explain again all the reasons I didn't want to eat the food they provided and why I didn't want to order something else instead.My wife's hambruger was good though. If you're here, hungry, and confused at what to order, get a burger; I think it's the best thing on the menu and difficult to get wrong. Who knows, maybe they can. :-/Run. Not to, but away from this Elephant. Pretend it's a real elephant and it's scary and chasing you. That's how fast you should run. While I've had friendly, if not efficient service. It's the lame food. I've seriously had better things from Stouffer's. Sauces are thick and sugary. Drinks are overly sweet and not nearly enough booze to shmooze. After the Jordin Sparks party at SKYE we met some friends who said they would be here. I sighed. Or did I cry. I forget. But we gave it a shot. It was 10:00 pm and the place was an elephant morgue. Seriously the only guests were our friends. We were immediately told we could have no food and only one drink. Ahhh! Really? How hospitable! A quick shot of Patron and a visit to the elephant pottie and we split.Extremely noisey, undercooked rice, chicken very salty and dry, just not a good experience! Plus, we had 7 adults and a 1 yr old and they squeezed us all in a booth! Unbelievable! On a positive note, the ice water was very good!
Market Cafe=I've been looking online for the last hour trying to find a menu for Market Café at the Buttes. All I can find on the Marriott Buttes website is information regarding their flagship restaurant, Top of the Rock.So, that's annoying and perhaps should be fixed.Anyway, the review...The Market Café has an impressive environment inside with the massive indoor waterfall and the view from the dining room is spectacular. Although they serve breakfast and lunch, the real deal is the all-you-can-eat breakfast buffet. Unfortunately, the breakfast buffet lacks the splendor the environment/ view has. The buffet is good, but not great. The buffet has all of the usual breakfast items:eggs, French toast, cereals, muffins, bagels, fruits, sausage, bacon and the price is very reasonable.They also serve mimosas, which always makes me very happy. The staff was extremely helpful. In fact, our table had 4-5 servers making sure we had everything we needed.Overall, I 4/5 highly recommend the Market Café.
Las Cazuelas=I've never been to Surprise Arizona before so I had no idea where to go eat when we were out here for a Rangers spring training, so as always I relied on Yelp to help me and my co-workers find a spot! We were searching for Mexican food, so as soon as I found the reviews for Las Cazuelas, we immediately headed that way. It's located in a strip mall next to a gun store but don't let this deter you. Once we entered the place we saw that it was packed, which is a really good sign. It seems as if the locals as well as all of the out of towners frequent this place. The restaurant is divided into two sections so we took a seat in the rear in ne of the booths. I looked at the very large menu and ordered the vegetable fajitas. When I asked for no cheese or sour cream, they said it wouldn't be a problem at all. They brought out my plate of fajitas along with a side of cheese covered beans. The portions were huge and real good too. I hate the fact that they bring you a basket of only three tortillas, yet you have a whole plate full of food to fill them with! The grilled onions and peppers were good, the only problem that I had with it was that they included tomatoes as well. This kind of made the plate runny and soggy. I really wish that they would have given me a little more guacamole as well. But overall it was a good meal and I'm glad that we found this spot.Great food, great service, what more can you ask for? I definitely recommend Las Cazuelas if you're in the Surprise area. Venture a couple of blocks off of Bell and the tourist area and try it out, you won't be upset that you did
Saigon Pho=I've eaten here at Saigon a few good times but never by choice.  Mr. W.'s family loves it here but I really don't care for the place. The servers [and owner too I believe] are all Chinese who love to stand around and gossip about their patrons.  Don't be fooled by their friendly smiles.  They talk a lot of smack.  I ran into my mom's hair stylist friend whom I've known since birth once and who is also my grandmother's god-daughter when a nosy waitress walks up to me as soon as she left and asks me if her ring was real with the snobbiest attitude.  Okay, excuse you.  Go away you rude old woman.  The food is mediocre at best but it's super cheap eats.  You get a lot of noodles for your pho and plenty of herbs and condiments but the broth is bland.  The spring rolls are served a bit warmer than I feel safe but their egg rolls are delicious.  I'll probably be stuck coming here again and again because of Mr. W.'s family but I'll always eat it with a pained smile.
Costa Del Sol At Sunset Station=This place is the Oyster Bar inside Sunset Station. Alot of parking outside and inside garage.Service was fast and got great service from Julian at the bar. Anthony is them man. Sit at the bar just say how you want it and magic happens. Food was great on this visit and portions were right on. Plus cocktails right there no wait.Reasonable prices and great portions of food with great quality and taste.Have fun and enjoy.What a nice surprise! We wanted something other than the ordinary and seafood was on the radar. Thanks to my MIL being a "degenerate gambler" (as my wife likes to call her) we decided on Costa Del Sol in Sunset Station to accomodate her bingo addiction.Having been to Palace Station and believing the hype about their pan roast being "the best", and withstanding a near 2 hour wait for it, I must say with sheer delight that the pan roast at Costa Del Sol is just as good...WITHOUT the 2 hour wait in an old smoke filled dump. The location is ultra convenient, and the venue itself allows children to sit anywhere, including the bar area. There was no wait and very friendly service. The menu is the same for all the Station Casinos with variances lying on the different chef preparations, which they will also admit. Table seating is available, but note that the booth near the entrance behind the waterfall will get you a little wet.Bingo Betty and I ordered the Lobster Pan Roast, and my wife the Linguini with White Clam Sauce.The fact that our orders took about 20 minutes to bring out gave us hope the chef was doing the dishes justice. The Lobster Pan Roast was delicious! We couldn't believe the large chunks of lobster in generous amounts in both our dishes. The broth was perfect and spicy, the way I like it. You can order 3 levels of spiciness, and I chose #3 which is a 10 on the heat meter. It comes with 2 generous scoops of white rice and will fill you up. I don't like filling up on rice when there is more important seafood to devour first, so I didn't mix mine into the pan roast.The White Clam Sauce Linguini was also perfect. Al dente linguini in a delicious lemony broth with a good amount of clams...both shucked and a few unshucked clams for presentation with enough leftover broth to sop up with bread. Despite cleaning our bowls, we couldnt resist getting their Bananas Foster dessert. Vanilla ice cream with warmed bananas that didn't look good in its presentation served in a melted mess. It was ok, but still a nice way to top off our meal.If you happen to have a "degenerate gambler" of your own who has a Station Card, make sure you have them scan it for points to use towards dinner, which can save you off your bill or even get your meal comped :)
Life Cafe=Minus one star for not yet naming a smoothie after me. Minus another star for charging me four bucks if I order a peanut butter and jelly sandwich off of the kids menu for myself. This same PB&J would be only three dollars if it was, in fact, for my kid. And ... AND it would come with a bag of Sun Chips and a juice box! So not only am I paying a dollar more, but I am rendered chipless and juice boxless! "Why?" I ask. WHHHHHYYYYYY!?!?!?!  Are those of without offspring and who crave pre- or post-workout PB&J's being discriminated against simply because we've chosen not to spread our seed just yet? Seems cruel.The dollar (as well as the Sun Chips and the Juicy Juice) is important to me. On more than one occasion, I have considered borrowing a toddler from elsewhere in the fitness club so as to get the "good deal" on the samich, but I can never make it past the gals working the front desk in the playroom. Those of you with small children may find comfort in knowing that they take their jobs - and your little ones - very seriously at the child care center at Lifetime Fitness (a review of which is likely forthcoming). But back to the café ...I'm pretty bent about the PB&J deal, and I've yet to find a work-around. But I'm giving a star back because the people working the joint are always very nice and the place is well done for a café in a fitness club. It really is. Great overall selection, including smoothies, burritos, salads, pizzas, wraps and, of course, a kids menu. They make most everything to order, but also have some grab-and-go items if you're in a hurry.In short, Life Café is all that and a bag of chips. (As long as you're 12 or under).
Keegan's Grill=If I could afford it, I would come here every day and order their blackened salmon salad.  Roasted Corn & Red Bell Pepper Salsa, Edamame Beans, Tomatoes & Multigrain Tortilla Chips with a balsamic dressing.  My absolute favorite, hands down, and it pairs well with their arnold palmer.
K O'Donnell's Sports Bar & Grill=I hang out on restaurant patios as much as possible this time of year. This place has a huge covered patio, which is always a plus in AZ. The restaurant is located in a high traffic area, but I really didn't hear any of the noise from the traffic. I came here for happy hour and it was busy. They have lots of high tops outside, but they quickly fill up if you come around five o'clock. The crowds dwindled down outside by about 6-6:30 pm, which is great if you want to sit on the patio and take advantage of their happy hour.  They have discounts on drinks and apps are 25% off from 3-7 pm  Mon-Fri. They also have other drinks specials that change everyday.It started getting a little chilly once the sun set, but they started a fire in the outdoor fireplace which was surrounded by some pretty comfortable chairs and a love seat, another plus. Didn't try any food, but the menu looked pretty good (standard American food) and the prices looked reasonable. Looks like a great lunch spot. I'll have to come back and have something to eat next time.Was looking for a place that delivers Pizza and found this joint on Yelp.  I ordered a small Pepperoni & Sausage Pizza w/Jalapenos on 1/2 ($10.95 plus $1.75 for each topping).The Pizza was delivered pretty quickly.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wEc4JE2NYQr1RnGjGr4q7w?select=YteH1pH5LJEpwG07ZX3N9Ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wEc4JE2NYQr1RnGjGr4q7w?select=HlzLd9Q8thIf0PZ33AgRuwhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wEc4JE2NYQr1RnGjGr4q7w?select=-8ecQVJPSRa3WlsKLsTbIQI took one bite out of a slice and instantly became a fan!  The Sausage had a nice balance of flavors...slightly sweet, but very good.  The Jalapenos are on the spicy side, which is how I like it.....for some people, it may be too much.Overall, it was a solid Pizza.Return Factor - 100%Terrible drinks and mediocre food. Was not impressed at all!  It was pretty empty too so I must not be the only one with this opinion.Please tell Candace not to give customers their check prior to asking for it. Thanks for cutting my night short.I've been here a couple time and every time I go, I always get charged extra for things. One time the waiter dropped my friend's burger on the floor and charged us for a new one, another time I ordered cornbread as my side with my meal and it was an extra $5 that they didn't even mention or state on the menu. Food isn't that good and way too expensive to add extra charges to things without warning. I won't be coming back unless someone else is paying!Horrible service. Felt rushed. Gave us a check before we finished eating and before asking if we wanted anything.An unhappy "Happy Hour"...  The food was good and the beer cold so what went wrong?   Staffing or management unfortunately impacted our fun.  We came in with 6 ( our usual Friday group) and wanted to sit at  the high rise table by the front door.  We would have sat outside but the smokers are so bad out there, it's not even an option.  GO SOMEWHERE ELSE FOR OUTSIDE SMOKE FREE ENJOYMENT.   A waitress seated us and the manager came up and said the table was "reserved".  There was no sign and apparently even the staff didn't know this.  She made no apology, no offer to try to accommodate else elsewhere.  We wandered and then the same waitress offered to push two small low tables together.  It was difficult to get continued service as our poor waitress had two large groups and 3-side tables she was responsible for.  One or our couples are pretty influential community members and he was quite put out.  I was embarrassed that I had selected O'Donnells.  I thought it's not the waitress's fault.  I finally told him I was sorry.  By the way, we are in our early 60's, well dressed, normally a fun group.Why have a Happy Hour if you cannot staff and take care of your customers?  Happy Hour in Scottsdale is pretty competitive .  Oh, and that reserved table?  We left after two (2) hours, still no sign on it - and no people at it.  Four of us have been regulars for the past 5-years with many out of town guests.Time to move elsewhere...  And K O'Donnells - smelling that stinky smoke and burned holes in the cushions outside is more like the old days in Reno.Jennifer, thanks for your reply but unfortunately, you were not given good information.  The misters were not dripping, as I have witnessed when it is too humid, and they were turned off earlier in the evening, only to have the patio erupt in disappointment, and then subsequently turned back on.  The second time it happened, the temperature was still 102 degrees.  As your father walked around the patio the second time, the vote was 50/50 to turn them back on so he made the call.  His words; "there was no consensus, so they stay off".  We were never the only table complaining about the heat, as your servers can tell you.  There was no flipping off of staff, as you mentioned, in fact, we had great service and received free drinks as our server felt bad for the entire situation.  I would have let it go, however, the poor attitude we got when we made the complaint was not good customer service and the table of cold men actually turned their chairs to face us and stared us down with their arms crossed until we could pay our checks and leave.  It was an unfortunate situation for all but poorly handled by your manager, hence the Yelp review below.  Such a nice patio but the men are freezing so the misters are off so time to go. Poor customer service. It's 102 degrees people!I had really high expectations for this sports bar. All the reviews are pretty positive. I am reviewing for my first visit because, to be honest, I'm not sure we will go back and we were hoping to utilize this bar as our game watching location for football and hockey. It's a great size, close to home, and has a great looking food and special drinks menu and decent taps for the beer boys. I was out doing errands and stopped in for a late lunch. I sat at the bar. I ordered the wings because I am a wing fiend and these sounded interesting and tasty. They first fry the wings like normal, then sauce them, and then grill them. I LOVE spicy foods, so I ordered volcano. The wings arrived with bleu cheese, carrots and celery. Some of them were maybe a little overdone, but not enough to complain about and as you will see below, I don't think that would have been a good idea. The wings were very good, but definitely not spicy. Not even a little bit. I asked the bartender for a side of the volcano sauce to dip them in and that helped. So, the food was good. Not fantastic as many others have experienced, but good. So, why three stars instead of four? The atmosphere in the bar was just...off. Granted, it was 2:30ish on a Thursday, before happy hour, so I'm sure that had something to do with it. There were regulars and staff and they were definitely taking advantage of the slow time. I didn't get a friendly vibe from most of them and they pretty much stuck to themselves. It wasn't nasty or anything, just "off". I just had wings and no drinks, so maybe that was the problem. When I asked for the sauce after receiving the wings, I felt like I was interupting. I've been a server and a bartender and my FAVORITE part was getting to visit and build a rapport with all my patrons, newbies and familiar faces. After all, that's how you get regulars! If we go back as a group to watch a game, eat, and order drinks, I'll let you all know. :/As a Constitutionalist, I believe in private property rights. A business has the right to control the conversation in their restaurants. Just like any of us have the right to do so in our own homes. Anyone has the right to remove someone from their private property for any reason. You do not pay the rent payment every month, don't tell them what to do with their property. This storm will blow over K O'Donnell's... stay strong! No one will remember this in a couple of weeks.
Red Robin Gourmet Burgers=It's not that I don't like burgers. I just need to be in the mood for a burger. Last night when I went to Red Robin I wasn't. Why the hell did you go to Red Robin you say? I had a left-over gift card to use, ok? So I went with a veggie burger prepared like one of their "signature" burgers. It had melted cheese, bourbon sauce and onion straws. Of course it came with fries. I didn't finish the veggie burger and it didn't sit well with me. Oh well. Good try. The service was outstanding and garnered a nice tip by the way. So for this visit, 2 stars. I did have a burger here several months ago and it was pretty good. 3 stars for that visit.Well, damn.Until tonight, all of our experiences at Red Robin had been positive. Even at this location, our past meals had been enjoyable.Tonight, though...tonight left a sour taste in my mouth. That's not to say that the food was bad...it was actually pretty good. But the service was atrocious.We thought it was our lucky day when we walked right in on a Saturday night and sat right down at 7:00. We ordered our appetizer and drinks. The waiter, Cameron, came back and took our order a few moments later.Our appetizer came out in record time! We had hardly taken a few bites of our hummus plate, and then our food came out! Like I said...the food was good.So, where was the horrible service? The food was there fast, hot, and it was good. What could have bothered me so much?Well, I don't think the waiter said more than a dozen words to us. It seemed like he was late for something very important, and we were his last obstacle to overcome before he was able to free himself from the self-imposed bonds of servitude to Red Robin.Customarily, the waiter comes around after the food arrives and asks how things tasted. This guy didn't show up until our food was gone, our drinks were gone, and we were ready for the check and couple of to-go boxes.He begrudgingly gave me a refill on my drink before he dropped off the check. Now, granted, we don't ever get desert in a restaurant...but this guy didn't even give us the satisfaction of turning down his delicious sounding proposal.The whole process felt like we were imposing on this kid. We were in and out of the restaurant in less than 30 minutes.  This guy robbed us of the entire restaurant experience.If you can't enjoy the experience, then why go?It will definitely be a while (if ever) before I visit this location again. But I can promise that I'll avoid this kid like the plague if he's still "working against his will" at this location.Apparently, when I say I hate Red Robin, people react as though I'm saying I hate Disneyland. I just can't get into the jar of mayonnaise, shredded lettuce and tasteless meat they put into their burgers.Gourmet burgers my ass.Fries were great, spinach and artichoke dip was great. I guess I'll eat vegetarian here.We were seated at a table quickly.We were given a highchair, and I of course, whipped out our daughter's baby wipes, to wipe down the table. (she is teething, so anything she sees, and she's like a bottom fish)I wish I would have taken a picture, because after I was done wiping, there was my hand print, a dark grey out line on the baby wipe........Are you kidding me?The girl came around and took our order, we ordered, wedge salad, a prime rib dip, and a burger.salad came out, it was good. Manager walks around (or at least attempts to) in pretty woman looking boots...Making her rounds, but mostly joking around with staff.We wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, and wait for our food.Booties (manager) comes over and asks how we enjoyed our dinner...We then informed her that we hadn't eaten yet.She goes back and "checks". Waitress, and booties (manager) tell us separately that it will be "one minute", or that it's "next up".Whatever that means.Food comes, and it's decent, worth the wait I suppose.PLEASE, CLEAN YOUR TABLES PROPERLY!I usually have decent meals here at Red Robin.  The location is easy to find at the Galleria Mall.   It's located right off of Sunset and you can see their restaurant sign from the parking lot.  Since it's at the mall, it's usually pretty busy from open to close but I can usually get seated fairly quickly.   They do have tables in the bar area so you don't have to wait if you don't want to.   The menu is pretty huge with so much to choose from.  They have such a great selection of different burgers!  I always order medium rare and they do a good job with getting that right.  I have a love/hate relationship with their french fries.   I love them and hate that they are unlimited!  On my last visit I tried their sweet potato fries.  They bought out a huge side of them.  Unfortunately they weren't cooked long enough and almost like I was eating raw potatoes.  Strange.   I had to ask them to cook more.  Hopefully that doesn't happen on a consistent basis.  I will note that their kitchen seems to take longer than most places to prepare your meals.  Maybe that's why I get appetizers since I'm waiting a while.  Customer service here is really hit and miss.  You can get a really upbeat waiter/waitress one day but the next they are a downer.  I do, however, realize on a regular basis the servers don't really come back to the tables as often as they should.  Drinks do go empty and I'm always looking around for them to get the check.  In my opinion there are better places for burgers with better service.  I keep holding out hope they will improve.We gave this place one more shot, but now we will never come back.  Reasons why as follows:1. 15 minutes before the waitress (Lisa) took our drink order.2. 20 minutes before she brought them back and took our food order.3. After an additional 20 minutes we flagged down a passing hostess to ask her to get our waitress.4. 10 minutes later....no Lisa, so we left.5. The manager did chase us down when we were almost to Macy's but it was too little too late.Wow. I can't believe people eat this stuff on the regular. This was my first time ever at a Red Robin and it was pretty much what I thought it would be... cookie cutter food, mundane vibe, and terrible service. Normally, I save the bad reviews for my second visit, purely to be fair. I mean everyone has a bad day, but I don't ever foresee myself coming back here.When you're with the parents, sometimes you're just too hung-over to fight for a better place to eat, hello Red Robin. After waiting fifteen minutes for a table into a partly filled dining room, we were escorted to our seats. As we walked past the miles of screaming kids and sad looking overwhelmed parents. I noticed that not only was the place was relatively empty, but the empty tables were covered in dirty plates and old food scraps. Yummy. We sat down and were literally passed by three different servers for about ten minutes until finally a served stopped before walking by us and asked if we had been helped, "No, not yet", "oh man, well you're not even my table, so I'll be right back", wow. He did come back to take our order, but you have to realize at this point we have been in this place for almost twenty five minutes and haven't even received a glass of water. The food was a strong meh. I ordered the Ensenada Chicken Platter, with a side salad, pre-seasoned bagged frozen food, limp salad, and tons of dressing, because what do you do to mask bad food? Drown it in sauces and salt-based spices. I know this pace is known for it's burgers, but I wasn't feeling it, sorry Red Robin. The beer menu also confused me. They have the Stone and I believe Lagunitas logos on their beer menu, but when I asked, what kind of Stone they had on tap, the server said they didn't have any, wait what? It was all Sam Adams and Miller brands, so I ordered Iced Tea. Why add this logo to permanent, laminated alcohol menu and not even have it in stock? Beyond the bad service, lack of good beer, and questionable food. Our bill was still pretty pricey, over sixty dollars for three people at chain restaurant? Note-to-self, don't let anyone else choose the lunch spots from now on. RED ROBIN... No, Not Yum.
Bangkok 9 Thai-Chinese Food=This place is ok...I was with a friend and we were out shopping and got hungry so we stopped in here.  The service was really good, they seated us quickly, came to take our drink orders and then came back to take the food order.The food was not bad, everything was prepared the way we desired and staff was very friendly and helpful.We had 3 different dishes and based on those 3 I would venture to say just about anything you get here will be pretty decent.  I would definitely go back to this place again when in the area as I love Chinese, Thai Food and just cannot seem to get enough of it but all places are not the same.This place is one of the better one's at least based on this experience, we will see next time, I hope they continue to please.
Sesame Inn Carefree=This place is AWFUL. I'm sorry, there's just no nice way of saying it. I picked up my food and while waiting for it, there was a man complaining about his meal and asking for his money back. This should have thwarted me but I ended up paying 30 dollars for this crappy food. We order the sweet and sour chicken. The sauce has a strange flavor, unlike the traditional red sauce, this was orange and bland. Almost like jello. We also ordered the egg drop soup, which was very thick and had an odd taste to it, seemed old. And also ordered the crab puffs which were bland, room temp, and just tasteless. Way too expensive, I paid 30 bucks for food we ended up just throwing away. Do not recommend for those who love a good Chinese spot.
Korean Garden BBQ House=I wouldn't say this place is bad, but its not great, either. Here are the items you should order on the AYCE (15.95): Steamed Egg, Pork Belly, Beef Brisket. Also, they have pretty good side dishes, but in particular, I didn't like the broccoli that they made. In the end, it's all a pretty good price for what they give you, but those are the best items, in my opinion. Service was good for me. There wasn't a long line or a ton of people eating here. It was very private and bright inside. Plus, they have a great window view of..Chinatown haha! I feel like they did make our grill way too hot. It was burning my face and my food and I had to ask them to turn it down! I'd probably come here again because it's cheap and good, plus there are no extremely long lines! Next time, I'm just gonna turn the grill down and keep that brisket comin'!!!!MY FIRST REVIEW AS AN ELITE MEMBER! WISH IT WAS A 5 STAR REVIEW BUT...I have never been to a more disgusting place ever. I do not want to go into the sanitary and cleanliness of this restaurant due to Yelp rules but I will say that "Dirty Dining" should definitely investigate. Honestly not a big fan of Korean BBQ but family wanted to eat here. It's a All You Can Eat BBQ. You pick 1 out of the 3 menus they have which is of course 3 different prices. We went with the Vegas menu which was about $20 per person. You get to choose the meats that is on that menu. We went with Bulgogi, spicy pork, spicy chicken, and the family had cow intestines. Yes, INTESTINES! you already know I did not touch that at all. We also got an order of shrimp for the kids that is not included in the Vegas menu so it was an extra $25. They bring out little small plates, kind of like appetizers in the beginning. There was fish cakes, spicy broccoli, kim chi, jalapeños, mashed potatoes, horse radish, house salad, and soup. When the meats come out, There is a stove on the table and you actually cook it yourself. we had a few different waitresses assigned to our table because we were a party of 14. One of them pulled the table without acknowledging my phone was on there and dropped it. Good thing it didn't break or else I would have went crazy on her. Our drinks came after we got the food which was pretty unacceptable. I was thirsty! So we were eating spicy food without any waters for a good 10 minutes. Never will come back & I do not recommend this place to anybody!
Capriotti's Sandwich Shop=I'm a Capriotti's fan. I eat at one 1-2 times a week. This is one location I love because not only is it tasty but it is near a Home Depot I frequent. The store is clean. The dining area isn't very big so I usually phone my order in and pick it up to go. During lunch hours this location is a mad house and can get cramped but obviously worth it!I like that Capriotti's has been giving a $3 coupon on some receipts I get. Not sure how long it will last but as long as it is around I will be appreciative! Pay attention to your receipt you might have one on there. You do have to go to a website and fill out a brief survey but it is quick and worth the discount.I'm a sucker for a "Capastrami". It has Pastrami, Swiss, Cole Slaw, and Russian Dressing on a hoagie roll. It is pure heaven with each bite.They have a variety of sandwiches to choose from.Should you be a fan of the "tastykake" brand they carry a variety of their snacks. The "Wise" brand chips are my fav.Sandwich sizes are as follows:-Small is 9 inches-Medium is 12 inches-Large is 20 inchesthis place has been voted by lv review journal readers as the best sandwich year after year.i've eaten at nearly every location in las vegas and would say without a doubt they are the best. My wife loves this place so much one time she bit into a hair-tie in the middle of a sandwich-spit it out and kept on chowing down.The Capistrami & Bobbie are my favorites.The capistrami is hot pastrami with their special cole slaw & russian dressing on a fresh roll 12 or 20 inch. The bobbie is a thanksgiving delight. everything on a roll. turkey,stuffing and cranberry sauce with or without mayo!!the service is always fast & friendly. the atmosphere is that of a small-town deli/sandwich shoppe and the food is always consistent & great. a little more $$ than others but always worth itI don't think i can go to Vegas again and be satisfied without stopping by this great sandwhich shop (and Sonics) . I'd never used to go somewhere just for their pastrami- i was never a huge fan of the Hat, Top etc, even though it's good. but now good is not enough, since i know out there, there's a whole better sandwhich. The thanksgiving dinner in a bun (their turkey sandwhich) is awesome as well. too bad there aren't any in California. - drives me crazy! Just like how there's only ONE Sonic's within an hour and a half drive and they bombard us with those commercials.Great great great!!  Amazing sandwiches and service!  Small but sufficient shared parking lot, close to the strip (2 blocks-ish) without the craziness of the strip, and the service is fun and busy -- large staff to fully support the orders (not 1-2 people, but 8 or more!).First, you have to know, the secret to a good sandwich is the bread.  Here, at Capriotti's, they know HOW TO DO IT RIGHT!Randy's Top 4 Capriotti Sandwiches:#1 "The Bobbie" - (to die for) - moist and tender shredded turkey, cranberry sauce, and STUFFING #2 Meatball - (thats'a Italian to you) - great and meaty balls, super good, great sauce#3 Roast Beef - (so dang good!) - cooked right there in the shop, super moist and tender, and shredded#4 Chicken cheesesteak - (The Pope would say "holy moly") - tender chicken cuts, get the works with cheese, mushrooms, peppers, and onions!Capriotti's is my favorite sandwich shop!!  There are many locations, find one nearest you (or move closer to one!)Just sayin'......... if you're rating "sandwiches in Vegas"....... and for both taste and value..... this is my current 5-star winner.You only have to look at the 170+ reviews, with an average 4-1/2 star rating, to feel comfortable in anticipating a decent sandwich. What put this over the top for my business associate and me was both sandwiches and service.We were both wasted after another trade show day, standing on our feet, "gratefully" (I should qualify), talking to clients from around the US and World that visited our booth. By 5pm, we both agreed on "something simple" that we could take back to our off-strip condo's. Ironically, I'd never tried any Capriotti's location ever!? My loss. We order two hot sandwiches and two cold. Their "small" is 9", which is really a large in the typcial fresh-off-the-grill sandwich world. And this is a "sandwich kitchen" with a "hot-top grill", plenty of fresh onions, sweet bell peppers, mushrooms and plenty of Provalone... ready to join your grilled meats in a super "comfort food sandwich experience!" (I'd recommend you ask for "extra Provalone"... just because you can!)My personal thanks for the three person crew that cooked and served us that early evening! It was a pleasure stopping by, and the positive food and customer service experience will now make this particular location a "Must Add" to my "Vegas Black Book of Fooderies."Love this hole in wall place! =) Veggie Cheese Steak: 5 starsToasty & delicious, so tasty  =) The veggie chicken they had inside tasted so close to chicken that I couldn't believe it & the melted provolone cheese just gave it a delicious finish to it. Service: AGreat friendly service & they were so helpful too. Decor & Ambiance: AClean & chill place..great for groups/ families. Food: AOne of the best yummy Sandwiches that I've tasted in a long time!  =)This place beats Subway & Quiznos outta the water! ;)
Baja Fresh Mexican Grill=After having some Baja Fresh at the San Diego Airport on a recent trip, I was in the mood to have it again, so I stopped by this location.  After browsing the menu, I decided to try something new and ordered a Nacho Burrito (Chicken, Jack & Cheddar cheese, Pinto Beans, Rice, Smoky Queso Fundido, Jalapenos, Salsa, $6.79).http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/UMDYX0_C9TWxkANMoXBxGg?select=AqQo_Yxp0xhQO5owbgCVowWhile I was waiting for my food, I got some of the Spicy Salsa from the Salsa Bar.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/UMDYX0_C9TWxkANMoXBxGg?select=2raPMLrsrXO_6CSOdqgmpwhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/UMDYX0_C9TWxkANMoXBxGg?select=8eIvV0n0FRIh3yvggahHwAThe Nacho Burrito was OK, not great.  I wasn't too impressed with it.  It has a lot of potential, but just didn't seem to be as tasty as I had imagined.  The Salsa, which was supposed to be Spicy, was mild....bummer.Overall, it was an average visit for Baja Fresh.Return Factor - 65%
