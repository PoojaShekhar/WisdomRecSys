Restaurant name  Room 112

Review Text :
Hidden in a downtown bank building, Room 112 is easy to miss. But once you take the time to find it, you will be glad that you did. The environs are dark, modern, and comfortable, the staff friendly, and the menu tantalizing with enough variety to suit many palates. My companion and I opted for gyoza, a Just Pete sushi roll (fried smoked salmon, crab, avocado, and cream cheese), a beef and vegetable stir fry, and Singapore rice noodles with chicken and shrimp. The flavors were well-balanced, the meat was tender, and everything was fresh and fragrant. This might be the best-smelling restaurant I've ever had occasion to frequent. Prices were moderate, with good-sized portions for the money: We paid $6 for the app, $10 for the sushi, and $11-$12 each for the entrees. Ultimately, one who has enjoyed a lot of Asian cuisine won't be breaking any new ground here, but what familiar favorites Room 112 offers, it does damn well.

A first for me - a restaurant that specializes in Grilled Cheese sammies - in Vegas - RIGHT ON !!  I've seen a show about a  peanut butter sammie shop ( another great idea - maybe they put one next to this place )  but grilled cheese ? so they got the specialty menu - about 13 different cheese creations with cheese ranging from good 'ol american to Emmentaier / Gruyere ( damn if i know if  i spelled those right ! ) they also have various meats and veggies  - all UNDER $5 !!!  Grilled cheese brings back memories - fond memories of childhood - one of the premier comfort foods.  So i remember when i had a choice of how to make my grilled cheese - it was american cheese, crushed chips on rye bread - so that's what i ordered from the "construction worker " menu - 9 different cheeses you can try,  6 different breads and 17 different toppings,the result - FRICKIN' AWESOME  !  I actually had  a slight tear in my eye - made me think of momma !  All from a simple  grilled cheese sammie - the simple things in life .  I'm adding this to my monthly rotatation .poor pic addedFound this place on yelp -- they've only been open 3 weeks -- and I'd have to say, this is really a cool concept! I mean who doesn't like a grilled cheese right?We stopped in to grab a snack. We got The Apprentice, one with American cheese on whole wheat the other with muenster cheese on Texas toast with a side of curly fries and tomato soup.After ordering, we sat down and soon, the food was brought out to us. I'd have to say, the grilled cheese was really yummy! The hearty tomato soup was a little too thick for me, but it was tasty! We couldn't finish the soup so we brought it back with us. The young man said he didn't want any grilled cheese but he ate half of my order -- WTH! There are a bunch of cheese to choose from and your choice of bread including white, whole wheat, Texas toast and thin wheat (I think). The grilled cheese starts at under $3 and if you want, you can build your own or choose from one of the gourmet selections they have on the board.I thought it was pretty good! I'd come back again! I think Orange County needs one of these!! For sure!!PS: they even have soy cheese!PSS: the leftover soup, when reheated and some water added to it, came out perfect!!!What to say about Dads? Well there is a lot to say, like, " OH MY CHEESE".  I ordered the godfather and was a pleasantley surprised. They do not skimp on the meat, cheese, or peppers. This perfectly grilled little sandwich of goodness was perfect and really hit the spot. The girl at the counter recommended it and I now feel that she is a very smart person and deserves a tip. The atmosphere is interesting, the red walls tattered with grilled cheese pictures and the row of celeb visitors is an odd blend but it works. IT was a little different when I was standing at the register and the chef came out of the back and was dressed and decorated like he was working at a 5 star restaurant cooking tartar in the back. Now to me, this could be a good and a bad thing he either loves Flare or he is an amazing chef that had an amazing idea to make amazing grilled cheese sandwiches.... Guess what? He must be an amazing chef with an amazing idea because it was very very very good.So to the girl at the counter and the decorated chef in the back, Great job!!

11/29/10 and 12/13/112.5 starsVisited once (falafel pita and pizza) and ordered take-out (lamb pita).  Liked the pita bread and the veggies (though few) used, but the falafel portions were bland and dry.  Not even the extra garlic sauce and hummus (for which I had to twist their arms for) could add the flavor I was missing.  The pizza, while it looked good in the box, was also bland and VERY greasy!  I had one slice, threw away the cheese-barren parts, which didn't leave much to eat, and gave up due to seeing that huge  oil spill on the bottom of the box.  Brought the pie home and showed it to Mom and offered her some; She declined.  I tried toasting a few slices the next day, but by then, I could see that the pizza really didn't have much cheese on it, and the crust never crisped up in the toaster oven, no matter how long I kept the slices in there.  No wonder these pizzas are sold on the cheap!The lamb pita was actually pretty good!  I had low expectations since the first two products didn't deliver, but the lamb was actually quite nice-- tasty and not dry at all.  It actually was better than the lamb wrap I tried a few days later from the newly-opened branch of Pita Jungle at Scottsdale Fashion Square (oh, the lamb served there was HORRIBLE).  Hmm... well, I will say that we both liked it, and Mom has requested me to order it for her once more after.  Strange, though, that the last TWO requests for Jamie's lamb pita she asked of me, she quickly retracted, saying she changed her mind...  I should get her to tell me why the change of heart...I've wondered about their special Rosewater lemonade and their baklava, but every time I decide to try one, they've just run out.

All I can say is that the deep dish pizza here is fantastic!  Super good garlic knots too.  Service is good.  It's located inside the Four Queens.  If you can't find it just ask one of the staff.  I was hungry and after I ate, I wasn't.  That is all.

Restaurant name  Brooks Sandwich House
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Brooks is that hole in the wall, off the beaten path Mecca.  There is no accidently finding it, you have to be going there.  It is a tiny  walk up counter, pretty smoky from the exhaust.  Simple breakfast items, burgers and dogs. Everything is wrapped in that heavenly white paper.  No tables and chairs, only one long table outside. A very fun visit to fulfill the chowhound in you. Brooks is one of those special places that you need to go at least once.Cash only, closes 2p in the afternoon.This. Place.I can't believe I've lived in Charlotte for 5 years and somehow hadn't wandered over to Brooks'. It's perfect casual location for a take-out lunch with friends.I looked on Yelp to make sure we were all talking about the same place. Greasy, happy food in paper bags-cash only. Yep, that's the one.We arrived and I was immediately overcome with the aroma of sizzling beef. Vegetarian or not, you can't argue with that smell. It's divine.One of my dining partners, a MD, is a regular, and I heard shouts of, "Hey, Doc!" and realized the owners have a personal relationship with their customers. Something I truly appreciate.Having perused the menu ahead of time, I found that there aren't really any overt vegetarian options, but I didn't let that dampen my enthusiasm. I opted for an off-the-menu grilled cheese with tomato. No balking by the staff, and I think my sandwich was sublime. Coupled with fresh, nicely salted fries and a canned soft drink, it left nothing to be desired.What I appreciated about the grilled cheese is that it was served on a hamburger bun, but was pressed almost like a cuban sandwich...so the edges were crisp and held up well to the potentially soggy tomato situation.Once we received our orders, labeled in small paper bags, it was out to the covered, long, standing picnic table just outside the door. I love the communal dining aspect of the experience and the opportunity it afforded to enjoy a lunch while standing and chatting with my friends.One of the twin brothers stepped outside to share a joke with our party. Super southern, super kind. They're open for breakfast and lunch, Monday through Friday, and appear to have a large, fiercely loyal following. Apparently their chili is a big deal. So go try Brooks'. Take along a few friends, a $20 and some TUMS. You'll leave happy.You know how long I've been wanting to try this place?!  LONG OVERDUE!  Finally I got to try the famous Brooks burger last week for lunch. My $3.50 cheeseburger all-the-way (onion, chili & mustard, I asked for slaw on top of it at no extra charge) was well worth every penny. The single pattie was grilled to a slight crisp on the outside but retained a good balance of juicy meat flavor with a hint of seasoning. Everything else added on made it a filling portion (at least for me). The menu board was short and sweet, the only side item was fries basically... which wasn't anything special.  The whole eating under the outdoor hut/shed structure standing up along a wood slab table with everyone added to the experience. There will be many Brooks lunch outing in the future... I may have to give other items a try.Tips to eating at Brooks:1.Don't wear white... or anything light color, especially if you doing all the way southern style.2. Lettuce and tomato cost extra, but seriously, stick with chili and onion and slaw... you're in the South, enjoy the perk3. May not be a bad idea to bring some wet naps4. As you may know already, CASH only, so bring themChili burger or chili dog?! The struggle is very real my friends. My advice: just go ahead and get both. I first discovered Brooks Sandwich House a few years ago here on Yelp. It's nothing fancy, just a little stand alone building over by Heist in NoDa. This little hidden gem has been cranking out deliciousness for more than 40 years. I love the chili. So, my orders always consist of things smothered in that homemade goodness. A cheeseburger or hot dog all the way... either makes any day better. Order both and it makes the day A LOT better. Might as well get some chili cheese fries while you're at it. They also have options like bologna, livermush, and bbq (when available) on the menu. One day, I will be brave and try livermush. My friend Eddie swears by it. Note: Brooks is open Monday-Friday (no weekends) for breakfast and lunch. It is cash only, so plan accordingly. The place is small, so there is no indoor seating. Place your order, wait for your number to be called, then go pay. There are some outdoor seats if the weather is nice.

So, it's a Saturday morning and I'm in the kitchen making over-easy eggs accompanied by toast, baby tomatoes and fresh basil and my boyfriend in the living room says, "you're cooking? I thought we could go to brunch." Oh... okay. I never say no to brunch so stopped in my tracks and plated the "breakfast appetizers," considering it a good idea since any good breakfast place in Charlotte seems to have a 20-30 minutes wait.I was right. We drove down to South Park and put our name in (30 minute wait, as anticipated) and decided to do a little shopping at the Container Store while we waited. We're getting pretty good at fitting errands into dining based on location. Anyway, once 25-30 minutes had gone by we headed back to Terrace, where the hostess was ready to take us to our table. Perfect timing! We were seated upstairs overlooking the restaurant and ordered coffee and fresh orange juice. I had the shrimp and grits (I'm becoming quite the southerner) and we shared a side of the red velvet waffles... OMG. Both were so amazing. I'm not even a waffle person when I brunch, but these were stellar. Also, give me something cajun with a side of okra and I'm a happy girl- big fan of Terrace's shrimp and grits. I left full but surprisingly not feeling TOO full- we still had a lot of errands to run that day. Oh, Saturdays!First thing to know, you're going to wait! Come early and look through the menu before so you can order as soon as you get seated.I had a bloody mary at the bar while waiting to be seated. If you're alone or with a small group, you can try to get a seat at the bar! I was pleased with the taste (sometimes it's too watery?) and the slice of bacon of course made it even better! We got seated 45 minutes after we got there, which was the estimated time they gave us. They contact you by phone, so you can wander around while you wait.I ordered the red velvet waffle, fried chicken, and a side of cheesy grits (choice of grits or hash browns.) Everything was really good! The waffle wasn't too sweet and it complemented the chicken really well. The chicken was crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside, just how it should be. The grits were tasty, I mean, anything with cheese is tasty.Overall, a great food experience! Just don't come too hungry and think you'll be able to get seated right away. It's a busy place obviously for a good reason!We ordered the Velvet Waffle.  It was Oh boy super delicious.  It was cruchy outside and soft inside so perfect.  I can eat about 20 of their waffles in one meal no problem.  The price is reasonable average about 10 dollars per dishes.The seating is so cute, upstair and downstair.  On the upstair, they set up as a terrace so u could see thru the down stairs.

Review Text :
Um, clearly many of you have never had real Mexican food.My best friend raved about this place ever since I told her I was moving to Vegas from California and needed to discover new Mexican restaurants to help curb my insatiable craving. She mentioned how much she loved Lindo so I gave it a shot -- but girl you are trippin'.Lindo Michoacan is overpriced, bland, and flavors were just flat out weird. The salsas lacked that kick that I love and expect from freshly made salsa. The decor was a chain restaurant nightmare. However portions were big if you like that kind of thing and the view is quite beautiful. The search for delicious Mexican food in Vegas continues! (Please, any suggestions are welcome!)Has anyone seen the South Park episode where Cartman goes to "Casa Bonita?" Well, this place is the same thing, just with no tall diving board or pool. That would be cool though. Lindo Michoacan sits a top a hill that has a great view of the Las Vegas strip from Henderson. Seriously, fantastic view of the strip and even more awesome at night. I came here on a suggestion from a friend and decided to bring the entire family along. First off, this place is huge; tall ceilings, large dinning area, and a large bar with a window view. Lindo is also very loud with live music playing and giant bells ringing (reminding you there's a birthday happening with 50 feet), plus there are kids everywhere. Kids are usually a red flag for me to turn and run out, but I had about eight people with me so escape was not an option.We sat down and immediately ordered table-side guacamole and margaritas. They have two versions; spicy and regular, we ordered two of each and we're amazed to watch two servers on each end of the tables churn out this green pile of goopy goodness. By the way, you automatically get chips, salsa, and bean dip at your table when you sit down. I lived in SoCal for quite awhile and was privy to a lot of guacamole and Lindo ranks at the top of my guac loving tastebuds. My favorite was the spicy version; great flavor, creamy with crunchy texture, and just enough spice. Highly recommended! There were a lot of dishes going on at this table, but let's focus on me because...well just because. I ordered the Chili Verde Pork plate; it was both fantastic and huge! This plate is made up of pork that is slow cooked in a green chili sauce for hours until it pretty much melts in your mouth. The pork was super tender and also came with homemade flour tortillas.These were perfectly chewy and soft. I rarely can't finish my meal, but I was stuffed by the fourth bite. Yay, for midnight snacks! The service here was impeccable and the atmosphere was fun. Great place for families and a possible low-key date night. I might be back for few a cocktails and sunset view of the Strip.

Review Text :
I would have given 1-1.5 stars had the manager not tried to make it up to me and my party for the bad service by comping a few dishes. Despite that, I would rather have paid full price and gotten excellent service. There are too many great restaurants in Las Vegas to choose from. My bad experience here has guaranteed that I will not be spending my money here again. It's a beautiful restaurant with low lighting and lots of dark wood. It reflects the design in Aria, which I love a LOT! Very chic and minimalist but very stylish. The food here was excellent. Very good tasting food. However, it took forever to come out and our mushroom sides, which probably takes the least amount of time to cook, came at the very end after we were finished with everything else. Doesn't make sense to me.Our waiter was nice but after he took our order, he seemed to have pulled a vanishing act. We didn't see him at all until we asked a busboy to find him for us. He was forgetful. I asked for straws 3x and he finally got me one. But I had asked for 4. He came back with 6 more. ???What annoyed us even more was that we were trying to enjoy our meals and the busboys removed our plates and dishes without asking first! We weren't even done with our food! Geeez just because we wanted to take our time to eat, savor the food and just chill, doesn't mean we're done. We were conversing and eating at the same time. We don't want to stuff our faces right away like a bunch of pigs. Just because we put our forks down doesn't mean we're done eating. My friend had to stop the busboy from taking her plate by pushing his hand away.So after they removed our dishes and utensils, another dish came out. They totally forgot to give us new utensils. How the hell were we supposed to eat our Bolognese with??? Our hands?! We had to hail someone down after waiting for a while just to ask for forks. Really? For a restaurant such as this, I really expected a lot more. The service wasn't even average. It just sucked. I give credit to where credit is due. This place doesn't make the cut for me. You're better off dining somewhere else. Try Julian Serrano or Beso. Much better.

Just check out the Rainbow Donuts reviews. These people are cool. The ninja bowls are perfect in flavor, size and variety. I have had the one with Jalapenos, it was hot and good. I had the one with bacon, the greasy bowl... it was good and I have had the regular one large and it was good. I like these better then Samurai Sam's. I think it is the freshly grilled chicken, I don't know.

Restaurant name  Benjarong Authentic Thai Cuisine
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
I finally got around to visiting this one.  A few people have asked me now if I've been here, and it is just so far from my house!  It was totally worth the trip though.  I was impressed.  Benjarong is a gourmet Thai restaurant that is taking American Thai food to the next level.  I ordered the Salmon steak green curry ($15.99) and the Crab papaya salad ($8.99).The crab papaya salad was pretty good.  It was slightly sweet with no vinegar, but the flavor went well with the crab legs.  The crab legs themselves had to be cracked.  They weren't the best crab legs I have ever had, and there were only three of them, but this was a really nice addition to the dish.  The one downside is that I wouldn't say this was an authentically flavored papaya salad, and Thais might be disappointed in this classic dish.   The portion was huge though, and I couldn't even finish half of it.  Next up was the salmon green curry.  This had a beautiful presentation, with a light green curry sauce with green peas, spread in a thin layer over the dish.  The portion of salmon was healthy, and the quality was too.  The curry sauce was a bit sweet, but I could tell it was a homemade curry sauce, and was well made.  It reminded me of the style of curry served at Pan Asian, but lighter.  I liked the fact that there wasn't a soup of this curry.  That would have been too sweet.  The curry was used like a light sauce rather than a traditional fully loaded soupy or chunky curry.  It went really well with the salmon in such a refined way.  The salmon, while deliciously prepared, did have a few bones. In Thailand, the bones are eaten, but this could bother some Western patrons.  Take it from me though, the dish was worth the few little bones.  I was impressed by this Thai restaurant.  It fits in well with the area, and goes for an affordable, but upscale atmosphere and food style.  There are a few dishes on the menu that I don't believe I have tried.  Some of the dishes are definitely a bit Americanized, but they are done well.  I have a feeling that digging deeper into the menu would result in finding some good, authentic dishes.  I wish I lived closer so that I could explore this Thai restaurant a little more.

Quick lunch while waiting for a prescription at the nearby Teeter. It was busy for lunchtime, but I was able to take a seat and place my order quickly. Lunch specials are either a slice and a salad or two slices, each with a soda. I chose the latter.Special slices rotate on a day by day basis, but today was the White Wolf (veggies and fresh basil) and the New York, New York (lots of meat). I went with one of each.Since the pizzas aren't made to order for the lunch special, it didn't take long for them to arrive at my table. The NY, NY was greasy as expected. The White Wolf was tasty and needed only a little shake of the red pepper to kick it up. Sadly, neither slice was especially hot when they arrived.It was okay for quick, but I think I liked the Pizza Peel nearby much better.

Utterly superb customer service!There must be at least 47 employees buzzing around like bees.  I was startled by an offer to "help you right here sir!" only seconds after entering the front door, before my eyes had even adjusted to the change in light.Awesome menu offerings and wide selection of choices.+ Fresh not frozen burgers with lots of customization available. + Tasty desserts =Great American Fast FoodI love frozen custard! Imagine super rich and creamy soft serve and that's frozen custard. As Shannon C. mentioned, they'll always have vanilla or chocolate and you can build your own sundae for as little as $2.39 (includes 1 scoop and 2 toppings) and they make something similar to a Blizzard (Concrete Mixer) for $2.89 (short size) but I keep an eye on the flavor of the day (http://www.culvers.com/flavors.aspx?storeId=399) for my guide. I mean, seriously, Double Marshmallow Oreo (Rich chocolate custard loaded with Oreo cookie pieces and marshmallow creme)? Or, Butter Brickle (Specially blended butter pecan custard enhanced with all-time favorite chewy chunks of Heath Bar.)  Who could resist a special trip!?!Culver's is known for their ButterBurgers, though. It's worth noting that unless you order a Deluxe you have to specify which of the toppings like mayonnaise, mustard, ketchup, pickles, onions, tomato and lettuce you want; otherwise, ya just get a buttered bun! They make a big deal about the meat being "fresh, never frozen 100% US raised" and cooked to order and they're pretty tasty, but this is a fast food burger, not what I like to refer to as a "backyard burger." So keep your expectations in check an you will be pleased.The counter service has been good each time I've visited, but I have to give a shout out to my favorite, Luther, who broke it all down for me and, no doubt, made my first visit to the Metro location go smooth. It's worth noting they have items besides burgers, like salads and pot roast dinners. Although I haven't ventured there yet, I happen to be a fan of pork tenderloin sandwiches and am looking forward to giving the one at Culver's a try.  But, it's going to have to be on a day that I cannot resist the Flavor of the Day... maybe Friday for Strawberry Cheesecake!Dang you Culver's, with your proximity and convenient drive through! With all the nearby Baskin-Robbins and DQs now closed, I find myself at Culver's a bit too often.I do love frozen custard. I'd like to say that I'm not going to say that I had way better frozen custard back East. But I'm not, because I did.Nonetheless, theirs is pretty decent. They have some tasty flavors of the day. The toppings are ridiculously sweet, however. But obviously it's not enough to keep me away.Hey buttah buttah!  Hey buttah buttah!3 & 3/10th stars.This food reminds me of my childhood.  That's right, I have been eating healthy since a very young age.  Especially things like chili cheese fries.  My daughter pointed out that they know the 3 secrets of French cooking...butter, butter and butter.The burgers are pretty decent for a fast food burger.  Fries were ok, tasty soft serve but the portion varies wildly based on my two visits.  8 meals for 4 bucks is probably a good idea these days as well.I was watching a Judge Judy show today and JJ was really giving the business to this loser (you know...had bad credit, met a chick, she took a credit card in her name, he didn't pay her back, she's shocked, now they're in court)...she was RIDING his ass. It was awesome. Finally she said "what planet are you from?"...Dude with mullet bows his head, darts his eyes from JJ and says "Why, I'm from Wisconsin Judge Judy".LMAO!Culver's, by way of the Dairy State, has settled on Camelback and Central. Rickie and I ate here after seeing Date Night on our "date night". Thought it was a cute, innocent, 1950s way to wrap up our afternoon. You know, kinda like Richie and Laurie Beth. Please, I need to check ID's on this reference. I'm sure Rickie wouldn't pass this one!Culver's was very clean with well trained and polite employees...think In N Out. We ordered the famous Butter Burgers along with various sides. Burgers. Yum! Sides. Ugh! Would rather have had Ore Ida. Cheese curds had a thick, icky overcooked batter with a Q tip sized cheese curd, fries were limp and sad (kind of like Jesse James career and life now) and the chicken tenders were standard fast food fare.Root Beer! Outstanding! Smoothie was OK...probably should have went with a good old fashion malt. But who knew?We had a fabulous booth across from a large open window with a fantastic Sunday breeze cooling our curds. I would go back for a burger and root beer. I might even wear a Packers or Brewers t shirt...just to see if I get some free stuff.

Review Text :
Umm...W-T-F?!??!!!Came here to grab some food and a drink. First of all, the place was dead and the decor/vision of the place seems all over the place. But whatever. We seat ourselves.After about 15 minutes the server comes over and asked what we wanted to drink. And then tosses some menus on the table, while saying: "Sorry guys, we just opened. We don't have a fucking clue what's going on". Fine. Beers arrive. The menu did not look impressive. At all. I ordered fries and gravy. Not much you can mess up there right? WRONG. How about salt-less stale fries and gravy that tastes as if it crawled out of a can.But this gets better...Server: Omg, did you guys see that guy?Me: What guy?Server: The one that was just arrested outside?Me: Excuse me?!?Server: Oh yeah! It was crazy...he walked in here with his penis hanging out.Me: WHAT?????????Server: Yeah, it was just hanging out.Me: Ummm...check please.Bad food? Overpriced beer? And crazies? No thanks.Phoenix, we need to seriously recognize that we have a great thing going here and exploit it.  We're humbly cool, our best restaurant is a pizza place, we're a tough crowd who has a artistic bent, we need to celebrate that.  Sucker Punch Sally's does.  So does the Roosevelt, Four Peaks, Fez, Stinkweeds, Hoodlums, Cowtown, Sunset Clothing, Frances, Honey Bears, Queen's Pizza, Lux, Pita Jungle...If you haven't gleaned, I love this place.  I don't know the owners, they might not like me, as I'm a bit square, but I'm so happy they are taking this risk.  The use the Rockabilly motif and rock it out in spades.Menu is standard diner fare, but with a twist.  They aren't running their full menu yet, smart move for a business getting on its feet in this economy, but what they are offering is good dinner food.The three of us had a great time there.  $3 16oz Pabst, great loose meet sandwich and the homemade BBQ chips that came with it.  Had a bite of the Navajo Taco and the Pork Tenderloin sandwich, both very good and huge portions.  The rest of the menu is great too, chilli fries, wings (try the Sally's sauce), milkshakes and (thank the lord) affordable breakfast served all day.They also have a full bar and soda fountain.  And they have a stage for live music.  And they are open 24 hours.  You know what else is open 24 hours in Phoenix?  F'ing McDisgustings and a bunch of crap Mex places.  Love Phoenix or Leave Phoenix (or make it somewhere you can love)A breakfast spot on Mill? Hurray! I was so excited when Sucker Punch Sally's opened, I work on Mill and there has not been a "hot" breakfast spot within walking distance in years. By "hot" I mean something other than donuts and bagels. I looked them up online and was confused when the website listed was for a bike shop.. Hmm ok so I can't order ahead. I walked over and placed an order to go. The staff was very friendly, and explained that the owner also owns a bike shop (old school choppers and such) in Scottsdale. They should have the website update soon yadayada.I ordered a Denver omelet with hashbrowns, walked back to work and opened up the box. I should mention that it was about 10am and I was starving. I would have ate just about anything at that point, or so I thought. I opened up my box and looked down in disgust. Before me was an undercooked omelet (see picture) so undercooked that there was a puddle of yolk/water in the box, and to go with it was a side of freezer burned, undercooked hash browns. The hash browns were browned on the top but raw and soggy underneath. I was so disappointed, I tried choking it down but my taste buds revolted and I had to throw it away. It's interesting  to see 5 star reviews for this place. Lower standards perhaps? Or maybe I just had a bad experience? I doubt that as  there have been 4 other people I work with that have been over there and all had bad experiences. 1 star for getting  the name right, after that breakfast I felt "Sucker Punched".

Ordered the french onion soup and it was so salty I could barely eat it. Best part though? The slice of bread on top was a hamburger bun. How LAME.  The waitress was cool and very attentive. My friend ordered chili cheese fries that were huge and tasted decent.  The burger was a greasy mess. I love the set up of this place, there have been so many different restaurants here and none seem to last long. And with mediocre food I doubt this one will last.

Stopped by with my boyfriend today after saying, "It can't possibly be THAT bad."  At least not worse than I remember.  Oh no dear reader, it was much worse.  I write this review while we both lay around the house in misery bemoaning the urge to throw it all up but courting an even greater urge not to have to taste any of it ever again.The restaurant decor is punctuated by signs telling you not to take more than you can eat so they don't have to charge more.  "They can raise the prices all they want,"  my boyfriend grunted as he pushed an unfinished plate away.  "I am NEVER coming here again!  They can't make me!"The buffet is full of whatever they can find that wont cost them too much.  Jello,  sushi made out of cream cheese, fried rice that's not actually fried - just mixed with yellow food coloring the best we can tell.  I ate a mislabeled shrimp wrapped in what I think was a chicken patty...only the shrimp hadn't been cleaned.  The chow main was made with spaghetti noodles.  The only items were eating were the egg rolls and banana halves rolled around in strawberry syrup, which I imagine came frozen.  Everything else is either stale, old, lukewarm, under-cooked, or questionably labeled.    A tray of shrimp in sauce were labeled "Pigs Feet" and left mostly untouched by the diners.  The last straw came when I sampled an empty cream puff.  (Though my boyfriends managed to get filling in it.)They didn't ask us if we enjoyed our meal when we paid.I imagine they don't really care."Don't worry honey,"  my boyfriend said on the ride home.  "If the spaghetti-mein was that slippery going down just think of how slippery it will be coming out."Oh no.This is probably the most sketchiest buffet I've ever been to. I was told it's $6 so hey why not try it?When you walk in you can already see how dirty this place is. Not a good first impression. Now the food. I'll give it to this place for having a decent variety in food but it looks and tastes like it's been sitting there all day. The rice, meats, and some seafood were hard and dry. The wet food items were sticky and smelled funny. The best things in this buffet are the ribs, chicken wings, and the egg drop soup. Their best is decent. Their soft served ice cream didn't even taste good. All I tasted was wet sugar. I'd only come here if I was insanely starving and only had $6.

Enjoyed it here!On a spontaneous trip to Vegas this past Memorial Day weekend, I had the honor of meeting some down to earth peeps (DJ David and Chrissy) whom introduced my friend and I to some local Mediterranean food off the strip.After a long drive, we needed a quick bite to eat before hitting the nightlife scene so this was a convenient place for us. This small and casual restaurant accomodates nearly all kinds of foodies..from the health-conscious to the hard-core carnivores. Waitress was attentive and we were seated almost immediately. I liked the colorful and bright menu! Being as indecisive as I am, you really couldn't go wrong with the menu selection. Everything sounded familiar, simple, and straight-forward. I ordered the "Vegetarian Gyro" sandwich (tabouleh, fresh veggies, and tzatziki sauce) and my friend ordered the "Simply The Best" sandwich (Authentic gyro meat, lettuce, tomatoes, onions and tzatziki sauce.)  Both ~$6-7 and a decent portion size.KEY IMPORTANCE: Freshness!!!Upon arrival (quick service btw), I was visually impressed at the setup and freshness of the ingredients. Presentation is important to me so my mouth was salivating already. My camera phone didn't do it justice though (see pics), but let me tell you..as simple as the ingredients were...nothing beats a good gyro, but FRESH and TOP QUALITY ingredients! This had THAT!!! The tabouleh was flavored nicely. Simple and Delish!My friend devoured his sandwich in what seemed like 3 bites or maybe it was 2 and a half. It all happened so fast that by the time I looked at him, he was smiling with a look of sweet and utter satisfaction! According to him, "It WAS simply the best." HAHA! Or maybe he was just THAT hungry?! =pAs for me...I'm a pretty slow eater. I made sure to chew 13 times before I swallowed. haha. Okay..maybe not 13 times, but I did let all the flavors dance around in my mouth, but only to get a text soon after to meet up with the rest of our crew in 20 minutes! EEk! So I got to eat half and took the rest "doggy-bag" style.  Only 4 stars since the restroom could have used a bit of a makeover. I know, but I'm anal like that. Anywhoo, I will definitely head back to "Ambrosia Cafe" to try out their other menu items. I hear their "Falafel Sandwich" and "Eggplant Parmesan sub" are HITS!A great and quick stop to get your Mediterranean fix on!

Review Text :
When I first moved here it was a Mic-Nics which is no more.  A few years back Federico's acquired the property and cleaned it up and painted it a bit brighter.  This location is open 24 hours but the dining room closes from 1-5AM.  It's a chain that started in New Mexico and expanded to Arizona at some point in time. They already had a presence here in 93 and was my first introduction to 24 hour taco shops.  I haven't been to one in a while for no particular reason, except maybe they were not in my path when I wanted Mexican.Having expanded here from New Mexico instead of the San Diego area like Filberto's and their many copy cats there are some differences in how identical menu items are prepared.  I had my standard plate of shredded beef taco and a cheese enchilada with beans and rice ($5.79) and a med fountain drink ($1.49).  First thing I noticed was there was no grease in the taco.  That may have been part of the slight flavor difference.  Also the cheese enchilada was made with a corn tortilla instead of the more common flour.  I thought they were a bit stingy with the cheese on both items, but I like lots of cheese on almost anything.In general everything was clean and while I was there the tables were cleaned off and the salsa station was checked and neatened up.  This was a Wednesday lunch and three tables were in use and a few take out orders handled.  Only one person spoke English, and then only just enough to get his job done.In a two day span, I frequented this monument to lard, not once, but twice; making Federico's my defunct dinner for two days in a row.How did this happen? Why did this happen?These were questions I woefully pondered as I spent nearly 3/4 of a sunday perched upon the porcelain throne, evacuating my bowels like Anderson Cooper and his news crew amidst a chaotic Tahrir square. The only reason to my madness, that I could fathom, in the clouded and reeking haze I was brewing that sabbath day, was that I had literally drank or smoked myself retarded- so much so that my ravenous appetite overwhelmed my better judgement.Friday night, my mistake was assuming that the graveyard shift would care enough to properly cook an Adobada burrito at 2 am. It honestly tasted like they doused some chorizo in red chili sauce wrapped it in a tortilla and threw it out the delivery window like an unwanted baby in bath water.Saturday night for one idiot reason or another I ordered a green chili burrito, which I'd assumed would be hard to fuck up, apparently not. This didnt taste like green chili pork, perhaps It'd be more apt to label it as "boiled pork offal with a splash of tomatillo salsa" it was proabably the worst green chili i've had in a long while.Sunday, Montezuma claimed his bloody revenge on this descendant of Spanish immigrants (had this angry aztec spirit bothered to scan my family lineage on ancestry.com he'd have realized that the spanish on my mothers side is hardly large enough to exact vengeance for atrocities committed by cortez and his cronies in the 16th century, but who am I to question undead central american monarchs) ahem. Lets just say I dont enjoy prolonged bathroom visits and this is what Federico's translates to in my vernacular.

Review Text :
I cannot pass up the opportunity to take the FTR (First To Review) on Chef Aaron May's latest creation... I stopped by for a drink during their grand opening celebration last night.  While I arrived too late to sample the food, those around me said it was fabulous... The place was packed but I think that is just because it was the grand opening... Located right on Main Street in Old Town, I can see this place being a perfect spot to grab a drink or a light bite after work, or as a more laid back place to go with a small group of people on a weekend night.  Aaron did a fabulous job with the decor.  I will return soon and update my review then... but I encourage anyone seeking a new hot spot in Old Town to go check out Mabel's On Main!Very nice atmosphere- dark walls, w/ furnishings in deep browns and burgundy tones.  Loved the plush railing at the bar- very comfortable!   Cool tunes, and while I really liked how it was very easy to converse w/ the next person in the beginning of my stay here (even the people across from us could hear what we were saying), by the end of the evening, the music did get louder.  The cocktail menu looked great, but the prices made me balk...Mabel's happy hour menu also features great-sounding apps!  A couple across from us recommended the pork belly.  While I can't even bring myself to imagine swallowing pillows of pork belly fat, which will eventually become pillows of belly fat on me (!), I do see other propitious options.Ummm.....so.....what's up with the whole 'goat' thing. Has no one else noticed the goat theme? How has this not been mentioned??Seriously, there's a goat head hanging on the wall (possibly more than one), little goats on the menus and bill book. I half expected to look up in the ladies room to find a goat peering over the stall. It was creepy and confusing. I NEED to understand it!!or...maybe not.Moving forward: The food was truly fantastic. We had the pork belly and deviled eggs with caviar, which were the two standouts for me. The meatball dish wasn't bad, I just feel as though I could have made it at home with things I already have in my refrigerator, so all in all, nothing special.Our Manhattan's were quite good overall but lacked consistency. If there was a next time, I would stick to wine.The problems I have with Mabel's are the following:If this review was based on food alone, it would warrant at least 4 stars, however the running question between myself and my guy the entire evening (other than the goat conundrum) was whether or not we even saw anyone else order or eat anything.That may not matter much to anyone, but why waste such talent on a place that seems to serve little more purpose than to be the next drop in for a bunch of 30k douchebags and  their cheap, tacky, sparkly dressed girlfriends. Seriously ladies and partially tucked gents, 1998 called, it wants it's bad taste back. Have some class. I don't need to see your manscaped chest or your womans' ass cheek hanging out of the bottom of her $29.99 dress. I may have been able to bump the rating up to three stars if the service wasn't  so awkward. I can't stand it when a server (almost always female) makes eye contact and directs conversation to my date only. I don't appear threatening, I smile a lot and try to make eye contact, I'm not going to bite you.....LOOK AT ME!! I'm a pretty cool chick and I'd like you to acknowledge my existence...thanks. For some reason, this happens to me frequently. I waited tables myself back in the day and I can't wrap my brain around that one but oh well. All in all the food was excellent. Drinks were alright. Service was weird. If we hadn't already had a table from dinner and were forced to stand I could totally see myself wanting to shank some bitches.  The whole experience felt a little 'Twilight Zone' especially with the goat situation. Doubtful return.This update is LONG overdue. Mabel's has become one of my favorite spots and is a solid part of my nightlife rotation. With that said, it has also become the cause and center of many drunken stories! And we all know drunken stories are the best stories...but this is about Mabel's, not my shenanigans. :) Music, whether live or spun by a DJ is always stellar. Makes me shake my groove thang and want to party like it's 1999! Service, every visit aside from my first has been top notch. Twice I've had table service with Holly as our server. She is amazing! They really take care of you when you have a group/event. Greg, the manager always addresses me by name and says hi when I'm there. Pure class. Also, they have some hotties working there I love to flirt with. (Yes, I'm talking about you, Silas...I may not have twitted you but I Yelped you! ;)Drinks/Food, fantastic. They have great bubbly here. And bubbly cocktails. Yum. Of course they have all the top shelf liquor. Bottle service is phenomenal. They get creative with your drinks for you if you want and we had this grey goose/soda/ginger drink that was major yum. I've only tried a few of the items on the menu (deviled eggs, scallops, and something else I can't recall, too much bubbly! hehe) but they were all delish and perfect for snacking. I was told they revamped their menu and I have yet to try the new items but look forward to it! Now that the weather is cooler, they have started really enforcing dress code. You see a lot of guys in suits and ladies wearing their Saturday night best. Just the way I like it! I can't say enough good things about this place. If you haven't been to Mabel's, you are really missing out. Your Scottsdale nightlife will not be complete until you pay them a visit.Be careful when you order happy hour drinks! Don't open a tab! Last night, we went to celebrate a friend who graduated and is leaving the country, and came at the beginning of the 7-9 happy hour. We were a pretty large group, and our waitress was very attentive, ensuring that we all had fresh drinks when required. My boyfriend and I each had two old fashioneds (olds fashioned?), which were watered down and full of ice, but for $5 we weren't complaining. However, when we requested our check at 9:15 (fifteen minutes after happy hour ended), our waitress gave us a group check for almost $300, with everyone charged full price for their drinks. When we complained, she said that she had no way of knowing what time any of us ordered our drinks, so she couldn't give us the happy hour prices, even though we had been there for two hours. Suddenly, what should have been a $20 check became $74, including an outrageous auto-gratuity. This may not matter to the typical Old Town Scottsdale crowd, but we are graduate students and can't afford a bar tab like that. So, thanks, Mabel's, for stealing my food budget for the week. With every bowl of ramen, I'll think of you.Love the vibe of this place. It's fun and chill and can have a good crowd. Didn't get to try too much of the food, but what I did try, the mac and cheese, was really yummy and the wine selection wasn't bad and the fact that they had happy hour certainly doesn't hurt either. My friend had a table for his birthday and it was really great and the staff was super. And the music was pretty good and there was a place to actually dance if you wanted to. It's a place worth going to when you're looking for dinner and drinks or an alternative to the usual dance clubs in Old Town.It started off as a crush, but now I think I am in love.  I went here for the first time on a  'Girl's Night Out'.  It was fun, with a great atmosphere, pretty people and good service.  Then there was a loooooong gap in time and Mabel's had faded away as a mere distant memory of a cute bar I once went to.  Then, finally, a few happy hours and I eventually met Chele.  She is the amazing bartender who wooed me many an evening at Mabel's with her bartending prowess and dazzling gin drinks.  Unfortunately, for all of you reading this now, she has left for New York city to concur the bar scene there and I wish her the best.  My favorite Chele conversation: "I have always worked in speakeasy kind of places since I started bartending, so I know lots of old-timer drinks and martinis, but the down side is I don't really know the 'younger' drinks."  And I say, "Well, what do you mean?" And Chele replies, "Well, this college girl once ordered a Tic-Tac, and I asked what is in a Tic-Tac.  And the college girl replied in her most valley voice possible, "how do you NOT know what is in a tic-tac, it is an 'ASU-thing'''...and what did Chele say??? "Well honey this is not ASU"  Priceless, and what makes it better is I don't think Chele is much older than 25!  Man, I am going to miss her.So, this is not even the climax yet.  I also stumbled in another random Tuesday evening to witness the filming of Mob Wives.  Not that I am a Mob Wives fan but it was funny to watch 'reality' TV being arranged...Finally, the point this relationship really turned into love was right before Christmas.  I was out on a cold Thursday night with 2 of my girlfriends, whom I had not seen in a long time.  The beginning of the night had been ruined at another drinking establishment, and the evening seemed to have been forgone and Mabel's was our last hope.  We must have looked defeated as we walked in the door, because after we sat down a fine gentleman came over to ask what we were drinking.  I looked at him closely and thought, he does not look like a server...it was one of the owners.  He introduced us to our fabulous waitress, Christina I think, and our evening was perfect from that point forth.  We also met the General Manager who was just as outstanding.  After 3 hours of many cocktails, shooters, good times and a cab ride later, I knew I had found my new favorite bar in Old Town.

I love Sandwiches.....so I decided to stop by this joint for lunch recently.  After browsing the menu for a minute, I decided I was going to order the New Yorker (Pastrami, Cole Slaw, Thousand Island Dressing, on Marbled Rye) w/Fries & Pickle for $8.99.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mKybTX2TTB_f_q9gj0s85Q?select=wYhry_TSaeyE3jlM3kqRTgTo wash it down, I ordered a large drink for $2.29.When you walk in, you get into a line like a cafeteria.  Then you place your order with someone who prepares you meal for you and then pay the cashier.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mKybTX2TTB_f_q9gj0s85Q?select=5tUWH1ZbuhFAMnR5sYaztAIt's an efficient process and it allows you to see other people's orders just in case you want to change your mind.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mKybTX2TTB_f_q9gj0s85Q?select=XQa5ffhPOJPUWHb_ULqogQI couldn't wait to take a bite out of my Sandwich.  The Cole Slaw comes inside the Sandwich, which I love.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mKybTX2TTB_f_q9gj0s85Q?select=Son0jYmuPk8BM11ZBga8dAThe only downside to this is that it makes the Sandwich very soggy fast as the Slaw will soak the Bread.  But that's OK with me.  I took one bite and thought the Sandwich was OK.  The flavor was pretty good, but I don't know, it wasn't great......didn't leave me wanting more.  The Fries were pretty good, but again just OK.  The Pickle was very good and was complimentary....very cool.Overall, it was a good meal.  There are other Sandwiches on the menu that I want to try.Return Factor - 65%

I had dinner here tonight with friend and fellow yelper John M. Rather than ordering individual items, we decided to try a half bandeja: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/NSmTvGgirPJ4mJ9jzNW-eA?select=3WQJvXTP_2auQSAcnL_k0g (a full bandeja feeds 4 people), which turned out to be a very good choice. The savory array in the bandeja included tostones, rice, carotas negras (black beans), fried eggs, blood sausage, chorizo, grilled steak, shredded beef, avocado halves, sweet fried plantains ... and an arepa, of course. If you come here with company, I highly recommend the half or full bandeja (depending on the number of people in your party) - it's a lot of really good food and you get to try an array of dishes that go very well together.

I have a love/hate relationship with this place. If I place the order for pick up or delivery sometimes the wait is much much longer then they say it will be.  I have been left waiting inside for up to 40 minutes and waited almost 2 and a half hours this last time we ordered for delivery. We actually cancelled that order and got a refund.  This would be the hate part of the relationship..Now the love part.. The food is pretty good. There are certain items I have ordered that I wouldn't and others I order each time. Like the "Fried Veggie Dumplings". You get 8 in an order and they are addictive. The Egg Rolls are bigger then I'm used to. I can get a 2 piece order of those and eat some dumplings and rice and be stuffed. I have always ordered online. I have only called when checking the status of my order.  The online ordering is very convenient and they have a area where you can out extra instructions. The "Orange Chicken" only comes in large size on the menu, but if you order it from the kids menu you can get the small portion. If you still want the larger portion then you might want to order the combination dinner meal with the Orange Chicken because then you will get a choice of Soup, Rice, an Egg Roll and a Crab Rangoon for $8.95 and the Orange Chicken alone is $8.55. Might as well get more for your meal for just 40 cents more.

Review Text :
After reading many reviews of this place, I decided to stop by here for lunch and try it for myself.  I was please to see how nice the decor of the restaurant was.  There are two dining room areas and bar seating.  The owner, Leticia, greeted me and asked me if I wanted a table or sit at the bar.  Since i was eating alone, I saddled up to the bar and ordered from the Bartender.  I decided on the Nachos and a Raspberry Iced Tea to wash it down.  While I was waiting for my order a server brought out complimentary Chips, Beans, and Salsa.  In Vegas, it's rare to get Beans with the comp Chips/Salsa....also, there were two Salsas.....a Chipotle based Salsa and an Avocado/Cilantro based Salsa.....it was excellent!A few minutes later my Nachos came out.  They were covered in Cheese and had two small portions of Sour Cream & Guacamole on top...certainly not enough for the entire dish.  The Nachos has a lot of potential....the Chips were fresh, all of the ingredients tasted very good....but the proportions were all messed up.  Too much Cheese, not enough Sour Cream/Guacamole/Pico de Gallo.....just the right amount of Beans & Jalapenos.  The Cheese was melted just right, but with some bites it overwhelmed the dish.  A lot of potential here...Overall, I enjoyed the meal and loved the friendly service and active owner who cares about her restaurant.Will I return?  I want to come back with my family and try a few more dishes.Don't ask me how I ended up at this restaurant located in one of those annoying fake-downtown retail/dining centers way the fuck out in B.F.E. Well OK, it's because my boyfriend lives out there. Otherwise, I would never have come here.We went during happy hour, and tried everything on their happy hour menu, all of which was shockingly affordable and shockingly delicious. The house margaritas were excellent, too. The chips and salsa were AMAZING.The atmo is sort of casual upper-middle-class-suburban Tex-Mex, and they have a patio for outdoor dining, where you can bask in the breeze created by all the SUVs blasting down one of those ginormously expansive asphalt rivers that pass for roads up there.Overall, it was excellent food at a great price, but I probably would not drive all the way up here to eat here. If they opened a location closer to midtown, then maybe.Feeling like GOOD Mexican food for dinner I had the idea of eating at Leticia's. We loved it so much the time we ate here before despite the ordeal we went through (see my previous review for details) that I knew it wouldn't be long before I had some of this yummy food in my tummy.I was so pleased with the "Happy Hour Menu". It runs Mon-Fri from 3-6 pm. You can get margaritas 50% off! They have other food items starting at $2.50. We tried the "Cheese Quesadilla" and "Chorizo Taco". Both were well worth the regular menu price but getting them and just a great discount is just a bonus! They had other things like nachos, toastadas etc.I tried the "Carnitas & Carne Asada Tacos" tonight and they were just so tasty. The rice that comes with it is good but the beans are the winner. The beans are thick and have great flavor.The "Fried Ice Cream" is very yummy!My experience as far as service and the food and restaurant are the same. Excellent.I wanted to update my review to let others know about the happy hour menu and the quality and consistency of Leticia's.I've been here several times and have never found "my dish" that I always come back for (until this night).  I come back for the ambiance and to keep trying to find that one dish that makes me crave coming back.  Saturday we brought some out of town friends here for dinner.  Looking for somewhere they haven't been before we thought this was the place that wouldn't disappoint.  We were greeted by the hostess as soon as we walked in.  There were people waiting but we were seated right away.  The waiter came to take our drink order.  He was very friendly and offered up some recommendations.  He brought out the complimentary chips and salsa.  There was two types salsa - one smokey (not good) and the other was a tomato based salsa and was very tasty.  It also came with a warm bean dip which because a favorite of the table.  The chips were an "eh".  Nothing special and not even sure if they were freshly made but with the salsa/bean dip you didn't really notice.  We did order some of the freshly made guacamole.  It was pretty bland and was in need of salt, but I would rather put my own salt on guacamole anyway.The BF and I both ordered the street tacos.  The waiter said they were what he usually ordered and so we thought we were good to go.  I ordered ground beef, chicken and carne asada on flour tortillas.  They were so good and I think I found my craving for this place.  It really was so much food though.  I only ate two and picked at the 3rd one.  It came with rice and beans and I only had a couple bites of rice.  I do love the rice here...its a no nonsense rice-tomato sauce and diced onion is my guess.  The BF and I also split a Mexican style corn on the cob (they cut it in half) that came topped with a white creamy cheese sauce and seasonings on top.  The corn itself had little cornels so it was just blah to me.  I might have to try this corn again because I'm not quite sure how I felt about it.  It was much different than I've had before.The middle of our meal the owner stopped by our table to make sure everything was going good. I think he has done that every time we have been here.  I always appreciate an owner or even the manager that can take time to acknowledge their customers.  A simple effort but not many do it.As our dinner started to wind down the karaoke crew started funneling in.  I had forgotten that they do karaoke on the weekends.  So we extended our drinks and our stay to watch some people strut their stuff.  I believe the starting time was 9pm.  Pretty smart to bring in a new crowd just as the dinner crowd is thinning out.  I hope it brings in some added business for them.  Really fun to kick back, catch up with friends with some good live music in the back ground.  Overall, the service is very personable and caring, the food is a delight, the ambiance is cozy and after 9pm on the weekends live karaoke lovin.  Score!I hate doing this, but I feel it needs to be said. Firstly, I love Leticia's. By love, I mean we eat here a lot. By a lot, I mean we frequent this place at least once a month. That's a lot for me. The reason for this update is the service. We sit at the bar because we like to play for free drinks. And it's usually just my boyfriend and I. Otherwise, we'll sit at a table. And I have almost always had a bad experience when we're seated. The waiters/waitresses seem so rushed, so annoyed and just generally pretty rude. I hate being biased and I have been for way too long. They are seriously lacking on how to treat clients. They rarely check on you, take forever to get you food or drinks. If I'm here with a smaller or larger party,  it's made no difference. Each time, we have been waiting too long or just had a server that doesn't seem too keen about helping us. The bartenders are awesome. They have a few new ones that have been excellent. The food each time has come out perfectly and delicious as always. The main reason we come to this place. Now, I hate referring people here. Each time, they say the same thing. They loved the food but hated the service. So, I give you 3 stars - for the servers, please...do not ruin such a great place. For the food, drinks and bartenders - I give you 5 stars.My Mexican friends don't like this place. They said it's not the food/flavor they grew up knowing. I find the food here real salty. The times I've been here, there's more gringos and gringas than Mexicans.I do love their chips, tomatillo, chipotle and bean dips for sure. I can eat 2 baskets of their chips. 5/5I've tried their signature dish: Quesa Taco. Loaded with cheese, very flavorful and very salty. I asked for no tomatoes since I'm allergic, they gave me tomatoes anyway. I scraped the tomatoes off but I guess not all since my lips were puffier than their puffy tacos. 3/5Puffy Tacos:Fried flour tacos. Greasy. Rice was salty. 3/5I love horchata. They don't have free re-fills though.The wait can be ridiculous even with a reservation. There are parts of the room that is dark and warm (to the left of the hostess' booth) and bright and freezing (to the right). Bring a scarf/jacket just in case.

Review Text :
I'm shocked, SHOCKED at the reviews for this place.  Puzzle this out with me: + Take the top-rated burrito in Phoenix (Rito's "downtown" location has 4.5 stars, primarily on the strength of their legendary green chile burritos).+ Keep the same menu (with food so good that it makes Carolina's look like Taco Bell).+ Remove it from a tiny house in a less-than-savory South Phoenix location.+ Add hours (including Saturday hours!)+ Add indoor seating.+ Put it into a more accessible location with less wait time.Aaaaaaand... you get negative reviews!  What gives?Bizarrely, the criticisms are on its ambiance!   This is incredibly ironic.  Nobody slammed the old Rito's for ambiance because there was NOWHERE TO SIT AND EAT.  It was a crowded little house with an aging air conditioner that worked overtime to try to keep the temps under 90 as everyone stood and waited.  Okay, there were outdoor tables and chairs, but in the Phoenix summer, that's not really an option.  So now that the new location stuck a few chairs and tables indoors where you can sit in air-conditioned comfort while you wait, suddenly everyone's expecting a five-star restaurant environment!  What do you want them to do?  Start hanging the type of tacky decor most Mexican restaurants have around here - red and green sombreros, anyone?Let's get this straight.  Rito's is NOT a sit-down-and-eat restaurant.  It is TAKEOUT.  You order, you pay with cash, you step aside, and you wait.  You pick up your food, go to somewhere more convenient, cut into the best wet burrito you've ever tasted, and go to food heaven.  (It's probably good to go someplace where you have a little privacy, because some people in our society still aren't comfortable with seeing a stranger weeping over the perfect burrito.)The funniest part is that I think the new Rito's is designed to FORCE you to go somewhere else and eat your amazing burrito.  The place is so popular, they want the chairs open for people waiting for their orders, not people slowly burning their lunch break.  I noticed when I was there that they had purchased and mounted a glossy, pre-printed sign that said the restrooms were under repair.  Think about that for a minute.I'll close with this.  My wife is an ambiance junkie.  She loves ambiance.  A beautiful restaurant could serve her a hot pocket and she would be content.  But Rito's is so darn good that she doesn't even care about the ambiance.  We grab the burritos, head back to work, and by the time we're two bites in, we're already planning our next trip.It's that good.  Go get a green chile burrito enchilada style, eat it, and once the food epiphany has worn off, come back here and let's give this place the rating it so richly deserves.  Five stars.P.S.  Always, always, always call to see if they are open before going.  Their hours and days can be a bit irregular (for example, they are now closed on Saturdays during the school year), and occasionally they'll just be randomly closed.  There's no heartbreak quite like showing up at Rito's and then having to settle for some other type of food instead.

Review Text :
I received a restaurant.com gift certificate for Fresh Wasabi for Christmas and finally decided to use it tonight. Yes I know Christmas was 5 months ago.We brought another couple with us and I told them we needed to spend $100 to get the $50 per what the certificate had said. Other than that no restrictions. So we ordered ALOT of sushi rolls, edamame, gyoza and teriyaki chicken. The food was really good. We stuffed out faces and then we got our bill. We gave our waitress the certificate and debit cards. She then tells us that we cannot use that gift certificate even though there is NO expiration date and states the restaurant is responsible for the discount. We then try to use our Yelp check-in for the free appetizer. She tells us that's not for their location even when we show her where the address is on the deal.After all said and done we payed our full bill and left. We never would have ordered so much food if we knew they were going to refuse the gift certificate. The customer service was awful and unfortunately that is swaying my opinion of them. I will more than likely never go back because I'm pretty angry over my experience.

My new favorite "go to" restaurant in the area! Love the food, love the service, love the atmosphere. I have been here a few times already and have left happy and full every time.This location use to be the old El Jefe's restaurant but newly converted to Sabor. I always describe it as a Mexican infusion - Chilis pricing for Carabas quality. I am suprised this place is not busier than it is. It is never packed when we are there.I LOVE the queso dip. AMAZING! I seriously lick the bowl. It is so delicious. Their bread plate is so awesome as well filled with breads, tortillas ext. YUMLICIOUS!My favorite dinner so far is the scallops. OMG - so perfectly cooked and every bite delicious. We finished with the banana foster icecream rum dish....it is so good. I have such a hard time sharing it. Next time...I am getting my own..LOL.So, if you think you can't make it down to Sabor.....I disagree...You Mexi-CAN! Go now and thank me later!

I was certain I reviewed Freddy's already's but when I looked it wasn't there.Freddy's has good fast food burgers, thin patties cooked hot and fast so that they carmelize slightly.Pencil fries with cheese sauce are tasty, although the amount of cheese sauce varies wildly depending on where the moon is in relation to mercury and the various astrology signs.  This issue may have resolved itself with the advent of the new astrology sign.  As a matter of fact, this may have been the underlying cause for the creation of the astrology sign in the first place.I don't pretend to understand the greater workings of this mysterious universe which revolves around me. I do know that things are more in harmony when I have the desired amount of cheese sauce on my fries.

I've been curious about The Liberty for some time now, and I finally made it in to try some tasty lunch!I went into this meal with no expectations - I just wanted to give it a try. Hubs and I grabbed a seat on the patio, which was just lovely for half of the time, the other half I was covering my ears due to the fire engines leaving the station across the street. No matter though - that's not Liberty's fault!Liberty is pretty neat inside - a great bar area with plenty of high tops and a main dining room with lots of low, amber-colored lighting and a big kitchen in the rear. I also meandered downstairs where there is a really cool private dining area. Super sweet. Anywho, back to my experience. Our server was really sweet and efficient, especially considering we were the only people eating on the patio. I ordered the chicken & dumplings and was quite happy with the bird - crispy skin, plump bird and a small smattering of carrots, mushrooms and a few greens. While I was expecting large dumpling (considering the dumplings part in the description) it came with seven or eight ricotta gnocchi. Now, I love me a gnocchi, and these were indeed delicious, it just wasn't what I was expecting. The star of the meal though was my husband's mac 'n cheese - I totally took over that little skillet. It's the baked mac with more cheesy goodness than I ever though possible. Delicious, creamy and topped with a light coating of breadcrumbs. I don't know what types of magical cheese were in this tasty skillet, but I couldn't help myself. Overall, a really solid dining experience at The Liberty. I look forward to coming back, especially since it's in my 'hood!For our wedding anniversary dinner, The Liberty was a big hit. Starting off with the fact that I booked us on OpenTable and seeing the couple in front of us without a reservation get sent to the bar area!Great service from our waitress who did try to get us to bite on the drink and dinner specials, but we saw from the menu what we wanted and placed our order.My lovely wife had the brook trout with Carolina peach chutney and said it was fantastic. Great tasting fish, sweet chutney and creamy mashed potatoes. It's rare that she clears the plate but she did this time.I went for the crunch burger and it arrived as ordered, medium rare. Very juicy but a huge stack with pimiento cheese, LTO, bacon and crunchy kettle chips on the burger. I had to slightly disassemble it in order to eat this messy delight. Very nice flavor, very well done. Yum.No dessert tonight.Parking is a challenge on a busy night, but there are spaces in the lot next to the light rail and there's a valet stand that might share with Tupelo Honey. Or just take the light rail!Love the "donate" line on the check. It says that it's a donation to PlateShare.org.

Solid 3.5This place is brand new. it is a market and a great place for lunch.My review is for lunch only.Gyro $5.99Fry's and drink $2.50Total $9.22The place is clean and has plenty of help. Everyone is extremely nice and helpful.The food was average, the pita was warm and the gyro meat was good. It is cooked on a spit. The tzatziki sauce was thin and not too flavorful. I have had better.Fries were a thicker type and had a little seasoning on them. They give enough for two to share.The salads looked good as did the "plate" types of meals .I will go back but may skip the fries and drink.Well over due for an update. The owners 5 StarsThe market 5 starsThe food darn near 5 starsI had the burger the other day..way impressed. It was double thin patties with hummus and cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion if you wish. It wasgood and filling. Today I had the Gyro with salad and a drink.Excelent Falafel - check Great hummus - checkAwesome spanakopita - check**Warning** Beware that veggie doesn't always mean good for you.While I normally try to skip the cabs, I just couldn't stop stuffing myself with those perfect triangles of warm pita covered with their garlic pepper hummus; it was just the right amount of spice with a more than right amount of awesome!I don't eat falafel too often, but this was definitely the most interesting and tasty falafel I have had. Cover it with whatever that creamy sauce was and you're in vegan junk food heaven!If you're wondering how the spanakopita (spinach pie) was, you just can't go wrong with this option. I was plesantly surprised when the spinach didn't taste like you're average cafeteria bitter blah, whatever-ness like I was half expecting. They perfectly topped the spinach with fresh feta - which was some of the better feta I've had in a while. Covered with flaky layers of filo dough and baked til perfection --- mmm its so good.Olive Tree is super authentic with my only regret being that I didn't try the Gyro, I have a personal goal to find the valley's best gyro and have had one at close to 10 - 14 places thus far. For some reason, on my only visit here I was just feeling vegetarian, go figure. :/I don't imagine I will be back too soon, since I hail from CenPho and this place is like 15 miles away, but it will definitely be a destination if I'm within a few miles around mealtime!Quoted in weekly Yelp newsletter 7-25-2012: http://www.yelp.com/weekly?editorial_id=0YYMd5auwMs-83hardCBZA

Restaurant name  Pollo Royal Restaurant
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Pollo Royal is a lunch favorite of mine. You may order at the counter or take a seat. They primarily specialize in chicken, but have other latin foods. As with many Latin countries, the food seems regional. I believe it's Central American. Ordering here might be difficult, because gal up front doesn't speak english too well. But if you really need to, the owner speaks english fluently and he is also very helpful. Many menu items are in spanish, but most are accompanied with a picture. =)Pollo royal specializes in chicken. They offer fried chicken (unbattered) and rotisserie/grilled chicken. This isn't your traditional American fried chicken. It has a lemony flavor and isn't fried to a crisp.  Both are quite solid though. Being a south of Mexico Latin restaurant, lunches are accompanied with plantains and/or fries or fritas as they call it. One of my fav dishes here is the crispy chicken tacos. Back home we would call them rolled tacos, but the proper name would be flautas I believe. Pollo Royal does them differently, but not in a bad way. They are topped with a cabbage salad, that I might say is pretty tasty for just being cabbage and some type of red salsa. The absolute best thing about this restaurant for me is their chicken soup. Although it is latin, it reminds me of home and of my mom's cooking. Comfort food is subjective and that soup for me is comfort food. It is slightly sour and with the lemon provided you can control the level. Nothing fancy about it. Its just your basic homemade chicken soup made with veggies and cilantro - just like my mom used to make. It  comes with rice on the side also. Mind you, it might not be for everyone. Ethnic chicken soup has a different taste. For me personally though, it is a familiar taste that warms my soul.

Gee whiz, how do I find the time?  Actually, this time I'd like to focus on their prepared food items/pizza/salad bar/gelato.I have tried the pepperoni roll-ups, swedish meatballs, and some other easy prep items from Mrs. G's prepared food area.  None of which was worth trying again.  I'm sadden to say this, really I am.  None of the items had any zip, taste, or verve.  The fiancee and I recently purchased one of their 'new' pizzas.  It's not a NY style, not a deep dish, not a thin/crispy crust.  It's somewhere between a NY and a hmm.... no words to describe it.  The pizza chef/manager told us Glazier's recently (within the last 4 months) changed their pizza recipe.  I wonder why?  Was it not selling, too many complaints, or too many whiny commentors?  So, the new version we brought home was okay and definitely worth forgetting about.  The sauce on the pizza really was quite upsetting.  I personally don't enjoy munching on tomatoes; the pizza had huge chunks of them in their sauce!Ahh the good ole salad bar.   How I love thee.  So fresh, so clean, so good.  My fingers want to keep piling vegetables in my to-go container when I'm around thee.  But at $6.88 per lb. I must  exercise restraint, for I have already created a 2 lb. + monster from your bed of greens.  Remembering when Glazier's first opened, they had fresh dipped ice cream available by the scoop.  Ice cream is good but, I have to be in the mood for it.  However, recently there's been a change in the freezer to GELATO!  This stuff, gelato, yummy goodness, I'm always in the mood for!  COOKIES AND CREAM and MINT CHOCOLATE CHIP are my weaknesses.  Glazier's carries both!  WHY, damn it!  However, at $3.79 for 3 scoops I cannot cower at the price, I'd be willing to pay double or perhaps triple (and have paid 5x the amount for the same thing at the Forum Shops @ Caesar's).Though Glazier's needs some work on the Mrs. G's prepared foods and pizza, they're doing a mighty fine job on their salad bar!  And whomever decided to replace the ice cream with authentic Italian  gelato, I'm coming over to give you a big kiss (j/k).I used to love shopping at Glazier's. USED to love it. Today I went in for my usual Monday morning grocery run. Since I have a new iPhone I wanted to take a photo to post with my Yelp review. So I'm over by the bakery section and this employee comes out and just starts yelling at me "You can't take pictures in here! That is AGAINST COMPANY POLICY!" And on and on and on. I mean, what kind of store doesn't allow photography of any kind? Makes me wonder what the hell they are trying to hide! So after this incident I asked where the stated policy was that said "no photos." No signs posted anywhere. But when I started looking around the store, I noticed more and more customer un-friendly signs. "All backpacks and bags must be checked." "We can refuse service to anyone." "All bakery boxes will be opened and checked." And top it off, the store has these hulky looking security guards that wander the store and will follow you around! Glazier's makes me feel like a thief! I've concluded that you should only shop here if you want to be made to feel like a second class citizen or shoplifter. Seriously!I'm really sad about this because it is such a nice store. Great produce and while it's too expensive for everyday grocery shopping, the wide aisles and wide assortment make it fun to look around. Of course, one dissatisfied customer is worse than having 100 happy customers because, believe me, I am going to share this story with everyone I know. I don't think Glazier's wants to upset the upper middle class community so they might want to rethink the unfriendliness of the store. Instead of shopping at Glazier's, it's going to be Whole Foods only for me.Things I miss about the greater Phoenix area:1. AJ's2. Sprouts3. Smashboxx4. A select group of friends.5. That's it.Today, after reading countless mailers for Glazier's, I finally decided to make the drive to this LOCAL grocery store. It's like Sprouts and AJ's all rolled into one.Thank God, because the first two on this list were something I grew to love while in Phoenix/Scottsdale.For those that don't know...AJ's is a local high end chain in the Phoenix area (think Whole Foods but smaller and for the nose up crowd like myself)...and Sprouts is similar to Trader Joe's but the stores are much larger.Ok, back to Glazier's.As soon as you stroll in, you are greeted to a very pristine sales floor. Everything looks immaculate! The produce section is perfect, the prices are competitive, and the selection is great! The hot deli section has everything from knishes, to pizzas, crab cakes, and even Cincy-style chili. Boom.The meat section...to die for. Everything else is laid out just like any other grocery store, but the rest is still just as clean, and perfect as the entrance.I am so glad this store is close to my house. There is a location in Henderson if you live out there.If you read the various rags around town, you'll notice that Glazier's consistently wins "Best Grocery Store" in Las Vegas. There is a reason. This place is the ish.I can't wait to come back!When I found this store almost 3 years ago, this grocery store would have gotten well over 5 stars. in 2010, this WAS the grocery store of Las Vegas to check out due to the friendliness and quality items. The store is HUGE!The chicken breasts are still the cheapest in town, the ground beef seems to be of good quality (no pink slime detected), and the produce seems to have good deals if you search through enough. Aisles and bathroom are always clean. The New York and Chicago products are well stocked.In 2011, I even spent over $1000.00 in one shopping trip to pay for the high quality food at my own wedding. Glazier's used to be that great of a store.Over the years, Glazier's has become the MOST EXPENSIVE grocery store in Vegas. I have personally shopped at Glazier's, and went to Whole Foods to find an ORGANIC version cheaper than what Glazier's offers at non-organic.Prices are not the only thing that has changed. When walking in, a bouncer at the Dance Club-type greets you at the door. Immediately, you are to feel as though you are being watched. London Broil was on sale for $2.98/lb. I wanted it cut in half - so they charged me last week's price ($5.99/lb!) I did not even notice it until I got to the register, where I found it is "new store policy" if you make the butcher do anything other than hand you a piece of meat. Hope it worked out for them, since at the register I gave it back.One other no-no here... I wanted to bag my own groceries.I worked in a grocery store as a kid. I am well trained to keep perishables together, produce together, etc.  I've been bagging groceries for almost 25 years! I'm told by the cashier it is "a safety hazard" if I bag my own groceries. This is a new one to me. Never in my life I have been told I could hurt myself from bagging my own groceries. If it was a "safety hazard", would Fresh & Easy be out of business by now? Surely the Health Dept would have shut down Winco and Food 4 Less as well. I don't see people in these grocery stores on the ground, writhing in pain from bagging their own food. One other tidbit I noticed... sometimes I shop at 10pm. The donuts used to be 25¢ each after 7pm. Not anymore. Five minutes before closing you pay the same as if they were just made. There is no law that says they have to mark it down... but just saying... one less reason I go there. Naturally, since I did not get to bag my own groceries, I get home to find 3 items in the same bag... a cucumber, chicken breast, and dish soap. This was a good store. I drove 10 miles each way to visit. However, "Mr G" has over-extended himself with petty policies and procedures. He has squeezed people like ourselves from shopping there on a regular basis. Instead of Glazier's I would recommend Sunflower market (soon to be Sprouts). Glazier's, I will still shop with you 2 to 3 times a year when I get cravings for New York stuff. Otherwise, I have found other places to go.How about that?!? After the cashier assured me that my debit card WOULD NOT BE charged twice, I find that it did in fact get charged twice (posted to my account the next day). I know registers "time out." I've been there, done that. I work in retail and it has happened so I know for a fact THAT IT WILL CHARGE THAT PERSON TWICE. She didn't offer to call and supervisor or manager, but against my better judgment, I left. I filed a dispute with my bank and hopefully my money will be returned to me in a timely manner. Glazier's management: Ensure that your cashiers are properly trained to handle all types of situations - and if they cannot, give them the tools necessary to ensure that customer satisfaction is their top priority. I chose not to call your establishment because I felt that if you didn't care if I shopped in your store, then you wouldn't care if you gave me back my $60. To some $60 is chump change - but I work hard for my money and $60 is what I could use for gas money and food for my family.Pretty torn about Glazier's. When you walk in there is a ton of freshly prepared food waiting for you. Pick up a nice deli sammie, a huge pizza to-go, a meal to heat up later or a cafe latte. 5-stars!... But then you hit the weak produce section, the tiny lil' 'healthy' section and you come back down to reality... Glazier's is just a normal-ish market. Given, you'll find some gems along the way (I snagged a random knish from Chicago that was so damn good), but for the most part it was a let down for me. Take into account I can only judge on the crap that I typically buy, so this could be your favorite store. For me, it's just A-OK. Somewhere above a Von's but way below a WF or TJ's.DO NOT EAT AT THE FOOD COURT. I used to work there and got fired for complaining so much about the fact that there were many COCKROACHES by the sinks. On the side wall I found about 6 cockroaches that were all the same sizes in the same area so I know there were eggs there too. My coworker was eating a stromoli and put it in the back and I walked back there for a towel and found 3 fully grown cockroaches on it. I found two baby ones on my sandwich station and when I told my supervisor, he told the manager in front of me then said, "k now that I told him about a problem he knows about and that we can't fix can you go back to work?" Sad part is the manager knows but decides to not do anything about it. Plus the owner's a dick and threatened to fire me when I first started because there was a water spot on the glass. And the owners a cheap asshole who only cares about himself and he doesn't deserve a cent of what he's making.Absolutely terrible business practices!!!I was checking my email after work and saw the new weekly specials for Glaziers - awesome! Scrolled through and saw their deal for Norbest turkey that was going for $0.57/lb if you spent $25, valid through 12/02. So off I went, in the lovely Vegas rain, to stock up on a ham and turkey for Christmas.Turns out when I get there that the deal expired on 11/27, although it said in BLACK AND WHITE in TODAY'S email that it was good through 12/2. The cashier checks with the manager, who then claims to call THE OWNER who says he is not honoring it. Seriously?! It's on your WEBSITE, the printed circular I have in my hand, and in your email. Buddy, I hate to tell you but you're doing a fantastic job of practicing false advertising. My husband and I have been loyal supporters of your store since you opened but your questionable business practices and apparent disregard for your customer's time and, believe it or not, ability to read, means we won't be back. Vons is less than 60 seconds from you and at least they honor their word!PS. Your "Thousands of Prices reduced" tagline in this week's ad? Maybe you should reduce it to the price you're advertising.I go back and forth between Glazier's and Vons. The employees here are always very helpful and friendly. I mostly come here to buy meats because there's a significant price difference in that department. I also come here to buy Blue Bell moo bars, I can't get enough of them and they're the only store in the neighborhood that carries them. They have a good selection of items but they have a small produce section, sometimes they have good deals but I still prefer to get my produce across the street, it's about the same price and I get too lazy to drive across to Glazier's, ha! Food court, the pizza is amazing, the slices are huge and the pizza itself is thin and crispy. They also have a bakery and deli which is nice but I've never actually purchased anything from there, Glazier's can be a bit overpriced but sometimes they have really good specials.Have you ever eaten frog legs? Yeah, well... that's not for me! But, I have to admit this store has grown on me. I really love the cultural influence in this store.I still believe the store is mostly overpriced. So when I shop, I stick to the outside perimeter of the store. I hit the fresh fruits, fresh salad bar, deli department, meat department, and dairy department. I pretty much skip the isles. They have the most amazing deli. Honestly, I go every Sunday now just to get their egg salad, cranberry chicken salad, and California tuna salad. It goes great with their fresh Hawaiian loaf of bread. I make these for lunches during the week! The other part of the deli has a great selection of deli meats. I like that I can place my order from a kiosk, then shop while it is being prepared to my thickness specifications on eat meat. They even text me when my order is ready. No more waiting at the deli counter for my lunch meats! When you have so little time, these things make a huge difference.The meat department always has cool items, like stuffed crabmeat in crab shells and stuffed clams in clamshells. The last time I was there they had fresh frog legs. Really... who eats that? I like that there is something for everyone though. If only they could just lower their prices on standard items like ketchup and cereal, I would not have to go to another store for the rest of my groceries.Items Selected:Pancakes with StrawberriesApple FritterStrawberry FritterPineapple FritterBlueberry FritterLemon Sprinkles BarMocha BeanDouble Chocolate MousseMounds BarKey Lime PieBlueberry Coconut CreamRed Velvet CakeHaving thought to have exhausted The Valley's list of Doughnut shops over the past two years it was on the recommendation of a friend that Glazier's Food Marketplace was identified as another source of novel fried dough, and recalling that Donut Mania's owner had once suggested he originally helped establish the grocery store's program it was just after 7:00am on Saturday that a stop was made, the cabinets well stocked with most options still warm.Advertising a whole new lineup, including four types of fritters to go along with the store's recently launched weekend brunch, it was admittedly with some surprise that Glazier's collection tallied more than two-dozen variations and ranging from cake to yeast and filled to frosted the 89-to-99 cent prices are a far cry from many other artisan purveyors, the results ranging from downright excellent to subpar grocery store stuff.Holding off a moment before exploring the donuts, a total of eleven selected largely as a result of space  per cardboard box, one could not help but wonder how The 702s "Best" Supermarket would fare in terms of made-to-order options, and taking the easy way out by offering fake syrup and a cold pat of butter alongside pancakes so dry they literally crumbled fork pressure the answer can simply be summed up as "horrible," an $8.57 waste of money with more than 3/4 deposited in the trash.Onward to better things, payment at an automated checkout fairly simple before returning to a table to indulge, opening bites of raised options spoke to a brioche base similar to that of Donut Mania and Pinkbox with just a bit more tooth, the blueberry coconut a bit artificial in its flavor while cream-filled rings of coffee as well as chocolate fared far better, the espresso infused glaze particularly robust.Unabashedly fond of fritters, a sentiment that many do not share, suffice it to say that those who cite oiliness as a reason for their displeasure need not fear as the ones at Glazier's are actually much 'lighter' than the average, yet although an attempt to raise the stakes with multiple flavors is indeed appreciated the substantial lack of whole fruit beneath a double-shellacking of sugary sweet glaze most certainly was not, the pineapple particularly affronting in its lack of flavor with the vast majority of each left in the box.Rounding out the morning with a cocoa-rich red velvet cake that made me wish for more classics including an old fashioned or buttermilk bar amidst the group, it was perhaps with good fortune that two bars and a tangy Key Lime Pie complete with graham cracker crumble were saved for last, the lemon filling beneath white frosting and rainbow sprinkles impressive in its tartness while the shredded coconut and cream amidst dark chocolate reminisced of a Mounds Bar in all the right ways, the sliced-and-filled presentation assuring a perfect ratio of each ingredient throughout.More modestly priced than other places offering novelty donuts, but at the same time not always executing on a level that shows the creativity to be matched by the quality of the staff, those planning to visit Glazier's for Donuts are encouraged to choose carefully while those looking for pancakes or fritters should steer clear and visit almost anywhere else."Don't you dare even think about squirting ketchup on that hot dog! It's a Chicago law!" "Yeah Dad, but we're in Las Vegas!" "OK, fine, spoil the hot dog and put more ketchup on your ketchup!"The above satire is typical between my son and I every time we eat hot dogs together. Well, that all changed after a visit last Sunday morning to Glazier's. I found Jay's potato chips, refrigerated celery salt, neon green relish, sport peppers, pickles, Vienna beef hot dogs and poppy seed buns too. Needless to say, we feasted on Chgo style hot dogs @ home in Las Vegas. Ketchup became an argument of the past.Also found my favorite dessert as a teenager, TastyKakes, located in the fridge section at the far right side of the store. They are shipped in frozen from Philly and brought back fond memories w/ each sweet bite.The deli counter is unlike anywhere i've purchased Boar's Head products....talk about hi-tech...felt like I fast forward my life into a Jetsons cartoon.  Glazier's deli shoppers can order from their iPhone app, at the counter kickin it old school w/ good ole fashioned face-to-face communication skills exchanging personable smiles, or enter your deli order into 1 of the 2 computer kiosks and receive a text when your order is ready for pickup. I very much appreciated this kiosk concept as a time saving option while I ventured off into the store in search of hard to find regional food products.TIP: Glazier's is open early and stays open late! TIP: If you can't find it, put down your macho ego and ask one of the friendly employees; chances are they have it and are willing to help shoppers find it.Yay! I'm a fan.See 9 photos below...YELP 300 CHALLENGE 2015: RECOUNTED ALL REVIEWS THIS IS #297.

This spot is going down as hit and miss. They hit on the HH drink prices which go until 7pm Monday - Friday, half priced drinks, all drinks, and their reverse happy hour many days offer buy one get one drinks. The food here is on the miss side of the coin. They have a full menu of burgers, fries, sandwiches, etc. but their tacos here are mostly the only food I've had. I think I've had a fried something or other at one point or another and likely an order of wings; but again the food isn't why I visit. This spot is fairly busy all the time, again, think drink prices; those cheap drinks really keep this place in business. They do have a Taco Tuesday special on tacos, but I think there *might* be better places out there for tacos. Drinks are not amazing, you won't find anything special or exceptional, but you can't mess up a beer or an alcohol with a diet coke mixer, well, you can, but it's pretty difficult. Take this spot for what it is, a hang out and grab a drink, I like the atmosphere though!Happy Yelping.

An entire grocery store (ok, it's more like a 7-11 in size) Gluten Free? Sweet!This place is great.. lots of products. They also sell alternative items such as dairy-free stuff. They have a lot of kits for everything from baking muffins to dinner stuff like Hamburger Helper-style kits.I HIGHLY recommend this place and hope they get the support they deserve. The staff is SUPER friendly, helpful, and engaging. GO HERE AND SPEND MONEY. :)

Review Text :
After seeing John H's "FTR," Anthony V brought me a copy of the 5th and Wine menu, and it was then that I knew, I had to make my way over to check this place out. So this past Friday, I met my friend Laura for lunch, and I was extremely pleased.  Service was friendly and attentive and the food was fresh, delicious, and priced just right!I went with the veggie salad.  Avocado, white beans, green beans, grape tomatoes, jicama, mozzarella, and just the right amount of herb vinaigrette.  I debated adding grilled shrimp, but i opted for a cup of butternut squash soup instead.  The soup was warm, but I would've preferred for it to be served a tad bit warmer.  It was tasty though and a nice accompaniment to the salad.  Laura went with the grilled cheese panini and french fries.  She seemed to enjoy it also.I cannot wait to go back to try the bruschetta - they've got some creative selections including "apples, brie, fig jam, honey and agave drizzle" and "prosciutto, figs, mascarpone cheese, and tomato jam."  YOu can choose 2 for $3.95, 4 for $6.95, 6 for $9.95 or 8 for $12.95.  Not bad and probably perfect for sharing!  I also noticed that 5th and Wine serves $5 wines by the glass daily until 6pm... you can't go wrong with that!12/17/09Saw that John Hill was holding a happy hour UYE and thought I'd check it out.  Haven't been back here since my first and only visit of what used to be Fine's Cellar.  I like what the new owners did with the place.  Unpretentious space.  I liked most of the dog art- I still can't appreciate dogs dressed in suits and playing poker, I'm sorry, but the psychedelic-prints are very handsome... I have one of a kitten at home, myself!HH apps menu is very reasonable here.  So reasonable, I spent about $50, with tip, on 3 glasses of wine ($5 each), 12 pcs. of bruschetta, fries ($3, I think), and chicken wings ($3 for 12)!  I'd skip on the ordinary chicken wings (which came w/ jicama slices and ranch dressing) next time, but the parmesan fries are d'lish!  I must warn you that if you lack even an ounce of willpower, DO NOT order the bruschetta!  Especially not the Apples and brie, nor the Fig and mascarpone.  Oh. My. God!I'm bumping up to five stars for 5th and Wine...Since my initial review, I've been back at least five times and I have yet to have a bad meal... I am addicted to the vegetable salad and the butternut squash soup, but I finally branched out and tried the bruschetta last night - PHENOMENAL!I highly recommend both the ones I tried: the apples, brie, fig jam, honey and agave drizzle, and the prosciutto, figs, mascarpone cheese, and tomato jam.To top off the attentive, friendly service, 5th and Wine now has live music in the courtyard on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays!Another place that was bumped up on the list thanks to Yelp in Bloom.  And this is probably one of my new favorite places.  $5 glasses of wine until 6 pm everyday, including weekends.  And not just "select" wines, almost all of them.  In fact, I had a nice glass of Sauvignon Blanc for $3 as an open bottle special. Yes, you read correctly.  $3!!! In Scottsdale!We sat on the patio which is behind the restaurant and nicely hidden from the street.  We started with bruschetta, and chose four to try.  I think my favorite was the apple, brie, and fig jam.  Perhaps my least favorite was the tomato, mozzarella, and basil, but only because it was too heavy for the bread and was difficult to eat.  They were all great.  We also shared a  prosciutto and brie panini which was really good.  They're not giant but enough to share if you're having appetizers.  And we were each given a salad with our panini portion.Our server was excellent, but we were given a dirty plate.  It was dirty on the underside so she probably would not have seen it.  Our wines were also mixed up.  When my lips puckered at the first drink, I knew I had the Riesling.  Luckily, I caught it before my husband drank my entire glass in one gulp.Overall, a fantastic find and I can't wait to go back.  Hell, why am I writing this review now.  It's before 6!Finally made it to 5th and Wine last night. Is it bad that I had 3 glasses of wine and a martini? If I wasn't hungover the next day does that mean I am an alcoholic or just a professional?  I don't care to know the answer, because that might keep me from coming back!Our waiter, Michael, whose name I remember because my mom only dates Michaels and he made a joke about her not looking like any of his ex-girlfriends, was fucking fabulous. Sorry, but sometimes I really like to use expletives to describe how great something was. I should probably give 5th and Wine 5 stars.  You know what?  I will.Live singer on Thursday nights- awesome.Me singing along and knowing every song because I'm good like that- even better.Waiter who aims to please- fantastic.Good wine- makes me happy.$40 a bottle- makes me happy I'm not paying.Bruschetta choices- perfect and so far, all delicious.   Reuniting my mom and a Michael from her past who still desperately loves her- what good daughters do.Hoping Mother's current boyfriend named Michael never reads this- priceless.OMG OMG OMG...This was some seriously good grub!  We had a party of 30 tonight on the patio and the staff was amazing.  They were helpful setting up the party and sosososo accommodating.  The chef actually called to apologize that they couldn't make something.We ordered several kinds of Bruchetta...the Apple and Brie with Fig Jam was KILLER, the traditional tomato and basil one was so tasty it was like it was just out of the garden, there was a steak with horseradish sauce that was out of this world.  We also had calamari fried, wings and hummus which were all top notch.  Where they get their bread...I need to know!There were so many excellent wines to choose from, the water was even good as well and was served in a quaint old fashioned milk bottle.On the patio there was a musician who played a guitar and sang who is worth going back for alone!The place is well appointed has cool art, comfy seating  and nice bathrooms too...I can not say enough...you must go to 5th and Wine!After experiencing a whole new light to 5th and Wine, I figured it was time for an update. I ate here during Yelp Eats Week. I wanted to try out the special menu items, but some of them were a little out of my comfort zone for 5th and Wine. Typically, when I visit this adorable wine bar, I opt for a salad, a panini or bruschetta. It's just the tri-fecta I think of when I go to any wine bar. But during Yelp Eats, some other items were featured on their menu, including the Agave Salmon and pesto chicken pasta. This review will talk about the new items I tasted during my last visit. The Agave Salmon was a surprising treat! Sometimes I get bored with Salmon. It's not the menu item I dream of, but it's the one I order a lot of times when I'm watching my waistline. I decided to order the Agave Salmon from 5th and Wine. I expected your typical salmon, which it was, but then they threw me a curve ball with the Agave marinade. It was a candy-like glaze that was perfectly paired with the Salmon. I could drink a glass of this Agave marinade it was so delicious. I also tried the Pesto Chicken Pasta. It was indeed decadent and carbtastic. I wouldn't probably order it as my main dish, but it's a great dish to order for the table to everyone can have a little bite. Or if you're really in the mood for a carbo-load, order it just for you! Some other items I tried were the Parmesan french fries, prosciutto wrapped breadsticks and the hummus. All three were delicious and right up my alley. I was pleasantly surprised with the prosciutto wrapped breadstickts because typically breadsticks bore me. But when they wrapped them in my salty friend, prosciutto, it added the perfect twist to the typically boring stick. After my dinner visit to 5th and Wine, I will definitely remember to switch up my meals here and not just order the typical wine bar food from the menu.Laid back yet trendy dining spot in Old Town Scottsdale, I'm glad tried it out.  We came in on a Friday night at 8:00 and we were able to get a table right away.  We sat on the patio where they had a guy on the keyboard going to town with some jazz music, very nice ambiance.  I ordered their signature bloody Mary and it hit the spot, easy on the tomato juice, just like I like 'em.  For apps we had the tomato and basil bruschetta, the bread wasn't that great.  The menu had a nice selection of seafood, pasta and a nice steak but I settled on a burger which was cooked to perfection, very delicious.  I could only take a few bites and packed the rest to go, super huge burger.The server was quick to bring out the drinks and food but she disappeared after that.  While we were eating our meal some random guy came up to our table and sat down.  We were both too polite to tell him to leave because he meant no harm and was obviously drunk; he just sat there talking to us while we ate... awkwarrrrd.  We kept trying to flag down the server to get our tab so we could bounce out but she never looked our direction when she was visiting the other tables.  We left as quickly as possible.What a fantastic neighborhood restaurant. The type of place that makes me want to move to old town.  And such a great Saturday night crowd! A perfect demographic mashup that felt more like Santa Barbara than Arizona.  For dinner I ordered the panini with prosciutto and caramelized onions. It was very tasty but arrived at our table a little too cold. My butternut squash soup on the other hand was piping hot and excellent. Just right for a chilly January evening. Unfortunately I was a little under the weather on this particular evening so I couldn't drink any of the wine but I am feeling better now and look forward to returning and getting a nice red wine buzz started.Love this spot. Parking never seems to be a problem in this part of Old Town. Walking in, we were greeted warmly by the hostess.  My girlfriend and I chose to sit in the lovely outdoor patio to enjoy the perfect weather that night. Our server was very helpful and recommended some pretty fabulous red wine. My girlfriend who brought me here used to work there so she recommended the bruschetta as an appetizer followed by the  amazing 5th and Wine burger and ending with the cheesecake. Umm... Yes total foodgasm! I need a cigarette. But seriously, I loved my burger, the fries, the salad - everything we had was delicious. Best believe I'll be back very soon!Tip- $5 glasses of wine during HHI came here for the first time last night with a girlfriend for appetizers, and was really pleased with my experience. Unforunately, we missed happy hour by only a few minutes, but we had a blast anyways!For starters, I really loved the decor of the place.  Red chairs, tables of all sizes, with such a great atmosphere.  There's room to spread out some, so its not like your sitting on top of one another.  Menu selection and prices were great, and the place was jam packed!My friend and I went with the shrimp appetizer and split it.  Order came out quickly, and the dish was so cute looking! Served with crackers, some sauce and some other stuff, we dug in immediately.  The shrimp was spicy! But in a good way...we both were surprised, but whatever it was marinated in had a nice kick to it.Overall, I had a really great experience here. So you ask, why not 5 stars? Well, here's why.  First, parking here can be a bit tight. The later you go, the more difficult it will be to get parking. This is a very popular part of town, with lots of other locations around 5th and wine to hang out at.  There is a parking structure, but plan on doing a little walking in case you go for a late dinner.  (Really its not that bad, but if your in heels or the weather is poor, come prepared!)  Secondly, the happy hour ended at 6. UM, most people work and can't get there that early!  my schedule allows me to get their earlier, but would be nice if they extended it until 7, especially on a Friday.  Thirdly, our server was fine, but overall she didn't seem to take much interest in spending time at our table.  She would literally continue walking and ask if everything was okay without hardly stopping. Yes, I know its a busy Friday night, but she seemed like she just wasn't interested.Anyways, place is great, I love it here, and I will probably be back for more in the future!Wine bars... What's NOT to love! Especially this one! I came here with some friends the other night and I already love wine bars so I love trying new ones. I loved everything about this place. From the food, to the wine, to the environment...I ordered the Chicken Pesto Pasta. This entree was delicious! I like it when they don't skimp on the sauce because I feel that it makes it taste dry. The pesto sauce was really yummy. I'm a pretty light eater and usually always have leftovers to take home, but I devoured it! My friend ordered the Portobello burger that I tried. Quite tasty as well and I like the combination fries and dipping sauce that it came with. I also ordered the Red Sangria which was quite yummy. It wasn't too sweet like most Sangrias that I've had. Our server was very friendly and knowledgeable as to his recommendations to what was good on the menu. I loved the lounge area that they have set up as well. You can stay and hang out after you eat. It actually reminded me of the Living Room wine bar in Chandler that I absolutely love. Another great thing is that it's in Old town Scottsdale so it's not that far from me. They have a happy hour menu as well that I'd really like to come back and try and will probably do an updated review on that as well! If you like wine bars with great food this is definitely the place to go! =)So, I can thank Groupon for finally coming to this place.  I've heard so much about it, but waited for 3 yrs after moving here before I finally gave this a try.  The experience and food was great.  Over several visits, we ordered:Wings Korean BBQ http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5th-and-wine-scottsdale?select=pTbXHxZ8CicgWm7jBdWvlA#pTbXHxZ8CicgWm7jBdWvlALamb Burger w/Pork Bellyhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5th-and-wine-scottsdale?select=92bjst7gE-8qXpkb95HEvw#92bjst7gE-8qXpkb95HEvwhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5th-and-wine-scottsdale?select=9dyAgYrFMaWu8tpXcdtMAg#9dyAgYrFMaWu8tpXcdtMAgFrieshttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5th-and-wine-scottsdale?select=-S_-WGJYnRVH7vQATf2SpQ#-S_-WGJYnRVH7vQATf2SpQBison Burgerhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5th-and-wine-scottsdale?select=-fWYw7JinySzB4reU21JGQ#-fWYw7JinySzB4reU21JGQ5th & Wine Burger w/White Cheddarhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5th-and-wine-scottsdale?select=gN4OONYG9QxzVITRaTpfRg#gN4OONYG9QxzVITRaTpfRgPortobello Burgerhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5th-and-wine-scottsdale?select=lQkcHDKn3MCqNf8CA8r1cw#lQkcHDKn3MCqNf8CA8r1cwPomodoro Pasta w/Meatballshttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5th-and-wine-scottsdale?select=G3Jc9YQUM7xx4NN1szZ6FA#G3Jc9YQUM7xx4NN1szZ6FAStuffed Mushroomshttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5th-and-wine-scottsdale?select=yMUE2PBzrW6l5tBWbrxoNg#yMUE2PBzrW6l5tBWbrxoNgMy favorite out of all of the items was the Bison Burger and the Pomodoro Pasta w/Meatballs....very very good!The servers here were good, except for 1 visit where she was a bit inattentive....that could be due to the fact she had our table, which was inside, and other tables out on the patio....out of sight, out of mind is what they say.During each visit, I noticed that there was always a large table full of women and tables with women only with gifts, etc.....this must be a bachelorette/birthday/GNO hub of sorts...who knows, those tables are always loud which is why I noticed them every visit.Overall, this place is pretty cool.Return Factor - 90%

Review Text :
11/03/10A close coworker and good friend recommended I try Donna's Bakery many, many months ago (maybe even a year ago, whenever it was that it first opened-- the owners are close family friends of hers).  This visit was a spur-of-the-moment decision-- a rare thing for me as I like to do some legwork first before I try a new place.  I even texted my friend for directions and DB's phone number so I could inquire if they were still even open for business that evening!The young clerk I met there was very friendly and accomodating-- answering most of my questions w/ firm authority, and when he didn't know the answer, especially that concerning of the large fruit-topped birthday cake in the display case, he'd pop into the kitchen and ask someone for the answer.  I soon met the affable Mr. of Donna's Bakery, who informed me that the Mrs.- Donna- had to leave town that evening, but not before making the very cake I had a fixation on that very morning!  I hadn't planned on making such a purchase, esp. since Mom already had a birthday pass, but he made the cake sound so healthy (made w/ all-natural ingredients-- no powdered sugar, cornstarch, or corn syrup!  The fruits were brushed w/ a tapioca-fruit juiced glaze.  I don't think it even had eggs in the batter!), and topped with fresh, sliced fruits (w/ the exception of the maraschino cherries) AND filled w/ more fruit inside!  After selecting a few pastries to take home: a slice of German chocolate-mousse cake; a couple of red-velvet cupcakes w/ icing topped w/ red velvet cake crumbles (!); and something akin to an almond slivered-topped and flattened mocha cream puff (not pictured), Mr. Donna kindly offered a 10% discount on the cake.  Still hesitant in purchasing such a big item I hadn't had a chance to sample, I splurged and brought the cake home.  None of the smaller items wowed me (I found the cakes' texture to be very tender, yet lacking in moisture- strange), but that birthday cake was very, very good!  The layers were made of angel cake, and I LOVED the fruit-and-cream filling the most!  Mom didn't think much of the slice she had, but she was going through a period of a few months when she wasn't craving anything sweet, which was a good thing!  So, I sliced the rest of the cake and brought it to work-- everyone who had caved in to the temptation loved it.  Some even had seconds and thirds!!I plan on going back to try a few savory items that sounded good on the menu!

Restaurant name  The Compound Grill

Review Text :
I always thought it would be cool to have my own private compound.  You know, kind of like the "Cheney Compound" that our former VP had.  Except I would let Google Maps display mine...mostly because I don't have the power to bend the intertubes to my will and control the Googles.  I also don't have a man-sized safe in my office or play "pepper the lawyer" with my lawyer friends.Not that I'm against the occasional "peppering" when it's called for in the case of not just lawyers but oil company and health insurance company executives, politicians or media talking heads.  I would of course only sanction rock salt or bird shot, I'm a reasonable man after all.But since I don't have a compound I guess I can go to The Compound Grill from time to time.  I was here for a UYE send-off of our illustrious Yelp Community Manager, Gabi.  Not that we won't see her anymore but she is moving up the ladder and overseeing multiple Yelp communities now, sort of like a really cool and sophisticated mother hen overseeing a bunch of foodie chicks from different nests.  Not exactly like chicks because she can tell if we're male or female by looking.  So The Compound Grill hosted this event because they stood to make a few bucks off of the deal.  Hey, they're in business to make money, right?  When we arrived we had the choice of going "off the menu " or buying the wristband for $10 and having the buffet and a couple free drinks.The buffet was pretty good.  I liked some of the food better than others.  The chicken satay sort of things were tasty and I appreciated that they had some nice hot pepper sauce to punch it up.  The salad was good, the sushi ok, the key lime torts were tasty, I loved the grilled sweet potato. The Compound apparently has live music regularly and they get some pretty good acts.  Overall I liked the atmosphere, the service and the food and I would come back to take in some live tunes.  The Compound Grill displays easily on Google Maps so they may want to look in to that.This place is random.  R A N D O M random.  I don't "get" it.Went for lunch, while taking a break from medical testing at the Mayo Clinic.  This place was empty.  Ok, there were a half dozen other people there, but it barely counts with the size of the place.Now, I like that there is a stage (guess who thought of doing comedy there???!!!) and that they have live music that promotes local bands.  I am all for that.  But, there comes a point when you can't have the place seem too classy for that sort of thing.  Framed pictures of different musical icons are nice, but overplayed.  Everywhere else.  It just doesn't work here at Compound Grill.I had the fish n chips for lunch.  5 nuggets of fish places over a bowl of fries that weren't anything special.  When will people stop serving shoestring fries????  It was cool that everything was served in a bowl made from an old record that had been warped into...the shape of a bowl, though.  Service was friendly and attentive.  The manager or owner or whoever he was also present.  I'm guessing because they though there would be a lunch rush.For this area, in N Phoenix, so close to the 101/51 and N Scottsdale, I would expect a bigger lunch crowd.  Without it, I guess shows I'm not the first person to just find the place "meh."The CompoundThis venue does not honor their contracts with artists that perform at the premises...do not play this event unless you are prepared to receive a BS story about why they wont pay there contractual obligation despite your band packing the house with at least 250 people, their music director "Kyle Day" is a liar, cheat and participates in un-ethical business practices...AKA....Arsehole....

Review Text :
Well, it seems the potential for upscale whiskey bar is being squandered on the frattiest crowd ever to descend on Plaza/Midwood (which is saying a lot, considering the crowd TST draws). Since the cask beer is my main reason for coming here - and its seldom on tap - I'm giving up. The parking in this area has always been tight but its been taken to a whole other level of screwed since WW opened. Harris Teeter and CVS have put towing programs into effect because patrons of this joint (and hey, others too, but no one really complained until, coincidentally, right after WW opened) are too lazy to park in the municipal lots scattered around the 'hood. Watch out driving by the place in the wee hours, too - you'll inevitably be lunged at by Turd Ferguson and the Misses, thinking you're the cab they called. Idiots.Whiskey Warehouse - your service sucks and I could get better pimento cheese dip at the HT across the street.  I was here last Thursday and at 11pm a snottty manager-type lady came over and asked us to cash out because she wanted to leave for the night.  WHAT??  How can you be rude and come over so early?!  I looked at my watch and thought geeez time must have gotten away from us but no - it was only 11.  Are you kidding?  Can yall get with it?Above average whiskey selection! I was impressed how this place has "Jack Daniels" stamped on nearly everything. The place is a giant billboard for Tennessee whiskey. When we arrived, it was super loud. They had a DJ playing dance hits, with people getting out of their seats and getting rowdy with the music. The place had a definite fratty vibe. The whiskey selection was decent. I've seen much better lists of bourbons, and it seemed like they were mainly just picking out as many whiskeys as they could. They were missing great bourbons, but I guess it's not a bourbon warehouse, huh? They offer a variety of decent locally brewed beers, which was exciting. The beers were nearly all $5. The service was pretty good, our drinks never went empty, and we were checked up on regularly. The place is clean, and well kept. It has a classy interior, with an awesome rooftop patio! My favorite thing about this place was the number of televisions that they had going. They're on every surface around, each tuned to a different sporting event. This seems like a great place to catch a game!

5 star update!  This is, so far, my favorite place for tacos in Madison.  If you're looking for tasty, authentic Mexican eats this is the place to get it.  I went back a few times for lunch recently and left super satisfied. Here's how it goes:1) walk in, head straight back and grab a beverage from the cooler.  Mexican coke, anyone? 2) take a seat, any seat. And wait (sometimes a while) 3) place your order.  3 tacos: campechano*,  al pastor and steak4) eat5) pay. 6 bucks. That's some cheap eats, friends. I recommend eating in so you can try their amazing sauces in your tacos. Everything comes out fast, hot and fresh. Everything I've had here has been incredibly tastyService isn't the best, but the food is so tasty that I don't care.  When you're done eating, check out the store.  You'll find some housewares, spices, groceries and even some of the meat you just consumed. Pastor meat, get it. I still need to get out there on the weekend to try their specials.  Barbacoa, pozole, carnitas and chiles rellenos are a few that come to mind.  *the BEST taco in Madison. Chorizo and some crispy steak bits. Do yourself a favor and get this.

Meh is right... lets start on a positive note. The service was friendly, very friendly. I ordered take out the General Tso Chicken with Lo Mein and Edd rolls. It came out pretty prompt (7ish minutes or so) But when I got it home i opened the bag only to notice the guy hadn't closed the lid all the way and the sauce and lo mein were every where. it drenched the egg rolls and made them soggy. It also made everything taste the same. And the noodles seemed to be over cooked, they are so soft... yuck! And for 10 bucks you can get much better. Ill stick with my Grand China on Durango & Warmsprings...

Being the food-crazed person that I am, I perused the menu extensively before making reservations for my husband and I for NYE. We even half way picked out what we were going to have before arriving (yup, I'm food obsessed). I was beyond psyched to try the lobster/pineapple and ahi tuna/raspberry. Drink orders were taken after 20 minutes. Drink orders were forgotten. Service was pretty damn bad in general. Also I did experience the issue the other person faced where they kept asking about dessert after 10 minutes with our first course (WTF)? These things I can forgive them for, given it's a new place. The guy finally takes our food order, and after taking the order says "well we're out of lobster, tuna, and scallops". WTF. It's 5:30, we're literally one of the first diners of the evening. He doesn't offer an explanation (mb the supplier flaked?), or an apology. Just "we're out of half the menu" essentially. I'm more than a little irritated, as these were the items I was most excited about. Why 3 stars? The food we did try was really good. *Risotto with mushrooms and manchego: Tiny (it's tapas), but DAMN Good. I was scraping the plate. *Beef with brie: Note, this has honey and nuts all over it. I found it scrumptious, but mb the idea of a honey covered steak doesn't appeal to everyone!*Mini Chorizo over garlic potatoes: yup as good as it sounds*Garlic shrimp: Boring. This was a sad substitute for my lobster I wanted.. grrr*Spanish creme brulee - HUGE and quite good*White Sangria - packs a punch.. there might be 2 hours of NYE that I can't remember and I blame this sangria!Overall it has major potential, but my first dinner here was a bit of a disappointment. I'm excited we have a high-end tapas place finally, so I'll definitely be back to give it another shot but I'll probably give them a few months to get the kinks worked out.It was a Saturday night, my LV partner-in-crime and I were in the Aria Hotel, and decided to dine at Julian Serrano after reviewing the menu. Truth be told, since this resto name somewhat resembles mine (as people have mispronounced and called me by this name along with others- ask me about if you're interested), dining here was really a no-brainer. hah! With no reservations, we chanced it and apparently lady luck was on our side, as there was no wait. The warm colors of the restaurant looked so inviting. Here's a pic of the bar area, taken with my iPhone http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_w5hBpkjHs5_Hv3pLeHtIw?select=0OlrsQnQXZSPeD5NFJMvmAFrom our table, here's a shot of the entire restaurant http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_w5hBpkjHs5_Hv3pLeHtIw?select=GblIBlQF3t_da6M1L-zYbwEverything on the menu looked so delicious, so we ordered (and pics credit go to my girl, Li):- Beet Salad: Roasted and oh so beetalicious! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_w5hBpkjHs5_Hv3pLeHtIw?select=758bzflJcsXww0Lrl4dYeA- Beef with Brie: Tender pieces, with brie, (one of my fav cheeses). Oh Mylanta, such a digalicious combo, and with walnuts on top, and the savory sauce was divine! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_w5hBpkjHs5_Hv3pLeHtIw?select=ILrElkjFRWwhzXsjWWQ8xA- Striped bass: Fresh fish, cooked to perfection. Delish! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_w5hBpkjHs5_Hv3pLeHtIw?select=z4xiwtEsBVbf-jFhDgX7AA- Creamy Risotto with Mushrooms and Manchego: Mouth watering deliciousness, and so rich, creamy, and cheesey goodness!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_w5hBpkjHs5_Hv3pLeHtIw?select=bJAq88XYZOcUhvlGSTUkuA- Pan Manchego: Spanish Toast with roasted tomato and garlic paste with melted Manchego cheese. All I have to say is mas pan, mas pan! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_w5hBpkjHs5_Hv3pLeHtIw?select=HLxPDvdXAqwLErnnHtCVdw-Chocolate Cake: Chocolate molten cake, which rivals my favorite chocolate souffle at Roy's Hawaiian restaurant. Combined with mango sorbet, and I was in dessert heaven with these two loves of mine. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_w5hBpkjHs5_Hv3pLeHtIw?select=Igp440NlqPIVtgwWajkFfwWhile we feasted so well, our beverages were refreshing white sangria (para mi) and red sangria (para mi amiga), and later had very 'brave' coffee. We needed the caffeine jolt, as it was only the beginning of a very fun and memorable night out.Que bueno, Julian Serrano! Beautiful interior, efficient service, reasonable prices, and wonderful food. This is a great restaurant for a date, a small or big group of friends, and perfect for getting the night started off right in Sin City! Viva Las Vegas!!This place is a surprisingly good vegan eating option on the Strip.  Most of the vegetarian tapas are vegan (since they use olive oil and not butter in their preparations) or can be made vegan with the omission of a sauce.  They even prepared a vegan paella for us! We tried pretty much every vegan-friendly dish on the menu, and I was very pleased for the most part. The only disappointment was the cold eggplant salad.  Bad texture and very bland.  Beet salad, patata brava, padron peppers, gazpacho, etc. were all very good.  They have vegan mango and maybe pineapple(?) sorbet there as the only vegan desserts... but they are fantastic.  Good Spanish wine and sherry (if you're a sherry fan), fancy cocktails (nothing special, especially for the price).One of the servers there, Stephanie, is vegan... so request her if you want to ensure that you get all the vegan options!The Skinny: undercooked rice in the paella, bland chicken croquettes with no chicken in them, flavourless sauteed spinach (2); service: is good and prompt (4); value: I'm sorry... we spent $90 including tax and tip, no booze, on food that isn't that great (1)We were hovering between going back to Sage for round two or heading over to try Julian Serrano for dinner. My hubby decided, for the sake of Yelp reviews, that we ought to try something we haven't done before. This is even despite the average 3.5 star rating.So, we checked out the menu and ordered the Valencia Paella, the chicken croquettes, the sauteed spinach, the mushroom soup and the stuffed dates.The chicken croquettes were singularily unpleasant. Not much chicken inside, the bechamel sauce was bland. So basically, you bit into a croquette filled with bland bechamel... yuck!The mushroom soup as an odd mushroom underseasoned consumme with foie gras foam (that didn't taste like foie gras). Considering the price you paid for this dish, it clearly doesn't deliver the luxury you are expecting.The stuffed dates were atrocious - greasy and boring.  You couldn't taste the bacon, just the warmed dates with the crunch of a flavourless blanched almond.Sauteed spinach with apples, raisins, shallots and pine nuts - sounds really yummy right? Well, it would have been if they'd added a grain of salt to the dish. The spinach was also unappealing on two levels - 1) uneven cooking method (see the pic - some are cooked, some slighty wilted) and 2) not enough oil leads to that filmy sensation feel inside your mouth.The Valencia Paella was improperly prepared. First of all, the flavours were off for such a dish - perhaps too much saffron. Secondly, the rice. Now, I know that the rice is supposed to be al dente. But this was not al dente, my friends. It's considered raw when the rice after chewing leaves a grainy texture in your mouth. Plus, if you look at my pics - no evidence of that wonderfully toasted socrrat layer (no golden brownness to the rice or the bits sticking to the bottom of the pan).Third, the chorizo was subpar - texturally dry and one note... salty - it could not stand up to the other mediocre components of this dish.So overall, a 2 starred review - mostly for the excellent service.The Julian Serrano Tapas Restaurant carries the name of its executive chef, Julian Serrano, who has made a name for himself in Las Vegas as the celebrated chef at Picasso's at the Bellaggio for the past decade. Prior to that, he was the head chef at the world famous Masa's, in San Francisco.Here in the Aria at City Center, the grandiose, massive and latest project of MGM Hotel Group, it adds a nice modern Euro feel to the ultra modern and art infused City Center complex, and adds a splash of mediterranean hot colors to the understated Japanese-like hotel color motif of the Aria hotel. It's like a saucy Flamenco dance hall in the middle of the hi-rise offices of corporate giants in the Shinegawa section of Tokyo. Or like the Guggenheim's museum in Bilbao, Spain amidst the rustbelt of the surrounding aging industrial factories that once were the heart of that city. It was later on a Thursday when we came, and it was fairly unoccupied. Sat at the bar and was professionally waited on with a lot of attention, owing to the sparse crowd. The room is large and very open; there are dozens upon dozens of bar seats, the ideal tapas location, strung along one side of the restaurant. The ambiance is a classy-festive feel and decor, but very pro in service. The specials were told, but they were all fairly heavy and hearty, and we were in a lighter mood, it being about 9:00pm. So we opted for 4 light dishes:-Marinated Olive Medley ($3) about 5 different offerings including pearl onion-White Ceviche ($10) This was light, with just a touch of onions and tomatoes, served with a wafer and garnished with cilantro and radicchio- Escalivada ($8) - were roasted bell peppers and mushrooms in olive oil with a baguette toast slice- Avocado Cannelloni ($10) this was a light cannelloni wrapped not in noodle, but thin avocado slices topped with chopped nuts, and sided with a dollop of guacamole topped with watercress and a side splash of aioliWith a Gin and Tonic, the bill was $43.24 before tip, and satisfaction came with the refreshing flavors with the creative and traditional dishes from Julian Serrano at Aria.***Aria's Julian Serrano is a nice looking tapas spot with a menu that sounds good; unfortunately, the food was surprisingly mediocre***Julian Serrano is a tapas spot that is near the front lobby of the Aria Hotel.  The decor reminds me a little bit of the Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill in MGM Grand in how the restaurant is very much open to the casino and the hotel.  There are no big and thick walls separating the dining area from the nearby bustling activity of the casino.The decor is very upscale cafe-like and hotel restaurant-like.  Nice and contemporary but pretty standard stuff (not unique or memorable).We had a few things here and I felt the food looked better than it tasted.  Several of the dishes were average.  I was not a big fan of Fleur by Hubert Keller (a tapas spot in Mandalay Bay), but I felt Fleur was noticeably better than Julian Serrano.Here is a rundown on what we had.(Ahi Tuna Tempura) This was ahi tuna two ways.  There was a standard ahi tuna tower on the plate that had an avocado base (fresh and a good flavor but something you will find at a lot of other restaurants).There was also ahi tuna that was flash fried in a light tempura batter (crispy on the outside but still rare on the inside).  This was okay and I liked the contrast of the cool center with the crisp outside.  Still, I've had a much better version of that dish at Ocean Avenue Seafood in Santa Monica.(Mediterranean Bass)  This was a bass with the skin-on that was served over some veggies with a light sauce.  It was a light dish and had a mild flavor.  The fish was pretty moist (the skin could have been crisper).(Cheese Platter) The cheese selection at Fleur was much better.  The cheese here was a little dry (not great flavors either).  The garnishes were also disappointing.  The fruit paste was too thick and lacked sweetness.(Chicken Skewers) The chicken skewers here were juicy enough, but they lacked flavor.(Prime Tenderloin Topped With Cheese, Honey And Pecans) The quality of beef was really poor (at least when compared to the other dishes we had here). The beef was a thin piece.  They overcooked it  (it came out well) and it was dry and chewy.  The cheese, honey and pecans were all fine, but the centerpiece of the dish (beef) was a real disappointment.(Stuffed Dates) The dates here were wrapped in bacon and then deep-fried.  This is a pretty popular combination and their version of it was pretty tasty (though kind of a given with this flavor combination).Service was okay.  Food came out at a good pace and the staff was attentive enough, but I felt the wait staff was not as strong as what I experienced at other Vegas spots recently (including Fleur, Mesa Grill, Comme Ca, Bouchon, and Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill).I've been fortunate enough to have a lot of service where it felt the wait staff was really putting in the extra effort to make every aspect of the dining experience enjoyable and memorable.  While the wait staff was pleasant enough, I did not get that same feeling here.Julian Serrano sounds like it would be a nice place.  The menu reads nice as well.  There were mostly misses here though and the food was just not as good as other Vegas spots I've tried in the same price range.  I will give a lot of places a second try, but since we had so many dishes and so many were average, I doubt I would return here.Aria features complimentary valet parking.  I am not sure if they feature complimentary self-parking as well.Top notch modern Spanish tapas served in a very cool, contemporary setting.The food combines the traditional flavors with just the right amount of modern, molecular gastronomy to keep it cool and fresh.  After several visits, these are my favorites:Ceviches.  Excellent.  Both (white fish and mixed seafood that adds shrimp and octopus) are near perfect.  The seafood is extremely fresh, peppers and onions still retain their crunch, and the lime juice adds a bright finish without being overpowering.Angulas (baby eels).  The slight brininess of the eels blends perfectly with the garlic and chili oil that they are served in.  If hundreds of eyes looking up at your from your fork is a problem, skip this dish.Incredible ham.  The serano is good but the imported pata negra is much better.  A real treat although I would prefer that no sauces or accompaniments be served with it.  Why mask a good thing?Paellas.  How can you not love chicken, rabbit, and chorizo rice or calamari, shrimp, mussels and monkfish.  All the proteins are cooked perfectly and deeply flavor the saffron rice.  Plan ahead if you want to enjoy the paellas.  They all take about 30 minutes to prepare.Service is excellent.The wine list is extensive with a lot of choices from Spain which pair nicely with the food.  Prices are fair by Vegas standards.Had dinner here with a good friend.  Have always passed this by on prior visits to Aria and never gave it a 2nd thought.  When he suggested Tapas for dinner, I was excited to give this joint a try.The menu isn't as extensive as other Tapas restaurants, but the quality is exceptional.  We ordered:- Brava Potatoes (Spicy Tomato, Alioli Sauce, $8)- Creamy Risotto (Wild Mushroom, Manchego Cheese, Natural Jus, $10)- Pan Tomate (Toasted Bread, Fresh Garlic, Tomato Sauce, $6)- Spanish Tortilla (Potatoes, Eggs, Onions, $8)- Stuffed Piquillo Peppers (Goat Cheese, Mushrooms, $10)- Stuffed Dates (Almond, Applewood Bacon, Spicy Piquillo Pepper Sauce, $8)- Buñuelos (Spanish Doughnuts, Butterscotch, Caramel, $8)The Brava Potatoes were OK.  They had good flavor, but were very filling.  I don't recommend having this if you want to try more than a couple of items....this is a gut-buster.The Creamy Risotto was awesome!  I finished it off in no time.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_w5hBpkjHs5_Hv3pLeHtIw?select=lMySncNeWzMMnVjutvUdYwThe Pan Tomate was pretty good....an excellent start for the meal.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_w5hBpkjHs5_Hv3pLeHtIw?select=GGXY6sUnEQD0-tlpUFHM_wThe Stuffed Piquillo Peppers were my favorite...yum!  They cooked just right and the sweet and savory flavor of the Peppers went perfectly with the Goat Cheese and Mushrooms.  I could eat a large plate of those, easily.My friend had the Stuffed Dates and the Spanish Tortilla.  He enjoyed both of them.The other highlight of my evening was the Buñuelos.....damn, these were good!  The Caramel Butterscotch dipping sauce went perfectly with the Spanish Doughnuts.  I love how they have the toothpicks for easy dipping/eating.  They are addicting too because I can't get my mind off of them.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_w5hBpkjHs5_Hv3pLeHtIw?select=6365pbJb9_eE-Hj_kxdMtwOverall, it was a great meal and good times.Return Factor - 90%Mmm. Firefly to the tenth power. Food came out bangin'. To begin we ordered the stuffed dates, some of the lightly breaded calamari, pan y manchego cheese, paella and I believe braised mussels. Definitely one of the best food experiences I've had since moving here. Paella was delicious. It came out hot, with a lobster claw and a ginormous prawn for the "Mixed Paella" that was nice and tender. Service was on point -- filling our water when needed, divvying our paella, providing us with some bread when we needed to sop up some mussel juice even. Service wasn't too obtrusive and dispite being a little secluded in the back corner (it was by choice as I wanted for me and the date to have a little privacy) came by frequently enough to check up on us when needed. Oh and all that seafood paired with the light, crisp white wine sangria just made my mouth melt. I wanted a pitcher. But watch out tho' folks, just like any well prepared, crazy yummy, addictive sangria, this one is a creeper drink. Talk about the perfect libation to cool off that stifling Los Wages heat. Definitely enough to get that party started.. When it was all said and done we were so full we passed up dessert.One *very* minor knock though is the restaurant's casual ambiance. While I knew it was a fairly laid back spot with it's open air setting I expected at least a few secluded areas with more private dining where I didn't have to hear the adjacent table's conversation.. or visa versa. But so what, it may not be an incredibly romantic spot but the great food, white wine sangria and service left me wanting to come back for more, date in tow or not.Yes 5 stars!  Julian Serrano is worthy of all the stars , the moon and the sun too!  THIS IS WHERE I HAD THE  BEST CEVICHE I HAVE EVER HAD IN MY WHOLE LIFE!I'm so not a Las Vegas fan! (Yeah, I'm that boring!) If I want to "live it up" South Beach has  never dissapointed.  BUT, I love road trips! So much so that I would go anywhere even when I don't care for the destination. "Hey you wanna take a road trip to hell?" Me: " Oh! Hell yeah!...you are driving, right?" WHY I HATE VEGAS, WELL IF YOU CARE...THE CHEESY DAY CLUB SCENE:Don't get  me wrong, I love pool parties but the whole Vegas day club culture with cheesy Z list "celebrity" hosts from mind numbing reality shows-BARF! This scene can be entertaining for about 20 min ...well unless you are slizzered! The scene as in dudes with huge biceps,  meaningless "tribal tatoos"  and chicken legs walking around like they're about to fly! Oh! And their counterparts, Pamela Anderson wannabees looking like they came to audition for America's Next Top Pornstar.  Meanwhile, the evil twin in me is itching to stick a pin in those thingies, something about inflated balloons...NIGHT CLUBS:Even worse; populated with the same roid heads from the pool trying to be all "big pimpin"  because they just paid $500 for $20 bottle of Grey Goose Vodka for the privilege of being sorrounded by 20  "hot" girls.  And the sad thing is  that, these ladies  are not even interested in these "ballers". They would play the part for a free drink and a place to park their asses and rest their 6" heels wearing feet! As you know, In Vegas, no bottle service, no seating! So if you don't want to get bottle service yourself, you'd better  find someone who could...SENSORY OVERLOAD 1. 2000 ladies of all shapes and sizes(not a compliment) wearing the Vegas Saturday Night Uniform-the "Freak Em Dress"... with 6 inch heels! Yap! That super short, super tight dress that used to be a favourite of prostitutes all over the world but now... Hey!  I don't even know what  Vegas "working girls" wear to gain a competitive edge over that girl from Kansas who just want to  "let the freak out" for the weekend! That is some conundrum!  2. The Wayne Newton's face everywhere- taxis, buidings, mugs...DISTURBING!3. The annoying slots machine ringers that I keep hearing even in my sleep!  The fake foreign cities,  waterfalls and beaches...4.  Millions of Elvis impersonators...I mean seriously, who goes to Vegas to watch a fake Elvis?OTHER ANNOYING FACTORS:1) The fact that you have to walk many carpeted miles in your highest heels to get to the main door? 2)  LET ME NOT START WITH THE VEILED SLOBBERING DRUNK BACHELORETTES! WHY I GO TO VEGAS.Besides the road trip, I go to Vegas because of one thing and one thing only-THE RESTAURANTS!THE VEGAS DINING EXPERIENCE:I can comfortably say that  with all the fake glitz and cheesy glamour, Las Vegas  is home to the best restaurants in the country...well, in close third to NYC and San Francisco!  We turned up at Julian Serrano by chance after an award show at MGM. A night before, we had a late dinner at Comme Ca at the Cosmopolitan, so for the next dinner, we wanted to try out restaurants at Aria. We first headed down to Bar Masa because of its New York connection. We get to Bar Masa " Bla! Bla! Bla! You have no reservation, you'll have to wait for the late sitting" (an hour later).  Moi, I am in no shape to wait-I am hungry, cranky, I am in so much pain, my hooker heels are killing me from all that walking through the Casino to get to the MGM main entrance!So I  told the Maitre d' I can't wait but needed a recommendation. This guy  personally walked us to Juliano Serrano. And of course, I am not that excited to be at JS because I was looking forward to eat at Bar Masa-my mind was already made up! And I am also thinking, I have had the best tapas already, what can this chef do that is different form all other tapas restaurants? The restaurant when you look at it ,is so unassuming-bright color modern decor-nothing special.THE FOOD:We had:- Lobster Salad - Red Beet Salad -Ahi Tuna Tempura  -Avocado Cannelloni -Huevos Estrellado -Sautéed Padron Peppers -White Ceviche (EASILY THE BEST CEVICHE I HAVE EVER HAD!)-Steamed Mussels -Gambas a la Plancha -White Anchovy Fillets -Grilled Lamb Chop -Stuffed Dates Yeah and we definitely stuffed our faces too ;-). We paired the tapas with a great bottle of wine as recommended by the sommelier. I was so happy that I ended up here instead of Bar Masa; what a great surprise that was! I had no expectations coming in and ended up with the best tapas I ever had (as far as I can recall!)  I highly recommend Julian Serrano as the restaurant to dine at when you are in Las Vegas. I have dined at some of the "best restaurants in Las Vegas" but this one is high on that list!Compliments to Chef Serrano!BY http://www.girlstrippin.comFollow me: http://www.instagram.com/pendoloveamoreFan-frickin-tastic.I admit I went to this more than a year ago but our meal still stands out as one of our better Vegas dining experiences.The 'atmosphere' is a bit odd, just between the Cosmopolitan and Aria but the food and great service make up for any oddity.I know I should have taken notes because I can't remember what we had, but I doubt there's a 'miss' on the list, just go for it.From atmosphere to food to service- from drinks to tapas- Julian Serrano is a must when even close to the Aria Casino. If you are a fan of Spanish tapas, you will be as close to heaven as you will ever be. We are huge fans of tapas, the smaller portions and the many flavors that will explode on your taste buds. So many varieties and all of the tapas were beautifully presented on great, long rectangular plates that facilitated the three of us getting to all that was available. Favorites included the Spanish tortilla de patata, the octopus, the scallops, the ceviche was so delicious. We tried everything we thought we would like including the lamb, and then because we had a great rapport  with our waiter, we let him pick some of his favorites for us to try. We had reservations for 9pm and ate easily for at least 2 and a half hours, as a matter of fact, we actually closed the restaurant down and were never made to feel that we were a bother. It was a birthday celebration, and they brought the most beautiful plate complete with candle! (see pictures) Rarely will you find a restaurant that gets all of it right- but at Julian Serrano all of the stars aligned for us to give us a perfect meal.Swanky tapas, Vegas style!  Who doesn't like the sound of that?I certainly don't, so that's why I made a beeline to Julian Serrano for my first night's dinner on the Strip.First of all, Chef Julian Serrano's eponymous restaurant is absolutely beautiful.  It overflows with bold, colorful tile that's a feast for the eyes.  It's also *very* loud in there, since it's directly adjacent to the Aria resort lobby, a mere feet from hordes of tired hotel guests checking in and out.  And, no, there are no walls to keep out the hubbub.After taking a seat at the long, comfortably, and classy bar, I was quickly helped by one of the friendly and efficiently bartenders.  After ordering a glass of Sauvignon blanc to whet the palate, I browsed the mouthwatering -- and **long** -- menu of tapas options.  The menu is nicely organized into fish/ceviche, veggie, and meat/poultry tapas, making it easy to navigate.  There's also a catch-all "new style" tapas category, as well as paellas and "platos grandes" for those of you with larger appetites.Four items were just enough to fill the belly without making me uncomfortably full.  Here's the rundown of what I tried:1.  White ceviche.  Everyone knows I love a good ceviche, and this one was a knockout.  The white fish was tender and flaky, with just the right amount of heat and tang from the lime and cilantro.2.  Brava potatoes.  This dish was a little less exciting than I thought it would be -- it's essentially just fries with aioli.  That said, the flavors were excellent.  There's a *lot* of aioli provided, so I ended up taking the excess off to prevent the potatoes from getting soft.  I did enjoy eating the potatoes with the little skewers provided.3.  Tuna cones.  This dish was the weirdest and also my least favorite.  It consisted of 3 wantons (rolled into ice cream cones), which were filled with avocado, and then ahi tartare and aioli on top.  Again, my issue was the overabundance of aioli, which overwhelmed everything else.  I couldn't taste the tuna at all.4.  Santiago's cake.  This was an almond cake dusted with powdered sugar, with a side of almond ice cream.  Simple but very well done.  My only gripe was that the cake was a little dry, but this was remedied by letting the ice cream melt all over it.  All in all, Julian Serrano was a great dinner, although the little hiccups along the way make me hesitant about rushing back.  After all, you're paying Vegas Strip prices here (most tapas are in the $10-15 range, but some are more), so you tend to expect perfection for your buck.That said, with all the amazing options on Julian Serrano's menu, it'd be hard to resist the temptation to try them all.  =)*** REVIEW IS FOR LV RESTAURANT WEEK 2013 ***I have been meaning to visit Julian Serrano for awhile. After all, for all food connoisseurs in Las Vegas, surely Julian Serrano must be somewhere on their list. Tucked away inside the alluring Aria by the front desk, yet ever so far away from parking garage is this spot of expensive tapas paradise. To be of note - it IS a tapas place, hence why I haven't been on pins and needles trying to come here. Always in the back of my mind was the voice saying, "So expensive for just tapas! Just go to Firefly instead!"Luckily LVRW2013 has rolled around and I enjoyed a meal here with friends on a Tuesday night at 6:30 PM. Before being seated my friend and I ordered cocktails at the bar (all $14). I tried a fruity type drink that provided a nice start to my meal. Not too sweet, not too alcoholy, but still pretty steep in price. After drinks we were seated in the dining area further back, which is nice since it is over carpet, which brings the sound of the clacking of feet down to a minimum and it also hides your table from the casino. Chairs are plush and comfortable, lighting is perfect, and the ambiance is classy. Service was excellent. Our server was prompt, kept our drinks filled, and in general was a very courteous gentleman. I ordered a chardonnay from the Bordeaux region of France ($16). A lovely wine indeed and of the two options (another which was from California) I am glad I splurged. Worth every drop.  On to the food...Chicken Croquetas - Simple yet tasty is the best way to describe these. The dish is not the most pleasant to look at, but the taste was deliciously fried on the outside and creamy on the inside.Salmon (with mashed potatoes and baby carrots) - The main dish is what let me down and which brought down my rating. The salmon was cooked well enough, but the portion size was disappointing. My friend got the chicken and after seeing her dish I was wishing for chicken. Also, the horseradish cream served on the side of the salmon just did not go well with the fish, to me personally. I am wishing now someone else in my party had wanted to do the paella, but in order to have that option you must have more than one person ordering the dish. *womp womp*Molten Chocolate Cake and Blood Orange Ice Cream - I do love blood orange ice cream and sorbet and this one was refreshing to have with the very decadent and very good chocolate cake. If anything, this may have been my favorite part of the dining experience, coming in second to the glass of chardonnay.Overall - I realize I am reviewing the LVRW2013 menu, but even so, this food reflects the establishment. I think the big thing was how flat the salmon fell for me. After all, it was my main dish. While the other items were good I believe they should have been better considering the establishment. Would I be back? I would try happy hour. I would even go back for a birthday party I was invited to here... or some other special event. BUT, I do not believe I would come back for a full-out full-priced meal.During a recent stay at Aria, I did one thing that I NEVER thought I would do while staying at a hotel... I never left the property once during my 3 day stay. I don't know about you, but that is unheard of for me, especially in Vegas. I'm all about the hotel hopping and restaurant at this hotel and this other hotel. With that said, Julian Serrano was one of the reasons I never left the property. I simply did not need to. I came here for the lunch three-course menu, which I concluded was an AMAZING deal and steal. If you want to try this place out, but are wary about the heavy price tag, come for lunch. It was $19 for a three course meal. My three courses was the Wild Mushroom Soup, Rib Eye Steak w/ fries and the Santiago's Cake. I really enjoyed the rich and earthy soup and the rib eye was cooked very nicely and served with thinly cut and crispy fries. The cake was surprisingly delightful and I preferred it over the flan that they offer. Our waiter was very friendly and checked up on us several times. He also gave us some sangria mini samples and informed us of the happy hour they have daily 4-5:30 which includes sangria and app specials!Overall, a good bang for your buck, especially for being at Aria and I'll be sure to come back for their happy hour!As I was driving to Vegas for my vacation, I was contemplating on dining options and suddenly thought of Julian Serrano. Julian Serrano is a great alternative to the multi-course restaurants in Vegas, and here are the reasons that I may revisit the restaurant: 1) If you are looking for a good place to grab lunch and do not want to wait in line, this is the restaurant for you. 2) The waiter knows the menu well and points out food for our friends who have dietary restrictions. 3) The food is simple and arrives on your table quickly. However, I have decided to give the restaurant only three stars because of the following reasons:1) Although the restaurant is not full, it takes a long time before the host takes notice of us.2) The food is good but not great. Having had the tapas in Purple Pig and Girl and the Goat in Chicago, my friends and I are not impressed with the food at Julian Serrano. 3) The restaurant lacks vegetarian options. If you are a vegetarian, I would recommend you visiting Jean Philippe next doors.If you were me, would you visit Julian Serrano again?Tapas 101:A glass of wine, a plate of tapas.A glass of wine, a plate of tapas.A glass of wine, a plate of tapas.Repeat until full.Siesta.Don't  be intimidated by the almost 100 selection menu.  Don't order more than one plate at a time (this isn't dim sum).Do take your time.  Savor the flavor of simply prepared, quality ingredients.While the kitchen excels at traditional tapas, do not pass the  tuna-raspberry skewer.  A multi sensory dish opening with the aroma of sesame and essence of raspberry, textural contrast of the silky cube of ahi against the seeds, the contrasting temperature of ingredients.  It just works.To the traditional.  Top props to the monkfish and pisto.  Beautifully pan seared, moist monkfish paired with a mix of eggplant, zucchini and tomato.  Vinegar adds a good acidic zing that brightens the flavor of the fish.  Excellent mixed seafood ceviche with perfectly "cooked" shrimp, white fish and octopus bathed in lime and cilantro.  Other standouts, gambas a la plancha (prepared head on; oh the head fat..), tender octopus whose oceanic flavor is heightened by the earthy paprika, calamari a la plancha simply dressed in olive oil, and a very simple plate o anchovy fillets.  Not into seafood?  Excellent rabo de toro (braised oxtail), falling off the bone, served with Iberian pork atop a very creamy, mashed potato, an excellent Iberian pork shoulder with it's deep, porky flavor, and a sublime plate of imported pata negra (ham from the black footed pig).  The hazelnuts of the pig's diet is very prominent in the complex flavor of the ham.Many repeat visits.  Service is consistently excellent; friendly and accommodating.  Very good wine list with well focused selection by the glass that pair well with the dishes.  Vegas resport pricing.Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.....

Review Text :
The old Cross Road (aka Carowinds) Mall. I think the only thing left from it's previous incarnation is the old Hamrick's (and that's a review all unto itself about how it reminds me of old, country, 80's, Sears stores). But, from what I understood, the Cross Roads mall suffered a slow and painful death and Plaza Fiesta came to try to revive it.I don't know if it did though. For the most part the place is pretty deserted outside the main playground/food court area. The layout is a simple grid of large vertical hallways and smaller horizontal ones. The large ones have names like Avenue of the American while the little ones each have the name of a Spanish-speaking country.They hallways have a variety of stores that range from ethnic eateries/pastries, shoe stores, hispanic/latin products, cell phones, sound equipment, Quinceañera dresses, knock off clothing, brand clothing, and others. The anchors, untraditionally, include Hamrick's, a Tae Kwon Do schoo, and a small Latin grocery store, a Van Heusen Outlet and a Cowboy Clothing store. One of the most unique stores though is definitely the Botanica, which specializes in Latin American folk medicine, religious candles and statuary, amulets, and other products culturally regarded as magical or lternative medicine. Strolling the hallways is a very interesting way to spend a Sunday afternoon once or twice... but after that, you've pretty much seen it all and the fascination wears off.The food court is really good. They have some pretty unique eateries here that you won't find in any other mall. They have a Mexican restaurant with pretty traditional Mexican food (not really dishes though, more like tacos, subs, sopes, etc), A Ceviche stand, a Greek restaurant and others.The food court also houses the biggest/tallest indoor playground in the Southeast. Our kids LOVE this thing. It's like a massive hamster maze with slides. If you have kids, try it out. It's a pretty cool concept. You buy your kids a bracelet and you throw them in the fenced-in, round-the-cloock guarded playground. The kids are not allowed out unless their bracelet matches yours. So, short of someone from the Colombian black market chopping your hand off, you're pretty safe to get your kids back... whether you want to or not. Their arcade is pretty awesome as well, a little pricey, but unlike most other places that still have arcade rooms, all the games work!!!They also have special rooms to hold parties. Becky and I have held two parties here, one for Girl 1 and one for Boy 3. We were fortunate enough to get great service from the girls who run the arcade/party room and the parties were a success at a very reasonable price.They used to have a Latin-themed music store... but that went out of business. Which sucks cuz they also carried some awesome books in Spanish that you can't really get anywhere in Charlotte.It does seem like the mall is flailing though. Stores seem to appear and disappear every time  you go and customers are scant at best. I do not know if this is going to last much longer but it seems the only business they get is on weekend. I could be wrong.I enjoy coming here and bringing the kids. Hopefully they'll be around for while.

2 stars, would have been 4 if the service was at least decent.  Hard to justify waiting 25 minutes before someone came and talk to us after we were seated.We came here after hiking Picacho so we were too tired to leave but this is shamefully bad.  Food quality was actually pretty good, better than the Chandler's Mimi, but after the drinks came and food order was taken, it was another 25 minutes before the food came.  Refills were slow, the lady who helped us tried to smile and apologize but she was certainly quick to drop the check off when we barely finish eating.  So25 mins wait for drinks order25 mins wait for food order30 mins to eatcheck was not late, came right as soon as she took the first few plates off.Oh and we did not go during rush hour, we were there at 2pm.  All in, we got out of this place at 10 till 4.  Not impressed and kind of shocked that a national chain could be so bad.  If anyone from Mimi Corporate is reading, just send someone over there and pretend to be a late lunch client on Saturday, guaranteed a very full report.

Review Text :
In the immortal words of Homer Simpson, "Mmmmmmm pie......."I had read the Yelp reviews for Croshaw's and wanted to try them for some time now.  I was finally able to get there.  Upon walking in we were warmly greeting and looked over the pies in the cases.  Beautiful chocolate cream pie, lemon merangue, berry, and several others.  It was hard to decide.  What I loved the most was that they also had "mini" pies.  A pie for one or two is perfect if you don't have a large family or you're not taking a pie to a dinner or just don't need an entire large pie,  And mostly because if I bought a regular 9 inch pie, I'd eat the whole damn thing.  I really do have very little self control.  I settle on a mini german chocolate pie, a mini peach cobbler, and a chicken pot pie.  All of this for $12!!  WOW!  I took my delicious morsals home and popped the chicken pot pie in the oven.  About 20 minutes later it was done.  This beats any frozen Marie Callander's pot pie any day!  You can taste how fresh it is.  It tastes like mom made it and the crust is delicious!!  So then I tried some of the german chocolate pie.  Creamy chocolate with pecan bits and coconut topped with whipped cream.  YUM!!!!!  I'm in heaven!  And the peach cobbler......another slice of heaven! And in case you're wondering, I did not eat all three in the same night, thank you. I didn't say I had no self control at all.  It appears that I will be making frequent trips to Croshaw's.  And with the holidays coming I'll bet their pumpkin pie is amazing!  Thank you Croshaw's.  Now I'm obsessed with pie.  :)

You have a sweet tooth? Come here.You want desserts to chase your drinks? come here.You want alcoholic smoothies? come here.You want something pretty to eat? come here.This place has it all. Small patisserie (pastry shop in French) but very eloquent with their desserts. They're pretty to look at and fun to eat! The staff are very friendly and they let you sample all flavors of gelato, cakes, drinks, etc. The decor of the artistic cakes and pastries may seem snooty at first but this place is anything but! Hubby and I came here for some treats after our dinner. We couldn't decide on the gelato, so we tried about 8 flavors before deciding on 2. The cosmopolitan gelato was delicious! Hubby ended up getting lemon and "Samantha's forbidden apple" for his gelato. I got the strawberry shortcake since it was dipped in grand marnier! WOW! We also got 2 small pineapple mojito alcoholic smoothie and strawberry lemonade vodka! The samples didn't taste so strong, but once we got them in our cups, we got to see how much alcohol was really in our smoothies, we got drunk off it!Hubby loved the cup and they let him keep it. Even when they were closing, they didn't throw us out, we got to take our time and finish. I plan to come back here every time I'm in Vegas now!

Boba!Yes, I said boba.  Boba as in "a name for the sweet, chewy, tapioca balls found at the bottom of the Taiwanese bubble tea/boba tea drink."There are few places that have boba in the Valley, and after seeing a sign out front of Red Kimchi on several occasions, I finally decided to go pay them a visit.I walked in at an odd time... around 5pm on a Tuesday.  I was heading to a meeting and not sure how long it would be, so I wanted a little something to hold me over until dinner.  The restaurant was empty except for all of their staff sitting at a table in the back eating.  I felt like I was interrupting but once I was in, I wasn't going to turn around and walk out.  I came in for boba and I was going to leave with boba!I felt kind of awkward as I just wanted a boba to-go, but they sat me at a table while I waited... I perused the menu of boba choices and narrowed it down to either green tea, mango, or strawberry boba.  I asked the guy for his input and he asked if I wanted it to be low cal or not.  When I said, yes, I'd prefer the low cal option, he convinced me to go with the green tea flavor.  Imagine my surprise when he brought me my drink five minutes later and it tasted like ice cream!  I really really doubt it was low cal, but I decided to "suck it up" quite literally... and it was delicious!I took a menu with me and since then, decided I need to return sometime soon to give their Korean food a shot.  Hopefully when I do, it will be a less-awkward experience.  If you're up for joining me for Korean sometime, let me know!  And regardless, go check out Red Kimchi's boba and yelp about it so I can see what you think!

Connected to the Bauer Lofts and part of the Charcoal Group (that brought Waterloo Martini's, Wildcraft, del Dante, and the Charcoal Steakhouse), you get the dining-for-the-nouveau-waterloo that you'd expect. I don't mean it derisively; the atmosphere is modern and fresh, the menu albeit meat-heavy is interesting (complete with wine pairings), the service is mature, and the food doesn't disappoint. If you've been to Wildcraft, the vibe is the same. My wife and I dropped in on a Friday night. We didn't have a reservation, they were fully booked, but they were happy to seat us in the bar area with the rest of the ill-planned 30-something-professional couples. I had the sirloin burger (at the recommendation of the bartender) and it's probably one of the top 3 I've had in Waterloo. My wife had a halibut steak on top of mixed veggies -- it was presented well, and she enjoyed it. The beer selection was good -- they made the right trade off decisions. I actually had a laugh when I noticed 10 taps: 5 typical main-stream selects (I think canadian, blue, blue light coors), and 5 "micro brew" selections (tank house, creemore, waterloo dark, and a couple of others). In general, the BK is a safe date, work, or parent restaurant -- recommended above others in the same category in waterloo (sole, wildcraft, rude native).

After browsing the selection of draft Beer, I was pleasantly surprised to see some quality....I started out with a Dogfish Head IPA ($7) and ordered a 10" Pepperoni Sausage & Jalapeno Pizza ($11.95).  The Pizza came out and to my surprise was very good!  The crust was soft and doughy and tasted great....the Pepperoni and Sausage were good quality.  I normally like Jalapeno on my Pizza, but for some reason I didn't like it this evening and regretted ordering it as it took away from all of the goodness of the rest of the Pizza.  I ended up picking them off the slices.I watched the Lakers lose to the Bulls....that called for an Abita Purple Haze ($7), which I couldn't believe they carried!  It's brewed out of Louisiana and is hard to find in bars in Las Vegas....bonus!Later I tried a Duvel ($7), which is a Belgian Beer....very good too.  I'm amazed at the selection of Beer here.After a few hours of fun and games, we left.  Kiddo had a blast with his buddies and discovered a cool place I enjoy on the Strip!Will I return?  I'm trying to think of an excuse to go back....ha!

I've never tried a McRib Sandwich and I heard via the Talk Threads that McDonald's in Las Vegas started serving them the other day, so I took my Son here to give this legendary Sandwich a try.We ordered two McRib Meals (Sandwich, Fries, Soda) $4.19.  I also wanted to try the $1 Spicy McChicken Sandwich.The verdict......I didn't like the McRib at all...blech!  The Sauce was the best part about it. Other than that, it was pretty bland.  The Fries were good of course....and the Spicy McChicken Sandwich was decent, not bad for $1.Overall, it was a complete waste of calories.  I'm not dinging McDonald's for my stupid curiosity, so they get 3 Stars.  The McDonald's experience was A-OK. Did I find value in my meal?  Not today....my fault though.Will I return?  I'd come back again to order something I enjoy.

Review Text :
I'm hesitant to review this because it's a small place and it's kind of a secret, tucked away on Bower Hill road between Scott, Upper St. Clair, and Bridgeville.  Alas, I'm a committed Yelper, and this place deserves every bit of 5 stars.The food is tremendous.  Wild Rosemary would be successful anywhere.  As Kerry D. mentions, get your reservations weeks ahead.  My mom has been trying to get us in while we are in town for a while now and it's always been booked.They do not serve alcohol, but it's a BYOB situation. I think they charged us like $10 corkage.  Totally worth it.  Stop by and pick up a great bottle of wine and prepare for a top-notch meal.  I'll attach photos of our plates.  You can see the care taken in every plate.  At the end of the evening the chef came out and was taking time at every table to introduce herself--a nice touch.The menu changes, but I think you can check online to see what's offered.PS: Rocket is a type of arugula salad.Cons:The food is very hit or miss. When you wait months for a reservation, the food better be delicious. It's expensive. Chicken prepared in a perfectly ordinary way with pantry staples should certainly not be over $30. Additionally, if you are paying that much for ingredients that are as a whole inexpensive, you'd expect to have a decent portion. Not quite. I had less than 5 bites of the protein I ordered in my meal. This happened each time. Finally, I ordered the pasta dish and that came in a more reasonable portion size. For reference, I'm not expecting gigantic portions or to even take leftovers home. I want to feel reasonably full at the end of my meal (especially when it includes appetizers, soup/salad, an entree, and dessert). Also, I'm not quite sure what it is, but I have been to WR 3-4 times. Each and every time I've had a major stomachache within a few hours after eating there. It could be the richness of the food, but I am not certain. I am not the only one to experience this though. Pros: Very small and secluded with a cozy ambience. There were very few tables and the service was excellent. The food did taste pretty good in general. Sometimes there were major let-downs in the preparation of the meat or the sides.  (There were times when it was inconsistent--see above)The pasta--it was wonderful. Amazing. Expensive, but really quite good. If you want good homemade pasta for a fraction of the price try La Tavola on Mt. Washington. Much better. BYOB would certainly be a solid pro.One of the things to love about WR is it is BYOB (more later on this).  Another is the food is usually great. However, it is noisy.  We were with friends that go to WR several times a year.  We started with the one appetizer that was some cheese and charcuterie.  Really enjoyable. The menu changes frequently, except for two items.  WR now has a winter/December menu that is interesting.   I had the Lamb Rack Lollies that were spiced and grilled perfectly and roasted beet carpaccio and sumac creme came with the Lamb.  The meat was prepared perfectly and tasted great. The beets and sumac creme were a nice compliment.  I did manage to get a bite of the Duroc Pork chop that was very good.  Again, a very well prepared meal.  Will WR is BYOB, we were charged $12 for the BYOB, I guess because we had two bottles at $6 per bottle.  That is to much, I understand you have to have glasses and clean the glasses but $12 is to much and not competitive.  Also, our server opened the wine but did not offer to pour the wine or have much contact with us.  Service was acceptable but not exceptional.  One thing that WR likes to do is make sure you get your meal and finish for the next seating, which I understand, but we felt rushed and were never told there was a time limit.  Actually, our friends said they tend to rush so lets not hurry and feel we have to order our main course immediately. Yes, I will go back but only with friends for a special occasion.  It is expensive and the food is good but noisy, noisy, noisy.

Review Text :
The beautiful Carin and I went to the Village this morning for our respective workouts...She hit the cardio machines hard and I played squash with my buddies.As I finished my last game with one of my buddies, Jim (who happens to be a cardiologist), he mentioned that I looked a little emaciated...peaked even, and prescribed chicken and waffles, "stat" (stat is a medical term that means "with extra butter, syrup and a side of grits":)Fortunately for me there is a new emergency location for Lolo's that has opened up altogether too close to my home:)Serendipity started to smile on me when we pulled up just as someone was leaving and we scored the parking spot right in front...serendipity continued as we put our name in for the 30 minute wait, only to be called after 15 minutes...and continued to weave it's way through the entire meal, as we got our drinks right away (really, is there much of anything better than a 1/2 gallon of sweet tea with your Saturday afternoon brunch?:), and we were waited on promptly and served right away.I was saved from wasting away:)I was particularly delighted for 2 reasons:     - This was only their second day open in Scottsdale and they were   absolutely slammed with both people eating at Lolo's and with take out orders, so it looked like the service was a little uneven...but the Lolo's staff were so darn nice to everyone, most of the customers seemed  to be pretty understanding:)     - This was Carin's first experience with Lolo's, and like all of her other "first times" with me, I wanted it to be both "special" and "delightful"...I am a loving, thoughtful and caring husband:)We couldn't have asked for it to go any better, especially for going by so soon after they opened:)The chicken and waffles are every bit as good as the original location down on Yuma:)...Carin has fallen in love with Lolo's, too:)The decor in the new place is pleasant...welcoming and comfortable...I love the wash tub lighting treatments:)And the staff continues to be pleasant (trending toward sweet as pie) to everyone...they could have been pretty tight-faced today, because they really did have a ton of people (all looking to get their chicken and waffle on) come by Lolo's today.I wasn't expecting to give these guys 5 stars right out of the gate, but doggone it, they earned it!Great food, great atmosphere, nice people and now, right in the hood:)I wonder if Jim is going to send me a bill for the medical advice? :-)I ride my bike to work.  Today I was running a little bit later than I usually do.  I had the slightest of hangovers, so getting out the door was a bit more delayed than is typical.I was riding my bike down Scottsdale Rd.  I've peaked in the window of Lo-Lo's before and I saw that it was under construction.  Today, I saw people standing around inside.  It was open.I decided, Fuck it.  I'm never late to work, so today I can be a few minutes behind schedule.  I still made it to work on time, but I set down a Styrofoam box next to my computer with chicken and waffles.The waffles have a taste of cinnamon to them and they're super buttery and delicious.  The chicken is not the best chicken I've ever had, but the best chicken I've ever had was so good that if I told you how good it was, you would simply assume that I was exaggerating.The chicken is damn good though.  The recipe that they use is very much complimented by using a splash of Louisiana hot sauce.  It was phenomenally bomb.I stared out the window, watching the clouds loom in the distance and raindrops spit down the glass... all the while chewing on a chicken bone and feeling my hangover dissolve into genuine comfort.In order to arrange a upcoming UYE "Butter Party " , Jim , Audrey, Donald , Amy B , Heather  and myself set up a little waffle exploration meeting.  For the good of the order we met up to partake in the phenomenon known as "waffles and chicken ". To be fully prepared for the UYE we ate to our hearts content . I have to be honest and not lie, that I fully loved every scrumptious morsel. From the yummy waffle, tasty chicken , to the  yummy cornbread  it was all good.. but the highlight of my eating was the macaroni and cheese ...creamy , sublime , rich , crusty in places, sharp cheese laced, man ,I really like that stuff. I didn't know if I should share the delicious treat with my family or squirrel it away in my purse to savor later.   Kids loved it , waffles and fried food goes over big in our family. The service was exceptionally good, courteous , well thought out , and  made the place. Decor is a bit of whimsy with homey flair . Bright and airy , fresh and  comfortable.  Love the big old mason jars for drinks , nice down home touch, folks .  We met the manager who was very nice and willing to make all of our UYE dreams come true. She also informed us that they will be opening soon for the late night crowd from 5pm-3am. Simply can't wait to go back.... Anybody busy tomorrow?************************WEAR BIG PANTS************************I had never had chicken and waffles together.  In fact, I don't think I've even had fried chicken outside of KFC and Hungry Man (I guess women don't get hungry?).  For a meal that did not involve a tortilla, I was pleasantly surprised.I went with the Betty Boop, a breast and a waffle.  The chicken was juicy and perfectly fried to a crisp golden brown.  The waffle was delicious, although maybe I wish it were just a little crispier on the outside.  But the cinnamony goodness was complimented by a nice baseball-sized scoop of butter and plenty of syrup.  Of course, I had to have the mac & cheese, too.  It was some of the best I've had in a restaurant (I'm a little partial to Kraft I'm afraid to admit).  We had a large group, and the staff was very accommodating and friendly.    But word of warning, they don't split checks for large groups and will only process two transactions per table (two credit cards or cash and one credit card).  Luckily I planned ahead and brought cash...and wore big pants.I went to the new LoLo's location with other fellow yelpers to check this place out.  I had been to the location downtown and wasnt all that impressed with what I had seen, so I thought I would give it another chance.  This one was a much better time.Upon entering, said parties were already seated.  I was happy to say that my experience here was much better then before.  This place is actually clean!  and has decent parking!  and, as a bonus, the service was substaintially better then the one downtown.  Same menu, same tasting food, but a better experience.When coming here, expect to wait.  This place is super popular, and tasty.  Be prepared to eat!!While I was waiting for my food at the counter, I had to try the last piece of red velvet cake that had been staring me down and calling my name. Verdict: the BEST Red Velvet cake I have ever tasted!!!But I digress, my first taste experience upon entering Lolo's this Sunday morning with my husband, was the refreshing homemade lemonade served in a large mason jar. It really is the best lemonade, better than any I have ever had the pleasure to drink, even my own homemade lemonade does not compare.  I quickly downed half a jar and then was promptly offered a refill. Customer service is alive and well at Lolo's. What brough us to Lolo's was the fried chicken, so needless to say we were filled with anticipation and can tell you that it is worth the trip. It is the best fried chicken west of the Mason/Dixon line! The mac and cheese was wonderful as were the sweet potatoes. Let's not forget the grits...yummy! The corn muffin was the "icing on the cake" (if you don't count the scrumptious red velvet cake icing!)We drove home and promptly devoured the red velvet cake and then took a nap. In short, a perfect way to spend a lazy Sunday. Starting September 11th they will serve dinner and be open until 3:00AMSave money!  Eat at Lolo's!  Go here for an early lunch and you are set for the day!  Perhaps a small snack 6-8 hours later but that's pretty much it!My second visit to Lolo's didn't quite measure up to the first visit...and still it was 4 stars.Great company with a group of Yelpers and my family too!Seriously, I was full 6 hours after eating here.I've never been to either Lolo's location until today.  I'm not a huge fried chicken person, particularly not for breakfast, but i ordered up a Betty Boop and buckled in for the full experience.  Bottom line: best fried chicken I've ever had.  The waffle was pretty great as well.  I sampled two sides - the fried okra didn't knock my socks off, and by the time i got around to trying the mac and cheese, i was too full to appreciate the creamy cheesiness.  it was really good, though.  The service was great, I was quite pleased on that front.  I was a tad worried that a great local place that knows that they've really made it would have a bit of an attitude, but i didn't get any of that from the people who served our table.  five stars on that front (other than the fact that the drink orders were served to the middle of the table - i don't consider that a deal-breaker).Speaking of drinks, I recall a recent "twitter" or status update in which someone noted that she was looking for a bathtub full of ice cold lemonade or something similar.  I'm fully prepared to go a few steps farther.  I would willingly give up seafood if all the world's oceans were made of Lolo's ice cold Arnold Palmer, in perfect proportion.  It's that good.  And it can't be much more sticky than the nasty saltwater those oceans have now, right?  plus that stuff tastes disgusting.anyway, i cannot tell you how excited i am for the night hours that begin next friday at this location only.  every friday night, this Lolo's will re-open at five and remain open until THREE the next morning.  I don't care if I have to walk from downtown phoenix (where i usually do most of my weekend drinking), the people-watching here is going to be epic.  (oh, wait, those are the people i came in with.  funny i don't recognize them in the light...)  i can't wait.I've been hesitant to review Lolo's. I know everyone creams their pants upon its mere mention, but I really don't. I don't like fried chicken at all, and I'm generally too hungover in the morning to eat anything besides a gallon of gatorade, so I was afraid my review might only be relevant to a specific audience. Namely: Me.But I wanted to review the Scottsdale location since I just went last weekend and have also been to the Phoenix location, so I figured the differences between the two might be worth pointing out. They both have good food, endearing servers, and awesome atmosphere. The differences are subtle, but noticeable. For instance, at the Phoenix location you get an ice cream scoop of warm, melty butter on your waffle. At the Scottsdale location you get a spoonful of cool, hard butter. I realize that waiting 5 minutes would solve this problem, but who has time to wait while there is a delicious breakfast pastry sitting right in front of your face?Basically, everything was just a little different. Though this may have been in part because Coda B. and I split a 3 piece and he stuck me with the thigh.  Bastard.  He liked the grits better here but again, I liked them better at the other location.  Main reason: Not enough butter. I am in a race against time and if you think I'm going to die as a 95 year old healthy person you have another think coming. All of my decisions shave years off of my life, and I wouldn't have it any other way.They did have an awesome little gospel band there because it was Sunday. So I left feeling that much closer to God. And not just because I felt like i might have a cholesterol induced heart attack at any moment. I would say if you're not generally a fried chicken fan, I don't think Lolo's will blow your mind. If you want an awesome breakfast experience go to the Lolo's in Phoenix. If they're too busy, come to this one.Same great Lolo's fried chicken and waffles without the risk of getting stabbed or shot... and it WAS worth the risk to visit their South Phoenix location on occasion. The food is that good, it might even be the ultimate in comfort food! Lucky for us they have a new Scottsdale location where the most dangerous situation you could encounter might be a hungover Scottsdale "clubber" (who could scratch you with their Ed Hardy bling).The only suggestion I have for them is to drop the prices about 25%They tried to make me go to rehab, I said Lo, Lo, Lo..So it's Friday night, it's getting late, and there's a rumble in your tummy, where to go? Before you'd might hit up some fast food joint and regret it in the morning. Say good bye to those greasy drive-thru burgers and say hello to some down home soul food lovin' at the new location of Lolo's Chicken and Waffles.Situated at the corner of Scottsdale and Thomas in what used to be a Kyoto Bowl, this is a welcome location to the neighborhood. It's the same delicious menu as the Yuma Street location and for me, just as tasty and deeply satisfying. Ordering the Lolo's Soul Food Platter ($13) is all about eating way too much way too late but with food this good I wouldn't order anything else. Your choice of fried chicken or fish plus 2 sides and cornbread, can be split between 2 healthy eaters and will be plenty to fill the tummy and the soul. The chosen 3 plump pieces of fried chicken, are so fantastically seasoned, and when smothered in gravy and onions is pretty much addictive pleasure. The sides are fantastically delicious, including the mac & cheese which is so rich and cheesy you'll probably order it every time. The collard greens are wonderfully tender and bursting with bitter sweet goodness. Dinner here just isn't complete without ordering you a hot buttery waffle ($4) to accompany your fried chicken. The tender sweetness of the waffle works really well with each savory bite of fried chicken, so much so that you might wake up early to come back for breakfast.Who knew how these 2 components, which sound like such strange bedfellows, would work so well together? It really is a beautiful thing.First off.. back home (Northern California) I have to go to either Oakland OR Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles in LA to get anything decent (I live in Santa Cruz... aka either a 5 hour drive or a 1 1/2 hour drive to get some southern goodness). This was on my list of places to go since our SBCer transplant got an ROTD at the other location.  Honestly, for me personally the chicken and waffles were average *ducks and covers*  The waffles had little flavor and the chicken was meh....I will stick with Roscoe's down in LA.The sides however were ridiculously bomb: The grits were cooked perfectly to our liking and were served with a big #$cking thing of butter.. amen...amen. The home potatoes were light, crispy and well seasoned. The collard greens were by far the best I have had in a minute..they were not too salty... not super soppy/mushy and came in the perfect sized bowl. Drinks came in a jam jar and once half consumed we were asked if wanted it either in a to go drink container (GENIUS!) or if we wanted more... I knew we had a drive with no real established potty so we declined.Clean establishment with an autograph wall in the back (very cool). Service was good.... no complaints.Okay... I love LoLo's. I think it IS better than Roscoe's. I live for their Red Velvet Cake. I DO love most of their food and usually the service is great... so why the two stars? Because I'm not a fan of THIS location. and here's why...- The crazy hours. I never know WHEN this place is open, sometimes the sun isn't even set and it's closed and other times I go by and late at night and they're open. It's very inconsistant and frustrating. - The loud azz sound system blaring in the background makes it hard for me to hear the person I'm dining with. So usually we just eat in silence while the music plays on.- The food simply isn't as good as the original location. Everything is a subpar immitation. The chicken is usually overcooked and the waffles lack that certain crunch or crispiness. - and my own personal reason - I had hit up Lolos on twitter and said they should have a separate to-go menu and I even said on twitter that we were dining at the counter and it was way facinating to watch the food come from the window. Which it was. I liked it, they were cranking it out and were having a good time when in comes this manager who started barking out orders and basically bullying the staff. I thought it was unfair. and then I got the bill... and was misbilled. I told the waitress who didn't do anything about it and ran my card. I asked her to fix it before running my card - she didn't. I didn't sign my ticket and asked the bully of a manager (who was bald with a tan shirt on June 10th) and then shrugged off my complaint and didn't change it. He didn't even look at it. I was astounded. I didn't know what to do - so I entered my tip and signed my ticket and vowed to never return to the Scottsdale location. oh and before we left, the Bully of a Manager asked me if I wanted a to-go menu, I said yes, thinking it was so serendipidous but when he handed me a regular menu with this shitty look and scarcastic tone he said that THIS WAS their to-go menu... and that's when I knew... he had read my tweets. I didn't mean any disrespect, honestly. It WOULD be awesome if they had a to-go or catering menu. There will be feedback from customers. And I don't care HOW good your food is, nothing warrents such rudeness to a PAYING customer. I think success had gone to the manager's head and they forgot how to keep it real - one of the drawbacks of being "Hood-rich" as the waitstaff's t-shirts declare. To my yelpers I say: Be careful of what you tweet. The manager at the Lolo's Scottsdale location is sensitive so perhaps you should just save your opinion for yelp. And as for the food... imagine you found Lolo's recipe book... and you tried to make yourself a little feast, you did everything EXACTLY as it says, but it misses something... some pizazz, some flavor, some... soul? You will have the Scottsdale location's food down! Stay away from the Scottsdale location. i will keep to the Downtown location where they keep it realI've been on a real bender lately...and this Fried Chicken was worth it!...I got the Betty Boop which is a huge fried chicken breast with a super fresh and tasty waffle...the chicken was juicy, moist and perfectly fried!  I smothered my waffle in the butter and syrup and need I say more...this was paradise!  I complimented my meal with a super sized mason jar of red koolaid and it was the perfect thing to wash this meal down with!  You have to get the Red Velvet cake it's a must have!!! This is a super fun place to go!Well where do I start.....I didn't know what to really expect when I came to this establishment....but it compared very favorable to the world famous Roscoe's Chicken & Waffles in Los Angeles. We waited about 15 minutes to be seated because this locale is always crowded and there is always a wait. When we got seated we were immediately approached by a server to take our drink orders. I had the homemade lemonade which they call "Dranks" at this location....LOL....I loved that. The jars are huge that the drinks come in and while the refills are free....I didn't even need one.I ordered a dish called the "Betty Boop" which is a juicy all white meat chicken breast....and perhaps the BEST WAFFLE I HAVE EVER HAD. Now there are a lot of great "Soul Food" items on the menu but the Fried Chicken and Waffles you must try without question. If it is not the BEST WAFFLE you have EVER put in your mouth please write me and let me know because I guarantee you will LOVE the waffles. The service was second to none....I mean every few minutes someone was checking on us....it was like having a maid....butler....and housekeeper while you just sat back and enjoyed your meal and the experience. One of the nice ladies there even lowered the blinds for us sitting in booths with our backs to the sunlight so we could cool off.....I mean wow....that was so nice of her. Now I don't about the location in Phoenix....but this one in Scottsdale is fantastic. The parking is a bear because it is located in a strip mall.....but all-in-all it is not to terrible. Like I said I am always skeptical about "Southern Food" that is not served in the south per say....but again this is MUST DO chicken....WAFFLES....and soul food dining at it's best. So if your ever near Old Town Scottsdale.....take a short drive over to N Scottsdale Rd and Thomas and pay a visit to LO-LO's. Remember while your there to Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!!make sure you enjoy your waffles and chicken onsite. it doesn't taste nearly as good heated up at home.weekends are busy so try to go during non-peak times in the evening.tourists: servers are sassy and the waffles are one of the top ten you'll ever taste!This review is PURELY based on service. I typically try not to do entirely service oriented reviews but this last visit was unacceptable. To preface this, I have always been a huge fan, I bring visiting family, force it on co-workers, etc. My earlier 5 star review was even featured here on Yelp. I have been there easily once every other month for the last 3 years. I even pick up the chicken for camping trips (cold Lolo's chicken and beer is heavenly). My wife and I were at the one in Scottsdale on Sunday (managed to get a babysitter so we could hit brunch there sans-kids). We arrived at 9:20am so I was fully expecting a LONG wait. We actually got seated right away and ordered coffee and water. The server came back with the water and told us the coffee was brewing and took our order. After about 15minutes a different server stopped by and said our food wouldn't be too much longer. This was OK since I knew they would be busy and it would take awhile, no problem. I did ask if we could get the coffee we ordered. He said the coffee machine was broken and they were trying to fix it. I mentioned it really sucked having it break in the middle of their breakfast rush. He said it had actually broken they day before and that lots of people wanted coffee (crazy right?). At this moment I thought, that's odd, I thought it was brewing... oh well....Well, not being one to complain, I worked in restaurants for years during college, but also not being one to enjoy waffles without coffee I opted to run across the parking lot and grab a couple coffees from Einstein bagels for the wife and I. I came back with the coffee and before I got to the door one of the servers popped out and said, "Sorry, no outside food or drink". He was very polite, but I said maybe this could be a special circumstance since their coffee machine had been broken since yesterday and we couldn't get any. He said no. I asked if we could just pour it into their mugs, he said no. I asked if we could switch to an outside table, he said no. I said I would like to speak to a manager and could he please go tell my wife to change our order to go since I couldn't go back inside. He went inside and came back and said the manager said no also. I was in shock. I could NOT believe this was their response. I went to the car to put the coffees down so I could text my wife and tell her to just leave the order and we would go somewhere else.  Unfortunately by that time she had paid and had the food. So, that's it Lolo's, I refuse to give you another dollar. That was unacceptable. And seriously? What kind of place doesn't have a backup plan for coffee on a Sunday morning? You couldn't send someone out to Target to pickup some cheap coffee makers for the morning? Or rent one from a catering company? Or worst case scenario just order a massive batch from Einsteins? Instead you opt to tell people they don't get coffee and won't and if they get their own somewhere else they have to leave?  FAILThis place was recommended by people at work so checked it out yesterday, and I was not disappointed. I started off with the richest, most moist Red Velvet cake I've ever had. Was so rich, that I only was able to eat 1/3rd of the slice. I went with the "Betty-Boop" plate which consisted of 1 breast and 1 waffle. Perfect portion. I'm no master chef, but I believe I tasted a bit of cinnamon or some kind of spice in the waffle- it was very delicious. The fried chicken was my favorite part if the meal. I took advantage of the Chile vinegar as well as the Louisiana hot sauce. I also love they serve Kool-aid here. The prices are decent- not too cheap, not too expensive.  Overall, I would love to come back and would recommend this place to anyone who likes some good fried chicken.Finally made it to a Lo-Lo's!  Met up with some folks for the Yelp Breakfast Club's first meeting.  I had the Stupid Fries which were very good.  I will have to go another time to try the chicken and waffles which were receiving high marks from everyone else at the table.  Service was good.  We got there early enough on a Sunday so we didn't have to wait for seating.  They only seat complete parties and don't split checks so bring cash for a group.  They do provide a receipt identified by seating position.Just as delicious as all the hype warrants, and impeccably clean. This is hangover food at its finest. Played hookey from work and came here with a rager of a headache, like a crippling debilitating hangover. Lo-Lo's put the kibosh on that noise real fast. The fried chicken is succulent and moist, the skin has the perfect texture of crunch and a savory spiced coating. Their signature homemade hot sauce is just the right accompaniment to the fried chicken and must needs be slathered all over the fried bird, leaving you, your table, and your face a hot mess. Again I have to reinforce how clean and tidy the place was, you'd think there would be grease and chicken bits all strewn about as hungry patrons devour their selections of fried chix but nuh-uh, spotless. Service was fast and friendly to boot. I have to mention that the waffles, while not anything especially great, were certainly not bad either, piping hot and fluffy, with a fat glob of butter and saccharinely sweet syrup they are what a decent waffle should be.I didnt get to try their famous red velvet cake, but hey, that's reason enough to come back for me.(Lyrics - Spice Girls - I Wannabe)LoLo!, I'll tell you what I want, what I really really wantLoLo tell me what you want, what you really really wantLoLo!, I'll tell you what I want, what I really really wantLoLo tell me what you want, what you really really wantI wanna, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna reallyReally, really want some Chicken & WafflesIf you want some cool-aid, get some on tapIf you wanna get some breakfast, better make it lastNow don't go wasting these pieces of chickenGet your appetite together, and we will be just fine.LoLo!, I'll tell you what I want, what I really really wantLoLo tell me what you want, what you really really wantLoLo!, I'll tell you what I want, what I really really wantLoLo tell me what you want, what you really really wantI wanna, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna reallyReally, really want some Chicken & WafflesLo-Lo's Chicken and Waffles has been around the Phoenix are for quite some times and has been a local favorite for many reasons.  Chicken and waffles? Yes, indeed it is a deadly combination!  If you ever need to carbo load I tell ya this is your place.  I generally can't eat a lot so I opt out on the sha-bang of 3 pieces of chicken, 2 waffles, grits, 2 eggs, and cheese.  Yeah tell me about it!  That's a lot of food!  Yummy though!  I go for the Shee-dah's Special; 1 breast, wing, and waffle.  Overall, I love it!  Nice succulent chicken and syrup induced waffles!  By god, what have you done to us!  I can't complain about obesity problems in America especially when you come to Lo-Lo's; instead embrace it haha!  I did indeed tried the Kool-Aid on tap.  Personally, I don't think I can handle so much sugar in a beverage!  Once you take a swig; you're thirsty for water!In the end, Lo-Lo's deliver what they say; Chicken & Waffles.  Service is real attentive and overall the food is a must try if you never had chicken & waffles! - Enjoy!Sorry but Lo-Lo's is highly overrated. I don't know where to even begin with Lo-Lo's... I guess I will start by saying I will never be back! The food is OVERRATED. Anyone who can actually cook will tell you that their fried chicken isn't even close to die for. It's just average fried chicken. Their collard greens are garbage as well. The greens from Honeybears aren't even that good but those definitely trump Lo-Lo's. The Mac and Cheese sucks! I know I am not the only one who thinks that too. Serving sizes are not generous at all. And the price is way too expensive. The service is about as average as it gets. Maybe this is due to the fact that the servers are always so busy but most act like the could give two shits about their tip. The WAIT is horrendous. It's always at minimum a 35 minute wait for my party. Not to mention if anyone shows up who is consider a "somebody" they will usher them past everyone right to their table.Anyways, I hate to hate but the main reason that this place is so successful is because the have entered into a niche market in the valley. It's not because of their food, service, or management. Pros-lots of seating-great drinksCons-Service-Food-Wait times-atmosphere-Too expensive-overall unfriendly staff"Everybody Want A Piece of My ChickenSouthern Fried ChickenFinger Lickin' "-- Ms Peachez These are the words that ring in my head every time I know I'm going to get some Fried Chicken & Waffles(C&W); for those who don't know what I'm talking about, do me a favor and search YouTube for: "Ms Peachez". Go ahead, I'll wait... Pretty funny, eh? Anyways, I'm always down to grub on some C&W and after seeing the solid reviews for Lo-Lo's Chicken & Waffles (LLCW) I knew I had to make a stop here on my tour de Arizona. Fortunately, their Scottsdale location is less than 1-mile from Scottsdale Stadium and I leapt at the opportunity.Sides:Cornbread- This is a pretty tasty Northen-style Cornbread and for only $1/each you can't beat that deal with a stick! One of my dining companions loved it so much he ordered one for the road! 4*Entrées:#8 DD: x2 Fried Chicken Breasts and Waffle- The chicken coating was crispy and tasty, but the chicken itself was a bit dried-out. The Waffle was nice and crisp but I would've preferred it to be thicker--however the taste was very good. Overall, not as good as Lillie Mae's back in San José but it hit the spot. 3*-Chicken/4*-WafflePuffs Chicken Tender Basket- I was a bit disappointed to see that LLCW doesn't have a children's menu; so, I had to order my 3-year-old an adult meal, which is OK -I suppose- who doesn't love leftovers? This came with 3 Chicken Tenders and Fries and he gobbled it up pretty well. 4*-Lance RatingDrinks- All you have to know is they have Kool-Aid, and they serve the Purple flavor (aka Ghetto Grape). 'Nuff said. 5*Service & Ambiance- Service from our waiter, Carl, was terrific! He was super-friendly, helpful and on top of things. LLCW is a really chill diner-style atmosphere that's kept clean and has some neat chicken paraphernalia decorating the place. 5*-Service/4*-AmbianceValue- Pretty decent value and a bit cheaper than Lillie Mae's; we paid a little under $15/head for a copious amount of food and drinks. 3*I really like LLCW and I'd probably rate it at a solid 3.5-stars, but the friendly service, great atmosphere, and fun menu will give it that 4-star bump. My only wish is they would get a children's menu and then they'd really have something. Irregardless, I'd still give it a hearty recommendation.

Yabba, Dabba, Doo! :-)http://tinyurl.com/45psjkThat's what I thought the first time we strolled into Fred's at Barney's in Scottsdale Fashion Square (BTW, anyone have any idea why they call it "Scottsdale Fashion Square"?...It's not a Square...it may or may not be Fashionable, too close to call...It is in Scottsdale...so, maybe 1  1/2 out of 3? :-)How wrong I was about the origin of the name, and how very happy I am to have found one of the best little restaurant and bar combo's in all of Scottsdale.The place is actually named for Barney's son, Fred (also apparently long departed, like Barney, for the great cocktail lounge in the sky:)But I'm still here and while I am, I will take every opportunity I get to soak up the cocktails, food, ambiance, service and convivial chatter at Fred's:)Fred's is as pleasant a place to dine as anyplace I've found in Scottsdale...the food and cocktails are excellent, the service is as good as anywhere in town, the room itself is both comfortable and sophisticated (overlooking scenic Scottsdale Rd....although the décor and scenery inside is also delightful...esp. at lunch during the week...if there is a larger gathering of attractive women in a single place at noon, I don't know where it would be:)... and the people...they are all first string...everyone at Fred's is a delight, from the hostesses and wait staff, to Richie the Barman (more about our pal, Richie later), and the managers of Fred's:)After working all morning and finally finishing things up for 2009, it was time for a cocktail:)The Beautiful Carin and I dropped by Fred's to ring in the New Year (at least it was midnight in Minsk, Prague and London while we were there:)That's right, we closed Fred's down, yesterday...at 5:00 pm:)We sat at the bar and had some delightful afternoon snacks and several cocktails as we chatted and laughed with Richie, the bar manager (and the Best Barman in Arizona:) and several other afternoon revelers (including the guys who put together all of Barney's "look and feel"...incredibly talented guys:)More about Richie...Richie is simply the best barman I've encountered here in Scottsdale...he's a certified genius at creating cocktails that are both imaginative and tasty...the 007 martini, the Pomegranate Lemon Drop (Richie's Special), his brand new Blueberry...10 oz's. of ice cold, alcoholic pleasure in a glass:)...and Richie is the kind of guy that makes me feel like I'm in Manhattan, sitting in the bar at the Waldorf, helping the barman solve the problems of the world...he can talk about anything and he's got that great NYC personality:-)Even more than the cocktails, the atmosphere is stylish and sophisticated...something that other bars and restaurants try for, but can't (quite frankly) match...again, Fred's feels more like Manhattan than Scottsdale...and that is the right atmosphere for this marvelous little spot:)David (the GM) has put together a very talented team of the best and brightest from a number of high end establishments in the Valley of the Sun and essentially given them free reign..."Here's the framework, create what you want and the customers will come".The result is an interesting menu and top notch execution (where even the Club Sandwich and Pomme Frites both have interesting and subtle notes), where everything is made with fresh local ingredients and obvious care and attention to detail:)No kidding, even the chicken wing appetizer is spectacular!...(you should see the "ladies who lunch" hoover those little bad boys down...delightful:-)Fred's just charms me:)So, I think I can be forgiven for my little bit of whimsy (you know, the Flintstones thing:) because Fred's (and Barney's, by extension) inspire a little bit of whimsy...especially after two or three of Richie's signature martinis:)Yabba, Dabba, Doo!!Scottsdale Fashion Square Shrimp Salad.  That's what I ordered both times I lunched at Fred's and both times I was extremely satisfied!  I was also impressed with the friendly and attentive service and the welcoming, fun atmosphere of the restaurant.I must admit, I was hesitant to eat at Fred's - I had an image of snooty staff and crazy expensive menu items.  But this image in my head was proved wrong when I went in for happy hour several months ago; i had a very pleasant experience.  And then with so many four and five star Yelp reviews, I just had to make my way back for lunch!Try their flavored iced tea - it's really refreshing and tasty... and the fresh bread they serve adds just the right carb deliciousness to the meal. I recommend dipping it in the olive oil on the table.I look forward to returning to Fred's for brunch and/or dinner. And while I overheard someone say that Fred's has the best Creme Brulee in the world, that Meyer Lemon Square sounds more up my alley!***Oh, and a pointer for those that don't want to be tempted to shop at Barney's if you decide to dine at Fred's.  Park out front on the Camelback side of the building and go straight to Fred's via the elevator outside. It's worked for me so far... it's a treat enough to dine at Fred's (as it will cost you a pretty penny).11/30/102.5 stars.Came for happy hour, but didn't find anything on the happy hour food menu I wanted to try, so I ordered a medium Emilia Romagna pizza (mozzarella, parmesan, and 12-year balsamic vinegar- Aceto Balsamico).  Can't recall what the price was on this pizza, but it was probably around the $14 range.  The pizza came a bit too charred on the bottom, and the very thin-crust didn't stay crispy for very long, perhaps just 5 minutes, and definitely soggy by the 10-minute mark.  While I enjoyed the slice I had at the restaurant, the leftovers proved to be too salty when I tried to re-heat the pizza at home, so I had to toss the rest- not economical for the price, I'm sorry to say.  I only ate a slice at Fred's, bec. I wanted to try the cobbler-of-the-day, which was the apple cobbler topped w/ Haagen-Daaz ice cream (if I recall correctly).  Had to order it sans powdered sugar (corn allergy), and I found it good, and not too sweet.  I'd try their other cobblers, too, if they didn't come at a high cost ($9, plus the ice cream has corn syrup in it- corn allergy).  I'd also like to try the profiteroles, but they, too, come w/ a $9 tag, which means $4.50 per profiterol- I believe I'd asked how many came in a dish and was quoted two...Don't be fooled by the scowl that the bouncer-type bartender constantly has on his face-- he actually was nice to talk to, at least the first time I spoke to him.  A couple of friends and I went there after a mixer about a month ago, and he was unapproachable, and projected himself to be too busy to do more than to come over and take our order.  No hellos and how-are-yous that night- such a big turn-off, and w/ a high-priced menu, I don't think I'll come by again.(I originally was going to rate 3 stars, but type it up as 2.5, but now that I've finished w/ my review, I'm going to go w/ 2 stars.  I wish you better experiences here yourself!)

Review Text :
So my closest 17 relatives and I were going to Vegas and I wanted to try to introduce them to some interesting food that they might not otherwise try. Talking to a group like that is like herding cats! MY GAHHHD!!! It was such a loooooong, painful process! I showed them pictures, menus, prices, and spent hours deciding what to eat for our 3 days in Vegas.While talking about our dining options, I often heard: "It's expensive!" "Buffet! Let's go to a buffet!" "That's such a small portion!" "Let's go to the Filipino restaurant!" "Umm...where else can we go?" GEEEEZZZZ. I wanted to end my misery so I gave up persuading them to eat somewhere else.PAN SEARED SCALLOPS - Yessss, oh yeeeees...These scallops were perfectly seared, fresh and tasty! The red wine sauce was so good that I actually ate all the brussels sprouts and parsnip pear pasta that came with it. The sauce had a tremendous flavor but it didn't cover up the scallopy flavor! Is "scallopy" a word? Well, it should be!Nothing else was as superb as the scallops, though.COMPLIMENTARY BREAD - They gave us so much! Unfortunately it wasn't fresh off the oven. I didn't even mind if it was recycled but at least heat it up! The olive oil/balsamic vinegar it came with was spicy and wasn't good. My family, on the other hand, must've liked it cuz they inhaled most of the bread and the olive oil, maybe because the entrees were taking too long.OSSO BUCCO - This was the special that night but it wasn't that special. The meat was fall-off-the-bone tender, it was alright but it was thirsty. I was not impressed with the risotto it came with either, it was a little tough. A little more water all around would be great!TIRAMISU - It was decent and that's all I can say about that.PANNA COTTA - Light, silky, creamy, yummy! But it was just like many a panna cotta I've had.SERVICE - Needs improvement! We were the only customers for a while and their service was so slow. Our entrees took about 45 minutes. It got even slower when more people came in. Our waitress was MIA for so long that we asked another waiter for the dessert menu. It took about 15 minutes for everyone to decide what to get and our waitress was still missing when we were ready to order. When we asked for our waitress the waiter replied, "She's busy." Uhh...how about us??? We didn't want to be late to the Cirque du Soleil show! So another waiter took our order. We finally saw our waitress again when she served our dessert.I was kind of disappointed that my family chose to eat here cuz there are so many other excellent restaurants in Las Vegas. It wasn't a total bummer because the scallops kicked serious ass, the panna cotta was good, and my family liked their dishes. So in the end I guess I didn't mind so much that we had dinner here, but I don't think I could be convinced to eat here again.The online menu on the Monte Carlo website they have is NOT current. So if you were hoping to have their seafood risotto or seared scallops appetizer like I was, well get ready to be disappointed. They have a winter menu now.My bf and I came here to celebrate his 25th birthday and mentioned that when we made our reservations but they didn't do anything to make us feel special. No dessert or anything whatsoever. The hostess did say 'happy birthday' as we were leaving.. I guess that's better than nothing at all. The service was extremely slow as we waited forever to get our checks, forever for them to pick up our payment, and then forever again to wait for them to return my credit card. I also asked our waiter what risotto they had for the night. He said he would ask the chef and never came back with the answer.Don't bother getting the trio of bruschettas. It was disgusting, especially the tomato one. It was mushy and the sauce they had underneath had a grainy texture. I took one bite and that was more than enough.The only positives I could think of was the sopressata pizza (4/5) we ordered and the chicken cannelloni (3.5/5). Our total came out to be around $51. There's no way I'm coming back. I just feel bad picking this restaurant to take my bf out on his big day...

Review Text :
Yes, the Aria in the new City Center is a very chic, very European, and very out-of-my-league-so-don't-bother-trying kind of place. So I would expect nothing but a tres-chic ice cream parlor in a hotel as fancy-schmancy as the Aria. With its perpetual video showing on the outside wall to draw you in, Sweet Chill is just that type of place in all its muted day-glo rainbow glory. Its clean, pinkish and slightly retro-look is meant to evoke an earlier time when people enjoyed sitting on plastic, butt-contoured chairs (see photos). It's as if Paris Hilton opened her own gelateria, bitches.They serve sandwiches and salads, but the eye candy is really the variety of ice cream flavors to be seen in their long glass display case. Prices are not surprisingly on the high side with a large cup a whopping seven bucks. Jamie W. and I shared a small cup of peanut butter gelato for the comparative bargain of $4.75 (see photo). I say bargain because you do get three small scoops which you can lick slowly to take in all the colors of the seats in the place. Eventually, the cacophony of pan-EuroAsian voices does make your ears bleed - and you have no choice but to leave and go back to your $80-a-night hotel way, way down the Strip.ICE CREAM - 4 stars...judging from the peanut butter, very creamy and tasty if a tad priceyAMBIANCE - 4 stars...chic while you lick with abandonSERVICE - 3.5 stars...a bit non-descript...it is a new placeTOTAL - 4 stars...stop for your sweet tooth and then do fifty laps in the Aria pool around the cornerCute, modern, pastel love-fest looking place.I requested a sample of the Carrot Cake, which was promptly handed over: white gelato, white spoon... and a black, curly hair.Truly, a Kodak moment.

Review Text :
The post-hike dinner has been a personal tradition. After my hiking trail adventure ends, my dining adventure begins. Today, after hiking up in the Sawmill trails of the Spring Mountains National Recreation Area, I set out for the Streets of New York. It was a logical choice. I am a New York transplant that loves his pizza and subs.    It took work to find the Streets of New York on account of the fact that the streets of northwest Las Vegas are so confusing in the vicinity of the US 95 and the 215 exits. Streets of New York is located in a pedestrianised street that looks like Town Square. In similar style to Town Square, customers can park on the Main Street or in a parking lot at the back of the building.    Streets of New York is a casual sit down restaurant with extended booths and tables where televisions showing professional sports provide entertainment. When I walked into the restaurant, the host and waitress invited me to sit anywhere. I'd chose a long booth. After hiking, I appreciated the comfort of the plush booth.    Now for the menu. I was hoping that they offered my favorite sandwich, which is an eggplant parmesan on toasted bread that the pizzerias on my streets of New York offer without fail. But not these Streets of New York. The menu features New York pizza where their customers have a variety of choices and sizes in pies and slices, sandwiches including pastrami, and the meatball parmesan sub. What truly reached from the Streets of New York to the heart of my soul was their broaster chicken. This is where I was aware I was on the streets to a rewarding dining adventure.   It was only recently that Chilly Jilly'z at the other end of the continent Boulder City turned me into a fan of broaster chicken. When I set eyes on Streets of New Yorks special menu of broaster chicken, my mind was set on the two piece white meat broaster chicken meal. It included a chicken breast and wing, a 4 ounce side that I picked coleslaw and two potato wedges. It was also supposed to include bread that they never gave me. Oh well! The food was so filling and tasty that I had forgot all about the bread. The chicken breast was a large portion where the chicken wing was sufficient. The two potato wedges were large. Regardless that the potato wedges tasted fine they fell short of Chilly Jilly'z, that up to the time of this review is the best that I ever had. The cole slaw was a nice size portion and tasted average. All this food wasn't bad for $6.25 before tax. But, I have to have a fountain drink with my dinner. Especially a post-hike dinner. The Cokes, that didn't have a dint of flatness and that the waitress refilled in a timely manner brought the dinner up to nearly $10 before the tip.   After my leading dining adventure at Streets of New York, there is still more adventure that awaits. I truly want to try their New York pizza. Maybe this is first-rate New York pizza. My dilemma is that there are miles of streets if Las Vegas to reach Streets of New York. However, sometime in the future I leaning toward a dining adventure in their Spring Valley location to explore their New York pizza.

Review Text :
We had dinner plans with friends on the calendar for over a month... When we made the plans, we said we'd figure out the time and place as the date approached.  So when my friend suggested we go to FnB, I hesitated for a moment..."What is FnB," I asked? (Embarrassed that I had no clue)."It's the new restaurant located where Sea Saw and Digestif used to be," my friend informed me."OK - Perfect," I responded - still having no clue what to expect.Jared and I were fans of Digestif and ironically, we happened to be there on the last night they were open.  We went in for dinner on Sunday, October 18th (the day after our wedding) and were shocked to hear the news... But enough about that!In just six weeks time, this restaurant transformed into FnB, the creation of Pavle Milic and Chef Charleen Badman.  It now has a bit more space and a warmer, lighter feeling to it... the tile on the floor is really unique and colorful.  You can tell it's a family-run business too... we felt extremely welcome from the moment we set foot inside and we met the entire staff, Emily, Josh, Pavle, Chef Charleen, and Sous Chef Sasha.But enough about the atmosphere and the fantastic staff, I'm sure you want to know about the food!The menu is limited, but pretty much everything on it is appealing.  Luckily, our table was up for sharing.  We started with two orders of the crispy rock shrimp & jalapeno tartar and a fried green tomato salad.  Both were delicious... I especially enjoyed the combination of the fried green tomatoes with green goddess dressing and feta.  We continued with the citrus marinated olives as an appetizer to share... they aren't kidding with the "citrus" description - you can really taste it and I loved it!Jared and I shared the boneless trout entree and our companions shared the roast jidori chicken entree and we all shared an order of the spigarello.  What's spigarello? It's similar to broccoli rabe but not quite as bitter.  Chef Charleen prepares it with garlic and chili and it's delicious!  Needless to say, we cleaned all of our plates!As if that wasn't enough, we proceeded to order one of each of the dessert offerings: a lemon creme brulee, an apple crisp, and the cherry chocolate bread pudding that Angela mentioned in her review.  The lemon brulee and the bread pudding were the favorites at our table.  And from listening to Pavle talk about it, I think the chocolate bread pudding is his favorite too!Oh, and I forgot to mention that I was the only drinker in our group last night... I had a glass of sauvignon blanc - one from Chile - and it was perfect.The prices aren't bad considering everything used at this restaurant is bought fresh daily from local farms.  We'll be back to see our friends at FnB again soon... and I encourage you to go check out this little gem of a restaurant as well!  Just make sure to save us a seat at the bar.I haven't had a full dining experience here yet, but I wanted to relay last nights delightful visit to FnB.  I swung by last night for dessert with the girls and FnB was packed. I love the decor and the new floor is exquisite and I think they've made it look a much lovelier dining experience all around, especially considering the space constraints. We waited a few moments at the door while Pavle and Co found us seats at the bar. Though we were there for sweets, Dottsy couldn't resist getting an order of the rock shrimp with jalapeno tartar sauce and god bless her. It was delightful! MMMM, now I want more of it...anyway, we went ahead and ordered 1 of each of the desserts on the menu (only 3 last night we're not animals). I ordered the apple ginger thingie (can't think of the name, sorry), Dottsy had the chocolate cherry bread pudding and Chrissy had the lemon creme brulee. The creme brulee blew me away, it was so delicate and lightly infused with lemon essence it was like a pillow of sugar deliciousness. The chocolate-cherry dessert was a mouth full of yum as well, and my apple ginger dessert was tasty, thought I like a bit more ginger zing in general. Ohh they are so good. The rest of the dinner menu looks fantastic as well. I will be back to test the rest of it out soon!I have to go w/ five.  I can still remember every, even the most subtle flavor, starting with the bread and oil, the Ginhound cocktail, followed by the salad (we chose the salad Pavle talked up, and we were not disappointed).  As we munched on the salad, I commented to my dining partner that we were eating a lot of grapefruit - both the Ginhound and the shaved fennel salad featured the fruit, but neither were overly bitter at all.  It was the ideal way to start the meal.We elected to carry on with the Spigarello (delicious- excellent balance of garlic and a slightly buttery taste) again per Pavle's recommendation, along with an order of the mozzarella w/ an egg over braised leeks.  This was my favorite dish (well, tied with the salad and dessert...).  The mustard breadcrumbs added a little tangy flavor along with a fantastic texture.  Finally, we decided to split the bread pudding dessert.  Made w/ chocolate/cherry bread from the Phoenician's bakery (available at the Old Town Farmer's Market in Scottsdale), it was decadent.  All in all a fantastic meal - everything was perfect.  The atmosphere, the service...  It was fantastic.  You won't regret going there.I love the special feeling of being greeted by Pavle and the ceremony of him checking to see if there's a space for me. (Of course, I've been able to get a seat each time, so that makes it especially alright) I love sitting at the bar and watching chef work her magic. She's so focused. If it weren't for her assistance in refilling my water glass, I would question that she knew I was there. Being able to watch the kitchen is one of many highlights at FnB, for me. The food is hauntingly good. It's been almost a week since my two visits and I still think of the lemon creme brulee and the cool way they "brand" the top to caramelize it. I can taste the chocolate cherry bread pudding in a way that I can recall the feel of the dense, soft, mild, chocolaty goodness and sweet cherry on my palate. I crave the refreshing goodness and beauty of the shaved fennel salad with lovely rounds of watermelon radish. The braised leeks were hearty and delicious! I want to work my way through the entire menu. I have already begun to prioritize my list. My only worry is they will have an alluring special to distract me and, if that were to happen, I would not lose sleep over it!Dearest FnB,I realize we have just met and I am putting a lot of weight on our first evening together...but I love you.  I have been infatuated before and I know this is so much more than that.Last night, even as I sat staring into your local produce, the sweetness of your grilled butternut squash still upon my lips, this poem was forming in my mind.  I know it is not original but a take off from the great Elizabeth Barrett Browning of the Romantic Movement.  To me it feels right and fitting that a great sonnet taken from among the best the world has to offer is an appropriate way to enumerate your intoxicating virtues:FnB, how do I love thee? Let me count the ways.I love thee to the depth and breadth and height of your menuMy palate can reach, when tasting out of sightFor the local produce being prepared in grace.I love thee to the level of every day's mealOk, that's enough romance.  When can I get with you again, FnB?  I must have you from the top of your delicate appetizers all the way through to your sweet and tender desserts.  You plied me with your cranberry infused vodka and zest of lemon, your spiced roasted nuts bursting with flavor again and again.Your crispy rock shrimp, flash-fried to tender perfection in their light and revealing cornmeal covering are etched upon my mind.  And the jalapeno tartar...you can be a spicy vixen indeed!  Your lovely salad of apple, celery root, walnuts and blue cheese was sublime in it's awakening flavors brought on by the simple vinegary coating, awakening in me the abiding desire to plough through your menu and consume you to your core.Yes, from there it rolled inexorably on to grilled butternut squash with pear and bacon, each bright flavor building on the next.  The fried green tomatoes were a revelation to us both (yes you had us both, you saucy wench) with their tart and delicate interiors exploding through the complimenting dressing and feta cheese with which you plied them.Oh yes!  And your flatiron steak...I don't often play with the red meat team but your presentation, your flavor...purple and cheddar cauliflower, caper and golden raisin salsa verde...enough I say, you overwhelm me with your generosity, you just give and give until...And your desserts!  I tremble at the thought of your chocolate bread pudding, macerated cherries all over with nary a care of what others may think!  Outstanding!As if all of this were not enough your service throughout the meal was warm and comforting.  To a member, I felt your staff was there to please me and me alone.But, Fnb, as in all healthy relationships, open and honest communication is tantamount to a wonderful and enduring relationship.  With that understanding I have the following constructive criticism.  I had to look deep within to find even the hint of a fault...your fried green tomatoes.  When my mother used to make them they were sliced more thinly and fried in a skillet...this made them delightfully crunchy on the outside.Oh my God, have I compared you to my mother?!  Freud be damned! Just forget that, and forgive me FnB.  I'll be back soon.In heartfelt adoration,Jim WI can't believe I forgot to write a review for FnB, I feel like I've been singing their praises since I first stepped foot into that welcoming atmosphere! First let me begin with how much of a joy it is just to meet Pavle Millic; he is by far the friendliest and most doting personality I have ever encountered. The menu is an interesting read, nothing that I would ever consider creating myself, but it all sounds intriguing. My first visit to FnB was with a group of foodie/wino friends and many of them had visited before. I let them recommend their favorites and then went and ordered the only items they didn't have covered, so we could try just about everything on the menu. I am SO glad I did, as I would've missed out on the best trout I have ever had... scratch that, probably the best fish I have ever had as a whole. I cannot begin to describe the symphony of flavors that Charleen has created in this trout dish, just try it... whether you like trout or not, just try it. That's not to say I wasn't impressed with the braised leeks in mozzarella with mustard bread crumbs and a fried egg on top... delish. The crispy rock shrimp and salads are also terrific.FnB also has an all-Arizona wine list which is why I was eager to support this place, but it goes so far beyond the locavore/locapour effort. Overall, dining at FnB is a wonderful experience with a comfortable atmosphere, amazing aromas, top-notch staff, and incredible flavors. I've stopped in several times just for a drink or dessert and it feels like I'm walking in to visit family. Someday I'll make it in for the late night specials... they tempt me every time!1/30/10Came in for dinner.  My second time at this location (the first was when it was the newly-transferred Digestif during Yelp Eats Week).  What a great transformation from a dark, smoky venue to a warmer, much-more inviting space- thanks to those b/w and prismatic floor tiles!My EXCELLENT meal consisted of table bread and basil olive oil; the marvelous and perfectly cooked flat-iron steak, medium to medium-rare (cauliflower, golden raisin salsa verde); and the stupefyingly-addiciting puff pastry Chef Charleen created that night w/ AZ pecans, vanilla ice cream, and Wild Turkey caramel sauce (corn-free!!).  I had to muster up all of my willpower to sock-away half of the steak (the raisin salsa verde made this dish a winner!) for my Mom to try at home (she's hard-to-please, but LOVED the leftovers), so that I could demolish the pastry creation :)  [I just recently found out I'm allergic to pecans, but y'know, this dish is so good, I'd definitely keep it in mind on my next visit when considering my dessert options!]While still enjoying in the aftermath of such a wonderful meal, I was pleasantly surprised to find that my table ticket arrived w/ a small chunk of homemade toffee crunch.  However, this lovely-looking sweet contained an allergen or two, so Charleen switched it w/ a two-bite chocolate chocolate chip cookie.  What a sweet way to wish me good night!Yelp Eats/Restaurant Week, where are you??As we arrived at FnB we immediately felt right at home. There was a faint smell of toasted marshmallows in the air and the hustle and bustle of Chef Charlene Badman's small open kitchen felt like being at mom's. The warm glow of owner/manager Pavle Milic's face fortified the welcome feeling.Short for Food and Beverage, FnB seems to have everything aligned for culinary greatness. With food and service worthy of a long-established restaurant, you'd be surprised that FnB has been open only a few months.Located in Old Town Scottsdale, the space formerly housed the famed Sea Saw. The bar surrounds the small open kitchen, with views of Badman and Sous Chef Sacha Levine working their magic. Or, if romance is in the air, opt for a table for two. FnB is cozy and intimate.Farm fresh, seasonal and comforting describe Badman's creative and fun menu. Even something as simple as Citrus Marinated Olives ($4) just tastes better with a touch of orange peel.The menu is not large, with only a handful of nibbles, appetizers, sides and entrees. On one visit, our knowledgeable waiter didn't even bat an eye when we ordered just about everything on the menu.Lightly dusted in semolina flour then flash fried, each crustacean of the Crispy Rock Shrimp and Jalapeno Tartar ($9) has a nice feathery crunch. Fried Green Tomatoes with Green Goddess Dressing and Feta ($11) combines classic components, yet brings something new and balanced to the table.Braised Leeks, Mozzarella, Mustard Bread Crumbs and a Fried Egg ($13) are as simple as they sound, but tastier than you'd imagine. This is the beauty of Badman's cooking: farm-fresh produce prepared with love and attention.Since it is based on seasonal bounties, the menu is always changing, so don't be surprised when your favorite dish is no longer available. During several visits I had the opportunity to try something new each time.Try not to fall in love with the pasta offering -- on one visit the pasta was a Garganelli and other times it was Strozzapreti ($19). Both were perfect, cooked al dente and served with local veggies.Blue Nose Bass, Snap Peas, Hazelnuts and Citrus Sauce ($21) was fresh and light, yet meaty and satisfying.Roast Jidori Chicken ($20) sounds like a cooking preparation, so I was surprised that it's actually a breed of Japanese chicken. Smaller than your standard chicken, it's amazingly flavorful and juicy. As one of my dining mates put it, "It tastes how chicken used to taste." Each succulent bite reminded me of how simple ingredients in expert hands can be so fulfilling.Grilled Broccoli, Meyer Lemon Aioli and Crispy Onion ($6) is one of the sides. The smokiness of the slight char on the broccoli is alluring and adds an exotic dimension to something that would otherwise be ordinary.Badman's desserts are handled with as much love and care as the rest of our experience, which made them all the sweeter. Topped with whipped cream and finished with a grating of nutmeg, each joyous spoonful of the Butterscotch Pudding ($7) brought comfort and delight. Looking into the kitchen, I could see plumes of smoke in the air as a ramekin filled with Mint Chocolate Creme Brulee ($7) was getting seared with an iron.It all made sense as burning sugar filled the air, like roasting marshmallows at a campfire. It's one of those things you long to come back to -- home.I'm updating to five well-deserved stars. The jidori chicken is so good, it even has me eating meat off the bone (I'm a boneless girl... no wings or ribs for me under ordinary circumstances. But, for this chicken I am compelled to make an exception)!! The pasta is perfectly salted and cooked. Hearty, fresh and delicious. I'm certain you cannot have a bad meal here. One of my favorite Valley restaurants!!Hoooolllllly cripes on a popsicle stick.Ever eat a full-course meal and then want to start all over again because it was just that damned good? This place is a home run in every sense. Not just a regular home run, but one of the ones where the ball shatters the stadium lights and Robert Redford is running the bases with sparks falling everywhere. I honestly don't even remember every bit of what was consumed. It was a blur of pure delight. There were these delicious peppers in cream sauce and tomatoes with goat cheese for appetizers. Oh, man. I could've eaten those until the act was criminalized. At some point corn on the cob with parmesan appeared. Then entrees came. I had the halibut (yes, you can get insanely fresh seafood in Phoenix, it's a myth that you cannot). It was so perfect and firm and tasteful... others got the lamb and it was sinful. You have to literally find a wooden booth and go to confession after eating it. I'm available for light penance if you can't find willing clergy.Anyway, the desserts. I'm not a dessert-ordering person, but we got puddings and cakes and I wanted them all in my mouth immediately now. We polished everything off and I seriously wanted the menu back so I could start again. The drinks!  The drinks were off the hook. We tried ordering mint juleps but the bartender had other things in mind. He had invented a variation on the mint julep and would we care to try it? Of course we would. Oh, it was game on. So tasty.Also, the ambiance here is just killer. The kitchen is right there in the middle of everything... and it's the quietest, most efficient kitchen I've ever seen. Ever watch those reality shows where everyone is shouting in the kitchen? How long till the risotto is done and whatnot? I didn't hear a peep from those geniuses all night. They just toiled back there and pumped miracles all night. Also, most of the ingredients for everything made are local!Get thee to FnB.Happy birthday to me! Possibly the best dining experience I've ever had. My date had dined at FnB on more than one occasion and talked it up quite heavily. Between trusting his palate and the 5 star direction of Pavle Milic, I literally didn't have to make any decisions. None. Being the control freak that I normally am, I really enjoy when someone else takes over and just 'makes it happen' for me. It's sexy. This time was no different. I wouldn't have changed a thing.We started off with a couple of perfectly crafted mint juleps and tasty marinated olives. I don't venture into mint julep territory very often but I'm glad we did. Light, refreshing and the perfect beginning to what would end up being over 2 hours of gastronomic sensory overload. The menu is forever changing; one of the perks of using only seasonal/local ingredients.The Braised leeks, mozzarella and over-medium egg is a little slice of heaven on a plate. Throwing an egg on almost anything will make my eyes light up. It's like bacon in that way...a no brainer. As for the entree, I had the jidori chicken and spaetzle. Holy WOW! Had I not known that it was chicken I would have assumed it was some sort of exotic fowl that I shouldn't legally be eating or maybe even WANT to be eating except it's so damn tasty that I can't stop, so ya...This was a first time spaetzle experience for my half German ass (sooo pathedic, I know) and it was superb. I have no comparison... but I am a dumpling fearing texture-phobe and let me just say there's nothing to be afraid of here. Insanely good! I did only have one bite of my guys lamb dish, though it too was excellent.I have a true soft spot in my heart for local wine and I've never seen a list composed entirely of such. Kudos FnB! I don't remember what we chose (see what happens when someone else does all the driving) but it pared perfectly with our meals.One more thing.....don't ever let anyone tell you that lemon cake and butterscotch pudding don't go together. They do. Let them scoff. The only rule is that there aren't any.Even though it took us 2 hours to get seated (no fault of FnB, Joel L NEEDED to sit by the window!), I had an awesome time here last night.See, I get teased a lot for never leaving CenPho.  In fact, Lara asked me "Are you ever allowed to get out?" so I knew it was time to finally check this place out.I'd been in touch with Pavle for a couple days.  He's adorable!!  Had to meet him.They have late night eats, which is $10 plates after 10pm.  Score!!!  They had two choices last night: brisket and chilaquiles for the vegetarians.  Once we were seated, it only took about 10 minutes to get our food.  We were served a small veggie platter to tide us over.  There were these little garlic pickles that were to die for!  Kirti even asked for a little extra of these and they were devoured instantly.The place was PACKED.  They were out of the brisket, but seemed to come up with two servings for my dining companions. I had the chilaquiles.  Holy cripes!  They were delicious and came with an egg on top.  I loooooooooooooove eggs.  So much so that I want to marry an egg.  Not Humpty Dumpty, because I'm little, but maybe he has a little cousin or something.Anyway, the service was unbelievable.  They made me some lime drink concoction (non-alcoholic).  I had 3 of them!  Chunks of lime, lots of ice.  Sooooo delicious, especially for a warm summer night.Sitting by the window was the BEST.  Watching the drunk Scottsdale girls stumbling around Old Town made the wait worthwhile.  Watching them park?  Priceless.I ran into a lot of CenPho Escapees there, too.  What does this mean?  That it's ok to venture to Old Town, but *only* for FnB.Thank you so much, Pavle, for an amazing night.  And thanks to my friends, for making me feel guilt-free about leaving my 'hood.When I first heard about this place going in to this little space in  Scottsdale, I initially thought it was going to be an Italian restaurant...a cute little play on the Italian alphabet.F'n A, F'n B, F'n C...I know...not really Italian at all...more Brooklyn and Bronx.But it's not Italian at all...it's world food...world class, world of comfort, world food.After a number of meals at FnB over the past year, I'm trying to recall a dish that didn't knock my socks off...and I can't think of a single item!Last night was no exception!Chef Charleen was in the kitchen giving everything from roasted chickpeas and a little piece of cheese, to fried green tomatoes and braised leeks, her special touch...innovative, imaginative, interesting...but never at the expense of the food itself.She uses simple ingredients, her skill and imagination, and obvious love for the art of cooking, to make every dish special and astonishing.One of the things I love about going to FnB is just walking into the place...You can tell it's going to be a great meal just from the fabulous aromas coming from Chef Charleen's kitchen...plus, who doesn't like the Technicolor floor in this place!The Beautiful Carin and I have had a few things to celebrate lately and another terrific dinner at FnB seemed like a fitting way for us to enjoy a lovely Saturday evening together.In addition to sharing our braised leeks and fried tomatoes and what-have-you, we spent our dinner feeding each other Red Snapper (pan-fried with a dusting of cumin and couscous) and pasta with bacon and morels...satisfying and rewarding entrees, that delighted us both with the flavors and with the quality of the food and the preparation!A quick word about the service at FnB...and that word is "welcoming"...Pavle and his excellent staff encourage you to linger just a little bit longer...to enjoy your conversations and relax with your meal...to enjoy the ambiance and the fact that you are in another world for while.So we did...with coffee, cordials (Chartreuse will set you free) and some of the best little sweet treats you will ever eat...Butterscotch Pudding that is sublime in both its simplicity and subtlety and Chocolate Date Cake...nutty, chocolaty and cinnamon-y.People occasionally ask me to name my favorite restaurant...I know, that surprises me too!When they do ask, I'm generally hard pressed to pick out one particular restaurant from the five or six that I would consider the best places I've ever eaten...and FnB easily falls in that top five.But I will tell you that if I had to eat at only one restaurant for the rest of my life...I would do just fine at FnB!Go. To. FnB.I just recently had my anniversary dinner at FnB with my girlfriend and it was truly a phenomenal experience. Char, Pavle and Emily deserve every pleasant thing that I've heard about them, and they certainly deserve every single star in this review. I felt like a "guest" (I want to stress guest because I didn't just feel like a customer) the whole time I was in the restaurant. Oh, and I noticed the same treatment to the rest of the guests in the restaurant as well; Pavle knows what he's doing.Oh, yeah! Food! We tried a lot of different items on the menu by splitting everything, and I couldn't have been happier. We had the eggplant with pomegranate, za'atar and yogurt, a cauliflower dish that was substituted for the okra dish, the braised leeks and the pasta with creme fraiche, bacon and butternut. Every single dish  was very well crafted with multiple layers of flavor and texture, but they were very simple when it came to ingredients. I would really like to say that there was one thing that I would call favorite, but I can't. If the cauliflower stays on the Fall 2010 menu, it's worth a try. The eggplant was dreamy to me because I love za'atar. Za'atar is a simple Middle Eastern spice blend that adds a great flavor to most things it is put on, and it brought the eggplant dish together. The braised leeks? Well, I now understand why critics are crazy about them... Fantastic mozzarella, mustard bread crumbs and leeks covered with a gooey eggs? Count me in anytime. Lastly, the pasta. Bacon is really a wonderful thing to see when looking at the description of a pasta dish  that already had butternut and creme fraiche. It didn't disappoint; scrumptious until the last bite.Oh my... I've gone on and on. I couldn't help it though, FnB was and is a place with hype that does not falter when faced with customers ready to be blown away. It was worth every penny and I can't wait to head back down to Old Town the next time I want to have a great meal at a classy (and cozy) eatery.PS: My girlfriend and I also had the butterscotch pudding for dessert. Wow, just wow...Maybe my expectations are getting high...but why not?   We went to FnB last night and the menu lacked great choices.  The whole menu except for the last 4 items and one item on the top was all vegetarian.  We started with the cheese plate and it was a small slice of blue bree,nuts and burnt piece of nut bread that we witnessed being scraped off after it was burned and a blob of yucky apricot goo...wouldn't the dish washer tell them no one was eating it?Next we had a braised leeks with mozzarella with a fried egg on it...it would be fine as a side... but not an app?Next came the pasta...it was ok, not house made it had a heavy sauce and a lot of chewy mushrooms,squash cubes and wilted bacon...nothing special.Dessert was a steamed chocolate cake that was dry as a bone served with a table spoon size scoop of banana ice cream...the coffee was pretty good.The tap water was even bad so we ordered bottled...I fear that the owners are cutting corners and making things that are easy to make with the small quarters they have.  We have been many times before and the menu has been more inspired and so has the food.  I hope they are not getting burned out...Excellent dessert.  If you go here you must try the desert.  We shared the  butterscotch pudding which is the best pudding I  have ever had.  I was trying to steer clear of sweets, but with the recommendation of you must have this...I went for it.  I am glad I did since the desert at FnB can be put in my most memorable deserts of all time. Yes when I am dieting I can dream of FnB.  I also enjoyed the fingerling potatoes with the dirty chicken gravy and a super fresh sandwich.  I am not a fan of basic sandwiches, but with recommendation by FnB staff I went for it.  The mix of hummus, turkey, avocado, even feta cheese made a great dish.  I even liked the pickled corn and peppers.  Can't say I ever had pickled corn on the cob before, so it was another exciting moment for me:)What a great lunch, so great that I can't wait to come back and enjoy some dinner dishes.  You should try them out as well, what a great place.This is one of Scottsdale's treasures.  The concept is refreshing - they incorporate fresh local ingredients as best as they can. This means that there are seasonal changes to the menu but that only gives you a reason to go back.I like to order dishes when I go out that I've never had before.  You'll find a number of odd sounding dishes here but don't be afraid to be adventurous. Who knew that I'd like braised leeks with mozzarella and a fried egg? But I do.  I doubt that you'd be disappointed in any of the appetizers but in addition to the leeks, try the pork and duck pate.At one time or another I think I've tried all of the main courses - pick whatever tickles your fancy - I don't think you can go wrong.  Save room for dessert. A personal favorite is the butterscotch pudding.You'll also find an interesting wine list here - I believe they are all from Arizona wineries - Who knew?  They're surprisingly good.One tip - This is a popular place so you should make a reservation.* FARM TO TABLE GEM in Downtown Scottsdale!!! *friendly staff, nice atmosphere, flavorful plates.FnB stands for Food and Beverage.  farm to table restaurant with local ingredients.  i did not take a picture of our actual menu since i figured it would be online...oops.  menu changes with what's fresh and in season. (and i left my phone in the hotel room on the charger, so i didn't take photos either that night...shame on me.) beet salad - different colors of beets, mixed greens, wheat berry, lightly dressed in a viniagretteasparagus with polenta cakes - i love polenta cakes. these were triangular in shape.cauliflower dish - this one tasted like a healthy meatball marinara dish!! IT WAS THE MOST DELICIOUS CAULIFLOWER dish i've ever had.  cauliflower, marinara sauce, fennel sausage.  there was a bit of spiciness in it. Mmm...kudos to the chef!!  she's amazing.butterscotch pudding - good balance of salty sweet flavors. butterscotch pudding topped with whipped cream and nutmegchocolate whiskey cake with ice cream - should've stopped at one dessert but decided to indulge since we were on vacay. enjoyed everything else, so figured...why not? =)  moist, round chocolate cake drizzled with a whiskey chocolate syrup. a scoop of vanilla ice cream complimented it well (though i thought the vanilla ice cream they used was too sweet)they have a simple menu. there is one for lunch (no brunch), dinner, and late night. dinner is from 5-10pm. late night is after 10 (until midnight).  for the late night menu all wine is half off.EAT, DRINK, and BE MERRY!!!If you're coming here in a group, follow this advice:Order as many dishes your mouths can handle. I am stunned by how exquisite the dining culture is in Arizona. I can at times be a Bay Area food snob but this place really blew my mind away.As soon as my colleagues and I walked in, we were pleasantly surprised with an intimately set up table for three and was introduced to a knowledgeable professional server. I hate that I never got her name! Don't be afraid to ask what some of the funky sounding ingredients are; the waiter will guide you through the menu. My colleagues and I ended up choosing about 4 of the smaller appetizers- oh the wonton, yuzu salmon dish was heavenly. And please try out the eggplant dish too! This would be an ideal place if you:1) Care about what goes in your body; health conscious yet still a big foodie2) Love vegetables 3) And desserts (how can you not?)4) Prefer an Intimate, quiet ambiance 5) Look forward to Farm to Table, beautifully concocted and creative dishes As a side note:Our server had to move my group to a table a foot way because a group of 8 was congregating at 10pm. To thank us for our "move," our lovely server treated us with THREE DESSERTS. WHAT. I know...If it's your first time in Phoenix, please stop by this place. I promise you won't regret it!After having Sheepdogs and Moscow Mules with bites of nachos and chips with guacamole and salsa at the CMYE: Meet Your CM event, I was ready for some good eats!  Yuko H. had plans with Aileen B. for some dinner here at this adorable place and with a hungry appetite and booze to burn off, I tagged along with Linh L. and Brett B.!  What a night!  It was our own UYE/PYE inside the Charleen Room.Out of our intimate party of five, Aileen was the only one that had been here before and she told us all about the co-owners and their previous location.  It made for pleasant talk while we nibbled on warm bread with EVOO.  McCallister was our server for the night and he was great.  He was charming, knowledgeable, and I think he had a thing for Aileen AND Yuko!  ;)With a rotating menu, it's not very helpful to talk about my dish for the evening but hey, it's my review so why not?  I had ordered the Yellow tail for $30.  It had featured a beautifully seared and nicely seasoned yellow tail served on top of a generous bed of cous cous with avocados and hearts of palm and tomatillo sauce.  It was a beautiful medley of flavors and texture and with the help of some friends, I polished off my plate.  I also got to sneak some bites of the Summer Squash, Pork Tenderloin [chick peas, radishes, kidney beans, and other yummies in one bite... goodness!] and Socca with cultured butter.  The food was amazing and fresh and I like the farm-to-table theme this place has going on.  All in all, I had a wonderful dinner with some of the best Yelpers in Phoenix!  Thanks for the great night!

Restaurant name  Five Guys Burgers and Fries
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
I've had Five Guys elsewhere, but maybe this one is different? Nope. It's a great burger that is well assembled and I love how the cheese gets all melty and messy in there with the loaded toppings.Your order will be prepared extremely quickly while you fill up your soda and then you can get down to the eatin' part. Fries are good, but not great.Five Guys is a huge step up from the fast food joints, but it's not the best burger around. If you're looking for something just a bit more upscale, try the BT's Burger Joint across Tryon in Rivergate.

Review Text :
And so I finally bagged the elusive white whale of the vegetarian world in Madison. I had attempted to eat at Dandelion Food Cart on at least five or six separate occasions over the last year or two, but I was always either too late, or had come on a day that it's not open (it's only open Tuesday-Thursday, 11:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m.).The owner graciously prepared a potato-tofu wrap for me (vegan, of course, by my specification), even though he'd technically already closed for the day (as usual, I was barely late). He also gave me a peanut butter chocolate cup on the house.The wrap ($6.25) was excellent: super-fresh, filling and flavorful. It was full of tofu, spinach (or was it kale?), a creamy dressing, potatoes, black eyed beans and other vegetables. It also came with a side of tortilla chips. The wrap/burrito was spicy without being overpowering, and felt like comfort food. I can't wait to try another dish from Dandelion.The chocolate peanut butter cup was also amazing. It had a rich chocolate flavor and the peanut butter inside was some of the creamiest I've ever tasted.My only gripe is that this being a food cart, you're forced to eat outside (unless you have an office or apartment to go to, which I don't, as I'm always just passing through Madison). There's no shortage of benches and open space where you can sit and eat in downtown Madison, but be prepared to be bothered by a constant stream of buses and more than a few panhandlers.

I will begin by saying, it is 2:37 and I am indefinitely stuck at work due to our bi-annual inventory.  Now this already makes me crabby, but as it got late the boss wants to buy everyone lunch.  Great!  Where?  I suggest Chinese...  Five minutes later he comes to me with a takeout menu for Chili's.  I guess I was vetoed by everyone else...  So I picked the spicy shrimp tacos.  It came with 2 sides, black beans and rice. The shrimp tacos were skimpy with the shrimp, and the spice level was more mild than spicy, but the shrimp was cooked ok and my stomach doesn't hurt, so they pass.  The beans and rice are another story.  Really bland, no flavor.  Oh well at least I didn't pay... Well back to work... this is the saddest part of my review...

Restaurant name  Fran's Filling Station

Review Text :
Another YERRAA challenge, Fran's turned out to be pretty rad! They've recently remodeled the interior and while the decor is a little confusing (a mix of southwestern color and old timey chotchkeys) the space is pretty comfy, if very open. Tables are painted with varying themes, cute. Service was great, as we had several waiters checking in on us from time to time in addition to our main gal. You gotta love a staff that works together to make sure everyone's happy.The lunch menu was simple, and somewhat veg-friendly. The specialty sammiches looked awesome (Croque Monsieur, Thanksgiving Stack, other inventive plates), but there was no veg option. You do have the option of assembling your own - choose a bread, cheese, veggie, etc. Salads work the same way - a list of house special concoctions, or build your own. I opted for the soup and salad side of the day, both of which were good - french lentil salad with onions, maters, goat cheese garnish. Tomato bisque, while salty, was very flavorful. A little expensive at $5 for a mug of soup accompanied by captain's wafers, but the cheapness of the salad side offset that to end up at about $8 for my meal. Sammiches are in that same range, and come with chips or a choice from their tasty housemade salads and slaws.They have a wider range of veg options at night (including the ubiquitous veggie burger), according to our waitress. I'll make a point of coming back, as the flavors and attention to detail at Fran's imply that someone's really thinking about flavor. Lots of potential! Yay!I went to Fran's today after reading the reviews, I couldn't wait.   I was in the mood for some comfort food, I was going to over order, so I could have leftovers for my husband tonight. Yah!!  Couldn't wait.When I sat down and looked at the lunch menu, it was like, "rrrrrrrt", the needle going off the record, you know that noise.  There were no mashed potatoes.  No creamy cheese polenta and no crab cake with spicy remoulade.  WAHHHHHH.   There were only sandwiches and salads and one cup of soup.  Rat's ass.So I ordered the hot turkey sandwich with cheese, slaw, bacon and russian dressing.  Toasted bread does not a hot sandwich make. It was a beautiful sandwich don't get me wrong, piled high  and great quality turkey, but cold when you took a bite.  I don't want to be petty, but a hot sandwich shouldn't be cold in the middle. The sandwiches come with a side and I ordered slaw, it was shredded cabbage and carrots with a little mayo and salt.  It needed a little more love.  I did see some desserts go by and they looked AWESOME!  They did not look like processed sweets that restaurants try to pass off as homemade.Alright, I made my mind up, I will quit being a baby and quit whinning about cold turkey, but it feels so good to vent....Service was great and they wore cute t shirts.  Fran's is everything a local neighborhood restaurant should be, can't wait to go back for the evening menu.Fran, your food is filling. So filling. And sooo delicious. Hubs and I dropped by for a casual dinner and pretty much ordered way too much. Big shocker, I know, but really we couldn't help ourselves. The menu was filled with comfort food goodness. Inside, Fran's is really adorable. There are about 15 tables and a small bar right at the front. All the servers seem to work together to greet, seat and take care of their customers. I'm a big fan of teamwork. Once we settled in at the bar, we started with the Fried Pickles and were happy to see a huge portion - one side was spiced, while the other was plain. The flavor was right on and the breading was nice; my only suggestion would be to crisp them up a bit more. For my meal, I ordered the Latin Wedge Salad which is filled with yumness - corn, roasted red peppers, iceberg, creamy sherry vinaigrette, avocado, boatload of cheese and grape tomatoes. The salad was one of the best I've had in Charlotte; it was super flavorful and ginormous. And of course, I had to try the Mac 'n Cheese, just for research purposes. Holy yum. Again, a huge portion for $6. It's absolutely a meal and half on its own. Per Fran, who is just incredibly sweet and friendly, her 'mazing mac includes cheddar, American and pecorino cheese. The service in total was top notch - all the servers were knowledgeable, laid back and offered great suggestions for we first timers. Although, I was clearly super full, I ordered the Chocolate Cake, again, just to see how it was. (Yeah right) Now, I'm a huge chocolate fan, but not always a cake fan because of the potential dry factor. I am delighted to say that the chocolate cake was fantastic - moist cake, delectable frosting (not too thick) and a huge scoop of whipped cream AND ice cream. You can say I made room for dessert and planned a long run for the next morning. I left Fran's Filling station with a super full belly, a huge bag of leftovers and the notion that I certainly want to be a regular here!I ate lunch at Fran's last week for the first time and WOW! I'm going to be back again and again.  I like the eclectic menu, it's not the usual boring..... burger, some sort of chicken, some sort of fish, sandwich with some canned choices of a side dish. Oh No,  Fran's menu is pure innovation. My server was well versed with the specials of the day and gave great service.  I got the sense that they mix it up in there from day to day.  I had what they called a meatball slider and Madone was it good.  I had a side of Mac and Cheese (which I consider myself a M-&-C connoisseur)  Even the Mac and Cheese had a Fran twist that separates it from the pack using several shapes of pasta and a few different cheeses.  It was the best M-&-C I've ever had in Charlotte (including what used to be my favorites Lupie's and Mac's BBQ).I was also impressed with the presentation. My ten dollar lunch was presented and garnished with the care, pride and attention like that of a Saturday Night, Uptown $50 Entrée at the newest sheik place with a trendy one syllable name.   The tableware was really cool and retro styled (Melmac or Fiestaware like) very fitting of the charming-ness and uniqueness of Fran's.Fran came out, introduced herself, welcomed me, asked what I thought and even gave me a couple of cookies.  How great is that?In short, awesome menu, excellent service at a great value.  Should I become a serial killer (though not likely), get captured, found guilty and sentenced to the death penalty, I want my last meal to be Fran's Mac and Cheese.

Restaurant name  Vaqueros Carne Asada
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Vaqueros is ostensibly part of a chain, since I have seen them around other places. But make no mistake -- the people cooking here have a brand of their own that Casa Grande locals may recognize.Vaqueros is fairly new. When I pass it in the morning, there are always people in the drive-through. I finally got curious enough to stop by for dinner take-out. They are indeed open from 5 am to midnight most days, serving up breakfast burritos in the morning hours.It didn't take long looking at the menu to recognize that it is almost identical to the menu of a long-time hidden secret in Casa Grande that closed last year, Ruperto's. I had heard that the Ruperto's staff had opened or was opening a new restaurant, and this appears to be it. Many of the same dishes Ruperto's was known for appear on the menu at Vaqueros. The most distinct is the 3 rolled tacos with guacamole. The guacamole is unique and extremely good -- it is a favorite of my daughter's and she recognized it at once as being the same as Ruperto's. We also ordered carne asada tacos, and a burrito and enchilada combo -- all were great. The rice is awesome, but the refried beans could use a little work.All in all, a great and quick stop on Pinal, which has a dearth of good restaurants. Feed your family of 4 for under $20.

Review Text :
GOOD LUCK, AND GOOD NIGHT.I've been to a lot of BW3s before and sure it's an average chain restaurant, but wow does this location have some serious issues.  I hate writing bad reviews, I really try to only review places I like (which there are plenty of), but tonight on yelp I'm slamming down a second bad review and this place takes the cake.I've been here probably 4-5 times, and the last 2 visits were just ridiculous.  The first time was for my fantasy football league.  The service was atrociously slow, with us waiting 20 minutes inbetween every waitress visit and 45 minutes for our "wings", the wireless connection was dropping constantly throughout the draft, they sat us right next to another fantasy league and both leagues could barely hear what anyone was saying, and the food was . . . well typical BW3s food which is to say not that great but fills your stomach I guess.  At the end of the draft, all of us vowed never to have it there again.My last visit was probably one of the worst customer service experiences I've ever had aside from maybe someone "doing something" to the food.We had a pretty big group; about 15 people, and were all meeting up to watch some playoff football games.  Our group was coming in sporadically over the course of about an hour, but I'd say about half of us put our food order in around the same time.  The waitress was an older lady and I could already tell by how slow the drink refills were coming to not expect much.  Shoot ahead a little bit and we're waiting a LONG time for our food.  Normally, I wouldn't care at a place like this on a day like this because we're watching football and laughing and all that good stuff.  But this was crazytown long wait.  The two friends of mine who showed up last (about 30-40 minutes after us) got their food before the rest of our group!  So at that point we knew something was up, we talk to our waitress when she finally comes back 15 minutes later, and she goes back "to check".  Another 15 minutes go by.  She is walking around helping other customers, trays of food are going out to every table but ours, and finally she comes over when we flag her.  She tells us she made a mistake and didn't punch in our orders but she's now taken care of it and the food should be out soon.Another 30 minutes + go by.  I'm not joking.  She's come by maybe once to refill drinks and let us know casually that the food should be out soon.  Most of the time we see her walking around like we don't exist.  We flag her down and ask what's going on with the food.  She tells us she'll check.  15 minutes go by.  Finally, food comes out.  She doesn't know who's food goes where, and half the orders are missing.  We ordered stuff to go with our wings, it's not here.  She goes back and tells us it should be out soon.  20 minutes go by.  Finally, we get the rest.  Hell, it took us like 15 minutes to get DIPPING SAUCE that was supposed to come with our wings let alone the rest of the food.  Nary an apology or sign of sincerity.  I go over and talk to the manager and he immediately seems to be on the up-and-up about the situation.  He seems distraught and genuine, and says he'll take $50 off the food and hands me a stack of $5 off coupons.  We're watching the game waiting for our checks.  Another 30 minutes go by.  I'm not making this stuff up folks.  Bills finally come out, comps are on it, food is all with the wrong people, we send the waitress back to get it figured out after we all write down for her what we all had.  15 minutes later, we get new bills, it's *mostly fixed but there are now no $$ comps like the manager said.  So we all throw in 2 of our $5 coupons.  20-30 minutes later we're finally able to pay as most of us are yawning and wondering if we're going to have to pitch a tent.  I was on the verge of a dine and ditch; something I'd never consider.  On the way out a few of the girls go talk to the manager again, and then relate that he was upset when he saw that we used the coupons and explained that the bill was correct even though 15 people saw that it was clearly wrong with full prices and no comps.   It turns out it was the waitresses third day, half of me felt bad, the other half was still disappointed that she didn't handle the situation better.  She didn't even make an attempt to be apologetic or act like she cared.  I only gave them any stars because they have big tvs, beer, and space.  I'm being generous. We got there at 5:15pm.  We left at 9:30pm.  DO.  NOT.  GO. HERE.

Review Text :
I am so excited to have yet another awesome hot-spot added to the Phoenix restaurant scene.  I've been watching the renovations of this building for a while now and read the blog of all the fantastic things they have done inside the place, so I was waiting at the door 10 minutes before they opened.  Needless to say, I was pumped to finally eat here.We were welcomed in a little bit before open time by Dana, the owner, who is a really awesome guy and his enthusiasm and excitement is truly infectious.  You can tell that this is his baby and he is so proud.  We were given menus which are minimized for the time being, but there are still a ton of stellar selections on there.For a starter we chose the sweet potato fries and they were excellent.  They were not too sweet and had a fantastic texture.  Crispy on the outside and slightly soft on the inside made for a pretty addictive pre meal snack.  Next up was the ceviche, which was actually brought out complimentary by the chef.  I've never had ceviche before, but if this is what it all tastes like, I love it!  The fish was lovely and had a nice firm texture and the spices/peppers added a great bold flavor while the coconut milk mellowed it out a bit.  My dinner entree was the Cocojoe's Coconut Chicken Plate and it was delicious!  There were two huge, flattened pieces of chicken totally covered and crusted in coconut.  It was also slightly covered in a deliciously spicy and slightly sweet lilikoi sauce.  I loved it, but my husband loved it more, so I let him have it and I traded him.  Now I had the pork plate which was also delicious.  The pork was tender and the pineapple/soy bbq type sauce was addictive!  There were also chunks of pineapple which was a nice addition.  The coleslaw it came with was actually a great stand-alone side.  It had a tangy buttermilk base with just the right amount of pepper.  For dessert we got the key lime pie.  It was amazing.  It was so tangy, smooth, and creamy.  It was simply unbelievable, and unlike any key lime pie you have ever had.I adore this place.  I'm truly in love.  I will be back here many many times.  I cannot wait till the weather is perfect for relaxing on the patio and sitting around the really cool firepit.  Obviously, I was impressed with this place.  The architecture and reuse of the building is wonderful.  The laid back/island atmosphere of this restaurant is a true winner that will be bringing in the people for a very long time.Screw you, Hula's. As if Spouse and I aren't alcoholics enough, you have to go and open one of the funnest (that's right, I say funnest) restaurants in Central Phoenix, fill the menu with phenomenal island drinks, and plop the whole thing within stumbling distance of our home. Our livers are on you, buddy.It takes a lot to impress a professional boozer (that's a lie, but let's move on). That Mai Tai I had last night tasted better than the ones I had in Hawaii. And can I just say how refreshing it is to finally get some fruity options (because I am a huge fruit) rather than the same ol' margarita and martini variations served at every other restaurant in town. Not that I don't live for margaritas and martinis. Let's be honest, I'd drink mouthwash if the bartender poured it in a glass, mixed it with grenadine, and served it to me.Where was I?Oh, there's food too. Loved the sweet potato fries. Loved the Hula burger with sauteed onions. Loved, loved, loved Spouse's coconut chicken thingie. I am so ordering that next time because he refused to share. So stingy. BTW, I love that they have a Pupus menu (that's Hawaiian for appetizers) because I am a child (teehee, I said Pupus).Speaking of next time, we're going back this weekend. Bringing a bunch of friends to hang with on Hula's groovy new patio. And I'm ordering about 17 more Mai Tais. If Hula's could go ahead and place an AA phone number on the drink menu, I'd appreciate it.I'm going to be real here, I'm unimpressed by this place. First of all, it is not Hawaiian. Let's just get that out of the way now. Half of the menu consists of tacos! Wasabi is a common ingredient. The standard side dish is coleslaw, when everyone knows in Hawaii its macaroni salad. Let us all just agree to call this some a pan Polynesian/Pan Pacific/Southwestern /American fusion restaurant. Yeah, I find that confusing too. Our first trip to Hula's was unexpected. We were walking from our friend's home to Maizie's and decided we should just pop into Hula's on the way. If you are taking the LR I would suggest getting off at the Campbell stop, but I think its 6 of one, 1/2 dozen of the other between that and Camelback. If you are driving they have a huge parking lot. The initial visit was 4 days after they opened and we had some hits and misses with the food. I really enjoyed the fish ceviche, while my husband did not as he does not usually like fish ceviche. The shrimp rolls were a huge hit. I thought that the hapu was adequate, as was the mahi mahi. Our friend ordered a steak which was one of the grossest, grizzliest steaks I have ever seen. We left that night wanting to try it again, so we made reservations for a group of friends for my husband's birthday the following week. Upon our return we tried the tuna poke which was fantastic and the pulled pork sandwich which was poor, IMO. My kalua pork is a million times better. On the first visit we had tried the sweet potato fries and they were pretty lackluster so we tried the plantains the second time around. The fried plantains were some of the most disgusting things that I have been served at a restaurant in a long time. I was hoping for fried plantains in chip form but they were hunks of plantains. Plantains as a non fried fruit are not really all that great, there is a reason why they are always served cooked in some way. By not splitting them up into smaller pieces the starchy flavor is overpowering. As far as food is concerned I feel that you have to really try different things to find their strengths. As far as drinks are concerned, get the Absolut Boston with lemonade. Thank me later. I have a PhD in mai tais and I will tell you that these are just average. They are entirely too sweet and the dark rum was not floating on the top, but rather it was shaken with the light rum like you would shake a martini. That is not the proper way to make a mai tai. We ordered a few volcano bowls for my husband's birthday and while they were strong, they were also very sweet. Tropical drinks don't have to be sweet! I really want a Tropical Itch or a Lava Flow but to be honest I'm not sure they offer them. Service is hit or miss. On his birthday my husband was wearing a birthday hat and our server actually asked him- in what I believe was complete seriousness- if it was his birthday. What? Really? The indoor space is great, not such a fan of the lighting on the patio. I think I will probably be back for that adult Arnold Palmer and apps. At the time we were there they didn't have a happy hour, but they have added one now.I have to say that the staff did a wonderful job taking care of a table of 8.  I had wanted a reservation for 7pm, but was told I couldn't get it until 7:15.  No big deal.  Got there just a little after 7 and the table was already ready for us.Our server, Jennifer, was great.  I didn't have to ask for a refill for my iced tea more than once and that glass was kept full all night.I like that I wasn't familiar with everything on the menu.  Hula's is definitely a different cuisine than we have here in the PHX.  WTF is a Johnny cake???  Good thing someone in our party asked and ordered it.  I mean, who wants to go to dinner with people who have no food adventure???I had the shrimp and coconut egg rolls.  A little greasy, but still had tons of flavor.  I also got the fish cakes.  They had a good kick to them and I was full with just the two appetizers I ordered.We went for a friend's birthday, and I was told that they give the birthday person a little dessert with a candle in it.  Jennifer said "We do it for everyone."  I wasn't expecting to be charged for it, though.  Not that I'll be broke the rest of the week, but I guess I had figured it was complimentary.One bizarre thing happened, though.  The other large party sitting near us must have been a bit warm, because they asked their server to prop open the side door to get some air.  It felt good at first.  We noticed the door was propped open with a silverware setting.  You know, the napkin with the knife and fork inside it.  Stuck in the door.  I asked our server after a few moments to close it and guess what?  I called it.  She put the rolled silverware back on the empty table next to us.  It was a really nice night and the ambience was comfortable.  I'll be back again to try something new.  I'll just inspect my napkin first, for any door-grease marks.Aloha! Mele Kelikimaka! Don Ho! That's pretty much all the Hawaiian I know. I'm delighted a little bit of our island state has reached Central Phoenix. And I say little because, clearly, this is not authentic Hawaiian, nor are they trying to be. Let's start with the ugly. Cuz there's lots of good stuff to like about Hula's. Probably not the New York Steak Sandwich. Which I quickly renamed the Rhode Island Steak Sandwich. Cuz it was teeny tiny. And that's not so bad, except it was served on a large hamburger bun slathered in Hula sauce and a couple slabs of Monterey Jack and loads of Maui onions which were outstanding! It fell apart quicker than my Aunt Helen when I told her I was a mo. Wait? Have I used that line before? Anyway with the sandwich I had the cole slaw which had fresh ginger in it and I loved it! Rickie's Cajun burger and field green salad was delicious as was our friends Cobb Salad complete with diced fried Spam! And just like the islands' friendly culture, the staff here was spot on with service, smiles and suggestions. Prices on our food hovered around $10 a plate. Now. The space. LOVING IT! Think Brady Bunch decor meets Hawaiian lore. There's a large, kickass photo in the dining room with some 60s/70s hipsters sipping bubbly around a pool with a Camelback Mountain lookalike in the background. Sort of looked like a still from an episode of McMillian and Wife (ok, this is where I lose anyone born after 1975!). Much like St. Francis, I love the textures. From the tiny tile on the wall near the restrooms, to the horizontal wood paneling, the nifty lighting above the bar and of course, the dozens of tikis lining the room. Eventually the two glass garage doors were opened to a beautiful AZ breeze and we could almost feel the slight heat from the fire pit on the patio. Though I did get a bit of a stench from about a dozen gnarly, pimpled skateboarders on the sidewalk. This is a 3.5 review FYI Hula's. Welcome to the desert! Welcome to CenPho. And as they say in Hawaii...um...hmmm...well...I dunno....Aloha?! Yep. Aloha!At the end of an action-packed Saturday including a hair-raising drive and strenuous hike, it was time to simply sit back and R-E-L-A-X.My friend and I declared that Pain Killers on Hula's outdoor deck were just what the doctor ordered.  There is something very right about the combination of rum, coco lopez, pinapple and orange juice.  Since Hula's has all-day HH on Saturdays (ending at 7pm), these beauties will set you back only $5 each.  Bargain!  We kept telling ourselves "hey, we burned like 2,000 calories today.  We EARNED these!"  They came with a fruit garnish, so technically they were "health beverages", right?  :)Our very cool waiter took good care of us, and even shared a little background on his detailed tattoo work.  While I don't have any ink, I love hearing the back stories behind people's art - interesting!  As the sun made it's way down on this good day, the deck, the fire pit and of course the Pain Killer elixr made all those bumps, bruises and scrapes earned on the trail just seem to disappear... for a while, anyway...On balance I liked Hula Modern Tiki and would return.  That being said, my experience with Sunday brunch at Hula was rather hit or miss.I debated between 3 and 4 stars in large part based on the service.  For a moment I considered giving them the benefit of the doubt because they were pretty busy and giving them the fourth star.  But service should be just as good when the restaurant is busy right?Then came the goo.I had French Toast with thick sliced bacon and maple syrup (according to the menu).  The French toast was very good.  The bacon didn't arrive and I had to ask for it - when it arrived it was good, no big deal.  The big deal to me was that the menu said MAPLE SYRUP.  The French Toast did not come with MAPLE SYRUP.  It came with some gooey, thick, out of the bottle syrup.  I'm sorry but maple FLAVORED syrup is not MAPLE SYRUP or anything like it.  FAIL.  I would not have ordered the French Toast if I knew it was being served with corn syrup instead of MAPLE SYRUP.If you are not sure of the distinction here Hula, go somewhere that has crab on the menu.  Then, instead of succulent and tender crab have yourself some of that KRAB that is some unholy amalgam of whitefish, miscellaneous proteins and crab flavoring.MAPLE SYRUP is runny.  It comes from Maple trees, not corn fields.I have absolutely fallen head-over-heels in love with Hula's for so many reasons! Let's just go over a few:-The amazing tofu tacos-The "I'm-gonna-fuck-you-up" Scorpion Bowl (they light the 151 on fire!)-The kick ass happy hour-Outdoor seating with misters-Sweet potato friesThis is a really laid back environment with a lot of options for veggies AND vegans, and they have really awesome drinks. Do yourself the favor and head here with a group of friends and split the scorpion bowl. You can thank me later, just be prepared to call yourself a DD.After a couple of technical complications early in their operation, I've been back a few times and always come to the same conclusion: Go for the drinks, not the food. At first I thought, "Maybe I'm just in a bitchy mood and it's throwing my taste buds off." But I've gone with different people and been mostly in a chipper mood so that wasn't it. Then I thought I was ordering odd items off the menu, but I've tried a variety of items from the brunch and dinner menus and come to the same conclusion. Finally, I decided Hula's is an awesome place to get a great cocktail. It's just meh on the food side. Hula's definitely has one cool patio, amazing architectural features and mighty friendly staff. I just can negate the eating experiences to provide a better rating. It won't be my last time here, so I'm hoping I can update with a more sparkly review.I will apologize in advance to Amber W. who will undoubtedly light my house on fire after reading my dissatisfaction with her happy place, but Hula's really is a 2 1/2 star place to me. I've been several times at this point, and while I'll happily return when I'm in the mood for a fruity over-syruped *strong* cocktail, I will not however be spending my money to eat there again.The first time I went with a small group in the springtime and we sat out on the patio which was a blast. Great ambiance. And two over their 151 packed Scorpion Bowls later, I was sufficiently blacked out. Unfortunately the blackout did not happen soon enough to make me forget the flavorless and overcooked Ahi Wontons i ordered.Second time I went and ate was with Amber W. herself and I ordered the butterfish which was drenched in a terrible thing overbearing cream sauce. I asked for it pan-fried and apparently that is their definition of it- certainly not mine.All in all, Hula's is a fun place to go, hang out, and have a couple cocktails and enjoy the patio when it's not 400 degrees out, but if you're going there with the hopes of being wowed by exemplary seafood, you will be sorely disappointed.Hula's you've won me over.My second visit was brimming with warm friendly service, reasonable drinks and tasty food.The indoor/outdoor blended space here is awesome on a gorgeous Phoenix evening in February!Until next time Hula's!My how time flies.  I remember all the buzz when this building was being remodeled.  Now almost a year and a half after it opened, and a bunch of reviews, I finally had the opportunity to dine here.  I was amongst a Smunch group that met for brunch on a Saturday.  I love the space. A combination of indoor, outdoor and part of both.  The service for our party of about 20 was really great.  Our group consisted of folks from 1 to over 60 and all our needs were well attended to.Their brunch menu consists of items from their regular corporate menu and some special items designed locally.  I chose the Island Eggs Benedict and enjoyed it and the hash browns it came with.  I ordered the decaf and it is the first decaf I have had in a long time that tasted like a real cup of coffee!  At least at our table I heard no big complaints about the food.A couple of things that kept my rating at 3.5 instead of 4:  Parking sucks, this is more important to those like myself not used to uptown/downtown venues. One of my poached eggs was hard cooked in the middle.I would certainly not complain about going here again.My friends and I decided to celebrate my birthday at Hula's a few nights ago and we had a fantastic time. It was on a Wednesday night, so they happened to have an all night happy hour on that day. We surely lucked out, so we enjoyed  $5 appetizers and discounted beverages all night. I love the spicy edename, but I didn't really care for the black bean burger.My friends also ordered food which they deemed satisfactory.I can't decide if it's overpriced or not though. I could barely finish my burger and mash (that doesn't happen very often),but paying $7 to $8 for your signature drinks seems kinda steep. Happy Hour is definitely the time to come here in order to get the discounted price.  I do love the delightful modern kitschy decor and the friendly atmosphere.I'd definitely come back here again and give them another try. Perhaps meet up with friends on a weekend to enjoy a brunch.Truth be told, I was holding off on my review of Hula's because I just didn't share everyone's enthusiasm for the place. Without a doubt, the space is cool. The concept is original for Phoenix. But, I'm not big on super sweet drinks so their signature cocktails were not on my list of "big deal happy hour bargains" and the food wasn't anything I craved. Until now. They must be new, because they are not included on the menu posted on the website, but there are some rice bowl additions. I had the steak bowl. I'm telling you: the steak was pink and tender, the sauce was spicy and craveable, it was a generous portion size and, over all, that bowl alone will get me to be the first to say, "Hey! Let's go to Hula's!!"Definition of "a-Ok".Not a destination dining experience, that's for sure.I would say over-hyped, but over-hipped is more like it.I'm sure it's all so impressive to someone less jaded and cynical, but c'mon. This is really nothing more than someone collecting all of the 'exotic' dishes one at a time from generic american restos like applebees and chilis, and combining them onto one menu in one place.Omigosh! You put a ring of grilled pineapple and some terriyaki on my chicken sandwich?!?  OOOH, how pacific rim fusion.  Someone call Martin Denny.Spotless! Service. Dining room. Restrooms. Patio. Spotless!!Next time I shall forgo table seating and plop my butt on the floor to eat. Yep. That's how clean Hula's is!Service was polished and friendly. Dana was working the brunch crowd and attending to everyone's needs. Most importantly everyone enjoyed their brunch.I say Bula Bula to Hula's!!Oh Hula'sThe first time we came in a noticed the spicy shrimp caesar.  I thought mango in a caesar was a pretty odd choice.  I tried it thinking that the two really didn't go together but was pleasantly surprised!  The next trip I ordered the Jerk Pork.  Holy pig.  Seriously, this pork was melt in your mouth tender.  Chewing was hardly necessary.  The flavor was really really good.  All of the sides were delicious, the fried plantains were just right and the Jamaican johnny cakes were passed around our table for everyone to try.Out of all the guests we have taken with us no one has ever left disappointed.  We have yet to run into anything mediocre and always look forward to our next trip.I came here once for a work event and after a few hours my boss said he had to leave before I "drank everything on the menu." I always have fun when I come to Hula's and I love their cocktails. I last wound up here with Laura L.; Liz S.; Tom S.; J.D.L. and Kelly R. after doing Happy Hour at Fez and we had a great time drinking and having some food. We had two of the whopping huge drinks that come with four straws and flaming rum in the middle. My favorite drinks are the Dr. Funk and the Blood Orange Martini but they have some great beers and lots of other yummy cocktails on the menu.I also LOVE the Spicy Thai Fish Cakes...DELISH!!!!! Great Happy Hour specials and an awesome patio....once summer is over!We really enjoyed Hulas and its wonderful outdoor patio. I wish I could elaborate more, but I remember very little of that night!!I do remember it was great and that I really enjoyed the Mai Tai's!!! Service was quick and friendly!!  Lovely place!!We came here for an early Mothers Day lunch. For my girlfriend and her daughter.Nice place and parking is tight, but since it was Saturday afternoon,we found a spot.It is located right across the street from St. Francis Chruch so it is easy to find.Good Ice Tea & lots of lemon for starters. Drinks are pretty reasonable for sure.I ordered a Burger. It was OK ,good but the bun was just so so.Lighty toasted, nice cheese,3 choices on the cheese.It came with regular fries. WHen they came out they were all over cooked and had no flavor at all. I think the Oil was old.However, our server was nice enough to switch them out and give me Sweet potato fries instead. Which were entirerly different and so much better.The girls each got Ahi Eggs Bennie.Of course I had a taste or 2 and they were really good.Love the way it is decorated in here. Very Mad Man,50's 60's.A very clean place and the Rest Rooms are as well.Cannot believe this is my first time here. I liked it and will be back.I have driven past Hula's so many times and thought someday I will have to stop by, well thanks to another fellow yelper who set up an Happy Hour UYE, my someday showed up so off to Hula's I went!What a great lil place, love the feel of it, makes you feel like you stepped out of Phoenix and are now at some island bar, I loved that they even had Elvis Presley's Blue Hawaii playing up on the wall.They have some pretty awesome happy hour deals, and on Wed happy hour is all night long. I ordered the Pink Bikini Martini which was pineapple infused vodka, sweet & sour & watermelon liqueur, garnished with a pineapple & cheery, this was a sweet lil drink, so very good! I also tried the Mai Tai, which was pretty good too, but I think the Pink Bikini is my favorite drink their so far! Also tried the coconut shrimp rolls, and I normally am not one to would pick a shrimp dish, but it said it came with a pineapple horseradish dipping sauce, I love pineapple, I love horseradish, so I had to try it!! They were very tasty and packed with shrimp, there was no shrimp shortage in those, and coconut gave it the perfect crunchiness! Very yummy for sure! Glad I have finally tried Hulas out and look forward to going back!This place just never fails to delight!  I have been here a few times now and it is always exceptional. Today was another wonderful experience.Meet a friend here for lunch I got the fish tacos.only I got one fish and one tofu.You can mix and match. It was with a very unique rice and bean dish. My friend got the Tofu Curry salad. I tasted a little of hers and it was also fantastic. Our waiter was so nice, he even gave me a sample of the Lobster bisque. Although I did not order it, it also was good.The water is filtered ,it does not taste like poison so that was really nice as well. I had hot tea (they have an assortment). He refilled it continuously.  One thing we noticed while we were sitting in the bar area was how clean the place was . I mean sparkling clean.  I know that may sound strange but, I was right by a corner and I noticed how it sparkled. The more I come here the more I like it. The bathroom is spotless and beautifully decorated. The place is so retro ,plus they play the best music on the P.A.Parking was good today, not so packed. But ,sometimes it can be hard to find a spot.Hula's has captured perfectly that hip, urban, midtown Phoenix atmosphere. You'll always find a crowd, their fire pit is pretty interesting, the indoor and outdoor spaces are cool, and they've got posters of old surf movies on the wall in the bathrooms. I was once inspired to try and find one of them, but wasn't able to on Netflix or Amazon. Maybe I just wasn't really that dedicated to the task at hand though.I've been to Hula's a number of times now and only about half of my visits I was ordering food. Not to say their food isn't appetizing, just that Hulas works well as both bar AND grill, and I'm not always out during lunch or dinner. While a bit on the upper end of my dining out price range, every time I've ordered food, it was either good or delicious, but when ordering a drink, I usually stick with a vodka & soda, their other drinks just aren't for me.Their signature cocktails are generally made with either rum, tequila, or vodka, or some mixture of two or three of them, but I've found that a lot of them are to sweet for my tastes. I'm not a real fan of super sweet drinks, and they can reach levels of excessive in my opinion. My favorite food item on their menu are the pork taco's and you can order one taco during happy hour for about $3. HH is Monday - Friday until about 6pm. I've also had their sweet potato fries, tofu taco, edamame, a Hula Burger, and their mac-n-cheese. All were tasty, and worth coming back for, but I imagine I'll try something different next time, like their habanero chicken tacos or their house made black bean burger.Overall Hula's is a fun spot to meet with friends, but I wouldn't go here for more than one or two cocktails unless you're looking to leave with a sugar high.Happy Yelping Phoenix!Being familiar with the 90's tiki bar trend of tired, low-grade pseudo-Polynesian food, coupled with overpowered rum drinks, I approached the family's suggestion to try Hula's with some hesitation.  Much to my surprise, Hula's is quite different than the prior-century icon.In a warm and inviting Old Town storefront, Hula's dim lighting, ample space and large central bar immediately brought to mind a comfortable dining and drinking environment.  Jazmine, our waitress, was patient, quite informative and quick to deliver our order.We ordered a shared portion of the whitefish cerviche appetizer, and it was good.  The marinating of the fish in lime juice appeared to have been rushed, as neither fully tenderized fish nor a fully developed flavor profile were the result.  Next, we each ordered entrees and generously sampled from each plate.The macadamia-crusted ahi, served medium rare, was very good.  A large cut of quality ahi in a nicely seasoned crust preserved the subtle balance of flavors between the two.  The luau-style pulled pork was tasty, if a bit sweet for my tastes.  Laced with a small dice of pineapple and pineapple juice, it remained satisfying none the less.  A scoop of jasmine rice helped to balance the flavors.  The star of the evening, however, was our older son's jerk pork.  Shredded, with a pleasant heat and light curry flavor, the dish was identifiable from its Caribbean origins, yet uniquely Hawaiian.Portions are very large, and quite fortunately, the food was delicious enough to make this "a good thing."Hula's Modern Tiki is a clever concept which, as the crowded dining room will attest, serves very good food.  Dinner for the four of us, pre-tip, was $75.50, making Hula's an outstanding value as well.

I didn't feel like cooking yesterday, but then again I haven't been feeling like cooking for a few days now.  Instead, I decided we ate Chinese food since that's really what would be open during this day here in Vegas.  First I drove to China Ginger  but decided to go a different route after reading some of the reviews.I found Wendy's Noodle Cafe through Yelp, thanks!  The lady that greeted me was really nice and friendly and seemed to go above and beyond her duties.  She was helpful and patient with me as I looked at their menu trying to find something good to order.  Finally, I ordered French Style Beef Cubes with Black Pepper Sauce & Rice $7.95, Chinese Broccoli with Oyster Sauce $5.50, and Walnut Shrimp $12.95.  After I made my order, the host served me some green tea as I was waiting for my food.  I was pleasantly surprised.  It didn't take too long before my food was ready which then I rushed home so my bf and I could eat.  The food was awesome.  Everything was as Yelp members said it would be and I would go back over and over again to try all the other food.  The meat and shrimp were tender and seasoned perfectly.  The Chinese broccoli had just enough and right amount of oyster sauce, and the rice was cooked perfectly.  Hands down, I'm coming back.  One of my bf's friend's talked about Chinese porridge and they do have it in their menu.  This will be my next item to choose when I come back here.Meeting a friend who was visiting from out of town, our party of 5 (plus infant) decided to meet at Ramen Sora for dinner. We got there, but they were packed to the gills, so we decided to head to Wendy's Noodle House instead, since our friend had a plane to catch and didn't want to waste our time waiting for a table. I remember coming here years ago when they first opened. I enjoyed my meal here that time, but haven't been back since. We were seated quickly and the service was pretty hospitable. They came to take our orders pretty quickly despite sending them away several times because we were chatting so much we were too distracted to actually pick something to eat from the littany of menu options. Our table started with some xiao long bao and steak baos for appetizers. I didn't get a chance to try either of these, but my friends raved about them. I ordered a Thai tea with boba and the noodles in xo sauce. The food came out quickly and and everyone in our party thoroughly enjoyed their meals. My noodles were nice and spicy and had a great texture. There wasn't one thing we ordered that we didn't enjoy. There are many things to love about this place. The prices were beyond reasonable, their menu selection is extensive and everything we ordered was tasty. I'm looking forward to coming back and trying some of the noodle soups and desserts on the menu. Great little spot I'm glad I rediscovered.Eating out is awesome.  Eating out at Wendy's Noodle Cafe is awesomer. 3 pieces of their Rib Eye Bao Burger, 5 pieces of their Grilled Beef Short Ribs, Great Service...Wendy's Noodle Cafe Go Boom!!!There's so much on the menu that you really have no excuse but to come back.  At Wendy's, you have a gang of choices from Starters, Noodles, Rice Plates, and even some East Meets West dishes. Their grilled beef short ribs was good, but I loved me some Rib Eye Bao Burger.  You get 3 with your order and if you're eating with me, I warn you that I exercise portion control.  That means I control all the portions.  Sorry Terri R., I just realized I didn't offer you any.  30 minutes into dinner, Christina W. (aka the Duchess of Wendy's) sent me a super lag tip to try their fried chicken wings, fried bread, and Tom Yum fried rice. My meal was so delicious and filling that I didn't have any regrets that I missed out on Christina's tip.  But looks like I'll be back because if it's good enough for the Duchess, then it's good enough for me.  Wendy's Noodle Cafe is legit.  I'm quarter Chinese and the meats that I had reminded me of what you can get in Chinatown SF or at my very own family parties.Still one of my favorite Chinese places. Good friendly service, clean and bright space, good consistently food. The owner is always so cheery and humble and remembers us each time and comes by to say hello. There are some unexpected fusion type dishes, but also traditional foods too (though this is not your average Chinese menu, more like Chaozhou style). Everything is fresh and comes piping hot, in large portions. There really isn't much over $10 so I feel this place is also good value on top of it being on with flavors. Since I come with fair regularity, I figured I should just make a running tally of what I'm ordering. Favorites - E-fu noodles: I have a thing for e-fu. It's a soft noodle with very subtle flavors, but comforting to me. Honey Glazed Eggplant - It's like honey walnut shrimp, but eggplant and less mayo-y. A bit of hot sauce and this crispy bite is a guilty pleasure.Lotus root w/ pork - this isn't on any of the menus, but the black board menu all in Chinese. I've only ever had lotus root in soups so I had no clue it was crunchy. Thanks to Christina W. this became my favorite, though it's hard to order it since I don't know the Chinese name. I show them the picture I took! Haha. BBQ Pork Rice Plate - their bbq pork here is juicy and perfect. Comes with rice, and steamed veggies. Singapore Noodles - not on the menu anymore, but they have all the ingredients and still make it for me. This is my favorite place to get it actually, just the right amount of curry flavor, has that yummy bbq pork slices and shrimp on it. Fish filet salt & pepper - theirs is really nicely crisp and I like they make it smaller pieces than larger filets so easy to split, and plenty of crunchy surface. Other stuff I've tried worth mentioning - Nan Yang Chow Noodles- I've only had this once so far, but it was interesting and good. I didn't know what it was so figured, what the heck? It's wide noodles in a rich peanutty, spicy XO sauce. I would order this again. Crab with XO sauce vermicelli - I'm not too keen on vermicelli, but somehow between this and Singapore noodles, Wendy's sells me on it. Seafood XO sauce stir fried udon - This is like, chow meins  spicy, savory cousin for foodies. I think I just like anything in XO sauce. It's that umami spiciness that is irresistible. You can also do this with thin rice noodles, but have not tried it that way. Spare rib black bean sauce hot pot - I love those spare ribs at dim sum, but I just wanted a whole bowl full on rice. Finally a place with it in a entree size just for meeee!  Pan fried rice cake w/ egg - The BF isn't a fan so I never get to order it, but I love crispy rice cake and with the over easy egg on it and dipped in a bit of soy and red vinegar - yum! Salty fish rice with chicken - their fried rice is fluffy and not greasy at all here so even if salty fish isn't your thing, try another fried rice and I don't think you will be disappointed. Also their desserts here always look great and interesting but I never have the room for it. One day. One day I will have a dessert. I've also never really ventured much in terms of their soups, though I always see people ordering it up. I know I've forgetting a few things I liked. I try to order 1 new thing and 1 favorite when I visit so I'm sure I'll be updating this review a few times.I was able to knock off another spot that was bookmarked and loved it! It was almost 9 pm when we arrived and the there was a good amount of customers inside. They have different sizes of tables to accommodate the size of your party. There was a nice man who greeted us and took us to a table right away. Drinks and peanuts were brought to the table and the night was off to a great start.There were tons of things on Wendy's menu that I had never seen before. After much menu gazing I decided on the "Flaming Hot Stir-Fried Beef" priced at $8.99 and it was so good! The portion was much more then I expected and the dish was packed with delicious flavor. This was a dish that could easily be shared. The rice brought with it was cooked perfectly. You just can't go wrong with the prices at Wendy's or the portion.Wendy herself came over to our table to introduce herself and ask how the meal was. I mentioned that I was curious about a few items on the menu and she took much appreciated time explaining the items on the menu and asking me what my personal likes were so she could suggest certain dishes for the next visit. She mentioned that the "Clay Pots" take at least 30 minutes to prepare and that you can just call ahead if you are on a time crunch and they can start preparing it for you. Wendy was so genuinely nice and it is evident she cares about the food they are serving as much as the customers.They have TV's inside and offer catering. This is the type of place you could go on a date, take your family, or just grab some lunch on a break. Inside was very clean and the water they serve is filtered. I will for sure be back![T]asty doesn't even begin to describe this dish![O]nce you try it, you'll get the hype-[M]any reviews cite it as the reason they come here...[Y]ou will too once you try it![U]ntil now, I never knew the  flavors of this soup; [M]y taste buds still did a happy dance, regardless.[G]o now and grab an [O]rder, it's[O]verflowing with seafood ['N'] it packs a punch of [G]ood and balanced flavors.[F]inally, a dish I can[R]egularly order when[I]'m overwhelmed by Chinatown options.[E]ven though I love trying new things,[D]efinitely going to get this dish, here,[R]egularly.[I][C]an only hope that you[E]njoy this dish as much as I do.

Review Text :
When I yelp, I bark animal style. When I dine in In N Out I pass over animal style and enjoy a mouth watering cheeseburger & fries.  Speaking of animal style, in the fast food jungle, In N Out is an animal with the style of simplicity and efficiency. It is delicious fast food made simple. With the exception of a secret menu, there are only three meals to choose from. A hamburger meal, a cheeseburger meal, or double cheeseburger meal. It is simplicity made fresh. Forget about ordinary burgers being left under warm lights or frozen patties warming up in a microwave style device. At In N Out, they cook the burger right there and in front of the customer.  Delicious fast food made simple is brings me inside the Blue Diamond Road In N Out Burger oftentimes when I am in the vicinity of the Target in the parking lot. Lol. Sometimes I go out of my way to do an errand in this Target just for an excuse to patronize In N Out. The thing is, it seems that on any given visit hundreds of people are also patronizing In N Out. The upshot us that I am rarely in n out. But then again I always dine inside. Regardless that I might be number 240 and they are serving customer 186; efficiency speeds up the wait. Due to supply and demand, In N Out is so popular that finding a table is as difficult as finding a cold day on a June in Las Vegas. Just like at any In N Out; I consider myself satisfied sitting at a bar chair.   On the subject of crowded, I observed that at In N Out; customers rarely seem agitated or annoyed. Ditto for the employees. The employees here are even friendlier than at casual dining restaurants that I have experienced. An example is last Saturday when I dined here, a friendly employee went up to all the customers asking how the food was and making small talk.   In a City where there are countless restaurants to dine in, In N Out is the ultimate option. It is upbeat, inexpensive,  and delicious. When it comes to yelping this In N Out, I give it a 4 star bark :-)Pretty snazzy fries and a decent double double were my companions during this workday, and I must say they were truly good company. Perhaps if I was able to sit down and enjoy my meal rather than have to eat it on the go, I could have savored it much better. But, I'm in the process of streamlining our courier service and had to focus more on the navigation of the driver than this delicious burger and tasty fries, so something might have been lost in translation.Needless to say, if I ever find myself transferred to our Mesa branch for the day, I know I'll stop by In-N-Out Burger to sate my loins.IN-N-OUT IN MAH BELLY!So freaking good it's almost criminal. Small menu here but what they do they do most excellently.As we had a long ride up to Sedona today and needed to get some gas in the tank I noticed the sign on the highway for this In-N-Out location and made a bee-line for it after hitting the gas station. Did not want to get all bloated and sleepy by ordering off the "secret menu" so I went with the basic crave satisfying meal of a double double, fries, and a Neopolitan shake.Good beejeezus this burger is like an orgasm in your mouth! Two beef patties of juicy goodness, fresh lettuce and tomato, crisp onion slices, and a soft buttery bun. Oh my! Decent enough fries and a thick delicious shake to wash it all down. Just ridiculously tasty! This location itself is super clean with a cool retro look to it like back in the 1950's. A bunch of tables outside on a front patio that we ate on with the perfect weather out today. It just doesn't get any better then this!That little devil on my shoulder kept taunting me to eat another burger, but I had to resist. Sedona was calling and it was a long ride. After this I already needed a nap!-The BEST fries in the whole wide world!! Cheap too!-I LOVE these hamburgers, it's worth waiting for! I envision the toasty buns, secret sauce, and greasy goodness as I slowly wait my turn in line.-Good location, right off the freeway.-Service was friendly, just like any location.-I learned there's a Jersey Mike's in the same parking lot, as I waited in the Drive-Thru line.-I found this location with YELP's help.

Honest to God, Sheriff Joe's jail is more comforting than this venue (trust me, and don't ask why, but I know). So here's to hoping that they just opened earlier than they had wanted to, 'cause right now this maybe the coldest coffee shop I've been in since Drip. Or maybe they just don't want you hanging around, and if that's the case they certainly have succeeded with flying colors. As at this point in time (1st week) they have ONE comfortable piece of furniture and all the rest are bare metal chairs. The space certainly does have potential with their big outdoor patio. And by the looks of it they will have a hot kitchen sometime in the future. As for the coffee, it's okay but nothing special, and/but don't expect any orange flavor for your Italian soda 'cause they don't seem to think it's worthy of stocking (at either stores).Unfortunately Lux still has no competition in this town ...i liked the location more then the original. but i liked the people at the original more. it's not like there is anything wrong with the people at the new location. i just was like super regular at the original location..so i didn't feel like a nobody. :-/ ohh wells. :)

After eating there at least monthly for the last year, Tokyo Lobby is a distant memory. We have a new item every time we order and we've still barely made a dent in the impressive menu!The place isn't fancy, but who cares? It is clear that it's a family business who has no aspirations to becoming a nationwide chain. And that's fine by me.The waitress is very friendly: greeting me by name when I walk through the door, remembering my orders (even when I forgot to get my usual garlic tuna roll), and giving me small treats as I wait for my takeout. The owners are similarly pleasant, so i imagine that it's part of their customer service culture.I recommend Ari Sushi to everyone I know that lives near the area and they all have loved it as well. The place has gotten busier, which results in longer wait times at the peak. But it's the price you have to pay to make sure that it stays in business.

I had lunch with a friend on Wednesday this past week...we were on the phone trying to figure where to rendezvous when the name "Tommy V's Osteria and Pizzeria" came up (I know...it's mouthful...I just said "Tommy V's":)We are both fans of Tomaso's (see my excellent review of Tomaso's...oh wait...you can't...it's one of the 89 partially written reviews sitting on my laptop waiting for me to figure out what to say...well, trust me...it's an excellent review:)And speaking of excellent, so is Tommy V's:)What a delightful little adjunct to Tomaso's...the wood fired oven facing the bar and dining area, the flat panel TV above the bar tuned to Italian World Cup soccer...murmuring softly in Italian in the background...the place is very nicely decorated and the ambiance of the place is quiet and pleasant:)And the food, my friends...the food!In the end, it's pretty much always about the food and anyplace that bears Tommy's name is not going to disappoint in that area:)I had a lovely Umbrian Sausage Panini...made the way a Panini is supposed to be made...on house baked flat bread (with wood smoke and dark brown blisters in the bread from the wood oven), filled with thin slices of savory Umbrian Sausage, caramelized onions and Italian peppers and set off perfectly with homemade garlic aioli...re-baked in the wood oven so that it was warm all the way through (very little that I dislike more than a panini that's still cold in the middle...that's just damn laziness! :-)My buddy had a pizza...a custom pizza...the kind of pizza that I wish I could get Bianco's:)And we didn't have to wait 3 hours for Tommy V's pizza:)...they brought out his beautifully blistered, crusty and delicious, Quattro fromaggio with artichoke hearts and caramelized onions about 20 minutes after we ordered...just about right for a pizza order:)Once again, essentially edible art...smoky and delicious, hot from the oven...all the ingredients were perfectly proportioned (I think my friend has a special genius for ordering...this pizza wasn't on the menu, but clearly should be:)The price to portion and price to value ratio are so clearly positive at Tommy V's that I didn't even bother to create a chart...Under $30 for the 2 of us and we couldn't finish all the food...my Panini alone was over 12 inches across, cut into quarters...easily enough for 2 people, and included a wild greens salad in a light vinaigrette...wonderful:)We didn't try the bar out (lunchtime...on a Wednesday...meetings later...can't afford to look drunk:) although we did gawk a bit...an excellent selection of Italian beers, decent wines, scotches, vodka's...even bourbon's:)The only thing that was a bit jarring was the service...but not for lack of service!:)I don't want to rag on them for being too attentive, but they may want to throttle back on the love just a little...I was asked "how is everything" 3-4 times while I was in the middle of a conversation (we hadn't seen each other in while so we had a bunch to catch up on) or in the middle of a bite...listen...I really appreciate that so much more than the typical "where did everyone go?" kind of thing...just ease off the gas pedal a little bit...we already love you...we really, really do! :-)And that's it...that's the only thing about Tommy V's that even remotely causes a ripple...they are just so very eager to please! :-)So drop by 32nd and Camelback (remember...this is Tommy V's...not Zen 32...you would be disappointed:) and have yourself one of the best pie's or panini's you're likely to experience anywhere:-)

Highly recommend! The food here is always good. No matter what you order, you can't go wrong. Highlights: The rotisserie chicken is juicy and flavorful. The steaks are cooked so perfectly, they almost melt in your mouth. The salads are delicious; my husband likes to add the salmon with his salad. One of my favorite dishes is Mort's Pot Roast. I don't usually get dessert at restaurants, but Bonfyre has great little creamy desserts in shot glasses that are the perfect size if you're looking for a sweet treat.This is a great place for happy hour. You can get $5 bar plates in the bar area---flat breads, tacos, fries, etc.This is a nice place to take out of town guests.  You can make reservations, they can accommodate groups well, and you know everyone will be happy with their meal.

For my birthday every year, my parents come down from Payson to take me to lunch. We try to coordinate where to meet, and since I have a client in Gilbert, my boyfriend suggested this. Oh, and they wanted to go to Winco right after, so this seemed like a good spot. I had never in my life heard of the place. Sometimes, that's a good thing.Today, though, it wasn't. Turns out, it's just a huge room with an even bigger menu. I chose the Cobb salad. Now, let me make one thing clear: If I am going to have a salad, I always get a Cobb salad. The Vig Uptown has my favorite one. I *know* a Cobb salad. The menu said it came with feta. F. E. T. A. on a Cobb salad. I asked the waitress to substitute the feta for blue cheese, remove the bacon (I knew it wouldn't be real bacon, and I hate bacon bits), and keep the dressing on the side. It also came with "turkey."Never in my life have I sent anything back to a kitchen. Ever. But there was no way I was going to let this pass. I've seen enough Kitchen Nightmares to know that Gordon would have told the server to have the chef eat that salad, just to see how horrible their food was. And that's exactly what I told her. The "turkey" were a bunch of cubes of white stuff on my plate, that had obviously been frozen, and had as much flavor as the iceberg lettuce. There were chopped tomatoes all over the place, and my "cucumber" was a tiny slice off the end of the cucumber. (see photo)She offered to bring me something else, and I declined. I didn't even want the free *$&#*$&# pizookie, that's how angry and disappointed I was. They took the "Cobb salad" off our bill, and we went on our merry way. My stomach was rumbling on my way home. I fear it's going to be a looooooooooong night. From a salad. The worst salad in all the land.I will never, ever eat at any location of this hole again. I had no idea it was a chain, or I would have picked something else.I've never cried during a birthday lunch with my parents, but I was mighty close today.Delicious margaritas in a beautiful setting with stellar customer service.  A margarita on the rocks with no salt is my go-to drink and it's fair to say that I've had my fair share of margaritas at different bars and restaurants all across the Valley and this one was THE BEST, hands down.  It was expertly mixed, with just the right amount of alcohol and citrus tanginess, served tall, on the rocks and garnished with slices of lemon and lime and most importantly NO salt.  You can ruin a margarita for me by ignoring my 'no salt' request, thankfully our server was paying close attention.Rumor has it, there was food in front of me too, but it was secondary to that amazing margarita.So for those nights where I prefer to drink my dinner (don't judge) this is the place.Margaritas: Not *just* for breakfast anymore.

Had dinner here last night. It was crazy in Uptown, everyone out at the Panthers Pre-Season Game. We went the opposite way and decided to finally have a relaxing sit down dinner at Zoes.Place was nice and quiet for it was like close to 7:30 PM. People coming in to grab meals to go and several patrons placing orders.The Steak Kabobs were delicious. Cooked to your liking. The hummus was creamy.Rice Pilaf good but a tad salty. Have to watch my salt intake and sugar levels for I have gained a huge muffin top.They have wine here too.

I have been excited for the Grand Opening... sort of a let down. Good thing I was in a who cares attitude today. First a little history... These meat heads started the whole chain and franchised out. They still own Peoria and Phoenix but have either sold or franchised out the rest. The place was busy and there were plenty of people working. Most had no idea what they were doing. LOL I browsed the menu and decided that the kids meal would suffice for lunch. (Since there are no lunch specials) I ask the order taker if the kids meal come with a meatball, she said YES but then asked if I wanted a drink, which it come with it. I KNEW there was not going to be a meatball. The little dude with an earring and Michael Jordan shorts on said to me... Is it for a kid? I said Yes, I am a big kid. He said to no longer order from the kids menu without it being for a child. Then proceeded to tell the order taker never let it happen again. LOL AZZThe same dude made it a point to serve me the food. It was a perfect lunch size portion of spag with meat sauce NO Meatball and two of the best garlic rolls/knots whatever I have had in a long time.  The sauce was good but it got a little watered down by the pasta not being drained enough. I see quality is not a high point here. The other plates looked great and I look forward to trying something else off  the kids menu.

Review Text :
Starving after 4 hours on the road but not wanting fast food places attached to gas stations Donna and I settled on Cracker Barrel. It's like every other Crack Barrel where you enter and exit the restaurant through a enormous gift shop full of surprisingly well prices candies, candles, knick knacks, toys, etc, etc. Food is comfort foods such as chicken fried steak, meatloaf, chicken and dumplings, ham, fried chicken, catfish, and other stuff. They even have breakfast. For my meal I had the hickory smoked bone-in country ham with fried okra and turnip greens for my sides. The ham was very smokey and tasted great. The greens were actually some of the best I've had. Chunks of ham hock all throughout the tender greens. Okra was fried perfectly and steaming hot. For $7.39 this was some good eats. Donna had the chicken and dumplings with "hashbrown casserole" and fried okra. Her meal didn't look good to me but she said it was excellent. Her meal was also $7.39. Very efficient and friendly service. Since you pay in the gift shop we couldn't resist and impulse bought some stuff. Their mission was accomplished!***Cracker Barrel is a countrified Denny's, but the food is better than that chain and their lack of presence on the West Coast makes their Arizona location feel different and more unique than some of the other big chains you'll find there***When I was a kid, I used to eat at Cracker Barrel a lot (Cracker Barrel is a combination of a touristy general store and a countrified restaurant focusing on big breakfasts and home-style lunches/dinners).  Cracker Barrel is very popular in the Midwest and it is also a popular along-the-highway-stop in the Southeast.  I remember enjoying it, but my fondness for it has decreased over the years.Every Cracker Barrel looks the same.  They have a faux rustic outdoor cabin-like exterior with a faux porch lined with rocking chairs that you can purchase.  When you enter, you are immediately in a pseudo general store that offers touristy souvenirs and a lot of food items.  Not really pantry items.  Instead, you will find a lot of sweets like nostalgic candy, chocolates, caramels, syrups, jams, apple butters, candy sticks (15 cents per stick), Jelly Belly jelly beans, etc.Just past the general store you will find the restaurant.  The breakfast (which I believe is served all day) is a mix of your standard stuff like pancakes, french toast, eggs, bacon, sausage, biscuits, etc.  Bob Evans is a lot like Cracker Barrel and I think Bob Evans' breakfast is far superior.I went with a dish I have always ordered--chicken and dumplings with mashed potatoes and corn niblets.  The last time I had this dish was in Ohio and the dish was quite oily and bland.  The dish was still on the bland side though the dumplings/sauce were less oily (there was a much creamier base).The dumplings were a little bit too thin, but they were mostly fine and enjoyable.  The chicken was a relatively small portion and it was a little dry (but not too bad).  The chicken and dumplings could have definitely used a lot more seasoning (though places like Cracker Barrel tend to have to please an older clientele, who may have more sodium restrictions).The mashed potatoes were okay.  Not the creamiest or smoothest texture.  Very hot.  The corn was okay.I had the hot fudge sundae for dessert and it was not that bad of a deal (it was under $3).  Served in a frozen mug, the sundae consisted of two scoops of Blue Bell vanilla ice cream, hot fudge, whipped cream, and a maraschino cherry.  The whipped cream was of the canned/aerosol variety, but the ice cream was decent.  It had a good flavor and was firm and creamy.  It was also not too whipped or airy (which you get at a lot of family restaurants).The hot fudge was also good and warm.Service was fine.  It was pleasant and quick.  I do not think I would classify Cracker Barrel as authentic country cuisine, but they definitely achieve a consistent look and personality with all their waitresses (no matter what state you are in).Pricing is more than reasonable.  You get a lot of food and you do not have to pay much.  Most of their entrees are below $10 and desserts run about $4 and below.You could probably do worse than Cracker Barrel on the road.  Still, I think the food was pretty average at best.  But if you find yourself needing to stop somewhere on the road in Arizona, you will come across a lot of chains you can find in California.  Cracker Barrel is a big chain too, but their lack of presence on the West Coast at least makes this restaurant feel somewhat different and unique.This Cracker Barrel is in a seemingly new shopping development that has a huge and free parking lot.

If you read my reviews before and tried the places I write about then you will realize this may be the only one you need to read!  i will make this short!Bobby O's CRUSHES any other BBQ place around.  Midwood, Macs, Jim n Nics.....etc.  Tastes like you just took it off the smoker and the brisket is tender and stretches a little before it tears, yumm. The sauce on the pulled pork is vinegar based with a little spice to it and their signature sauce is sweet but not overpowering (best bbq sauce I have had).  Sides are incredible (mac n cheese/cabbage, collards are my recommendations). Staff is unbelievably friendly! Flaws: they need another location! it is always hot in there (but that comes with the whole experience of being right next to all of the cooking equipment so it could really be seen as a pro and not a con depending on how you look at it). Recap:  this is hands down the best bbq but if you are planning on going with more than 4 people I would suggest getting takeout as there is not much room to sit.

Ok, came here to enjoy happy hour and the service was ok?  Waitress really did not want to help us, she rather be somewhere else for sure.  I have had better times in other bars, outdoor patios than here so I must only rate this an ok place.  Wish I could give it a higher rating? Why you ask?  The place is nice, just the service is ugh and the crowd.  Wish it could be a younger crowd, but it seems to attract Sun City here and not Surprise.  Luckily the patio is big so our group could be far from the other patrons.

The delicious meats, spreads and other concoctions are worth the trip.  The decor, the lighting, the location, not so much, but I put food over decor 9/10 times.The restaurant that was in this location before left such a bad impression in my mind that I wanted to try this new one quickly. I'm really glad I did.  We went here for a quick bite and wound up having a feast.  Their menu is ambitious, many types of Middle Eastern and Greek influenced preparation styles, each achieved with great success.The menu features everything east Mediterranean from lamb chops to kibbee to grape leaves to kafta.  The prices are a bit high, but when you look at what you get, it really is a good deal.  The owner was happy to beam about the fact that everything is brand new, everything is made in house and under his watch.We had the platter for 2.  Now, I'm cheap and a grad student so $25 is a good chunk for a weekday dinner for me, but man was this a bargin.  1 of each: beef kabob, chicken kabob, chicken kafta, beef kafta, hummus plate, salad.  Huge stack of pita, 2 falafel and 2 beef kibbee.  Everything was excellent.  The kabobs were excellently grilled, the falafel was crispy on the outside, fresh and moist on the inside.  The sauces that came with (garlic, tdaziki and tahini) were all great for everything on the plates.The decor needs a lady's touch and I really hope they spend a little cash in there to fix it up.  The location is prime for selling $5 gyro sandwiches til the cows come home (or at least til the lambs do), but if they want their excellent menu to keep the customers coming back they should fix the lighting and decor.  The old place was like a prison cafeteria, food included.  Out with the old!I'll be going back for a sandwich for sure.  And with the combo for 2 coupon for $22 they gave us, we might be seeing the huge boxes of leftovers in our fridge again soon.

I'm sad that I had a terrible experience here, because we live in walking distance and it had the potential to become a regular stop for us. BUUUUUUUT no. I had a living social voucher I think.. some type of social media discount. The first problem they had with me, was that my voucher wasn't printed. Well on my iphone it clearly states, either print out your coupon or show the merchant your mobile voucher. If you are not going to honor mobile vouchers then maybe YOU SHOULD PUT THAT IN THE FINE PRINT.After I made it clear they were going to honor this, they tried to tell me I couldn't use it for happy hour prices. Now I would definitely understand this too, had IT BEEN WRITTEN SOMEWHERE ON THE VOUCHER. Nope, nowhere. So our bitchy waitress goes to get her manager because clearly she doesn't have the brainpower to think of another excuse for not honoring this voucher....So then this braindead manager comes over. He proceeds to tell me that he would be fine with using it for happy hour prices but the computer will not allow him to do so. I tell him to enter it in to show me that it won't let him & SHOCKER. It does let him.Now why on earth would a place try so hard to make a customer unhappy. Because to say I left unhappy would be a fricken understatement of the year. DON'T PUT OUT A SOCIAL MEDIA VOUCHER IF YOU ARE GOING TO BE ASSES WHEN WE TRY TO USE IT.9/5/13Stopped in to use an expiring $20 for $10 Amazon Local Deals coupon**.  Was told to sit anywhere I'd liked, so I sat at one of the tables near the windows overlooking the Ice Den, the ice-skating rink next door-- pretty cool. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/18-degrees-scottsdale?select=3vIs8mTZeROUqDL3yPzWpw#3vIs8mTZeROUqDL3yPzWpw  There were booths alongside one wall that had their own flat-screens, which were nice touches, and an area with leather (or was it pleather?) seating, and yet another flat-screen, which looked inviting.  The young female server wasn't particularly enthusiastic or helpful about the menu offerings, but was honest enough to steer me away from the sweet potato fries when I inquired about them.  I have to agree with her that the green chile mac 'n cheese was the better option out of the two.  After studying the menus for many minutes, debating on trying three courses (app, entree, and dessert), or just two main entrees, and finally decided on ordering the Bacon and blue cheese burger, with green chile mac to start, and then later on going with the cheeseburger (cheddar) and subbed sweet potato fries for an extra $1.25.  (Perhaps she's not a sweet potato fry fan, or maybe she is and she didn't like the way they were prepared here?  I had to find out for myself.)  The burger patties weren't of high-quality-- I found them consisting of more fillers than meat and too fatty, yet not very flavorful.  I had a bit of the blue cheeseburger http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/18-degrees-scottsdale?select=KDB96IhpSqi3JgGvR259HQ#KDB96IhpSqi3JgGvR259HQ for lunch at work the next day, didn't enjoy it, and threw away the rest of both burgers that night.  Same thing with the sweet potato fries-- too soggy, even after I'd requested "extra-crispy," and not a lot of flavor.  The green chile mac was the only decent item I had.  Back to the burgers, I found it strange that the bacon and blue cheeseburger didn't come with any veggie trimmings ("only the cheeseburgers have them"), but I was given a plate of shredded lettuce and tasteless tomato slices when I asked.  The cheddar cheeseburger http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/18-degrees-scottsdale?select=LXfGcKQ1Z9fFAPSKVkRYFQ#LXfGcKQ1Z9fFAPSKVkRYFQ did come with lettuce and, even more interestingly, more flavorful and redder, tomato slices.The happy hour prices seem like a good deal, and it seems like a decent place to hang out and watch sports on TV, or to just  meet with friends, if hanging out at home, or someone else's, isn't feasible.  I thought it something novel to be able to watch both novice and experienced skaters practice next door...  I hope I can bump up my rating next time.  That is, if I return.**Sister with two kids were coming for a visit in August, and I thought I'd take them ice-skating.  The kids weren't interested in trying on ice skates, so the certificate went unused.

Review Text :
Came here for the Winter Beer Fest on a Saturday afternoon.  As usual, tasting glasses were $15 for the 1st round (you keep the glass) and each round after that is $4.  Not bad!  The lineup of Beer was pretty good, but not as good as the Summer Beer Fest in my opinion.  We arrived at 12:30 pm and here's a list of Beer I had:Stone Double Dry Hopped IPAStone Smoked Porter w/Chipotle PeppersBallast Point Brewing Company Dorado Double IPAStone Imperial Russian Stout Bourbon BarrelStone Smoked Porter w/Vanilla BeansBallast Point Brewing Company Sculpin IPABig Dog's Sled Dog StoutBig Dog's War Dog Imperial IPAMoylans Brewery Kilt LifterJoseph James Barrel Aged Desert DawnThey were all very good.  My favorites were the Stone Smoked Porter w/Chipotle Peppers.....I should have ordered this with a Burger.  Instead, I ordered a 16" Margherita Pizza ($13).  The Pizza was awful.....0 Stars.  I'm a Pizza lover too and I'm very tolerable about bad Pizza....but this one was soooo bad.  The crust was tough like cardboard and the ingredients were subpar.  You're not suppose to use regular Tomatoes on a Margherita Pizza....but that's what they did and they were bland.  Blech.  Ken M ordered Fish Tacos and he loved them.....I think I ordered the wrong menu item.  Oh well, next time I'll try a Burger.Overall, it was a good time.....I wish this place was closer to my neighborhood.  Return Factor - 99.9%I've noticed that I've only given Aces and Ales 4 stars.  Shame on me.  This is the best craft bar in Vegas.  What other place gets Deschutes Jubelale, seriously?  Even craft beer nerds from San Diego or Portland would be at least moderately impressed with Aces.  Sure, the atmosphere leaves something to be desired.  It does sort of feel like a dive bar.  But the craft beer selections here are the best that Vegas sees.  From Port Brewing to Double Dry Hopped Stone IPA to Belgian sour beers, Aces is the place for the true beer nerd.  The food has also improved since my last review.  I love the salads.  Try the Tuna Ahi Salad or even just the Caesar.  Awesome stuff.  If you don't like healthy food, the rest of the menu will definitely give you a delicious heart attack... at least you will die happy!  It is worth mentioning that Aces has events almost every weekend.  For example, the owner of Stone, Greg Koch, seems to visit annually.  Other great breweries that are new to the Vegas market take over the taps at Aces to offer their finest selections.  Parking can be a PITA though, so be prepared to park behind the gas station out back (not in front!).  SNAFU, the local homebrew club also has their monthly meetings here.Cheers!I wanted to love this place.  Everyone else loves this place.  But I don't.I must be an oddball.Anyway, I actually like the atmosphere here.  I like that it's dark and kind of divey with plenty of seats either at the bar or at the tables.  I like the super friendly servers.I've visited a couple times and although the menu rotates, it seems to be heavy on (very) dark beers.  It's the summer and it's hella hot outside- can I get something a little lighter?  Plus, the prices seem a bit high to me.As for the food, they have a decent selection for a bar and I'm impressed at the number of vegetarian options they have.  I've had the parmesan fries, fried cheese curds, and veggie pizza.  The parmesan fries are really good and the portion is large.  I have a mad crush on the cheese curds and like that they come with three different sauces depending on your mood.  I would come back to Aces and Ales for the cheese curds alone.I was completely unimpressed with the veggie pizza though.  The dough was raw in the middle, there were too many toppings so it was watery, and the mushrooms were old and funky.  I let my husband eat it.  He's not pickyAnd just a fair warning not to get here starving.  Our food took forever to come out.I think I'll give Aces and Ales another go if I'm in the area.  But it's much too far to make a trip when there are plenty of other places closer to me that I know I like.I can see why there's so much love from people who appreciate beer more than I do.  I'm guessing I'm a dummy that doesn't know any better.  Oh well.PS- Be prepared to get some odd looks and maybe hear a record scratch if you walk in as a newbie.  There are definitely regulars here that notice new faces.What a find! The only bad thing about this place is there aren't more around the Vegas valley. Talk about a beer selection.. Amazing! I got the oatmeal stout they had on tap. It was very rich, silky, and bitter. So good. My girlfriend and I got the pretzel appetizer to share. It was so good, and the mustard it came with was super good too. The only drawback the bartender didn't comp any of our drinks and we gabled quite a bit and she charged us a buck for a side of marinara sauce. haha no big deal just thought it was odd. If your ever in the area of Nellis and Flamingo I suggest checking this place out.I am not buying into the hype. This place was dumpy with snotty airheaded old bartenders who will snub the shit out of you if you are a girl. She "forgot" about my drink for 15 minutes until I pointed it out to the other bartender. Then the original bartender magically remembered. $20 for two shitty drinks and atrocious service. The manager was more interested in groping the bartender when he was behind the bar than actually checking in with patrons. Other than that, it is a standard dark, dumpy bar with a decent selection of beer. There are six TVs playing sports, 80s music blasting, and a pool table. I think they played Juke Box Hero like 5 times.  Video poker at bar. Smoking allowed. Weak drinks. Crowd is pretty old. Very meh ..not much separating from chains like yard house. Except at Yardhouse you aren't treated like shit. Also, the idiot airhead bartender added extra $2 to her tip to make it 20% which I am disputing with the bank. It isn't about $2.00 it's about the entitlement these idiots feel even when they provide below sub par service.I was in Vegas for work last week, and for the last night there I brought a coworker with me, we'll call him Mr. K, and explained that this might be the best beer bar he has ever been to.  I know.  I know.  That's a lot of build up.The receipt said Wendy and Jeff, and if that's accurate, both of them took excellent care of us.  They are funny, friendly, and knowledgeable about beer.  I love them.  OK.  I don't LOVE them love them. I'm not a complete weirdo.I was the DD so had to select my one drink very carefully.  I believe it was a New Belgium/Lost Abbey collaboration, Brett Beer.    I think this is supposed to be a sour ale, but it's not very sour.  I was calling it a farmhouse ale, but I don't think that's right.  I enjoyed it.  I don't remember exactly what Mr. K had.  I do know that one of his beers was aged in Wild Turkey barrels and he liked that a lot.Normally I am in awe of the beer, which is expected, but the food that night.  The food was amazing.  So simple yet so good.  I had the grilled cheese with cheddar, slices of apple, and bacon.  Need I say more?  Yes I do.  I also had the Arrogant Bastard onion rings, and when I forced one upon Mr. K, he said that was the best onion ring he has had in his life.  Yeah.  It's that good.He ordered a pizza with I think shrooms and sausage and possibly pepperoni.  I forget, but I swiped a piece and it was very good.  The crust is not too thick, not too thin, just perfect.  Delicious with the beer.Now I remember why my memory is so bad.  We were carbo overloading.  I've been thinking about the beer bites since the last time I was here and we started with those.  Just as good as I remember and I was happy to share since I knew we weren't done yet.I love this place.  And I mean really love it.Aces & Ales is a no frills bar, with an odd lay out, 5 tables scattered throughout, a killer jukebox, a solid selection of craft and microbrews, solid bar food, and cheap drinks.Monday nights they have a huge karaoke following. Starts at 12 AM. Karate Karaoke. You can earn you way up to a black belt. It's a great way to meet people and to people watch.Came here for a friend's birthday and it was a great time. The place was clean, the staff was friendly and accommodating for our large group. I wish it wasn't clear on the other side of town for me because I would invite people to come play and hang out here. The ladies room was also clean, too, which is real struggle in Vegas outside of casinos and nightclubs. Definitely a fan of this place.

I had the pleasure of having lunch here with my yelp buddy, Lisa G. and her well-mannered little guy last week.  I took vacation during restaurant week so I could purposely try different places.  Though Plum wasn't participating in Restaurant week, it has been on my list of places I MUST try.  This area of Shadyside is booming with restaurant activity and shopping places so it was quite a treat to find a parking lot above the restaurant for free!  We arrived there shortly before 1pm, and there were only a handful of people dining at this time.  It was very quiet inside.  The place had an echo to it, however the décor and the setup was lovely.  I did feel the urge to keep my voice down as it seemed to travel all threw the place.  To start we ordered drinks.  The waitress was very sweet to my friends son, and made his little drink to his exact specifications.  Gotta love a man who knows what he wants:) I ordered an Asian Sangria.  I am not sure what makes it Asian but it was yummo.  Very refreshing, but a little on the pricey side.   For lunch I ordered octopus sushi a la carte, and Shrimp Pad Thai which I requested be prepared spicy at a level 8.  I can say I actually found a sushi I wasn't thrilled over.  Don't get me wrong it was fresh, I just didn't dig the octopus the way I thought I would.  But it sure made a pretty picture.  My Pad Thai was pretty good, but not really spicy.  The waitress recommended another dish since I requested spicy but I stuck to the Pad Thai.  I love when the staff recommends things, I probably should have listened.  I look forward to returning hopefully for dinner next time, oh and next time here I am going all sushi baby!

Restaurant name  Braddock's Pittsburgh Brasserie

Review Text :
Braddock's should be admired for it's dedication to buying local.  Everything is described to you by friendly servers with where things come from.  Very impressive.  Especially for a hotel restaurant!  I think a lot of people have a common misconception that all hotel restaurants must be a chain of some sort.  It's nice that the Renaissance welcomes them in. The outer part of Braddock's is just a bar area or "Braddock's Streetside."  The back part of Braddock's is a fancy dining room.  It's really quite gorgeous inside.  I couldn't pass up a tasty looking beet salad so I ordered one up.  It's a beautiful presentation with two unassuming fried goat cheese balls.  But holy crap were those some amazing balls!!  The beets were good, don't get me wrong... and I liked shallot vinaigrette, but those cheese balls... star of the show!  I'd come back just for a plate full of those, even though I know it wouldn't be the healthiest option!  I definitely want to come back for dinner and get some of the other delicious sounding items and perhaps a cocktail.  It would be a nice date night spot.  Maybe even a romantical evening stay downtown at the hotel as well!  Fried cheese balls included in that package please!We stopped at Braddock's Pittsburgh Brasserie on a Friday night before heading over to the Byham Theater for the annual DVE Morning Show Comedy festival.  We had already eaten elsewhere so this visit was simply for wetting our whistles before heading to the show.We bellied up to the bar.  The bar area was moderately busy but not overwhelming.  From what I gather there is a dining room located across the way.  There was only one bartender and we patiently waited to be served.  The bartender was pouring some drinks for the patrons already seated.  I glanced over the drafts and picked an IPA to go with and waited, and waited some more.  In the meantime a party of about 6 rolled over to the corner of the bar where we were seated and were standing there.  We had probably been waiting about 10 minutes by now.  Finally the bartender comes towards us just to pass right by to the crowd standing at the corner!  Blood boiled; foot tapped hard, face red.  So you know I am not happy.  I am actually trying to tell this bartender that we had been waiting long before these folks walked over but he ignored me.  Thank God there was a server that just so happened to be behind the bar when this occurred.  I said, I guess kind of rudely, do you think you could get us a drink?!  He looked at the bartender and kind of shook his head saying he was a server and was trying to get the drinks for his tables but sure.  I said I was sorry but we had been waiting and was completely ignored.  He seemed sympathetic, almost like he was solemnly agreeing out of experience.  We finished the first round and thankfully the same server happened to be behind the bar again.  I asked for two more and our check.  I thanked him profusely and stated I believed they have the wrong person running the bar.  He saved this review from one star.  Great job, wish I knew his name.  Maybe some time I will try them again, but I would steer clear of the bar if that same bartender were working.

You know, maybe I am a diva or I just expect too much.  But when I get the worst possible service known to anybody, I don't care how good your pizza tastes.I go to Slices from time to time to get my pizza fix.  I always thought that they have great pizza and I love the different varieties that they have.  But I may never go back...ever...So I am in line waiting to be served.  (And when I say waiting, I mean at least 5 minutes with one girl staring at me while she is putting together boxes. )  Finally this guy came up and asked me what I wanted and I said the Tomato Basil and then asked him what pizzas just came out of the oven.  He told me and I said that I would also like a piece of Pepperoni and Mushroom.  I get to the counter and there is only the tomato basil waiting for me.  The girl (who loves her boxes) looked at me and I told her that I also ordered a Pepperoni and Mushroom.  She asked the guy and he said "I don't remember anything"  Ok, whatever.  So he gets a slice.  While I am waiting for that to warm, I told the girl that this was to go.  I am not kidding you she handed me a box and told me to put my pizza in the box.  (The two guys before got theirs boxed for them)  This place, especially the counter, is very small and I don't think it would hurt her to do some customer service and box my pizza.  I am now irritated writing this review.

This place has been here for over 25 years. They have had good times and bad times. Right now must be a good time. The place look great, fresh and clean. The service was ok but the manager dude was great. The food was good and they have some decent choices now. We had a fish plate with 2 big filet's, slaw, frys and hush puppies. I had 2 fish tacos and lobster bites. The plate was shared by both kids and they eat the majority of it and liked it. I had the tacos and while there are no good fish tacos in AZ these did alright. I would prefer not so crusty breading though. The lobster bites are fantastic but be sure to share them as the butter flavor get a little over powering and gross after 15 or so. Over all it is better the McDonald's and cheaper.

Restaurant name  The Green Owl
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Praise be, Madison finally has a vegetarian restaurant! Best of all, The Green Owl fits the bill as a go-to spot whenever you happen to be in town---it's casual, affordable and has a good-sized menu so you can try something new each time you stop by. About 80% of the menu is vegan and all vegan items are labeled. Green Owl also has rotating vegan dessert specials daily. If you're in Madison and you're vegan or vegetarian or just like good food, this place should be at the top of your list.The space itself is lovely: bright; colorful; retro-mod with a bistro-bar ambience. The bar up front is a bit cramped and too close to the front door (a chilly spot in winter) but it'll be great in the summer. Green Owl has a good selection of unusual wines and beers.I do wish that Green Owl was a bit more casual and offered original coffee & tea drinks, so that the space could double-up as a coffee shop as well. I think it would draw people in and (hopefully) steal away customers from less veg-friendly places in that area. It would also save me the hassle of driving a mile down the road to the Williamson Street Co-op to pick up a fresh chai for my frequent trips to/fro Minneapolis to/fro Chicago.I first time I went I had a BBQ jackfruit sandwich with roasted potatoes ($8). The sandwich tasted good on a whole, but was not without flaws. For one thing, there wasn't enough jackfruit---it seemed like only a few small pieces. Secondly, I don't know if mixing coleslaw on the sandwich worked with the smoky-sweet flavor of the barbecue sauce. Lastly, the artisan bread was not toasted enough, and was too thick; I would have preferred a thinner, toasted whole wheat option. The roasted potatoes were a tasty side, though.I also had a slice of coconut creme pie ($6) for dessert. This was spectacular. It was oh-so-subtly sweet, with wonderfully airy "creme" and nice crispy-crumbly notes from shaved coconut and a great crust. The second time I went to Green Owl I had the "vegetarian Italian beef" (which is vegan; $9). This sandwich was excellent and tasted just like Italian beef sandwiches, though with seitan. The bread got nicely soggy and wet and brought back many memories. I think the seitan could have been marinated more in the sauce, but it was a great-tasting meal and much better than the BBQ jackfruit sandwich. I got it with a side of kale crisps, which were also awesome, and not usually seen on menus. The portion size could have been slightly larger given the price, but this was definitely a high-grade meal and well-executed.For dessert I had a slice of New York cheesecake ($6) which came topped with strawberries, whipped cream, caramel drizzle, and one fresh mint leaf. This cheesecake was wonderful and one of the best I've ever had. It was rich, but not too sweet, and the interplay of the caramel, strawberries, mint and whipped cream was divine.On my third visit, I had the vegan schnitzel ($13) which comes with either a soup or salad. The soup was an amazing winter vegetable medley that was quite spicy (probably too much so for most people, but just perfect for me). The schnitzel itself was also spectacular---I've never had real schnitzel, but this was a breaded, meaty marvel covered in a savory mushroom stroganoff-style sauce. I enjoyed the garlic green beans and roasted red potatoes that also came with the dish. For dessert I got a chocolate mousse tart ($6) which came with raspberry sauce and soy whipped cream; this was delicious and the chocolate had a slightly minty flavor. Green Owl consistently does excellent desserts.For the fourth visit I had their crabby cakes sandwich ($9) which was tasty on fluffy white bread. It seemed a bit small for the price tag, but it was still good. On a whole, I would recommend the Italian beef or the schnitzel over anything else (I have yet to try their jambalaya, however). I also had a slice of key lime cheesecake ($6) which was good, and had a nicely browned/baked top layer, though it wasn't as good as the New York cheesecake I'd had a couple months back.The service is always friendly and helpful. On at least two separate occasions my server also got me samples of the other available vegan dessert of the day, which was a great way to help me decide which dessert to choose.Every town should have an all-purpose veg. spot like this one. I'm glad Green Owl is around, though I'm afraid it'll prevent me from ever trying other places in Madison!i hate to admit it. but i'm more impressed with the seasonal cocktails, the charming decor and the waitstaff than the actual food the restaurant provides.still, i think this place offers an excellent and much-needed service to the vegetarian/vegan crowd.Second time here, and still a fail. I want SO BADLY to like this restaurant. As a vegetarian, it can be hard to find good options at restaurants. However, for me, Green Owl falls flat on flavor and originality.Last go around, I had the TLT (tempeh instead of bacon) and kale chips. The TLT was just boring to me, and the kale chips too bitter (although, note that I'm spoiled by the chips I make at home).This go around, I tried the veggie chili and stuffed bell pepper. The chili was full of chunky tomatoes and some onions, but I only found 2 chili beans. The flavor was tomatoey without much spice (if any?). The stuffed bell pepper also had very little flavor, and I couldn't find any almonds or raisins in it (as the menu indicated). It would have been delicious with a variety of different spices, but instead was just another tomatoey-flavored soft mess. My table mates doused their food heavily with salt to make up for the flavor...I couldn't bring myself to add all that msg when some red pepper, cumin, cilantro, ginger, dear-god-anything would really have been amazing!For those who are vanilla eaters and don't like any sort of spice, this might be your perfect cup of tea. Or, if you're in to all the fake meats--most of the menu options involve fake meats. However, I'd rather eat something that isn't trying to be some meat entree. I'd rather my vegetarian meal stand on its own, as something delightfully yummy for what it is (not what it's trying to be). A focus on vegetables would be a nice touch, too...love my veggies! Vedge restaurant in Philadelphia is fantastic, for comparison...Oh, Green Owl, good luck...I want to try you and like you. I'll keep an eye on the menu to see if anything changes!There's a reason why the two-three star reviews of disappointed palates and deflated wallets share the same webspace as the five-star reviews that seem to feature broken capslock buttons, and read like they're taken out of an eBay customer satisfaction survey:You have to know what you're getting into when you come here.As the proprietor herself put it, The Green Owl seeks to:"...Please vegetarians and vegans--both those who gave up eating meat long ago and those who sometimes still miss it--as well as meat-eaters who eat out with their vegetarian/vegan family members and friends."Being Chinese, I'll proceed to do the math for you (and enjoy it!) as to what follows logically from that mission statement:Food:This restaurant is in no way a celebration of vegetarianism, veganism, or what distinct flavor profiles or textures vegetables themselves can offer.  Whereas Asian cultures, all with a high level of Buddhist influence, celebrate the many variations of tofu like Westerners celebrate cheese (there is popular franchise restaurants in China featuring Buddhist cuisine; all tofu, all the time), this place is expressly trying to make vegetation derived proteins and fibers resemble meat.In that respect, you can expect your "sloppy joe" or "fish sandwich" to undergo a bit more processing than a meat-based equivalent, to achieve the same desired goal.  Kind of analogous to how much makeup a drag queen needs to put on, in comparison to someone who is female to begin with; in our case, well the flavor just depends on if you notice the eggplant's Adam's apple or not.Money:All that vegetable makeup doesn't come cheap!  The irony is never lost on the Engineer in me that even though there's a roughly 10:1 conversion of pounds vegetation to pounds of meat, you can end up paying so much more for the vegetable "equivalent" (debatable, see above.).Atmosphere:If you're a vegetarian or vegan, you've probably already noticed that there tends to be a bit more malnourished rhetorical bravado within your demographic (skinny hipsters).  You're going to get those here.  In fact, you will probably be seated next to one, and he will probably be having a very opinionated conversation with himself (that his "friends" are forced to listen while they wonder why they bothered to go to dinner with this guy anyway) about why the wine this place serves isn't as baseball-glove-flavoured as another vintage.  I'm almost exaggerating, but this guy ruined my appetite more than the food ever could.Desserts:These babies deserve a separate section all their own.  Thankfully many desserts may use animal-based products, but at least they don't need to feature them.  In that respect, this place really shines for desserts.  Anything off of the dessert menu can stand in its own right, and there is no noticeable flavor nor texture difference between the vegetarian and vegan offerings.  They are also tastier and more unique than many offerings I've had at slightly more "upscale" foodie establishments in Madison.  Hell, I think this place may receive better reviews if it just became a completely vegan dessert shoppé.Director's Cut:My opinions of this location are tempered with the fact that I was a vegetarian for two short, hungry years, and I did it out of stubbornness for my best friend, who was one for most of her life, out of sheer love for animals (took me to a county fair, made me hug a piglet, told me to think about him whenever I wanted bacon).In that respect, I disliked this place, seeing its menu offerings as an affront to my stubbornness.At the same time, stubbornness can only last so long, and this place was absolutely amazing to my bestie, who's spent much, much longer than I have walking by every other brat and burger joint Madison has to offer.So there you have it, take a look at the menu ahead of time, try not to be disappointed by the obvious, cross your fingers that you'll be pleasantly surprised, and if all else fails, jump straight to the dessert!

Restaurant name  Mastro's Ocean Club

Review Text :
Delicious! We came for "Linner" and I just wish I was hungrier! At Morel's in the Palazzo, we met the most amazing waiter and totally chatted it up with him. He let us know that he also works at Mastro's Ocean Club so we also had to go visit him there...This restaurant is gorgeous to look at and basically looks like a tree house with the Crystal's shopping area of City Center. It's gorgeous!We started with amazing cappuccinos in the bar area since our favorite waiter, Dion, was not quite ready yet. I noticed that a cocktail that one girl in the bar was drinking was "smoking"... I think they put dry ice in it for effect!When we were seated for lunch, we ordered the fried onion strings as an appetizer and the escargot. The bread including "pretzel bread" was a great appetizer too. The onion string serving size was HUGE and could have fed about 8 people. The escargot were in amazing sauce that I dipped my bread into afterward! Then, I ordered the Cobb salad that came with a generous serving of huge prawns; it was delicious! He had the sea bass with the light bread crumb preparation and it was also amazing! We also shared the house mashed potatoes that included scallions, bacon, etc mixed in and were rich and delicious. What a fabulous late lunch/early dinner on the way to the airport! It was tough to leave Vegas after an amazing meal like that though!Excellent Came here with a party of 30 so I got to sample everything. We reserved their private dining room and it was fantastic. Service was great, the room was perfect because we could be as loud as we wanted, and the food stole the show. Must have....... would be their seafood platter. It's a 3 tier platter that comes with dry ice giving that smoky, cloudy look. It came with oysters, shrimp, king crab legs, and lobster over a bed of shaved ice. The bone in rib eye, bone in Kansas city, and bone in fillet were all perfectly cooked and seasoned. Do not get the fish here. The sea bass was a little overcooked and dry. Then again, why the hell would you order fish at a steakhouse? Lobster mashed potatoes was great but not when this cost more than the entrees. I was told that this dish was featured in Entourage and a few other magazines. We celebrated 8 birthdays so the staff gave us 8 individual desserts which was very nice of them. Their butter cake was to die for. My God that was good. Their bread pudding and apple crisp were also very delicious.I've dined at many a Mastro's, and I must admit: this location hooked me (and my rumbling stomach) + a pal for lunch because I found it architecturally intriguing. The staff in the front of the house were still very wet behind the ears. I was asked, "Is there any special occasion that you're celebrating? Anniversary, birthday...?" I replied that I am a living kidney donor and I celebrate that every day. My response didn't even register with the hostess and there wasn't any acknowledgment at all. *shrug* People have birthdays every year; it's not that often you have the privilege of donating a kidney. Just saying. I'm a sucker for waitstaff in white jackets; there's something very genteel about it that I absolutely adore, though the ambiance was a bit odd - the skylights above took away some of the mystery and glamour that one might otherwise enjoy over dinner. All the better to admire the lines and the strange view that our perch afforded us. Couldn't help but wonder: because the "pod" is not enclosed by walls, but mesmerizing woodwork that undulates and is breathtakingly organic... do shoppers at the nearby boutiques get distracted by the smells of the kitchen? "Yes, I'd like this limited edition Dior - hold up a minute - I need me a steak! " Surf, turf and couture - pinch me, please, and pass the pretzel bread, I'm wearing a silk shift with an empire waist - Carbonanza!!! The pretzel bread is otherworldly. I ignored the other varieties in the very generous bread basket, and asked for more pretzel bread, which was delivered warm, fluffy and perfectly salted. A healthy slathering of room-temperature butter didn't hurt, either. Even though I don't eat wheat, I was no match for the PB, and just surrendered to each bite of pillowy bliss. My virgin strawberry martini was not as tasty as the high octane version (yes, I had a sippie and was glad I did) and was just too sweet for my palate - but I had to wash all that PRETZEL BREAD down with something, right? Another quirk: there was a phantom lounge singer, who was, to be honest, not good at all... it was almost comical. It took me a while to figure out that it wasn't tongue-in-cheek lounge-lizardy - the dude was actually that schmaltzy. He was playing and singing live... but from an indeterminate location - I think it was behind the blue curtain - but it was just so odd, we kept laughing about it. My crab cocktail was okay... it was fresh and bright, but the last 1/3rd was frozen, because of the ice bath in which it sat. To their credit, when I pointed that out, a fresh one was brought out. The salads were nice. Nothing that knocked my Paul Smith espadrilles off, but I was very pleased that the greens were not drowning in dressing. Nice, simple, tasty. I plan to go again, but will make a reservation for dinner; lighting makes a difference, but then again... Pretzel Bread tastes good at any hour! BELIEVE.Before heading out for a night of partying at XS, my buddy and I found ourselves wandering around the Cosmopolitan looking for a good restaurant to try.  While the rest of our friends were grabbing dinner at the literal hole-in-the-wall pizza counter upstairs, we wanted to take advantage of the opportunity of trying something a little more unique.  Well, that is, assuming we could find somewhere that didn't have a crowd; each of our first few tries were met with wait times of 45 mins or longer.  Hoping for better luck at the mall at City Center next door, we eventually worked our way over to Mastro's Ocean Club to check things out there.  Greeted by a friendly hostess and the opportunity for immediate seating, our search came to an end.  Score for table seating by the bar!For a while now, I've heard a number of good things about Mastro's from friends in LA.  From the service to the food, they've all mentioned how great their experiences were.  At the end of my meal, I could certainly see what they mean.  After perusing through the menu of seafood and steaks, I ended up going with the grilled Chilean Sea Bass with a side order of the Garlic Mashed Potatoes for my friend and I to split (rather, I wanted it for myself, but needed to "share" it to justify getting it).  Now, I know...ordering a fish dish on my first ever trip to Mastro's is pretty counter-intuitive considering their reputation as a steakhouse.  However, given that it's one of their two Ocean Club spots, I figured that maybe I should give the seafood a shot since I don't know if it'll be as readily offered at their pure steakhouse spots.When our orders were brought to our table, I have to admit that it wasn't stunning at first glance.  Although the cut was larger than I had anticipated (which is never a bad thing), there wasn't much in terms of frills and dressing.  Since everything is a la carte, you literally get just the fish on the plate, with half a lemon on the side of seasoning.  Despite how lonely it may have looked though, there's no questioning the quality.  Although Chilean sea bass is generally more forgiving when it comes to cooking because of its fatty nature, this one was done perfectly regardless.  The meat was soft and tender, and it was moist throughout.  Flavor-wise, you couldn't ask for much more - modest seasoning to it, with a great buttery and velvety sort of flavor from the fish.  Excellent.As for our sides, the Garlic Mashed was pretty good.  I liked the consistency (thick, but not gloppy or too thin), and the flavor wasn't too potent.  While I would generally prefer a stronger punch to it, it worked well to not overpower the sea bass.  In addition, my friend also slipped in an order of the skinny fries, and let me tell you - a "basket" of fries here really is a basket of fries.  The order was this huge mound of fried potato goodness, and even after chipping away at it throughout our meal, there was still plenty left for our other friend to snack on when he joined us.  Oh, and I can't forget to mention their bread basket either - all served hot and soft with salted butter.  All of the ones I tried were good, but my favorite was the toast-like bread with cheese...so good.As for the rest of the experience, everything else was spot on.  Our server Sarah was awesome - really attentive, friendly, and pretty damn cute.  Now, I'm sure that last part MIGHT have had something to do with it, but seriously, really cute.  While it's kind of odd that it's located in a mall, I really liked the vibe of the place.  The main dining area is on a sort of a semi-open balcony (check out the pictures...quite a distinctive look), while they have a piano and singer by the bar.  While the music can make conversations a little tough, it's no worse than if you were sitting with a large group. While I do somewhat regret not having ordered beef instead of fish, I have no complaints about what I had either (plus, was still under that damn zero/reduced beef pledge).  That said, I know I'll be back to try more of their menu anyways (saw several tables with the seafood tower), as well as to get a table in their "tree house" section.  Great ambiance for a date as well, and while not a cheap meal, it's certainly worth the price.  But then, that could just be my waitress-induced bias doing the talking too..Thanks to the Mad Hattrix's mouth-watering review of the pretzel bread, Mastro's became my top choice of the perfect Vegas steakhouse to celebrate my steak-loving boyfriend's birthday.Knowing that the restaurant is located in Crystals--a shopping arcade (mall is far too down-market to describe this place) featuring Tiffany, Cartier, and LV--I had a feeling this would be an expensive celebration, and it was, but well worth it.Our table in the treehouse wasn't ready when we arrived, so we sat at the bar and ordered a drink. I thought I was prepared for Vegas prices, but I was wrong. Martinis that cost $18?! But when in Rome ...As our bartender raised the shaker to pour the martini into the oversize martini glass, I noticed that the cocktail shaker itself was about one and half times the size of your regular shaker. That's right, we got about three generous martinis out of that one shaker. Unfortunately, we'd each ordered a martini, which is why the rest of my review will be a bit vague.This Mastro's features a variety of seafood, and you can create your own seafood tower appetizer, even if it's only for one. We passed on a seafood appetizer and ordered a very good Caesar salad, followed by a bone-in rib eye for him and a bone-in filet mignon for me. Our waitress also sold us on the lobster mashed potatoes--1 1/4 pounds of lobster chunks folded into buttery mashies--so we enjoyed some seafood too.Between the monster martini and the addictive pretzel bread (soft with a slightly chewy exterior, sprinkled with salt), I had a hard time saving room for the entree and ended up taking half of it home. But it was one of the best filets I've ever had. Although I love the tenderness of filet mignon, I typically prefer the flavor of a rib eye. Both were excellent, even as leftovers.The restaurant provided a complimentary slice of chocolate cake to mark the occasion. And although it would have been nice if they'd given us their famous butter cake, which they'd talked up, it didn't really matter because I was too full to have even one bite.I guess I'll just have to go back for more pretzel bread and that butter cake. But next time, I'll definitely share a martini--and maybe remember a few more details.How can anyone not love this place?  Amidst Yelp's Spring Break festivities and other dining excursions we had in Vegas, the dining experience at MOC was one of the most memorable.  From the amazing "eighth wonder of the world" tree house we were sitting in, to a generous martini offering, to excellent overall service....it was beyond a five star experience. And I haven't even scratched the surface yet.   With all the eating going on in Vegas, I could have been very content with just their fresh pretzel rolls and a fantastic Campagna Burrata salad.  But I couldn't resist and......order more pretzel rolls.  They were just too addicting....try their Brussel Sprouts.  Lightly salted to perfection....taste the Lobster Mashed Potatoes.  One order can feed an army.  ...sample their Petite Filet.  Medium rare truly melted in my mouth....and savor the Seared Sea Scallops.  Cooked just right with an orgasmic garlic butter sauce. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/GI-CAiZ_Gg3h21PwrANB4Q?select=krtNnXcIArthzdx-FQ1_RA#MwXtyVuKcCbgmgFiZySLuQ)Just when I thought it was over, I was reminded of their infamous Warm Butter Cake for dessert.  So I had to be a teamplayer and try a little.  It was heavenly.  No matter how full we were, dinner was not complete without indulging in this popular dessert...and the accompanying gigantic bowl of whip cream. I discovered that 10 spoonfuls is "just a little taste" when it comes to this cake topped with vanilla ice cream and sliced strawberries. Ay! Their mysterious live piano artist kept us entertained and added a nice touch to the ambiance of not only the restaurant, but around all of Crystals mall. This will not be the last time I dine here, that's for sure. Even though we were running late to a Yelp event, it was well worth it!Good, straight forward fish house / steakhouse.  Best of all, you get to dine in a contemporary "pod" in the middle of Crystals (they call it a tree house, either way its cool).  Unfortunately, because of it's mall location, it doesn't feel like a special occasion, destination restaurant rather  "I'm hungry after all YOUR shopping, oh look, a restaurant, let's eat".With the exception of a few starters and a hand full of mains, you get exactly what the menu says, unadorned. No special sauces, no veg.  Just fish or beef on a plate.  Portions are large.  Unless you're hungry, pass on the starters.  They are traditional (raw bar, seafood cocktails).  You can get them anywhere.  Fish is expertly cooked to order.  The thick cut fillet of pan roasted Chilean sea bass and salmon are excellent.  Cooked medium with no sign of albumin (white substance that comes out of fish if the cooking temperature is too high).  Both were moist and naturally oily, exuding their naked fish flavors.  Good quality prime steaks.  Decent aging.  Good selection of bone in cuts.   Sadly, nothing sets them apart from other quality steakhouses in Vegas.  The bone in fillet is tender, mildly flavored.  No complaints.  For sides, its gotta be the rich and incredibly flavorful, king crab and truffle dressed gnocchi or the lobster mashed potatoes.  Chunks of lobster enveloped in a buttery mash that explodes with lobster flavor.  I could eat either an a main and be happy!  Solid wine list.  Vegas resort pricing.Sometimes "a kiss is just a kiss..."  and that's fine by me.Seems like I've been on a steak kick recently, which makes me realize that my stomach and wallet are inversely proportional. After visiting Gordon Ramsay and Old Homestead recently my gut has increased exponentially while my wallet is shrinking dramatically. Mastros, of course, had the same effect.Our party of four dined family-style and sampled the following:A dozen oysters (Kusshi and Bluepoint). All were delicious but, personally, I prefer the smaller Kusshi.The ahi tuna tartare was beautifully presented in a cylindrical stack with, perhaps, too much avocado, but contained plenty of fresh tuna and a variety of textures and flavors. Ocean Club crab cake. There was very little filler, nice big chunks of lump meat, and a perfectly balanced tartar sauce.The scallops were too rich and buttery and was drowning in sauce. The accompanying toast was deliciously crisp and cheesy.The 22 oz bone-in ribeye, cooked medium-rare, was tender and had a decent amount of fat, as was to be expected. A solid steak, but not as mind-blowing as the beef from the top steakhouses around town.Alaskan king crab black truffle gnocchi. A little dense with a rich, cheesey truffle flavor. Pieces of crab were scarce, but there were plenty of gnocchi for the four of us to share.Alaskan king crab legs. 5 large legs, slightly warm, with clarified butter and lemon. Each yielded plenty of tender meat.That was plenty of food for all of us, but we couldn't leave without trying their infamous warm butter cake. It was large enough for each of us to get a few bites. It came with a ridiculously large side of fresh whipped cream. I was expecting the cake to have a very moist texture, but instead it was a bit more firm with a slightly crispy exterior. The flavor was as sweet and buttery as you would expect. As delicious as it was, it's not something that my arteries and heart can take too frequently.Mastors is pricey, but not as pricey as other steak or seafood houses along the Strip. The atmosphere isn't the greatest either. It is located in the center of a shopping mall, afterall. There's no dim, mood lighting. Just the bright florescent  lights of the mall. The tree house thing looked cool, so request that if you have the chance. We sat just outside of it and it had all the appeal of eating at a food court.There was also live entertainment in the lounge area when we dined. I had to do a double-take because the girl performing looked like Aubrey O'Day. I didn't stick around long enough to see if she had the voice or attitude to match.I'm not sure how this Mastros compares to the ones in California that people rave about, but relative to Vegas steakhouses it's a solid option. It's a step below the top ones in town, but is great for seafood and, of course, the butter cake.After living in Vegas for about a year, this is easily the most disappointing high end meal I've had.  I'd give the food a 4/5 but the service was probably a 1/5.ServiceThe first disappointment was waiting.  We had a reservation and even so I can understand waiting by the bar for a few minutes.  However, we wanted far more than a few minutes.  Our "leader" went up to the front to inquire and they said on someone will be by shortly to seat you.  That didn't happen so we had to check back again and someone gave us the apology of "oh, I'm sorry I thought they came and got you."Maybe a miscommunication, but certainly something that could be excused.  However, things didn't get better from there.  It seems like about 10 minutes from when we seated until we even got drink menus, then another 10-15 before the drinks arrive.  Easily 15 minutes before bread arrived at the table.  It just felt like everything was so slow.  After the first round of drinks came our waitress or waitresses seemingly disappeared.  I mean when you have a table of 10 people ordering rounds of $15 cocktails or better you'd figure service would be fast.  I think they easily missed out on  at least 1 extra round due to the slow service.If you look at the prices at Mastro's and compare it to other places across town, you would expect to have a waiter or waitress that knows the menu back and forth and can describe all of the stars.  We got none of that.  I would say our service was at the level of an average chain restaurant.  You aren't adding any value when you ask about menu items and the waitress just lists 3 things that are "good".  We asked how the steaks come and the reply was something like "what do you mean"?  I mean are they seasoned, sauced, dry aged?  There is no explanation on the menu or listing of sauces or accompaniments for the steaks...."oh yeah, they are seasoned and broiled"....thanks.This was followed up with no description or explanation of any sides.  During the meal we couldn't even locate the waitresses and people were still anxious to get more drinks.I will say that the food was good.  The steak was unique in the regard it was so warm when it came out.  Usually food has somewhat cooled but their steak still had a sizzle and was warm for the first few bites, pretty good.  The asparagus was nothing special.  The lobster mashed potatoes were good but at $40 can be steep for a side dish.  Crab gnocchi was good, but I'm not crazy about gnocchi so I'm not an expert.  The problem in Vegas is that you can find a place equal to Mastro's food wise with probably lower prices so suffering through bad service can be a deal breaker.Needless to say, nobody ordered dessert or drinks after dinner.  With so many other options in town for steak I probably wouldn't come back for that.  I will say I tried the ahi tuna sashimi which seemed great for under $40.  I didn't try it but the swordfish looked the same.  I would come back if I was in the mood for seafood but would be nervous about the service, maybe with a smaller party and a better table things would be better.My favorite place to dine in Las Vegas!(1) Service - I forgot his name but awesome, awesome server! Best service ever. He was hot too! Drools! 5 stars for amazing service and seating me with a hot server.(2) Seafood Tower - massive shrimp, king crab, lobster, three types of oysters, and massive mouth jizzy. (3) Bone-In Ribeye - mouth jizz... must get! 5 stars(4) Lobster Mash Potato - one of my favorite dishes. Drenched in BUTTER... yum! 5 stars(5) Asparagus - well cooked! 5 stars!(6) Bone Marrow - 5 stars!(7) Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi - 5 stars(8) Birthday Chocolate Cake - I got this for free... so sweet of them... but it wasn't my birthday... I think they gave it to the wrong person.(9) Coffee - a little weak... I wanted a strong one... so I can get ready for the clubbb... yeahhhhh... woots!OVERALL** Yup! That was all for 2 people... haha! I eat a lot! Massive bill... but worth every of my penny!I just can't say that I am a fan of this famous steakhouse, but hubby is definitely a fan of their steak, so still 4 stars, the service was over the top, the restaurant is classy and beautiful. Decided to have anniversary dinner there, we asked to be seated at one of those window tables in the tree house, our host managed to get us one, very nice of her. Started off with bottle of French champagne, loved it, the bread basket was so delicious, just too much for 2 people, it could easily feed up to 5 people seriously! The hard part was to order, the entire meat section is out, that's pretty much all of the items on the menu. Saw seafood and sushi choices, a bit relieved really, glad I am usually a Pesce at nice restaurants, otherwise I would have nothing to order except salads or some sides, that would be miserable at a nice restaurant, wouldn't it ? Our server introduced lots of things, we decided to do chilled seafood platter first, a little bit of everything on the platter: The presentation of the platter was amazing, smokes came out of the prawns container, so beautiful and appetizing. The Kumamoto oysters were so good, the lobster claw meat was fairly tender. But the other things in there were bad, the crab & lobster meats were so hard and chewy, the prawns were even harder. They were hard to cut, even harder to swallow, we didn't finish them, so wasteful... The horseradish and cocktail sauces were so good, added nice flavors to chilled seafood. Clam chowder soup with garlic bread: our server was so nice to split the soup for us, even though we didn't ask so, the soup was still huge after splitting, too bad I didn't want any soup, so I just gave it to hubby, kinda felt bad for our server's thoughtful gesture. Lobster roll: had it as my entree, it was bad, really? The rice was thick, the stuffing was not that flavorful, I didn't like the cream sauce came with it, I had one and half pieces, and stopped eating. 12 oz bone in filet in medium rare: the plate was 400 degrees hot! Perfectly cooked to medium rare, the steak melted in hubby's mouth right away, he said it tasted amazing! Absolutely loved every single bite of it! Mushroom side: I love mushrooms so much, but those mushrooms were flavorless, they were just not that good. I had one bite, that's it. So, either my taste buds were numbed from too much drinking? Or Mastro's is really just for steak lovers? My food was just bad... I didn't even eat that much, just sat there , sip on my champagne, and tried very hard not to fall asleep in the middle of a dinner date.... They gave us anniversary chocolate cake with a lit candle, so beautiful, and a huge plate of whipped cream too. The cake was so good, both of us loved it, so yummy! I had a 20 -yr -old tawny ($27) to go with it, it was amazing. It's a famous steakhouse, of course it's pricey. Reserved wine list starts at $100 a bottle, up to 10 thousand. Tab was $350 for two. To be honest, I didn't like my food, dinner experience was good, I was just too sleepy to really enjoy it. Their restroom located upstairs next to private dining room, the elevator to upstairs was claustrophobic. And I don't think this place is good for dinner date, food is too much for two people, impossible to finish everything. The restaurant is too bright, not intimate at all. But it's great for family, group dining, or steak lovers!I made reservations for dinner on a Thursday evening and my hotel was nearby so I was able to walk here. I heart the decor of the tree house dinning which we were seated at. See it: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mastros-ocean-club-las-vegas?select=VeYIzprrIievG0x5eYXb7Q#VeYIzprrIievG0x5eYXb7Q This Mastro's has three levels dinning areas and tree house is on the second floor with views of the Crystal mall.  Ordered a a bottle of Napa Cabernet Sauvignon after the yummy bread basket arrived. Followed with the iceberg wedge salad which contained smoked maple bacon and chunks of blue cheese - refreshing and so yummy. For the main entree I opted for the 22 oz bone in rib eye - cooked medium rare and a side of the Alaskan King crab black truffle gnocchi. As with every Mastro's I've dined at, the food and service were impeccable. If you're a fish eater check out the Chilean sea bass here, it was incredibly fresh and delicious. We ended the meal with the chocolate sin cake which was moist and a perfect ending to conclude the meal. Even though Mastro's was bought out last year, the quality and service in my opinion are at the top tier of the industry. BTW, have a beverage in the bar before or after dinner for some interesting people watching.Thank you to the entire staff at the Las Vegas Mastro's for an awesome dinning experience!I have eaten at this location more times than I can remember.  I adore the gorgeous setting in Crystals, part of City Center in Vegas and  I love sitting at the opulent marble bar and enjoying a glass of wine.  The bartenders on this particular night were a little busy so we were not getting the service we usually would expect, but it was still good.  We ordered oysters for the appetizer.  As always, fresh and delicious!  The seafood here is consistently fresh and perfectly prepared. I have never had the steak, but people rave about that as well.  Mastros, you never let me down.  Next time I am home, I shall visit you.For starters I really wanted to give this place a great review because the food was good, but after receiving my bill I just can't do it.Our total bill came up to $243.23. That's not my complaint. My complaint is that we left a cash tip and when we saw the charge on the card, it was for $291.88. I'm glad I kept my receipt.This prompted a call from me to the restaurant today to find out why there was an additional $47.00 charged to my card without disclosing it to me. The manager told me that the company they use AUTOMATICALLY adds a 20% gratuity to the bill. This was not disclosed to us by the waitress. It was not disclosed on our receipt. In fact, when I called, he said they receive that complaint at least 5 times a day, as if that's the normal order of business. FIX IT if people are complaining. You have no right to charge them an additional 20% without disclosing this BEFORE  they eat.Tips are VOLUNTARY, not mandatory unless disclosed. I leave my tips in cash and I always cross out the tip line on the receipt.  The money isn't the issue,its the principle that they have no right to take my money without my permission. That is basically theft. So now, I have to wait 2-3 business days for the additional $47 to be refunded to my card, which means I won't see my money until Tuesday or Wednesday, since we ate there Friday night. Other than this absurd experience with my bill, here is a review on the food.1) The customer service is great except for not disclosing that I'll be charged an additional 20% even if you leave a cash tip.2) The  crab cakes were good, but both my wife and I had a small piece of shell. Nothing worth complaining about.3) My wife had the blackened ribeye. It was delicious.4) I had rack of lamb. it was delicious.5) Twice baked potato was good.6) Gorgonzola mac & cheese was good.7) Clam chowder was good.8) Calamari was just OK.9) The complimentary bread was mostly hard except for the pretzels. I don't mind a mix of breads, but when the majority are hard, its just not for us. Overall, the food was good, but we will not be going back until the change they policy of charging people an additional 20% without their knowledge.If you eat here PAY CASH.I've been fascinated by this "tree house" for the longest. This was my first time visiting Mastro's and I had long heard of the famous warm butter cake, so I was excited to come for a pharm. rep dinner, get to learn and try a new place. We made our selections from a pre-set menu.My first course I went with the Caeser Salad, this was pretty standard except for the bits of anchovie throughout, which is my favorite kind of Caeser. For my entree I chose the 8oz filet. I asked for it to be prepared medium. What came out was between rare and tartare. Since we were in a small private dining room for the lecture, I didn't feel comfortable sending my steak back, it would be disruptive, and I didn't want to interupt the lecturer. I ended up giving it to my friend to take home to her dogs.The family style shared sides weren't impressive either. Mashed potatoes had no flavor, and the sugar snap peas as well. Only one I liked was the creamed spinach. Dessert we had a choice between chocolate sin cake and cheesecake. I went with the chocolate cake, it came with a side of homemade whipped cream which I thought was better than the cake itself. Pretty disappointing meal all together. I would come back for a second try, just not in a hurry to do so. I definitely enjoyed the lecture more than dinner.I brought clients here on a Thursday evening for dinner around 800 pm. I recommend reservations since  the place gets busy. My clients who arrived from Denver around a year ago and never experienced Mastro's previously so I knew they were in for a treat.We started off with drinks at the table  once we were  seated and were brought the awesome bread basket -  I indulged in the pretzel bread yum! We ordered a few appetizers - scallops, crab cakes and ordered our starter salads. I opted for just the 1/2 salad of the iceberg wedge - it's plenty large and so yummy. For my main entree I went for he rack of lamb and we shared several twice cooked potatoes and cream spinach. Everything was spectacular and the service was stellar! My lamb was cooked to perfection and  my clients were impressed as I expected. The only con was nobody had room for buttercake!I received a telephone call from Mastrro's the following day thanking me for my business which again is so out of the box. I'm happy to see even with the change of ownership that nothing has changed here!*** Word of warning: this steakhouse is located inside a mall and you will most likely have a view of a high-end store while you eat. *** Typically, I'm a huge fan of Mastro's and every time we are celebrating a special occasion, we will pay a visit to Mastro's. Unfortunately I was a little disappointed in the Vegas location. I will start with the pros. The food was sublime. It was exactly the quality of food Mastro's provides at their locations in Phoenix. I started with the Ocean Club Salad which came with fresh shrimp with blue cheese dressing, avocado and tomatoes. The salad was refreshing and delicious and filled me up! However, I wasn't done just yet. Following the salad, I ordered the crab cake and shared the lobster mac and cheese with my husband. The crab cake was made of fresh crab and was more crab than filling which was perfect. The Lobster Mac and Cheese is always a must and you can't visit Mastro's without ordering it! I also stole a bite of my husband's filet which was cooked to perfection. Yes, I did roll out of the restaurant but rolled out fat and happy from the amazing food! They cook everything to perfection and it's always a gluttonous good time. So why the three stars? Sadly, that goes to ambiance and service. The restaurant in located inside a mall. Granted, it's a very high-end mall but it's still a mall just the same. That wouldn't make a huge difference except that the restaurant has an open floor plan with an open balcony which means you are looking out into the mall while you eat. It's very light and bright and just doesn't provide for a very romantic experience. They do have a tree-like structure that you can eat in which hides the mall a little bit, but it's hard to forget that you're in a mall during your meal. Considering that it's Vegas and there are so many venues with wonderful ambiance, I would choose another restaurant next time. The customer service was also a bit disappointing. I felt like we were always trying to get our server's attention. He wasn't very attentive to us and anytime we wanted to order another drink or food, we had to hunt him down. We were going to order dessert but it took him so long to check on us that by the time he came to our table, we were just ready to go at that point. I would have liked it if the server was a bit more attentive so that we didn't have to track him down the whole meal. While the food was amazing, the ambiance and service left something to be desired and since Vegas has so many restaurants to choose from, we will choose a different restaurant during our next visit to the Strip.Mastro's was the capstone in a hedonistic tour-de-force of eating and drinking, and oh what an excellent climax it was! We set up dinner reservations for 6:30 prior to a 9:45 flight that would get us the hell out of Vegas; while it wasn't the best idea in terms of timing, we were just super eager to eat at Mastro's and couldn't cram it in earlier in the trip.We were seated in the middle of the big floating wooden structure, which was excellent for the view and being in the middle of all the hustle and bustle of the restaurant (something I really like). Our waiter was excellent; he made us feel at ease and happily answered all our questions about ordering.The first order of business? A nice bottle of wine. Fortunately, they had several wines in the $60 range that I like and pair nicely with both fish and meat (keeping our options open :-) ). We chose the 2009 Grgich Hills Merlot, and sat around merrily sipping until our starters came.The Seared Albacore with Truffle (see the picture) was really damn good. I could have eaten two plates of that and been happy. The Tuna Tartare was good, but not amazing. Yep, I've dinged it for "not being amazing". We went in all different directions for main course: one bone-in steak, one cooked fish dish, one sashimi tuna dish. All were excellent. The sides were excellent. Everything was excellent. See a pattern?Somewhere in the middle of the main course we ran out of wine and unconsciously ordered another! Why not go out with a bang.The hour was winding down, our stomachs at near capacity, and fears of the implications of missing our flight creeping in, yet we got dessert. The Warm Butter cake. Dude. Best part of the meal. Might have been the best part of the weekend. Don't go without it.Thanks Mastro's for an awesome dinner. I'll be back next time I'm in Vegas.He always said we should have a nice proper steak dinner.  But every single time I'm in town, we end up skipping the whole steak thing.  But this time, his boyfriend had a client to impress, so we off we went on a steak dinner.  Yay me!Anyhow, since it is rare back home in Honolulu to find a filet with bone in, that's what they got.  Myself, because my eating habits have changed (boo!!) I opted for the petite filet.  I know, sad, right?  I got 8 ounces of meat!  Not the 12 ounces they ordered.  I got my meat rare, cold center, hot plate.  Mmmm I just love a good piece of meat especially when you can control how you're gonna receive it.  I got it just the way I want it, which is actually hard to come by.  I'll take it the way I want it.  He says out loud, "you think you know a person," when I ordered my meat rare.  Oh, honey, you've known me for how many years now, and you still don't know how I like my meat?  As rare as can be is how I like it and I got a true piece of meat perfection.  You know that I ate all of it!  I love me some meat!The rest of the dishes were typical.  Salads, soups, sides were just regular, nothing extraordinarily spectacular to really write about.  The portions for those items are generous, I must say.  We did order a bottle of wine to go with dinner.  I think it was a shiraz.  I didn't pick it out, but it did go well with dinner.  And since it was their birthday, there was dessert.  Not 1, but 2, since two of them were celebrating.  One was a butter cake and the other a chocolate cake.  How nice, right?  We couldn't finish the desserts, but I must say they were very rich and of course yummy.Would I return again?  Most definitely!  It's good that this place was a nice walk from our hotel.  I sure am glad that they are open late, since my eating habits were out of wack.  I love me some meat!!Dinner in a treehouse! It was my first time visiting Mastro's located in the shops at Crystals.  This beautiful and elegant dining can be seen while walking through.  The 'treehouse' as they call it sits directly in the center so it's very hard to miss.  The wooden structure will catch your eye in a heartbeat.  We made reservations for our group and were seated early.  I would like to give a tremendous thank you to Paul our waiter.  I don't think I've ever been so entertained while receiving the best service anyone could ask for.  He went above and beyond to make our evening memorable. The table is brought a bread basket which has 3 options. I will say their pretzel bread called my name.  I asked for more in which Paul graciously brought an entire basket of just those.  Fantastic! I started with the wedge salad.  Perfect and delicious.  The crumbled bacon had a great flavor combined with the creamy blue cheese.  For my entree I chose the Chilean Sea Bass accompanied by creamed spinach, Gorgonzola mac and cheese and Alaskan king crab black truffle gnocchi.  Of course all of the sides are huge and were shared between all of our group.  The sea bass was so light, fresh and baked perfectly.  The gnocchi was a disappointment.  I don't think there were any crab pieces in this. But the other two sides definitely made up for it.  They were so creamy.  Anything with Gorgonzola will make me happy. Simply delicious!If the appetizer, bread basket or main meal didn't fill you up, they have a great dessert list.  On top of that list is their signature butter cake.  It's topped with vanilla bean ice cream with strawberry drizzled around the cake.  It's calorie free and fat free... In my dreams! It's moist and delectable.  After the huge meal, I would suggest splitting this huge cake.  Mastro's delivered an impeccable meal with first class service.  It was surely a memorable evening!I'm so disappointed to write this review.  We had such high expectations of Mastro's having been to their other locations.  Celebrating our wedding anniversary and completely giddy, we sat down, ordered cocktails and dove into the incredible bread basket.  Our waiter seemed annoyed with us from the start, but no big deal, we ignored it.  I ordered chicken (please spare me the "you don't order chicken at a seafood place" lecture...I ordered it because it was on the menu, so let's get through that, k? Lol).  Our waiter was non-existent all evening, so he wasn't around at all for me to tell him that the chicken was glaringly under-cooked.  The manager happened to see us looking around and took it back to the kitchen.  He brought the same re-cooked piece back, but one spot (it was a really thick piece) still didn't look ok.  We had the flash light out and kinda debated if it was cooked enough, but the chance of eating slightly under-cooked chicken and getting sick was not an appealing option to me.  (And should I be having this debate at such a fine restaurant?).  I decided not to chance it, but not say anything.  The manager saw me not eating (our waiter was still in abandonment mode), took it away and insisted on replacing it with a filet.  The filet came out and was delicious and we were happy, albeit the mood had changed.  We felt like we had done something wrong.  Honestly, our least favorite meal of the whole weekend.  No butter cake, no second drinks--happy anniversary to us.  :(Thank you to the manager for not charging us for my chicken or filet and really trying to fix it, but I'm so sad we spent our anniversary there.The fourth new discovery that was a five-star worthy dining experience was at Mastro's Ocean Club.  I had heard good things about this place for at least two years, and before then espied its distinctive wooden bird's nest with admiration at its quite innovative and modern design just before the restaurant's opening inside The Shops at Crystals.It was the day of our 25th wedding anniversary, and our request for seating inside the nest was granted.  It actually felt like being two young birds sheltered inside a protective nest.  Not only that, but we were surprised at meal's end with a complimentary Warm Butter Cake ala mode, Mastro's signature dessert.  This was a great mouth-watering end to a very memorable meal, as the soft cake seemed to melt in the mouth. But the beginning of our meal was no less auspicious.  After enjoying a bread basket that included large homemade pretzel breadsticks, Diane and I dove into succulent hot Vanilla Battered Shrimp.  These big crustaceans bursting with flavor really deserve to be called "prawns" rather than "shrimp," and did deliver a taste of vanilla in the light batter--but not overpoweringly so.For our main we each ordered an 8-oz Filet, which here is called a "Petite Filet," along with 1-1/2 lbs. of Alaskan King Crab Legs.  Both tender steaks were cooked perfectly medium rare as ordered, and with little char on top.  Accompanying Bearnaise Sauce was drinkable, and a Peppercorn Sauce was not far behind.  The hot and long sections of crab legs were pulled out of the pot at exactly the right moment  and presented as already opened legs, so no prying with tools was necessary.  They tasted great dunked in warm drawn butter.  And while Diane praised her large and cheesy Twice Baked Potato, I delighted in a huge mound of skinny Sea Salt & Vinegar Fries, which was reported to be a small rather than regular-sized version.  Sauteed Mushrooms were lovely, too, but I hardly needed them.  We were stuffed.  With a ratio of about one waiter for every four guests, service was great.  Our knowledgeable and conscientious server checked on us several times, and water refills were regularly poured without any need to request them.  Even with the restaurant packed with guests, the ambiance inside the bird's nest section of the restaurant was romantic, intimate, and classy.Mastro's is pricey to be sure.  But, executing well at delivering artfully prepared high-quality offerings from both land and sea, there is a reason why several local diners in the know call this one of the best restaurants in Las Vegas.  Without question we will soon become repeat guests.

I usually try to check out a restaurants health inspection before I go there...this time I did not. The pizza was alright, nothing special, my daughter wanted to go because I think she liked the guy behind the counter. Anyway, after going home and looking them up I discovered they have failed their last 2 inspections for things like debris on their meat slicer, food not at correct temps, and worst of all there was indication that they were either smoking in the kitchen, smoking outside with the kitchen door open, or both. This is unacceptable to me that employees of a food establishment would even think this was ok...here is the link to look them up and other restaurants http://www.maricopa.gov/envsvc/envwebapp/business_search.aspx?as_page_title=Food%20Establishments%20Search&as_type=FoodWe have ordered pizza to go a couple times from Garden Pizza and have enjoyed it, but recently we decided to stop in for dinner. I have a whole new opinion of the place since then. I really enjoyed the staff who were extremely welcoming to us and all of the patrons they interacted with. We ordered a large meat pizza which was huge! My husband can eat pizza so I was shocked when we had several pieces left. We were also happy to see the pizza and wing combos that are available. I ordered a glass of wine which turned out to be a mug of wine (did I mention I love this place) for $3.50. It's close to our house and an amazing local business. They also have awesome salads. We will definitely be back!

It's definitely one of the best Korean restaurant in montreal. I had the typical dish at this bibimbap recommended by my colleagues who had been there many times. I had the beef variant with atti sauce. The food was delicious. It is so fresh and the special atti sauce makes the difference. The food comes with soup, kimchi and salad. It was worth every penny. In the lunch hour don't miss out the drinks for $3. It's the only place where I find it so cheap. Cheap and "the best" Korean food.

This was my second visit to this tiny restaurant on the main drag in Mt Lebanon.  I had been once before a couple years ago for dinner but decided to try lunch while in the area.  I had ordered a tagine for dinner and wasn't in love with it.  It was really heavy as I recall even though I had ordered chicken.  It was awhile ago but I can remember thinking it was expensive and not brilliant.  I ordered the appetizer platter for lunch and it was absolutely terrific.  It had a black bean hummus, vegetable hummus, roasted vegetables and an eggplant dish.  It was served with a small side salad minty and lightly dressed and surrounded by a fortress of grilled pita wedges.  We were going to go to Aladdins but their pita is thin and looks and tastes like shoe leather.  This pita was really nice.   It had a grilled flavor and was a quality product.  The hummus were great.  I loved the vegetable hummus, it was spicy and nicely seasoned.  Everything on the plate was delicious.  I would definitely come back and try some more.  I should have given them another chance years ago.Very tiny and cramped space, so go early or make a reservation, and hope that you're not seated near the door, as there is nothing between you and the winter wind when it's opened. The food here is made from scratch and very fresh, and I very much enjoyed my lunch of house salad and soup of the day, which was a tangy and delicious tomato bisque. The salad is very lightly dressed with a minty vinaigrette and was tasty. I would go with the veggie sampler next time, as my husband ordered ti and it was great. I have had the chicken tagine and found it swimming in a little too much oil for my taste. Great place to go if you're a vegetarian.For just under 16 dollars, my mom and I enjoyed traditional Moroccan food made from scratch and drizzled in love.Kous Kouse has simple decor and limited seating, but from the moment you enter - the staff here will go out of their way to make sure that you feel welcome.My mom ordered the tomato soup of the day and I ordered the salmon tagine with fragrant rice.The tomato soup was made that day and my mom adored it. It was creamy and rich with flavor. My salmon tagine was exceptional. It was made in a clay pot and the salmon was tender and soaked up the tagine sauce nicely. There was a great array of accompanying vegetables and the rice - though small in portion was spiced and melted in the mouth.Leading up to our meal - we could see their chef preparing everything with precision and care. Everything was made there and on the spot - and though it can be a little slow at times - it's because the food is fresh and not re-heated.My mom and I were tempted to order dessert, but being that we were under a tight schedule - we thanked their kind chef and efficient waitress and headed back into the Mount Lebanon cold.Kous Kous is definitely worth trying. The number of other dishes that I saw being put together while we waited for ours' all looked delicious and were presented beautifully.Trust.

When it's hot out and you can't stand to be inside a casino or out on the strip.  Hard Rock Cafe has an awesome menu and stocked bar complete with mini stage for the occasional impromptu concert.  Try the burgers.  This location is located near the MGM and Ross Dress for Less.  Look for the giant electric guitar.  As a bonus, at any given time of day, you'll see your favorite celebrity impersonators out front.3.5 STARSCame here for a little get together for my company over the weekend. We had a private room on the third floor as a get together and served buffet style!GRUB*Tex-Mex Salad (okay)*Asian inspired Salad (pass)*Mash Potatoes (yum!)*Mac & Cheese (uber yum!)*Pulled Pork + Dinner Rolls (yum!)*BBQ Chicken (okay)SERVICE+ Awesome service from staff members! Thank you for tending to everyone's drink requests!The facility was clean and the set up was quite nice. I wouldn't mind recommending a group party here if you're looking for a venue! It's on the strip and nearby the MGM!This review is for the place as a venue. I've been here before for a Yelp elite event and Motley Brews, but I caught a show ( ill.gates - church of bass) here recently. This HRC is one level retail, second a restaurant and the third floor is a music venue. I  like that it's a decent sized but still intimate. There's a large patio if you want some air as well which has a nice view of the whole strip. I am a old crab and in the back by the bar is a raised area with seating. I can't do this whole standing and squashed onto people type business anymore so when there is seating, I am way more happy. Sound is pretty good in here but depends on the setup can get loud in a small space. It was a fairly decent place for a beer fest, given that it wasn't too busy but this can be a clusterfuck if it was double the amount of people. Overall, good non club venue for music. (Yelp 100 Challenge 4/100)It's a pain in the ass to get to (as is everything on the strip) but it's worth the hike for locals cause this place has the coolest local bartenders and supports local music! Plus it's a great place to see a show cause, contrary to the convenience factor of getting there, its on the strip! Tip: park at Monte Carlo for free and walk over to avoid parking fees in the garage connected to it ;) And try the breakfast quesadilla, its magically delicious

Review Text :
On the whole, I'd give the Chipotle chain a solid three and a half stars. The burritos are big, the food is dependable, it's easy to customize, and things are surprisingly tasty for being a subsidiary of McDonald's. The reason this review gets one star is the horrible customer service and a fairly major flub on their part. This location is fairly busy, so I placed my order online so I could just go in and pick it up. I ordered a vegetarian burrito and chips & guac. Started with some chips, then moved on to my burrito. Took a bite and got a mouthful of chicken - not so pleasant when you order a VEGETARIAN burrito. Now, I'm not a vegetarian, but I'm not a super-big fan of meat, especially when I'm not expecting it to be there. If I was a vegetarian, I'd have been pissed. The receipt said veg and the wrapper had my name written on it, so I should have been reasonably confident that my burrito was not going to contain meat. I'm fairly easy-going, so if my burrito had otherwise been what I ordered, I would have just sucked it up and gone with it - I'd already driven there once. Unfortunately, it wasn't - whatever combination of fillings they put in the burrito was really unappealing to me.My unexpected meaty mouthful put me off my appetite for a burrito, so I decided to just finish my order of chips & guac and call it a day. I was meeting friends shortly and I didn't have time to drive back to Chipotle, wait in line while they made me another burrito, then eat. I needed to gas up the car, so I decided I'd just bring the burrito back for a refund and go to the gas station across the street. Upon my return, I went up to the register and explained to the cashier what happened. She was very apologetic and did her best to help me out - five stars for her. She went in the back to talk to the manager, and came back to offer to remake the burrito correctly since chicken and veggie burritos cost the same. I politely told her no thank you, and that I just wanted my money back. She disappeared into the back again, and came back to tell me the manager would be out in a minute. By the time the manager finally came out front, about 15 minutes had passed since I first talked to the cashier. This should have been a quick in and out. While at the register, the manager completely ignored me. Literally. No eye contact. I had expected her to ask me why I was returning my food and maybe offer in some way to "make it right" - at the very least an apology and maybe something more along the lines of a coupon/free drink/etc, seeing as how I had to come in twice, she kept me waiting forever, and, you know, I had been served meat in a vegetarian entree. Nope. She didn't say a single word to me and didn't so much as give me a glance. She inspected my burrito to make sure I wasn't making it up, fumbled with the cash register for a few minutes, then handed me my cash with a "thank you" and walked away - all very huffy and like it was a huge burden for her to push a few buttons on the cash register. There is no shortage of burrito places in town, including other Chipotle locations, so I doubt I'll be motivated to come back to this particular location ever again.*sniff* I can't believe I was made to cry (on the inside) no less on New Year's Eve. My hubby and I came here thinking we would split a burrito since I know how big the burritos can be at Chipotle.  We waited in line. I watched the two guys in front of me each get 2 tortillas each for their burrito and the girl behind the line really piled on the rice, beans, and their choice of meat. I was thinking, wow, these burritos are even bigger than what I remembered. Then when it came my turn for my burrito, the girl behind the counter took one look at petite me and took out one tortilla and gave me a skimpy serving of rice, beans, and seriously like 5 pieces of meat. I felt so crest fallen.  I looked at the measly portion that was going to be my burrito, I looked at the girl behind the counter and asked why the two guys in front of me got such massive burritos but not me. She just rolled her eyes at me and went on to the next costumer. Boy, was I disappointed. And I checked too with those two young guys in case they paid extra for their mega massive burritos. Nope, same price as what I paid. I seriously wanted to take a photo of my burrito next to theirs cause mine would look like the runt of the litter. It was so pathetically so much smaller in size. I thought maybe it was an off night but from reading the other reviews, many other customers have received the same uneven service. Chipotle corporate, you should take note since as corporate you take such pride in providing a good product and service- that is the Chipotle brand and signature. Well, this particular location is not making the grade. And *sniff* now I know what being an unwanted stepchild feels like. *sniff*.

Restaurant name  Contigo Peru
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
I'd say 4.5 stars. I'm definitely a fan but I don't have enough experience with Peruvian cuisine to know if it's as good as it gets. : )I was first introduced to Peruvian food a week ago and have now been to Contigo Peru 3 times. From what I have come to learn, it is a natural fusion cuisine. There are large populations of different ethnic groups (some major ones being Chinese, Japanese and Italian) in Peru and those influences have all spilled over into the food of Peru. From what I understand, the cuisine of Peru is quite varied and the food served at Contigo Peru is primarily that of Lima.The restaurant itself is great. It's clean and casual and the staff is amazingly nice. They were super helpful on every visit. I can't say enough about them. Over the course of our visits, we had:Lomo Saltado - tender loin beef strips stir fried with onions, tomatoes & french fries served with rice. I understand this is a classic dish. I completely loved it. The stir fry is Chinese influence with tastes of soy sauce. It seemed like total comfort food, even bringing back memories of "chips & gravy" for the Oz folk and maybe even brings poutine to mind? It's kind of a carb fest but it's great. Easily accessible and super tasty. Not spicy at all. The kids loved it too. If you're new to Peruvian food, definitely a good place to start.Saltado Contigo Peru - basically the same as loom saltado with shrimp. Also great.Yuca con frita huancaina - slices of deep fried yucca root with a cheese and aji sauce.First of all, aji here refers to peppers. This term is used all over the place. We enjoyed this but I don't know that we get the huancaina sauce yet. We ended up eating the yucca with aji (in this case referring to the spicy sauces/salsas on the table - more on that later). Ceviche de pescado / camarones - ceviche with fish and/or shrimp,  shaved onion, lettuce, yam, corn on the cob & dried corn kernels (called ganchas?). I loved these dishes. Sour and tasty but the thing that stood out most to me was the amazing contrast of textures. Causa - layers of mashed potatoes seasoned with lime juice & aji and a chicken salad layer in between.Kind of a crazy dish. Surprising texture (soft all the way through) but I really liked it. I liked the hint of spice and the taste of lime with the potatoes.Chaufa Contigo Peru - beef, chicken and shrimp fried rice.Enjoyed this well though I didn't really see a great deviation from typical Chinese fried rice.Pescado a lo Macho - fish fillet fried and covered with a spicy seafood sauce containing shrimp, scallops, calamari, mussels. Also some fried yucca slices.This is a great dish. Super tasty with a bit of spice. One of the Heather's favorites.Aji de Gallina - creamy yellow, spicy sauce, made with shredded chicken, ají amarillo (yellow chilis), cheese, milk, bread, and walnuts served with rice.This was another great dish. It's actually not on the menu but I think they have it most Friday, Saturday, Sundays. Heather called it pure comfort food. Loved it, especially the subtle hint of spice. Think this will be a staple order. Anticuchos - skewers of beef heart marinated in Peruvian spices and grilled. Also comes with it's own spiciy sauce.This is another special dish. It's not on the menu and only there on occasion. Since they had it, I had to try it and definitely enjoyed it. Not spicy without the sauce. The kids also liked it quite well.Rotisserie chicken - killer rotisserie chicken.I loved this especially with the aji (spicy sauces) on the table. There were two of these, red & green, with the red being a bit spicier and the green having more of a cilantro flavor. I became a huge fan of these immediately. The first visit, I was using pieces of bread as a vehicle for the sauce. For the 2nd & 3rd visits, we ordered the chicken which just went perfectly with the aji. We also used it quite liberally in many other ways (on the yucca, over the chaufa, etc.).If there were a good Peruvian restaurant close to the house, the rotisserie chicken and aji would be a definite staple. Felt healthyish and so tasty.Chica Morada - Peruvian purple corn drink made with pineapple rind, cinnamon, and clove and then mixed with sugar and lemon.I had this every visit and will probably always do. I actually liked a bit diluted. Light and clean. You can also order it by the pitcher which seems the best deal if you have at least a couple people drinking it.All in all, I'd say we didn't have a bad dish. Looking at the menu, it can seem like french fry overload but with a bit of consideration, it definitely doesn't have to be that.I'm a big fan and will be back often.

I ran and I ran and I ran...but still I couldn't escape:)Oh well, at least I worked up a nice sweat after my meeting with the legal eagles this morning:)After 6 miles of detoxing, the first thing I like to do (after a shower of course:) is go for a walk:-)I know, but when you get to be my age, you're so damn pleased that your body still works at all, that you use it every chance you get...it could be the last time that particular part works...you never know:-)Seriously...That's what I did...I went for a walk through Old Town in search of a light retoxing:)And I found my retox in an unlikely spot...that little alleyway off Main St., in Old Town!You know...the one where the homeless guys would park their bikes and sleep late on Sunday...the one with the temporary chain-link fence to keep said late sleepers out...the one that looked like an over sized trash barrel:)Well, the alley isn't for those sleepy heads any longer:-)It's called "The Frontier Shops"...I'll think of something humorous to say about that later:)The whole place has been cleaned up, remodeled and a slew (you heard me...slew!) of new business have opened or are opening up in there...and not just native american art and tee shirts, either:)New businesses (small businesses) are the backbone of America and it is nice to see some things opening up again:)The Cider Mill is a nice little addition to the noon time restaurant selection in Old Town...not too pricey, decent food, clean and bright:)Nice people running it, too!I was headed for David's to get a burger, walked by and looked down the alley at all the hustle and bustle and decided "I'd better see what this is all about"...those exact words!They had a sign out front advertising "Coney Island Special":-)If you know anything about me at all, you know they had me at "Coney":)Pretty good Coney Island, too... a big 1/4 lb. all beef dog, plenty of sauce, potato chips and a refreshing beverage, all for under $8.00 (US money) and enjoyed at the communal table in the middle of the restaurant:-)The decor is nice, the service is a still a little uneven (but consider they've only been open 2 1/2 weeks...the place still smells like wood stain for pete's sake:) and the menu is just right for the lunch crowd (big Ruben sandwich or a big Chef salad for $6.95...it's a pretty good deal:)I think they will get better with a little time, 3 1/2 stars for now (and I don't round up, so 3 stars out of the gate is no knock on them:)Finally, after lunch, I browsed for bit and came out of there with a little jar of Queen Creek Olive tapenade and a jar of Sanders Hot Fudge (these people are from Detroit and you Detroiter's will know what a treat Sander's is:)Swing by and support the new business going into this part of Scottsdale:)It's a patriotic, tasty and inexpensive way to "Hooray" for small business in America:-)Growing up in Michigan, Cider Mills bring back so many fond memories... nothing compares to picking your own apples at an orchard and then grabbing cider and donuts and enjoying in the fresh, crisp, Michigan air.  So as soon as I saw the name of this place, i was sold.  I bookmarked it but with all of the traveling I've been doing lately, I didn't get a chance to visit until just last week.I chose The Cider Mill Gourmet Market & Sandwich Shop as the destination for a casual lunch meeting.  There were three of us there.  Upon entering, I really liked the feel of the place.  It's hiding a bit but find the Rusty Spur and go directly across the street... while it's a new building, it's got charm.  It's clean and bright as well.  The ladies working were busy with a large order when we went up to the counter to order so they told us it may be about fifteen or twenty minutes.  I waited long enough to try this place, I wasn't going to let another fifteen or twenty minutes stop me, so we waited.  I'm hoping they were short staffed that day or that they plan on hiring more help during lunch because the shop was not crowded.Anyhoo, I went with the "Build Your Own Sandwich" (turkey, lettuce, tomato, onion, mustard on wheat)... I was actually pretty disappointed they didn't have avocado or multi-grain bread. (Their website shows a picture of big fat delicious looking multi-grain bread too.)  The others in my meeting went with the Tomato Mozz Sandwich, which they said was decent but nothing special.  We were all fans of the Pop Chips that came with our sandwiches though.Perhaps my expectations were high because of the name?  And call me out if I'm wrong, but I didn't even see 'cider' as a beverage choice on the menu!  This place was "A-OK" but probably will not be a regular on my rotating favorite lunch places in Old Town... go check it out if you're looking for a decent sandwich at a moderate price - just don't go with high expectations like i did!

Restaurant name  Hash House A Go Go
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
After much hype from the Man Vs Food episode with Adam Richman, Hash House A Go Go  opened a 2nd location at the Imperial Palace on the STRIP.HHAGG is known for their Enormous portions of farm fresh food with a twist and we have been to the Sahara location several times including the Man v Food shooting so we were hoping to see the SAME food,service and atmosphere as the original.The entry/waiting area has a wall of photographs of celebrities who have visited. The dining room is typical with boothes along the walls and tables filling in between. A few TV's i n the center hanging from the the ceiling a small bar along one wall.When we arrived there was NO line so we were seated immediately but don't surprised if you have to wait 30-45 minutes when it gets busy. This place is well staffed so they keep it moving.We ordered drinks-coffee and soda then our meal-I got the fried pork tenderloin sandwich & fries and My son @milesdavisvegas got the Farmer's Daughter-French Toast w/bacon & eggs.It took awhile for the food to come out -I had 3 cups of coffee waiting but the place really got busy after we arrived and Our waiter was NEW,actually his 1st day on the job.The pork tenderloin was FANTAsTIC-thin & crispy-pickles onion and ketchup!!The french toast was great-thick cinnamony with strawberries and banana,the bacon was crisp and the eggs cooked PERFECTLY over-easy lots of yolk no runny whites!!I'm a little biased towards this place because its 1/2 places in Las Vegas that serve a tenderloin sandwich so I don't really explore the menu -just burgers,breakfast & the tenderloin BUT I see lots of people trying the chicken & waffles really killin them:)I see the Reviews on YELP really rip this location but that wasn't my experience. The service was good, the food was good and it has the same feel as the original location minus the long wait.My only knock on this place is the prices but that's just me-because-I mean the biggest thing about a midwest menu is that it's  simple & CHEAP!!!Man crushes. Guys have them. No man is immune to them. No matter how he likes to boast how hetero he is and that having man crushes aren't very manly. Odds are that he's a closet man-crusher. Man crushing does not entail an intimate coital relationship. These are just guys that you may want to go to a bar with and throw down some brews and play darts (not the of the butt variety). The focal point of said man crushes can be athletes, actors, comedians, office jerk, gynecologists.... To bring me closer to one of my man crushes (yes I'm not scared to say I have several....it's liberating), I decided to visit one of the places I've seen on a show I loosely base my life on. Man vs. Food (Adam Richaman). When I found out that I didn't have to drive off the Vegas strip in order to visit it's sister location, my heart skipped a beat and I'm pretty sure I behaved like a teenage girl about to come into close quarters with Justin Timberlake (wet). I went with the sage fried chicken and waffles. The chicken was void of any sage flavor. I don't even know what sage is supposed to taste like, but I'm sure this chicken was void of it. It was bland, but, I will admit, it was the best cooked fried chicken I've ever had. Crunchy batter and all moist and sh^t inside. Nothing that a little bit of salt and hot sauce didn't help. The waffles were dense. They'd give Rush Limbaugh a run for his money. And much like Rush, there was bacon inside of the waffles. There's enough food on the plate to feed everyone on the blackjack table. It's inside the Imperial Palace casino on the second floor. So if you're a cocksucker that likes to pretend to have more money than your Anchor Blue jeans is letting on to me and only like to be seen in Aria or Bellagio, stay out dickhead. Us regular people have more fun anyways.Before I call it a week, here's a small sample list of men you can gush over and man crush on.  Also a list of men you need to hate.Yes:Chuck NorrisSteven SegalJason StathamRyan ReynaldsJo KoyBJ PennNo:Dr. PhilBill O'ReillyMichael MooreJa RuleKany WestOprahWe decided to have a late breakfast here since it was across the street from our hotel.  I had already been to the one in San Diego, so I knew to expect huge portions.  My friends wanted to check it out to see what all the hype was about.I went with the corned beef hash, some people got the Hardwood smoked bacon, avocado, onion & Swiss farm scramble, and one person decided to tackle the ginormous Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict.  My dish was pretty good.  It had just the right amount of corned beef, potatoes and scrambled eggs.  I've had the Sage Fried Chicken before, and that was way too much food for one person.  You will pretty much lapse into a food coma right after you eat it.  That is definitely a dish two people can share.The restaurant was pretty busy, and it took forever for us to order and get our food.  I felt like we spent more time waiting than eating.  If it wasn't for the slow service, I would've given it 4 stars.Warning: Another reason why I miss San Diego!I like this Hash House a go-go conveniently located on the Las Vegas Blvd strip on the second-floor of the Imperial Palace Hotel and Casino. I like the bigger venue of this HH Las Vegas location with no wait in the morning. I like the later closing hours at 11pm.There is a full-service bar. There is Keno and a big screen television for sporting events.  But the food tasted like any other casino's diner. If not, worst than the San Diego's Hillcrest location. For $16.95, I had the Crispy Hammered Pork Tenderloin. The dish had a long piece of a crispy Pork cutlet on top of a biscuit, BBQ cream sauce, scrambled eggs, tomato and spinach. My meal: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f4x1YBxkLrZg652xt2KR5g?select=FRWIO4KonJv9o279SsyKagThis is a very big dish, but the dish's taste-wise was just ok. Like I aforementioned, it tasted like an overpriced casino food. I also had $6.00 glass of Mimosa. At least, they used freshly squeezed OJ along with champagne in this drink. My drink: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f4x1YBxkLrZg652xt2KR5g?select=TH5sj4h8eY8RxZPgzzphIQI still love San Diego's location and food much better. But Las Vegas has two other locations. Unfortunately, this touristy part of LV is not my favorite. On the bright side, I might return again and maybe redeem myself and try something else instead.One thing I truly love is a spectacle. Doesn't matter of what, just as long as it provides me with some visual entertainment. With food, I love seeing the large and outlandish, quality is secondary and not expected but is always welcome. During my Vegas research, Hash House seemed the perfect spot for just that.Organizing a party of 10 for breakfast in Vegas can be quite challenge, but luckily, everyone was late at about the same time. We actually didn't even have to wait that long for a table once our entire party was there. Once seated, the drink menu led me to my first show; a BLT Bloody Mary;http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f4x1YBxkLrZg652xt2KR5g?select=_-fQlooq5QREsociXJU7YwCrisp toast, bacon, lettuce, and a tomato wedge all garnished this liquid meal. My first instinct was to smash all the solids into a pulp and mix them into my drink so I could suck down the slurry through the oversized straw. Luckily reason found me and I simply made a mini sandwich to munch on while sipping the well-made drink. I pondered ordering the famed tower of chicken and waffles, but I had a hankering for gravy that only gravy could satisfy. I ordered the biscuits and gravy at the recommendation of our server, based on my request of something large covered in gravy. After an expectedly long wait, our food began to pile in. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f4x1YBxkLrZg652xt2KR5g?select=bPvsgg04sxgX91PJmswpQQThe biscuits were surprisingly light and fluffy and the gravy had about a pound of diced sausages in it. It was definitely something that would stick to your ribs. I also tried a bite of the "stuffed" burger and was very let down. We were expecting the ingredients to be cooked in the meat, not just placed between two over-cooked patties. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f4x1YBxkLrZg652xt2KR5g?select=xjtwgwuEKBkjvO0-k80eKwOverall though it was a fun meal with food better than I expected. Service was attentive to our huge party and I think everyone had a good time. I'd go back.I didn't waste any time going to Hash House A Go Go right when I got off the plane.  I was HUNGRY!!  And I wanted a big meal that wasn't a buffet.  Plus, it was one meal that I really wanted to get it over with since it basically kicked off what was my Food Tour through the Vegas Strip and was the biggest and most intimidating meal that I would encounter.Since I've already had their Sage Fried Chicken & Waffles and Sage Fried Chicken Benedict, I went with a change of pace and tried their Hand Hammered Pork Tenderloin Benedict.  And just like the other two dishes, once I saw my waitress bringing it to my table, I immediately started cracking up because it was so enormous (http://bit.ly/1KIcQLz).   It's a loaded plate - Crispy Hand Hammered Pork Tenderloin w/ market Yellow Tomato, Spinach, BBQ Cream, topped w/ Scrambled Eggs all over two Biscuits and a Griddled Mashed Potatoes.  The Pork Tenderloin was good. If you've ever had Tonkatsu at a Japanese restaurant, it's pretty much the same deal, only 10x's bigger.  And I did pretty well, managed to kill the Pork Tenderloin and left one Biscuit behind.Washed it all down with their house special Kiwi Watermelon Lemonade (http://bit.ly/1YwCGrU).  A friend of mine recommended it and even my waitress said it went well with everything on the menu.  They were right!  Very refreshing and colorful too!!This experience was a lot better than my last visit 9 months ago.  Probably because this time I opted for a table and not a seat at the bar.  The service was definitely better as my waitress was very enthusiastic.  Also the $10 Restaurant.com coupon helped make it a good experience too!  So good service, big food, and full stomach.  It was a great way to start off my Food Tour on the Strip.When I saw their signature Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles platter on a Las Vegas television show one night I knew I had to try this.  As my buddies stopped into the Imperial Palace casino to throw away a little more cash I decided a mid day feast was in order.  I imagined this place would get pretty crowded, but at 4:30 in the afternoon on a weekend this restaurant was surprisingly empty.My buddies later told me they were concerned that a huge meal a day before the marathon would hamper their performance.  I'm a slower runner than they are though so my only concern was to finish the race and have fun doing it.Back to the restaurant I was greeted and offered a seat at the bar or a table.  I noticed an attractive vixen sitting alone at the bar so I decided I was going to go there and offer her a bit of companionship.  As I sat comfortably into my seat I couldn't help but notice this dainty young lady was eating from two giant platters of food.  She acknowledged my presence, turned to me, smiled, greeted me and told me she's a dancer and hadn't eaten all day.  Don't mind my stare, lady!  I'm not checking out your perfect physique, but I do have an eye on the humongous burger on your plate.  Wait!  Do all showgirls eat like this?I finally picked up my menu.  They offer fresh squeezed fruit juices in 10 ounce and 20 ounce glasses so I went with a fresh tangerine juice, but I'm sitting at a bar, and how does one not have a beer when they're sitting at a bar?  I selected a Pyramid Apricot Wheat Ale (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f4x1YBxkLrZg652xt2KR5g?select=I1ZZCzT_lKHJ_YthVtc-Cw) and ice water knowing all to well I needed to stay hydrated for the run ahead.I took a quick glance at the food menu although I knew exactly what I wanted to try the minute I walked into the restaurant.  I selected the Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles.  The service here was outstanding.  Every time the bartender left his station he'd return and give me an update on my food.I had a crappy camera with me at the time, but this is what I had (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f4x1YBxkLrZg652xt2KR5g?select=BagiL1VmvJTeDz_CIsty3w).  It's two huge chicken breasts partial bone attached battered and fried and sitting on an angle atop four squares of bacon-stuffed Belgian waffles drizzled in hot maple syrup.  That's right.  The waffles are stuffed with crispy bacon (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f4x1YBxkLrZg652xt2KR5g?select=t2IoUrYE-c7cIHRBxkk6ow)!The weight of the two chicken pieces quickly gave way to gravity as they fell onto the plate.  The chicken breast was amazingly juicy and the crispy batter was well seasoned.  The waffles were fluffy and chewy and I hadn't even gotten to the crispy bacon yet.  This signature dish definitely lived up to its hype.  This was outstanding.  I had to sit awhile after nearly finishing that entire platter.The dancer did better than I did taking what little food she left in a to-go box.  As she turned, smiled and bid me farewell I couldn't help but notice how gracefully she walked out the door.  I was so stuffed you might have been able to tip me over on my side and rolled me out the door!Las Vegas dancer or not, this time next year at 4:30 in the afternoon I will be back!Unlike Café Bellagio, Hash House definitely knows how to make a hash (it is part of their name, after all)!  Delicious food and giant servings?  Talk about a tasty (and filling) way to start the day.  People working on the Strip definitely know what's up:Cosmo Taxi Stand Guy:  Where are we going this morning, sir?Me:  Imperial Palace, please.Cosmo Taxi Stand Guy:  Ahhh...good ole Hash House!Me:  Yup, you got it.Cosmo Taxi Stand Guy (to cab driver): The Imperial!Cab Driver:  Ahh...he means Hash House!Me:  Man, how do you guys know?Cab Driver:  Well, it's a Sunday morning and since it looks like you're staying at Cosmo, really no other reason why you would want to go to the Imperial.  Me:  Haha...ouch.Even though a lot of the dishes that passed by our table looked great, I stayed true to my original craving - the Chorizo Hash.  Man, talk about a massive serving of food!  My photo may not do it justice, but the cast iron skillet they brought out was huge, and the hash alone took up about half of it.  The other half?  Choice of eggs (scrambled), fruit, and a biscuit.  Not that it mattered in the end though since I barely cleared half of my order.Sitting on top of soft and perfectly cooked chunks of potatoes was a tasty pile of ground chorizo.  YUM.  The "taco meat"-like consistency was a little unexpected, but the seasoning of the ground chorizo and melted cheese was great.  Just a slight kick while the jalapenos gave it that extra heat.  All in all - deliciousness.While I've heard of stories about the long waits at Hash House, we lucked into a short 5-10 minute wait for a table of five.  Since we were there on Easter Sunday though, I imagine it might have been a little quieter than normal.  Still, knowing how good (and generous) the food is though, I wouldn't mind having to wait (a little).I'm so glad I got a chance to try this place out!  After 1 week, I'm still thinking about the breakfast here!  Of the 4 of us, we shared 2 of the Andy's Sage fried chicken benedict, perfect portion & it was delish!!  Do not try to eat one on your own!  It's huge!!  I loved all the fresh flavors of the benedict, its a great twist on the usual benedict flavors and textures.  I loved more of the veggies & biscuits instead of muffins.  Everything went so well together.  The chipotle cream that topped the huge mound was yummilicious!!  I wanted a jacuzi size pot to jump in!  The menu states this plate is a Man vs. Food Fave.  I concur!!The location is on the 2nd floor of the casino inside Imperial Palace (currently getting a total makeover).  The service was good for the most part, but our server was inconsisant where he would be so friendly one moment, and kinda grouchy the next.I would definitely come again and again to try out the other items.  Next on the list is the chicken & waffles!!  That thing is huge!!!  The prices here are very reasonable for the portion and flavors.In the land of the dinosaurs, or at least those of us who eat like one, Hash House would probably reign supreme. This city is overflowing with buffets designed to make your waist, well, overflow, and Hash House can easily provide that feeling with a single item. The fact that very few things on their menu even exceed the $15 mark is pretty impressive, but maybe that's why everything presented looks ostentatious but winds up just rather banal... an embodiment of Las Vegas as a whole, perhaps.Style over substance certainly seems to be the modus operandi for Hash House, delivering mammoth sized meals you can't help but go "wow!" over, and yet very few people leave with empty plates, more likely because they simply got tired of eating surprisingly bland food, rather than being simply outmatched in the stomach capacity department. I watched multiple diners get up from the bar stools next to me leaving half or even three-quarters of a plate full of food behind. I guess when the prices are this low, in Vegas, you figure that the minimal investment isn't really worth the excessive calories.That's all in retrospect though... I came to Hash House because I had heard tales of monolithic food combinations so loaded with flavor that they had attracted multiple food related television shows to their establishments, including a chicken and waffle dish stacked so high that it approached eye level. Without going on too much of a rant about how these shows often lead so many people astray, I'll just say that the size (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f4x1YBxkLrZg652xt2KR5g?select=vdzuQYUETEvJLxak4rwB2w#vdzuQYUETEvJLxak4rwB2w) is definitely impressive, but we all know it's what you do with it that counts. Somewhat ironically I had actually used their sage fried chicken and bacon loaded waffles as inspiration for a recent brunch party I hosted, and I can honestly say that I put Hash House to shame. What absolutely makes fried chicken is the skin, and if you've got limp, soggy skin, then your size doesn't much matter. This chicken could have been baked for all I know, as there was zero crispness to it. Add to that waffles that, aside from the bacon slices inside, are generally bland, and one tiny ramekin of syrup to assist, and I can see why people literally just got tired of eating this. I also gave their BLT Bloody Mary a try, thinking the ingredients would be well infused into the drink, considering that it was by far the most expensive on the menu, but instead I wound up with what essentially amounts to a sandwich shoved into a drink (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f4x1YBxkLrZg652xt2KR5g?select=vdzuQYUETEvJLxak4rwB2w#SBNu2x4ogGJkvRJ5spQLRA), with no clear way on the best way to either eat or drink it. I wound up having to sip and nibble like a freaking rabbit on what has to be the clumsiest cocktail idea I've ever seen executed. After having the variations prepared by Brian, Nicole, and Gregg at my Bloody Mary Battle, this seemed outright amateurish. I should have stuck with my original intuition, passed on the alcohol, and gave the S'Mores latte a go... although if this was any indication it would have been the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man shoved into a teacup with a box of Graham Crackers on the side and someone who comes along and projectile vomits Hershey's chocolate syrup in my face.After our $60 breakfast here I can safely say this place isn't worth the hype!When we arrived at 9:30AM there was no wait. When we left, maybe an hour later, there were so many people waiting it had to have been over an hour wait. Let me tell you, I would have been PISSED if I had waited more than 15 minutes for this breakfast!Drinks - I ordered a Watermelon Lemonade and BF ordered a Pistachio Iced Mocha. The drinks were awesome! Mine was slightly sour but had enough watermelon flavor that it wasn't too much. His Pistachio Mocha was sooo good! I was mad that I didn't order it. For breakfast both my BF and my BFF ordered the Tractor Driver Combo which is two eggs, bacon or sausage, and a pancake, or you can substitute a waffle or french toast for one extra dollar. BFF got the pancake (that thing was bigger than the plate it was served on!!) and BF got the Vanilla Waffle. Their eggs (scrambled) were nice and fluffy, the bacon was alright. His waffle was good, but didn't taste like vanilla, and her pancake she liked, but couldn't even eat half of it.My order - okay you know when you read the description for something and then it arrives and you realize you read the description all wrong? This is what happened to me. I ordered the HH Original Benedict. Eggs Benedict - I expect hollandaise and some poached eggs. Whatever else happens is fine, but those are the things I need. I read that I would get a biscuit instead of an english muffin and there was mention of mashed potatoes, although I didn't know how that would fit in. I read about the red pepper cream, but I thought that would be along with my hollandaise. I read basted eggs, and I honestly didn't know what that meant. So I received this massive red mess with sprigs of rosemary and what look like pine needles shooting out the side of my food. I get trying to make a plate look nice, but this was a bit much.The taste? Eh. The top layers are alright. The basted egg is overcooked, no runny yolk at all, but the sauce was okay and the tomato was fine. The bottom layers though, a dry ass biscuit on top of dry mashed potatoes. Not a good combo. They really have no business calling this any sort of benedict since they strayed away from every traditional benedict characteristic possible, aside from stacking everything on top of each other.There are many better places to drop $60 on breakfast at in Vegas - this is not one I would revisit. Also, apparently there was an episode of Man vs Food filmed here? That must be their claim to fame because our waiter mentioned it at least 5 times. Wow, I am so impressed.You know when all your friends and their friends' friends have been to a cool joint and you're the only one that's never been? Well such as the case with Hash House A Go Go. My ears were burning for days when my friends were mouthing off about this place....the ginormous portions, the food coma afterwards and how their leftovers would last them for days back home....blah blah blah. Then they said Adam Richman from Man V Food went there. Say no more. We are going to Hash House A Go Go.My friends warned me that service was non-existent at this place. Well luck was on our side because our waiter was pretty attentive during our entire stay. The menu was extensive and their breakfast menu in particular was impressive. I never made it past the House Hashes. I was really tempted to try the Sage Fried Chicken (cause it was Adam's favorite). My friend ordered it and honestly it didn't look as appetizing.....as my Corned Beef House Hash (came with crispy potatoes). The verdict for the corned beef order after the initial taste test was just okay. I personally like my corned beef minced (not hand shredded). Then I had a bite of my other friend's Chorizo House Hash. Let me tell you that is the winner. I would probably order that again my next visit. The portions were big but the waiter did warn us all the House Hashes were "normal" size. The biggest portion I saw was the Sage Fried Chicken. Even that dish I expected to be even more behemouth in size based on what my friends were raving about. Sometimes it's better not to hear the hype and you can make your own conclusions. *I was really angry that they don't have any restrooms in the restaurant. I had to run downstairs back into the casino.Big yummy breakfast food. AKA comfort food overload deluxe.My x-brother-in-law told me about The Hash House A Go Go several years ago while we were fishing in Mexico. He said "dude you are gonna love this place, we're going when we hit the docks tomorow, the breakfast there is off the hook."  But it wasn't in the cards as we got thick in the fish and opted for some fresh bluefin sashimi instead.So fast forward several years, that Hash House place is still ingrained in the back of my mind and what do ya know, while taking a breather from the Venetian's casino I go for a walkabout and stumble on a sign that tells me there is a HHAGG in the Imperial Palace Hotel. So I go thru this construction maze of an entry to the IPH and into the hottest (like 90 degrees) casino on the planet. I go pass the performing blues brothers  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/9wjTzw8bEYOTQJk41V8WQw?select=TZSIV-_ypvbTuH7mh_f8cg#TZSIV-_ypvbTuH7mh_f8cg blackjack dealers and up an escalater to find that they are closed! Damn, so I make plans for the next days breakfast.Wake up at zero dark thirty (6:30) so I can have B-fast before going to the Fabtech trade show. I get there NO LINE! Yes the casino gods are favoring me today. I asked to be seated at the bar for quicker service. This was the first time I ever ordered a glass of milk at a bar, it felt wierd. I then ordered up a Andy's Sage Fried Chicken.  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=W3BT2l3t-ifYfCtQ_Q2vbQ&userid=EMMzx-gGDKsU4enmbae6dwFOOD: Andys Sage Fried Chicken ... This was a giant breakfast, the chicken and eggs atop a couple of biskets piled onto a heap of country style mashed potatoes loaded with bacon bits all covered up with a benedictish gravy with diced bell peppers. This was some good stuff a solid 4 **** Star for me. But less bisket and more of that yummy gravy and it would have been 5 Stars.  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=VDLsrE-gNdkh8N82jlEo5A&userid=EMMzx-gGDKsU4enmbae6dwSERVICE: From the hostess taking my picture http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=Eo1U2kj6OyU_a_Kr9pC-6A&userid=EMMzx-gGDKsU4enmbae6dw and quickly seating me, to the bar (milk) tender who was way cool and friendly, the service was great, fast and polite. 5*****StarsI'll be back.I finally got a chance to eat at the place that supposedly serves "twisted farm food." It had been on my radar ever since I first saw it on Man v. Food. Staying at Imperial made it all the more tempting to just go there for each meal. In a rare showing of mercy to my wallet, I didn't do that.Before going inside the dining area, you'll see a number of autographed portraits and menus. Adam Richman's is one of them. I decided to do takeout for dinner. While it was very tempting to just get the popular sage fried chicken and waffles, I was in a 1-pound stuffed burger mood. Oh, that'd be one pound of meat. The entire burger was probably closer to 2 lbs., although not quite there.The mushroom and Swiss stuffed burger ($12.95) was amazing. Extremely juicy and gargantuan. Everything cooked perfectly. It was heaven just to see the melted Swiss and sauteed mushrooms. It's served with the cold fresh veggies on one bun half and the stuffed patty on the other half. Two big dill pickle slices in the burger. While the lettuce looked a bit wilted, that's probably only because everything stayed in the same closed takeout box for a few minutes.I'm guessing they used a brioche bun. Very soft and inviting. I personally think it could have been better with a slight toasting on the flattop. This just felt like the Juicy Lucy I had in Minnesota a couple years back, just in steroidal form. I think the burger could be too greasy and too imposing for some people. Fork and knife might be required. I for one needed a larger mouth.Burgers come with one side item of your choice. I got the basil pesto tossed crispy potatoes and enjoyed every bite. Great job on the crispy potatoes. It also had some broken-down diced tomatoes in there. The olive oil from the pesto collected a bit at the bottom of the plastic takeout container.Dessert is served all day here, and one of the servers mentioned that some items (like the bread pudding) are for in-house dining only. Might expect up to a 15-minute wait on that bread pudding.Breakfast includes french toast, flapjacks, and the Fried Chicken Benedict, all featured on the Man v. Food episode. I hope to get back there for some of those dishes.I saw the plating of the sage fried chicken and waffles I spoke of earlier, and it's literally a tower of food. Three or four waffles for the base, some fried chicken on top of that, and a large knife to hold it all in place.Even with all the inflated prices on the Vegas strip, I think it's well worth the price to come here. Check this elite spot out the next time you're in the area.I had heard so much good stuff about Hash House A Go Go and couldn't wait to try here.  Unfortunately my first experience did not live up to the hype.  The service was great, but what I ordered was not.  I was really excited seeing everyone else in the place getting their big plates of food.  My mouth was actually salivating waiting to get my meal.  What I discovered is that I ordered the wrong thing on the menu.  My entrée looked terrible compared to everything else I saw.  I had ordered the Reuben sandwich with fries, and it was one of the funkiest tasting sandwiches I have ever eaten.  It tasted like bad pot roast on toasted, buttered slices of bread.  It was so inedible that I could only stomach about half of it.  I was super hungry when I got here, but I lost my appetite eating the sandwich.  The fries were okay, and were mainly what I filled up on.I heard the waiter tell someone that everything on the menu is good.  Not true!  The Reuben sucks!  Don't get it!  However, everything else looks good and I still want to give Hash House A Go Go another shot to see if it is really worthy of the hype.This breakfast is gonna last you alllllll day in Vegas because it's supersized! I mean, holy crap is it a large portion. I realize they have a "man vs food" item, but honestly, it could all be "stomach vs food" entrees. But the real test is, is it good? And I can happily say it is! Honestly, the only reason I'm not giving it five stars is because my main entree wasn't my favorite. But let me explain. Not realizing how large the portions were, I ordered the salmon and cream cheese hash, with me and my mom splitting the brown sugar and banana pancakes. To be honest, I really wanted the pancake, but I always feel guilty not getting a little protein in my meal. So I went with the "healthy" (I know, it's laughable) salmon dish. The salmon was a bit dry and I didn't really like the whole mix of salmon, cream cheese and hash. My mom ordered the mushroom hash, which I, of course, tried. It was much better! But the pancake was AWESOME! I should have just sucked up my pride and just ordered that. It's honestly one massive pancake, that would have equaled three medium sized ones. It was one of the best I've ever had! I liked the fact that while you waited they have a sole bar dedicated to bloody mary's! And they are gooooood! I swear, I'd come up there just to get a bloody mary and head back down and go about my day. It was one of the best I've ever had, packed with olives, pickles and a bean! Plus, it was the right amount of spice. Speaking of waiting. You will wait. And wait. And Wait. We waited an hour to sit and then another hour for food. We came around 10am on a Sunday, which I'm sure is prime brunch time. I'd highly suggest going in later, but you'll probably always have a wait here. It was worth it though!OK...I like to eat. I eat a lot. I like to eat good food. So far, I haven't experienced that here. Sure, the portions are humongous and it's dressed up all pretty and nice, but that's just about it - It's all style...no substance. Yes, there's all kind of celebrity pictures complete with their signatures on the wall endorsing this place as the best place to eat. So did Planet Hollywood. We all know what happened there. I'll have to agree that it's the best place to pig out, only if you can shove all of that mountain of food into your mouth. I wanted to like it this time around hoping for a better experience, but it just fell flat again leaving me wanting more and unsatisfied. Yes I was stuffed, but I was still hungry. Does that make sense? How is that even possible?They give you a mountain of food, but it lacks flavor and heart. A good example is their Chicken N Waffles. How can you mess up Chicken n Waffles?Well....they use breast meat and deep fry the living sh*t out of it and what you're left with is a dry piece of meat that is hardly edible. In this case, looks is very deceiving. Again, all style and no substance just like some of the stuff you see in Vegas. I have to also mention that we had the creepiest server ever. He lurks around with his big bugged eyes, who reminded me of Smeagle on Lord of the Rings. My precious....I also made the mistake of ordering their Mint Coffee. The only real mint they had on this was the garnish they placed on top. The mint they used to have that minty flavor is mint syrup which gives it that artificial flavor. It's overly sweet and undrinkable after a couple of sips. Yeah, I gave it another chance and it's time for me to move one.Even though the quad (formerly imperial palace) is unimpressive and their rooms are quite gross, they do have this one diamond in the rough. It is actually inside the casino and up an escalator so don't bother looking for it from the strip. You'll just get lost. I came here with about 20 people (yea. 20.) and knew about the long waits but we were all willing to eat here. The hostess quoted us a 45 minute wait but surprisingly we were seated in ~25 mins despite the large amount of people in the lobby. I felt bad for the waitress though as she had to yell across the three connected tables to all twenty of us to explain the menu. She sounded like she was losing her voice but she had a very cheerful attitude nonetheless. Portions are ginormous so just share; I recommend it. I split the sage fried chicken Benedict with my gf and it was way more than enough. We also split the snickers pancake with another couple with us. The Benedict was very tasty and stacked high, about 7 inches in height, 12 inches if you include the rosemary sprigs sticking out of it. It could've been that we were starving and getting over our hangovers but it was an amazing combination eggs potatoes fried chicken gravy spinach and bacon. I'm glad we shared the pancake because it was huge as well, probably at 12-13 inches in diameter with chunks of snickers everywhere. Also very sweet so I only ate about 3-4 bites of it and had to stop.Very affordable assuming you split the dish with another person. Fyi the bathroom is downstairs in the casino area.  Definitely worth stopping to try it out unless you've been to the original one in sd.After years of wanting to try this place out, I finally did this past Sunday before heading home from Vegas. For the 2 of us to be seated, we waited 30 minutes but it seems like the wait time is typically longer. Our waiter was really friendly, and explained a bit about the menu to us since it was our first time. He checked in frequently as we decided what we wanted to eat and drink. We were never waiting for him to show up at the table. My sister and I split the chicken and rosemary hash with scrambled eggs and were both filled up. The potatoes were the best part of the dish, so flavorful and perfectly cooked. Besides beer they also have some fun mixed drinks available such as spiked kiwi watermelon lemonade. Other offerings include scrambles, giant salads, and stuffed burgers. Come here for some heavy food if you need to cure that Vegas hangover!Seriously the best brunch spot in Las Vegas! This is such a popular spot that you almost always have to wait 30+ minutes for a table, but it's so worth it :) My favorite item from here is the sage chicken and waffles. The waffles have BACON in them! And the chicken is just phenomenal! As you may have read from other reviews, these come in a HUGE portion. It's literally 3 meals for me, no joke! I've also tried the blueberry flapjack. The flapjack is the size of a pizza!! It tastes like just your ordinary pan cake, so nothing special there. Something else I've tried is their French toast. They should rename this "French bricks" because that's the size of these toasts!! I also love ordering the watermelon lemonade! So yummy! Overall, I LOVE dining at Hash House A Go Go :)We walked like 2 miles to get here because we heard it was the best breakfast to get nearby the strip.  It's not in the nicest hotel/casino on the prettiest part of the strip (I think it's actually on the old strip) but don't let that deter you.We got in on a Sunday at about 1:30, and it was PAH-ACKED with people.  They told us the wait would be 45-60 minutes so three of us sat in the waiting room, and the other two went to the bar for coffee.  They came back a minute later and said there was enough room for 5 of us to eat at the bar, which was probably the best seat in the house - great service. Kye and Tiffany at the bar are awesome. We had drinks, friendly convo with the bartenders, and our food was delivered quickly. ..and BOY was it HUGE!!  Every plate could have been shared by 2-3 people and the banana pancake (singular) that the guy next to us got was literally *hanging* off the edges of the plate. I got the Roast Chicken Potato hash: chicken, mushrooms, red peppers and asparagus on top of roasted potatoes. Over medium well egg (?) and large biscuit on the side.  Oh and don't forget the wedge of watermelon!  Those things were also cocktail ornaments. I am not kidding.The best thing about any place in Vegas, I sadly only took advantage of here, was the to-go alcohol cups. Wacky... especially coming from GA (aka the Bible Belt).  I felt like I was being really bad, but I liked it. The only bad thing?  The whole place was really warm.. maybe because it's on the top floor, and we were sitting at the bar (by the kitchen door.)  Bar is still worth it!HOW I GOT STARTED WRITING YELP REVIEWSIn the spring of 2012 I went to my cousin's bachelor party in San Diego. Prior to that I had only written one Yelp review. Since the San Diego trip was going to be pretty expensive, due to the itinerary, I decided to write Yelp reviews of the places that I visited. At that time I didn't think I would constantly write Yelp reviews during these last two years? One of the places I ate in San Diego was Hash House A Go Go. I ordered a salmon omelet. The one regret I made was that I didn't order the sage fried chicken and waffles after seeing some of the customers eating this dish.Yesterday morning I ate here. Despite the item that was featured on Man vs. Food, I knew what I wanted - the sage chicken fried and waffles. As I remembered in San Diego the portions were huge. To my surprise there were small slices of bacon inside the waffles. As the saying goes everything is better with bacon. I couldn't give this rating a perfect 5-star because of the fried chicken. Despite its crunchy skin the breast meat was slightly dry. Overall I liked the dish because you get what you pay for due to the huge portions. Unlike the last time I went to San Diego location I had no regrets.Everything the world needs to know about us fat Americans can be found at the Hash House A Go Go.  Vegas is a city of sin and this is Gluttony at it's finest.  Hash House describes their concept as Twisted Farm Food.  It's American comfort food taken out of it's overalls and dressed up.  I came here for one thing.....The Sage Fried Chicken Benedict.  I saw it on Man vs Food and knew someday it would have to be mine.So many times when a place "creates" a tower of food all combined together on a gargantuan plate, it's not well thought out.  This is different and the key here is each ingredient is great on it's own.  From the bottom up we have mashed potatoes, nicely seasoned and thrown on a griddle to get them slightly browned.  Then why stop with one starch when you can have two?  The mashed potatoes are topped with a couple of fluffy buttermilk biscuits that are some of the most tasty I've ever had.  Followed by fresh spinach (it's great that they don't cook it so it doesn't get mushy) and slices of Red Beefsteak Tomato.  This is topped with a couple of slices of hickory smoked bacon and then it's namesake....A half pound well seasoned fried chicken breast.  Corn flakes are used as the batter and it keeps it's crunch well.  Top this with scrambled eggs and cheese.  The cheese is fried up on the griddle so it's melted prior to going on everything else.  This also creates a nice browned skin to the melted cheese.  I forgot to ask what cheese they were using, but it wasn't too strong.  It seemed it's main job was bond itself to the chipotle cream sauce that is poured on top and create one cheesy gooey chipotle sauce that seals everything in.  Winner Winner Chicken Dinner!  I hope they never open a Hash House near me because I could see myself craving one of these life ending creations often.  5 Stars all the way.The masterpiece... http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hash-house-a-go-go-las-vegas-5?select=8oW8c6E4IWay0MhURzQn_Q#4MG6MmBLXIl1kwp_ucw3kgAnd here's a nice cross section of it to fully appreciate all it's glory...  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hash-house-a-go-go-las-vegas-5?select=8oW8c6E4IWay0MhURzQn_Q#50iLIS2poMhauloTh8so2wI also got a chance to try the Big O' Crispy Hand Hammered Pork Tenderloin Sandwich.  We all agreed while impressive to look at, it wasn't on the same level as Sage Fried Chicken Benedict.  It was a tasty deep fried pork cutlet but I found it needing more than just the sprinkling of ketchup on it as it got a little dry.  I did love the pickles as the vinegar flavor worked well with the pork.  Perhaps some kind of creamy BBQ sauce would have been better.  The bun was a whole wheat bun, but was a throw away here.  Why whole wheat?  I have no idea.  3.5 stars http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hash-house-a-go-go-las-vegas-5?select=8oW8c6E4IWay0MhURzQn_Q#sMJihbRjw3f9nOLeumyMPQMy wife for some reason got the most boring burger on the menu.  As such I found myself saying....just a burger.  Their burgers are two half pound patties stuffed with a few different options.  Well it doesn't seem that they are really "stuffed" just things are put between the 2 burgers.  She got bacon, cheddar, and avocado.  So to me it was just how they layered everything, big deal the bacon, cheddar, and avocado was between two separate patties.  There was also no sauce?  Just ketchup.  We asked for some mayo, so it wasn't so dry, but this place should really come up with their own sauce.  If you want a burger, there are better more creative options in Vegas, such as Burger Bar or Bachi Burger.  3.5 stars. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hash-house-a-go-go-las-vegas-5?select=8oW8c6E4IWay0MhURzQn_Q#hjjZMDOZjlfQE0GSgrp17AI'm sure there are other 5 star dishes here as I saw a lot of amazing looking things.  My daughter's plain pancake was one of the best I've ever tasted.  They do them all kinds of ways here.  Of course the pancake was the size of a medium pizza and a good 3/4 inch thick.  For sure I'm trying one of their hash dishes next time.  After all they are called Hash House.  The Meatloaf and Smoked Mozzarella Hash sounds great with a couple of over easy eggs on top.  I can recommend the banana latte.  It was excellent. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hash-house-a-go-go-las-vegas-5?select=8oW8c6E4IWay0MhURzQn_Q#V1jbFFDhdWldAaGeyBHHWgExpect at least a 20-30 minute wait as the word is out on this place.  They told us 45, but we were in in 20.  It's a huge restaurant and they move them in and out fairly well.  Open 24 hours!!!!Warning: Portions here are humongous! I ordered a Sage Fried Chicken Linguine to share with two other drunken people and that was way more than enough food for all three of us. The mushroom cream was ok. Wasn't too overwhelming but it wasn't the best either. There was a good amount of it which came in handy when we tasted the sage fried chicken. The sage fried chicken wasn't hot to temperature and it was also super duper dry. I only ate a few bites of it and I had to dip it in the sauce with my pasta to be able to enjoy. I did like the crispy green beans that were in the pasta. Our waiter was very difficult to find. Find to place the order, find to get a water refill, find to ask where the restroom is at, and to find to get the check. The place is pretty big but wasn't very crowded that night so I don't know how that works. (Bathrooms our outside by Fat Tuesdays)What we thought would be a quick bite ended up being pretty long. Service is slow, food is ok. Decent place to go for diner food and large portions to share with a lot of people.We have a Hash House in San Diego and the wait is always over 2 hours. I did it once, and swore I'd never do it again. Because I refuse to do the wait, when we were in town visiting, my fiancé wanted to give Hash House a try since he's never been. We came in on a Friday around 12 PM for brunch. We were quoted about 25 minutes before we could be sat. What's awesome about this location is that they have a bartender by the hostess who can make you drinks while you wait for  your table so you don't have to go up to the bar. I liked this idea!Since there was open seating at the bar, we decided to just hop up there and opt out of waiting for a table. I warned him that the portions are HUGE and since I didn't feel like walking out of there in a food coma, we should just share a plate. Judging by the two men seated next to us who looked like they were struggling to get another bite down, he decided to take my advice (smart guy lol).We both ordered up Bloody Mary's- which were perfect- not too much horseradish ( I hate horseradish so the fact that it was in there and I couldn't taste it, was awesome), and perfectly spicy. Of course my fiancé opted to "man" up his Bloody Mary and ordered the BLT Bloody Mary.We decided to share the chicken and waffles. The waffles had a strip of bacon in the center, another bonus for all you bacon lovers out there. The sage fried chicken was good, but the sage was WAY too over powering. Overall, it was decent- nothing crazy. The portion sizes are what draws people in but the taste is meh. I probably won't be back unless I'm with a group of people who absolutely insist on coming and even then- I'd probably just order a bloody marry.Oh, a plus is the bartenders kicked ass! Great energy, great customer service!Over hyped. There I said it. Don't be hating, I just wasn't blown away and after seeing words like ''amazing'', ''exceptional'' and ''spectacular'' appearing in so many reviews I did expect more than the very average tasting Chicken and Waffles I had. Ok, portions are huge but that is the exact reason why America has an obesity problem. Half the portions, increase the quality and you're onto a winner Hash House.Located inside The Quad this place is a bitch to find. It's on the 2nd floor and accessible from an escalator in a dark corner of the ground floor, you really have to be paying attention to the signs and directions.Once inside the place is large and the staff inviting. The menu consists of Breakfast, Brunch, Lunch and Dinner with your usual American fare. Knowing from the Yelp pictures before we came the portions were big we decided to order just one Entree to share and see how we go with that before ordering more.- Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hash-house-a-go-go-las-vegas-5?select=WMlwV0h4FJ210s5htktfYg#qbOfWBSEnFvS3S5Kvu9uBA) The Waffles have Bacon cooked into them and comes with Leeks. The presentation was great, piled high and held together with a huge steak knife, truly a beast of a meal.My Husband and I found the Chicken to be a little dry and the coating oily. It also had a strong flour taste where too much had been used before the egg wash and crumb coating. The Waffles and Syrup were good if you took out the Bacon (consisted of more fat than meat) and the Leeks really added nothing to the dish, do people even eat them?The portion was large enough for Breakfast between two of us though as we didn't even manage to finish it, how one person could eat that much in one sitting is beyond me.Bottom line? Disappointing experience, I'm glad I did come here after wanting to for so long but am not likely to return. I guess it's the kind of place you come once just to say you have been. Probably more 2.5 / 5. I'm too generous...Awwww Man!!!!! This place totally ROCK!!!!Great food, Great Service and reasonable prices for Vegas!!!!! Large Portions.  Long wait!If you're wowed by over the top presentation and foods that will make you instantly gain 10lbs at the table, Hash Hash is for you! If not, take your belly elsewhere. BIG portion is an understatement. I'm sure the phrase quantity over quality was epitomized at this place. And there's nothing wrong with it. I was oooing and ahhing as well but when it came down to flavors, they were pretty average. Instead of paying $17 for my average chicken and waffles that I would have to eat over the course of 3 days, I rather pay $12 for a normal plate. Just sayin...1:30am leaving Harrah's casino extremely tired yet extremely hungry. Those two together is a bad combination! Why?! because while you are sitting and waiting for your meal to come, you end up looking like a "bobble head" to the other diners. I mean my head was just ah "bobbing and weaving"- couldn't keep my eyes open for sh*t. Thankfully I was with a group of gals celebrating my good friend's bachelorette weekend, so in between conversations and silence, I was getting some shut eye lol.To sum up the food: delish! The French Toast meal (dang, can't remember the exact name but it's one of their most popular dishes) was slamming! It was way too much food. We all concurred that we probably could have shared (2 people share one french toast meal). As far as service, it wasn't that many people so why was service so freaking slow. I don't know, maybe less cooks or one waiter. I don't think I fully enjoyed my meal because if the long wait. By the time my meal came, I was too tired to even eat half of it.Next time I will have to come with a full appetite and a nap under my belt!Massive portions.  Food was good enough.  Went with my boy and he's a big eater.  Even he couldn't finish.Prices reasonable. Vegas used to have great late night options, but they're dwindling as casinos turn to fast food mall-style eateries for after hours.   I hate it. But this place is a bit of the good old days.Please don't review this business if you received a freebie for writing this review, or if you're connected in any way to the owner or employees.Honestly, I am not a breakfast person. Never liked pancakes because every time I eat them I feel like I am chewing Styrofoamey nothingness that sucks so fucking bad that you must add Aunt Jemima and butter to it to make them somewhat edible.  However, the dilemma is that my better half loves breakfast and so, we compromise and usually have brunch... with bottomless mimosas and/or Bloody Mary's  to wash that Styrofoam down. So, when we were in Vegas recently and she suggested that we eat at Hash House a Go Go (HHAGG) at The LINQ before leaving Las Vegas like Nick Cage, I was like, "of course honey" because you know, happy wife... yadda yadda yadda. When we showed up at high noon like clueless morons that get shot by stray gunfire at a shootout, we were totally ambushed by the 45-minute wait. We should have thought it through that a lot of people would be grabbing a bite to eat before heading back to their not-so-sinful cities... Damn that hangover...  speaking of Hangover, if you get to the end of my review, I have a treat for you...Anyways, I gave the server my name and after receiving a plastic laminated number card, we headed out to kill some time by exploring the stores at The LINQ Promenade, which felt a lot like The Grove in Los Angeles sans a trolley and actual worthwhile stores to spend money at. This place looks much better at night, kind of like that girl/guy from Drai's or Hakkasan that you somehow end up waking up next to. By the time we got back to HHAGG, we waited another 5 minutes and then our number was called. Then they do this weird fucking thing where they make you stand on a red rug in the middle of the restaurant. All I can say is that, it was weird just standing there. After a few minutes we were seated and our awesome hipster-bearded server, Andrew, served us. We ended up sharing the most popular dish that was purported to be a New York Times favorite on the menu... the Sage Fried Chicken & Waffles. Let me repeat - we SHARED this shit. This thing was humongous. It came with two Jurassic-sized fried chicken breasts with waffles that had hardwood smoked bacon cooked into them that was then topped with a hot maple reduction, and fried leeks... all this stuff was stacked into a giant tower that was all skewered together with a rosemary spear and a freaking steak knife. Truly amazing... All for less than $20! We ended up getting the tractor iced coffee for around $3 and this was always refilled promptly by Andrew and he even gave us a to-go cup for our 4th helping of iced coffee when we were leaving. I've had chicken and waffles elsewhere. I've done the fancy at Bouchon and of course the not-so-fancy at Roscoe's. But honestly, I have never enjoyed chicken and waffles to the point that I literally sounded like I was having an orgasm as I ate and after I ate because I was moaning so much from the tasty food and from being so full. Oooooh! Ohhhhhhhhhh! Oh gawd! Everything was tasty. The batter of the sage fried chicken was perfect and adding bacon to the waffles made a world of a difference. And the leeks! Holy smokes were they fucking delicious!Look, people that give HHAGG a bad review are "hhaggs" that ended up not getting the Sage Fried Chicken & Waffles. Stick to what they are good at. That is like going to Lawry's Prime Rib and complaining that their spinning salad sucks. Of course it's going to fucking suck dipshit, that's why they spin it. Look, this place is open 24/7 so take a break from drinking, macking, gambling, bringing-your-homies-down-because-you-lost-all-your-wages-on-the-1st-night-like-a-chump-and-got-a-cash-advance-from-your-credt-card-with-28%-interest, and/or sucking-your-gut-in... and just go-go to Hash House a Go Go. It will be the best decision you make. Just anticipate a wait if you go during peak hours.* So I referenced the Hangover earlier... the following is a true story. I went to the Roscoe's Chicken & Waffles in South Los Angeles off Manchester and a brother came up to me and literally said, "hey I saw your hairy ass penis in that movie! Too-da-loooooo..."  Damn that Ken Jeong. Damn you!This was one of the best meals I had while in Las Vegas, and believe me, I ate a lot! This is a southern, down home style of cooking. They're open 24/7, and were able to serve us quickly and efficiently at 4am. The food was presented in a beautiful manner, with fresh rosemary and thyme poking out of the food. The food came quickly, and was hot, and there was plenty of it. The decor was interesting. Sort of a 70's style steakhouse with all the celebrities who ate there  tacked up by the entrance. The service was friendly and efficient. They wished me "good luck" when I ordered the house specialty. The prices were a bit higher than what I'm used to paying for down home cooking, but for the portions, it was actually a good deal. I challenge anyone to walk away from this place hungry. It can't happen. I got the dish that was featured on Man vs Food, the fried chicken benedict. I didn't see it as that big of a challenge, but it was a lot of food. My buddy got the hamburger, which he raved about. Our other buddy ordered some sort of chicken dish, but had to leave suddenly when all the free booze from the casinos caught up with him. We attempted to eat his dish, but we couldn't make it. The food was filling and delicious, and the fresh herbs were certainly appreciated. Out of the entire trip to Vegas, this was probably the culinary highlight of the whole trip. It can be a bit difficult to find this place, as it's tucked in the rear of the Linq Casino, but ask enough slot jockeys, and they'll point you in the right direction. I encourage you to check this place out.I had no choice but to try Hash House A Go Go.  My co-worker highly recommended this place and it had pretty good reviews from my Yelp friends.  The family and I arrived at noontime on a Saturday where we were met by a long wait. We waited along with the masses in the front of the restaurant listening to the woman call out garbled sounding numbers over their PA system until it seemed close to our turn.  When it seemed close to our turn, I had to go up to the front to ask her what number she just called.  Tired of seeing my face, they finally called out my number and sat the family and I in the back corner of the restaurant.We sat there perusing the menu.  Google Hangout messages were sent by my friends who told me that I needed order their Corned Beef Hash and their Chicken and waffles.  We were all ready to order.  Missing was our waiter.  We kept looking at the wait staff, but, none of them stopped at our table.  We didn't know if we had a waiter or a waitress.  Then I saw a nicely dressed man getting drinks for a table that was close to ours, and I heard the table behind me grumbling about the waiter not being there to deliver their check so that they could leave.  We were already seated for 20 minutes.  We needed to go home, back to Los Angeles.  So, I flagged down the nicely dressed man and asked him about our nonexistent waiter.  After a little bit of chit chat, we gave the nicely dressed man our order.  It wasn't until half an hour later that our waiter finally showed up and introduced himself.  Too late...your manager had already taken our order.  The food was good.  The portions were big and could have been easily shared by two people.  The Corned Beef Hash came on a skillet with lots of cheese, corned beef on top of potatoes, an egg, and a biscuit.  It was good.  Even my daughter who doesn't like to eat meat liked it.  The Chicken and waffles was impressive.  The fried chicken came in a tower held in place by a knife. The chicken was flavorful and moist.  It was a winner.The nicely dressed man, the manager came back to check on us.  Like the tables around us, he gave us a 25% discount.  The waiter finally showed up at the end, perhaps he was expecting some kind of tip.  Good food, but, nonexistent waiter.  I might've given them more stars if the waiter showed up.Their food here is massive! The service here is superb! The food is good just a lottttt, you have to come really hungry and share share share. We seriously over ordered the food we couldn't finish it all.We came here early for breakfast there was about a 20 minute wait which wasn't too bad. We were seated and served by a very pleasant woman I wish I knew her name because she was just the most patient and wonderful server I have come across.I had to order their famous sage chicken, let's just say this bad boy was just too much I couldn't see myself ordering this again but it was good don't get me wrong. It had butter milk biscuits, bacon, spinach, tomatoes, sage fried chicken, scrambled eggs, mozarella cheese and chipotle creme on top. It was really good but we weren't able to finish it between the 2 of us it just was a lot of food and the bacon was a little overkill for me.  This was featured on Man Vs. Food. Let's just say it won. :) We also ordered the brown sugar pancakes which were really good they had bananas also. Their kids menu their french toast portion is so big too, they brought out 2 big pieces of french toast topped with banana, butter and powdered sugar. Their french toast is really good. I really enjoyed their french toast.All in all a wonderful experience, you definitely must try and like I said before Come Hungry!I specifically chose this location over the one inside Rio because of their 4 star reviews over 3 stars at Rio... Unfortunately, I'm only giving this place 3 stars because the service was pretty bad. 3 stars for their great menu with unique offerings (lots of breakfast items), huge portions, and ample seating. Value: since their portions are hugenormous, you can understand why they charge so much. However, $5.99 for hot chocolate, it's a bit overpriced. Taste: I only ordered the chicken and waffles. The chicken was crispy on the outside and tender meat inside- great! The taste- well, it's just ok. It can have a bit more flavor. The waffle is bacon infused. And since bacon makes everything better, I had no complaints there. The chicken is a bit over battered for my liking... Leaving fried batter all over the plate so on top of the thick bacon waffles, you have all this breading from the chicken--- carbs anyone???Service: here's why i deducted 2 points... The bf ordered espresso... Accidentally, upon setting the cup on the table, the server spilled the espresso on the table, my seat, pants, and sleeves. We all know how small an espresso is so with half of it gone, he barely had any. You would think he would offer to replace it, nope! Fine. We realized our server clearly do not care about beverage because we already had our food and the water never came. Tending to our hydration needs seemed such an abhorrent task for him. The server gave no apologies, no f*ck, nor two sh!ts Finale: this place is overrated. Their food presentation is impressive however the taste does not match its aesthetics. What can I say, I'm a professional complainer and an emotional eater. Eating is an experience for me. To me, this was not a good one.

Review Text :
I LOVE French food.. in fact when we travel abroad, me and the Mr always make a point to visit a Frenchie place in another city. So when I got wind of a new French place right here in our own backyard I was stoked! The best part, its owned by chef James Porter, who did amazing job over at the now closed Tapino, so my excitement turned to elation when our reservation was confirmed!So now that I'm home from my dinner with the Mr, I guess I'm slightly indifferent. While they had a strong opening night, it wasn't the service or food per-se but more like the other diners. The dining room is small and extremely intimate with an amazing looking patio, we chose to sit on the inside. The interior is covered in wood, really, the floors, ceiling, walls but nicely contrasted by very stylish crystal chandeliers. I do have to say that I'm sure glad that they chose larger tables for the diners, since you can never have enough space. So there is plenty of room at the table to simply spread out and relax.Service is pretty shiny and have no complaints, in fact our server was outgoing, attractive and knowledgeable. The bar staff was also very competent since both of our cocktails, Bohemian Sidecar ($9) and the Le Matador de Nimes ($9) were mixed perfectly and tasted great, putting us both into great moods until... a 6 top was sat down right next to us.. I know the old saying, you can't choose your family and in this case, you cant choose your dining neighbors either. They were so loud the Mr and I just looked at each other then decided to check email and stuff on our phones. We couldn't even talk which was a real bummer since this was going to be a romantic evening out. Anyway, the food will make up for it, right?Of course I have high expectations.. new Foodiebear rule of life, never have expectations of anyone, or anything or you're going to set yourself up for irritation, heartache and misery. With that being said they were out of f*cking Pate! Can you believe that?! Out of the one thing that Ive been looking forward to this entire week. Opening night, first thing on the menu, first table in the place, out of something. I know, I know, things happen but come on, this is opening night!!!! *Sigh* Ended up ordering the Steak Tartar ($8) and the Mr ordered the Foie Gras ($10). Both were excellent both in presentation, quality and taste. While my tartar wasn't pate, it was still excellent with its fried egg on top and crispy potato crisps. The foie was much like the tartar, deliciously perfect and for the price, major value. In fact all of the food that we ordered was really big, surprising for the price points. Let me tell you what, the Onion Soup ($6) was prefect. In fact Ive never had onion soup that was that good! Perfectly sweet, savory and the right amount of cheese crouton to compliment the soup, not over power it. The Mr liked his Vichyssoise ($6) with it smooth creamy texture and a quenelle of salmon mousse in the center which added a smokey complexity to the soup. Again, the servings were quite large and could have been halved pretty easily. Entrees were a kind of hit and miss. The Mr had the Steak Frites ($17) which was well cooked but came covered in compound butter thaqt had anchovy in it. First bite I was immediately turned off to the slight fishy undertone. Thank goodness neither of us have fish allergies, very unexpected. The frites were nicely crisp and well seasoned. However the side of sauce for dipping was just strange. Was made from vinegar and had a decent texture but just tasted odd with the fries and the meat all together. Would have preferred something a little more basic, again a preference. I ordered the Porc et Lardon ($16) as my entree and Im pretty happy with the result. Grilled bacon wrapped pork tenderloin with roasted pork gratin which was made with roast pork shoulder, shaved fennel and celery root. The contrast in the flavors and textures was right up my alley aside from the tenderloin being a tad over cooked, it is again opening night.Desserts were limited to three choices, Chocolate Brulee, Biegnets and Grande Marnier Souffle. We went with the Biegnets de Nutella ($6) and the Souffle ($6). The biegnets had a filling of Nutella which was alright but wasn't a fan until, I took some of the Mr's creme anglaise and dunked them into that. Delish. The souffle was so light and and was just brown enough to caramelize the sugar. You cant go wrong with either dessert. All in all Petite Maison is an excellent value and with Chef James Porter at the helm expect solid French fare nightly with breakfast and lunch being added soon. Looking forward to back soon but this time Ill go with no expectations.When Jared suggested we try Petite Maison last night (Tuesday), I immediately approved... he tends to get stuck at his regular places and it's rare he wants to try somewhere new - so when the adventurous feeling strikes, I have to jump on it!  So we headed over there around 7pm, and we had a wonderful dinner.  The restaurant is beautiful and although I never made it in when it was "Buckets," Jared says they did a fantastic job with the renovations... I absolutely love the chandeliers!Since it was a beautiful night, we opted to sit outside.  The patio is comfortable and now that the weather is cooling down, I'm sure it will become a local favorite for hot spot outdoor dining.  Jerry, our server, took great care of us.  As we perused the menu, we noticed that everything is reasonably priced, and although I'm typically not a huge fan of French cuisine, there were a handful of items that were appealing to me.  Jerry brought us fresh warm rolls that had tasty herbs baked into them.  I usually skip the bread basket but I make exceptions for 'special' occasions and this was one of them - each bite was delightful!Just as we finished up our rolls, our Salade Maison was served (we ordered one to share).  Described as crispy chevre, lardons, candied walnuts, peppery greens and roasted shallot vinaigrette, (and I noticed it also had dill in it which I love); the salad was delicious and perfectly balanced with sweet and salty flavors and just the right amount of dressing. It was large enough to share, and priced right at $7.Next, I had the Coquille Saint-Jacques (sea scallops appetizer priced at a moderate $8) and a side of asparagus and Jared enjoyed the Poulet Roti (roasted stuffed chicken entree - $15).  We both cleaned our plates after admiring the beautiful presentations.Adding to the ambiance was the spot on French music (including French renditions of songs we all know) - props to Wendy for that! I'm totally in wedding mode at the moment so perhaps I fell hard for Petite Maison because of that alone; it was a memorable romantic meal that I shared with my fiance afterall...  but I'm pretty sure that Petite Maison will become a regular in our rotation - can't wait to try it for breakfast, brunch, and lunch too!Really, really enjoyed Petite Maison last night.First of all, I love the space. It's small, which I think adds charm. The patio is great and with weather like we've been having, it was amazing out there. I also love the restaurant interior itself. I love the space, the wood walls, the chandeliers, the bar... Very cool look and vibe.We also had excellent service. Both the bartender and our server were great - total pros. As far as our meal, we sampled a variety of things and really enjoyed most everything.We ordered and shared the escargots, steak tartare, foie gras, Coquille Saint-Jacques (scallops), vichyssoise and onion soup. Highlights for me were the escargots, steak tartare, foie gras and onion soup. The dishes were excellent. They even reminded me of the food my dad's old place (The Glass Door) served years ago, and not too far away. While we didn't have the puff pastry, the escargots with the pernod garlic butter were quite similar.  They were great. We definitely took full use of the good bread provided to soak up the garlic butter. The onion soup was also similar. It was fantastic, one of the best I've had in years. I will definitely be ordering that again. And while I may still be a bit partial to my dad's steak tartare, I'd also say that was excellent. I really liked the playfulness of the dish with the fried egg and homemade potato chips. The foie was great too.We also had great drinks. They have a nice selection of spirits and the bartender made a very tasty chartreuse concoction that I didn't get the name of. I had a Dogfish Head 90 minute IPA that was served in a large very cold, snifter. Was a great way to present it and of course a great beer.While they have a full menu, it's nice to see the option to go and get a variety of great appetizers. I also really like the idea of their late night staff meals.It helps that it's just down the street too!My favorite thing about eating at French places is cheese plates and wine so naturally this is what I ordered at Petite Maison. And it definitely did not disappoint. Four types of cheese ranging from blue to soft and creamy came with an assortment of sides such as mini-pickles (gherkins?), sauces and breads. Delicious! I also had a satisfying salad and a French press coffee. While normally I love French press this one left something to be desired, but it did the job and fueled me through the night with its caffeine content.The space is smallish and quaint with a nice bar as well as a cute patio area. Their beer list is surprisingly well done, as is the wine list, of course. Take a date here or have a business lunch with a potential client to impress. Perhaps you'll seal the deal in either case.So glad Gabi chose this place for Lunch, but damn the rain for ruining our chance at the lovely patio dining. Such cozy cuteness, I was beside myself. I just adored the pretty patio with all it's flowers, umbrellaed tables, heaters and even a roaring fireplace. Inside was more CC, chandeliers over each table, dark wood, and my favorite part was the beautifully framed window, literally framed, but instead of a picture you look out the window to the lattice and creeping vines, so cool! Wish I would have taken a pic of that. Several things on the menu wanted me to order them but I went with the Salmon Nicoise (see pics) It was not only beautiful but also delicious. Other guests ordered the Quiche and the Onion Soup (see pics) Both looked wonderful and I was told they were. I have only one complaint and it's really just more of a disappointment than anything. On such a rainy cold day I was hoping they would have some decadent hot chocolate to warm me up but they did not......Maybe soon? I went with hot tea instead and was pleasantly satisfied. I will definitely return to try some more of the very reasonably priced French Fare.I've been avoiding writing this review as this place holds bittersweet memories for me, but my unwritten reviews are stacking up, and I hate being a procrastinator, so here goes...Loved the atmosphere!  Alison and I decided to come here to try their "staff meals," which are served from 10p till closing.  The restaurant usually serves two to three dishes, labeled as such, at discounted prices.  We thought it was a great way to sample menu fare w/out losing our wallets (although, in retrospect, the very small portions necessitated our ordering more, so, really, I didn't find the staff meals to offer such great savings, but I digress).  It was such a nice evening that we decided we'd dine outside.  New friends would join us at a later time that evening.  (We were lucky enough to score a table by the crackling fireplace.  So romantic- take note, guys!)Alison was hungry, so she started off w/ a bowl of onion soup.  I wished I could've had a taste- it looked so good!- but it contained an ingredient or two to which I'm still allergic, so I passed.  We both had a glass of wine each.  Friends later joined us, and so we placed an order of the frog legs ($8) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/petite-maison-scottsdale?select=WRlCnJLkxSKMeIBd-p5EiA#WRlCnJLkxSKMeIBd-p5EiA and an order of the turkey bruschetta ($10). http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/petite-maison-scottsdale?select=XKgUUPNc5BtbWBATWY_2Ug#XKgUUPNc5BtbWBATWY_2Ug  When both appetizer plates arrived, I immediately placed a second order since 2 frog legs (although these were GIGANTIC frog legs- I'd hate to encounter these frogs in some Amazonian forest, that's for sure!) and two bruschetta slices just weren't going to cut it for the four of us!The general consensus was that I was the only one in the bunch who would gladly order the frog legs again.  I did notice that the first order of frog legs was much crispier, and therefore better received, at least by moi, than the second plate.  We all loved the turkey bruschetta (pronounced w/ an "sh" instead of the hard "sk," but no worries- both pronunciations are correct, depending on the regions you find yourself in Italy, but wait, aren't we supposed to be in France??).  This app was basically a turkey salad (ala chicken salad) atop a mustard aioli and then garnished w/ fresh cranberry relish/compote.  I adored this dish!So why the bittersweet memories?  Ah, well... a couple of things, really.  First, while I loved the romantic table we had by the fireplace outside, it did get chilly at the end, and I think that made Alison want to go home early.  I also had a chance to check out Petite Maison's all-wood interiors... very nice!  A few nestled-tables surrounding a beautiful and polished bar-counter.  Petite Maison is certainly a petite, and pretty, dining facility.And what's my second bittersweet point?  Why, it's the wait till the next time I visit Petite Maison, of course!  I'll need to sock away a lot more francs before visiting again, though.  What?  You weren't expecting a juicy confession, now, were you?  ;)  Hope you enjoy the photos!Love it. Petite Maison rocks, the end. The design is cozy and refined and sexy, the staff are friendly and attentive, the service is super fast even when they are packed and the food is delicious. I've only been there late at night and hear great things about the brunch, but let me tell you, the escargot is fabulous, the salade maison is the perfect size and refreshing, and I tried a port-poached pear and creme fraiche dessert the last time I was there that was incredibly lively and light. The parking is kind of tough because of competition from nearby bars and clubs, but there's always valet if you're impatient.At last...my love has come along.When chef James Porter's "Tapino" closed in May of last year, it was a sad day indeed.  It had been one of the first tapas style restaurants in the valley and  I would miss his bold and inventive dishes.  Now, there would be one less place for tantalizing international cuisine.Back then, he said, "This phoenician will rise again."  And he has, with something that the town of Scottsdale was in dire need of.  A cozy french eatery.With only 33 seats inside, but ample pation seating, it is ideal to book a table in advance.  The place has the feel of a French country cottage, with its wooden walls, tiny chandeliers, and brocade fabrics.  French music ranging from Brigit Bardot to Jacques Brel pipes in from speakers above.My guest and I came here on a Sunday afternoon for brunch.  We were seated at the only remaining table in the place. I started off with the "Mimosa maison" with champagne, lychee, and fresh squeezed orange.  Following that came the Nutella beignets with powdered sugar.  I am a sucker for beignets, but nothing beats Jackson Square in New Orleans.My main dish was the Croque Monsieur" with shaved ham, gruyere, and sauce mornay on croissant.  I felt like I was in Paris again.  The only thing missing was a cappuccino and a cigarette.  It was amazing!Our server said "As you Wish" after every request, so we both felt like the Princess Bride and appreciated the attentiveness and care of the staff here.From what I gathered, the menu is ever-changing, but I hope that French favorites such as escargot, mussels, steak tartare,and onion soup will forever remain on the menu.  I would recommend this cozy spot for breakfast, lunch, dinner, or a romantic date.  I look forward to returning there soon for dinner, myself.I had such a good time at Petite Maison that I went there twice in one day! Who would have thought a genuine slice of Paris could be found in Scottsdale?Each dish I tried was a tasteful pleasure, from the escargot to the onion soup. A highlight for me was their preparation of steak tartare, where just a drop of hot sauce acts as a secret ingredient in bringing out the flavor. Complementing the food is a well-thought out wine list, and at very reasonable prices. If only I had more time, I'd be back for their hamburger.But perhaps the true mark of an exceptional restaurant is the customer service. I left knowing Wendy, James and Chad on a first name basis, almost as if we were old friends, in fact. I can't wait to return to Arizona, if only to come to Petite Maison one more time.The first time I visited Petite Maison, it was for lunch on a cold and rainy afternoon. As I rushed past the wet outdoor seating, I promised myself I would come back in better weather and enjoy an evening on the patio. One should never break promises, especially the ones you make to yourself. So, I was more than happy to return recently for wine and appetizers under the stars! No rain here - just a beautiful night for dining alfresco. The patio, complete with lit fireplace, was like a garden party surrounded by plants and flowers. I couldn't have asked for better atmosphere. Sitting back and sipping a nice glass of Latour Domaine de Valmoisinne Pinot Noir I thought "this is as good as it gets". What was I thinking? Of course it could get better - I hadn't even eaten yet! We weren't "full meal" hungry, so my friend and I decided on a few appetizers to enjoy along with our wine: Escargots en Croûte - this was my first experience with escargot, and I will admit that due to an unfortunate childhood snail incident I was a bit hesitant. My bravery was rewarded by the perfect combination of garlic, herbs, pernod and butter, all capped off by puffed pastry. Yes, I dipped my bread in the segments of the serving dish to absorb more garlicky goodness. Moules Maison - I am a huge fan of mussels and these didn't disappoint. They were nicely sized, and served in a white wine and thyme broth. More bread-dipping ensued... Soup à l'onion - I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE onion soup and this was among the best I have tasted. The broth was rich and flavorful, with just the right amount of caramelized onions. It was topped with bubbling gruyere cheese that made each and every bite so very good. Our server was attentive and informative - she really knew the menu! Extra points for keeping us stocked with warm herb rolls. When asked about one of the after dinner drinks on the menu, she even produced a sample of Armagnac Samalens. While I didn't try it, my friend wanted to "bathe in it" so I am assuming it was very good! I can't wait to go back...I've been to this restaurant several times for lunch - it's close to the office. The burger is good and Nicoise salad is also a personal favorite. Well it was... In fact I was put off the restaurant as a whole due to a recent experience. The last time I ordered the Nicoise salad with Salmon the potatoes were stale! And by stale I mean noticably shriveled and inside/to taste 100% stale. Given they are a main component of the salad I mentioned it to the waiter when he asked how my meal was. He seemed surprised that I would say anything other than, 'yes it's good thanks' and my response literally caught him off balance... 'I'll mention it to the chef', he said. A few minutes later the waiter returned and thanked me. Erm for what? Telling you the potatoes were stale? There was no offer to replace or sub the  potatoes. In all honesty I didn't really care - I was on a lunch break and it was more important for me to eat within the time I had available... About 5 minutes passed and a lady sitting at the bar ordered the same Nicoise salad. I watched with interest as it was placed in front of her curious as to whether they had subbed the stale potatoes. A few minutes later on a return run to the kitchen I overheard the waiter remark to the chef, 'we've got to dump those potatoes, she's the third person we've had today picking them out and leaving them aside...' So they knew about the issue before I reported it and served me, then after I complained they served them to another customer. My check arrive - there was no mention of the potatoes or any adjustment to the check. I'm done going to Petite Mason - but I'm not done telling this story to everyone I meet!!!Petite Maison, you may earn the title of petite in the size of your little Maison but your food earns the title of grande! The appearance of Petite Maison earns a point because it's this adorable little cottage situated in the middle of the hustle and bustle of Old Town. True to its French roots, the stucco exterior is full of greenery and flowers and resembles a cottage straight out of a french children's book. It's just as dainty inside. When you first walk in, it's similar to walking into an enchanted cottage with a bar on the left and intimate dining on the right. The patio is hidden and covered with plants. While petite, it really is the perfect size for the concept. The food is tres bon. I've tried their two specialties: the salmon braconne and the burger Maison. My goal is to try everything on the menu but for now I think I've gotten le creme of the crop in the cuisine department! Normally more of a sandwich girl myself, I heard that the salmon salad was pretty spectacular so I had to give it a go. The reviews don't lie my friends. It's delicious. It's buttery, delectable, refreshing and literally melts in your mouth. The poached salmon is cooked to perfection and I wish I had the entire salad and not just half! However, the burger was just as spectacular as I hoped as well. With the brioche bun and gooey cheese, it also melted in your mouth and the bread was as soft as can be. Next on my list is to try the Croque Monsieur because if it's anything like the food I've already tried, then I know my taste buds are in for a treat! All in all, Petite Maison lends for an adorable experience and I think this would be a good restaurant to go with friends, your Mom or even on a date. Or all of the above! The staff is incredibly friendly and I wish they would place petite maisons all over the valley! We need more french dining like this.Besides the fact that I stopped here for lunch during a quick break from work I felt like a "lady who lunches" in this adorable cottage.  It's so adorable that I figured there would be a large lunch crowd, but we were able to easily grab a table outside.  And oh how I love to eat outside in March...something I don't ever get to do this time of year in Chicago.I did what most ladies who lunch would do and ordered a glass of iced tea. After a few sips I remembered that I don't actually like iced tea and wish I had ordered a glass of refreshing lemonade instead. Next time!I picked better when it came to my entree. The jardin sandwich was a perfect combo of veggies and brie cheese (my fave!).  It was a nice size and quite filling as well.There was no leisurely lunch for this lady since I had to be back at work...so I appreciated that our waiter had us in and outta there within 45 min. I'd definitely lunch here again and may even go back for some wine after work hours!This past Saturday night was the pinnacle of my entire fine-dining life! I'm not joking and I'm not exaggerating, it was that damn good! Thanks to a Yelp event and Petite Maison's generosity, I was fortunate to win a 10 course meal with wine pairings for four people. I have to say, my hopes were very high and I went into the evening expecting to write a five star review. By the end of the night I was left wishing I could give a 10 star rating. Let's see if this review can do any justice to our night. Our reservation was for 7pm and I was accompanied by my fiancee and another couple.First off, our waiter/sommelier was Dustin. He was an outstanding server and a friendly young man. Dustin was unbelievably informative on each and every dish and wine served. I highly recommend requesting him when you make a reservation. Dustin gave the background and history of each wine along with how you should drink the wine with the food.We started the night with a Bordeaux Sauvignon Blanc to accompany our first two dishes: bread puffs and a chilled Sweet Corn Soup with Truffle Oil. The bread puffs were freshly baked and delicious, but the soup was especially phenomenal! A great way to start the night.Next we had a Chardonnay to go along with a Beet, Radish and Multicolored Cauliflower Salad and then a caviar dish. The salad was light and delicious. The caviar was on top of a creamy scrambled egg with truffle I believe. By itself, the caviar was a bit too fishy for me, but when combined with the egg it was very good.   I appreciated this dish even though it wasn't my favorite since it was my first time trying caviar.A Pinot Noir was the third wine and the first red of the evening. This wine was paired first with pan seared loup de mer, which literally means "wolf of the sea" in French. The fish was incredible! Definitely one of the highlights of the night! You may know it by its Italian name, branzino. We were then served an excellent soft shelled crab dish. It was fried to perfection and served atop a delectable sauce.The fourth wine of the night blew us all away! We were served a wine by Domaine Faillenc Sainte Marie winery. It was made with a Cinsault grape (pronounced "sinso", or close to that) and it provided the most unique scents and tastes that any of us at the table had experienced. I'll never forget this wine and I am determined to find it somewhere. Thank you Dustin for exposing me to its greatness! My fellow Yelpers, you have to check it out. The Cinsault was paired with duck and lamb dishes. Both meats were out of this world and prepared perfectly, just like every other dish we experienced.Lastly, the two dessert dishes were accompanied by a port. Not a big port guy, but I guess it's the wine to have when eating dessert. For a port I actually enjoyed this one. The first desert was a slice of baguette served with cheese and fruit. The second were mini chocolate doughnuts with a heavenly cream dipping sauce. Perfect ending to a perfect meal.Each dish was spaced out perfectly from each other. I was shocked to discover that the Petite Maison culinary masterpiece took four hours. The time absolutely flew by. I ate every single bite and drank every single drop. Thank you Chef James Porter, Dustin, and Yelp for what was the most incredible and memorable dining experience of my life. Seriously, wow! Great food, great company, great memories. It's what life is all about.I've recently fell in love with French Cuisine and had the chance to endure great flavors from a cozy, cottage-like, French restaurant in the heart of downtown Scottsdale, Arizona.I had made rezzies at Petite Maison via Open Table on Yelp. Parking is on the street or their nearby parking lot. As we walked up to the hostess' table, she was able to show us to our seats. Although the restaurant offers outdoor patio dining, we opted to dine inside to experience dining in this cute, kitschy restaurant.*ESCARGOT ($11 for 6 pieces, **3.5 STARS**)I was expecting to shell out the escargot from it's shell! But actually, the escargot was already pulled from it's casing and baked within an individual baking dish full of melted butter and seasonings. The dish was served piping hot (especially the plate itself) along with two slices of warm, toasted baguette. The escargot was delightful, rich and tender. The warm buttery sauce it was baked in, encapsulated every crevice and gave a lot of oomph to the escargot itself. Definitely a dish worth trying! I kinda wish though I had the fun of shelling out the escargot from it's shell, but at the same time I'm kinda glad I didn't have to get down and dirty for it! *FOIE GRAS ($18, **4 STARS**)Was OMG! Mouth-watering, delicious and worth every penny! For those of you who are unfamiliar with foie, it's duck liver fat. The French would feed the ducks corn (in this case we knew the ducks were free-range and came from a decent place). The foie gras was seared and tasted like it was a piece of steak! As you cut into a piece of the seared foie, you got a piece of fat, which glistened within the light. Add a piece of the paired cranberry chutney, cider glaze and savory donut, this dish was mesmerizing! I do concur that it's worth ordering as this dish is what the restaurant is known for! GET 'EM!!!! *BOULLIABAISE ($33, **3 STARS**)A saffron base sauce was made with fresh mussels, clams, shrimp, scallops and halibut. The seafood was cooked quite well and everything was tender. The seafood was fresh! The base of the sauce was simple and not too salty. Not the best nor the worst, but pretty decent in my humble opinion.*POISSON ($28, **1 STAR**)A seared piece of halibut was cooked well. I liked that there was a nice "sear" within the fish and it was light and flaky. The only downfall to this dish is that the lobster risotto was not executed correctly. First and foremost, the risotto was so soupy that it wasn't thick in consistency as risotto should be. In addition, after one bite of the risotto, it was quite grainy - as if the rice was not yet cooked!!!!! After flagging down our waitress, she apologized for the mistake and was embarrassed for such a thing happening. The dish was sent back to the kitchen to be corrected. After several minutes, the risotto was served. Not only did it taste slightly better, BUT it was still grainy because the risotto was not cooked well..... AND it was still soupy! Unfortunately, it was the risotto that had made the halibut a lackluster as it was not paired well together. I didn't want to embarrass the waitress again and send back the dish, but accepted it as what it was. Service (**5 STARS**) was phenomenal from our waitress. I liked the fact that she shared recommendations of what to devour since it was our first time visiting the restaurant. She even shared a few corny jokes, which made our evening fun despite the risotto fail. She apologized sincerely for the mistake and was happily to correct the error. Overall, Petite Maison is a decent French restaurant in Scottsdale, Arizona. But I've had better French food in Portland, that this place doesn't really compare! If I were to come back to Petite Maison, I would probably only order the FOIS GRAS again. I had heard their dessert is good as well. Maybe my taste buds are spoiled by Portlandia, BUT for what it's worth, Petite Maison is A-OK in my book!Yelp 2013 100 for 100 Challenge - Review #27I am far from a french food expert but I had a great experience here. The staff are over the top friendly and accommodating. I love the cozy atmosphere inside and on the patio. They have an interesting cocktail menu and a choice selection of french wine and champagne to kick off your evening. We started with the escargot which was so decadent. I had the Lamb Chops which were the best I've ever had. The Scallops my friend ordered were perfectly prepared and succulent. I highly recommend you try Petite Maison very soon it is one of the best values in Scottsdale (dinner for two minus drinks was under $80).05/18/13AZ Restaurant dinner #1 started out fair enough:  Received a voicemail from Sarah in the afternoon asking to confirm my reservation for later that evening.  Called to say I was indeed coming, but may arrive earlier and was told I would be accommodated for patio dining.  I checked in around 8:15p amidst a bustling patio setting and was relegated to the bar with a waiting time of around 15 minutes.  While looking through the wine menu, I decided I'd just eat at the bar.  Bartender Matthew was my server and obliged me with tastes of sauvignon and pinot blancs so that I may decide on a glass ($9) to accompany my three-course meal ($40).  After I'd ordered the pinot, and my prix fixe of soft shell crab, sea bass, and lemon curd tartelette, my complimentary cheese puff arrived. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/petite-maison-scottsdale?select=gX_2BIP2yqskNyxU9ugNmA#gX_2BIP2yqskNyxU9ugNmA  It was delicious, but not as great as I remembered it to be during the Julia Childs' dinner of Aug. '12.What drew me in to include Petite Maison as one of my four dinners during AZ Restaurant Week, besides having eaten here many times before, was the menu's presentation.  Each course reflected a French fusion theme: the appetizer course had a French Asian twist (char sui pork jowls, or the soft shell crab tempura); the main was French Morroccan (sea bass, or roasted lamb leg), and dessert was French italian (nutella raviolis, or lemon curd tartelette).  A "French French" supplement of foie gras was also available for $14.  One of the advantages of Restaurant Week is the opportunity to try new restaurants that I haven't been able to visit before.  I also tend NOT to have dinner at a new place without first trying out the happy hour, and my daily routines and work schedule keep me from venturing out to places I've bookmarked for years, so when RW rolls around twice a year, I earmark new places, but upon seeing PM's menu, I decided to make it my first stop.  To say I was excited about my upcoming meal was putting it very mildly!The soft shell crab was a beauty. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/petite-maison-scottsdale?select=mjKPAlDj_Y00AGQKnz_QdQ#mjKPAlDj_Y00AGQKnz_QdQ  In fact, it was such a sight to behold, that a PM regular (Todd from Savannah, GA) sitting to my right also wanted to take a photo of it!  The dish smelled fantastic!  I ate this all up in a couple of minutes-- loved the yuzu aioli, which went well with the carrot-ginger slaw.  The ginger was divine!  The dish was well-balanced and not greasy at all.Gaps between the courses were well-paced and soon, the sea bass arrived.  Matthew placed it down in front of me, hot and still wrapped in the parchment paper casing it was cooked in, and was about to cut and present it, when I asked him to pause for a moment so that I may take a "before" photo. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/petite-maison-scottsdale?select=K28gtY8lGIG2qRQ3PNzY3Q#K28gtY8lGIG2qRQ3PNzY3Q  When he finally broke the seal, the aromas that wafted out were enticing! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/petite-maison-scottsdale?select=hCVa6u5-AQBTrTxUOoZZTQ#hCVa6u5-AQBTrTxUOoZZTQ  However, after the necessary pics were taken and I had a couple of bites, I found the flavor of the fish very mild, and the cous cous, which was what made me want to order the dish, was also a bit bland to my liking.  The fish was cooked perfectly- and the veggies and cous cous were al dente.  The couple of twists of braised lemon I did in hopes to add more flavor didn't change the overall taste profile, but I finished the course anyway, since it was a small serving.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/petite-maison-scottsdale?select=tZt7FlNlSb0PAKpcGy5pJg#tZt7FlNlSb0PAKpcGy5pJgThe lemon curd tartelette wrapped up the prix fixe meal, but not before Matthew brought me a surprise- a short glass of muscat.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/petite-maison-scottsdale?select=SZPQ1zcCm84ITBJVIjCJ9A#SZPQ1zcCm84ITBJVIjCJ9A  Overall, I liked this pastry, even though I had a hard time cutting through the pastry shell each and every time.  The curd was very tangy and sweet, made sweeter by the honey drizzle, but the dollop of goat cheese did well to temper the sweet dish.  The nice glass of pinot blanc and tempura app were by far my faves tonight, and Matt obliging me with samples of wine before I ordered was appreciated, and I would've walked away with a 3.5 star experience until Matthew bade me goodbye saying "See you again next year on your once-a-year trip to Petite Maison."  He and Todd laughed, and I laughed along (I was buzzed), but what a very rude thing  to say!  By implying that I, or anyone for that matter, came to dine here only during RW to save money, Matt effectively wiped away everything that was satisfactory and made me wish I never went in the first place!It takes only ONE person to ruin a guest's otherwise terrific experience, Chef Porter.  I hope you address this!RW menu, wine, and tax $53.39 + $10 tip= $63.39What else can be said about the wonderful little restaurant that hasn't been said already?We were able to make reservations on Open Table for 7:30 on a Saturday night. We arrived on time, and the restaurant was full. The host was very apologetic and asked us if we minded waiting at the bar for a few minutes until the table was ready. We didn't mind at all. The bartender was engaging and make a mean French cocktail. Once the table freed up, they brought us over and gave us two complimentary glasses of champagne - classy touch.For apps we got the escargot and steak tartar. Little disappointed the escargot had already been removed from their shells, but they tasted amazing none the less. The tartar was served with a perfectly cooked duck's egg.For entrées OH ordered the scallop special and boy were they big and tasty! Unusually for me I did not order the steak frites, having been persuaded by the waiter that the lamb chops were to die for. He was not wrong, they were quite possibly the biggest lamb chops I have ever seen, obviously from some mutant, but super tasty, sheep.Dessert had to be the soufflé - top tip: order when you get your entrées as this baked delight takes a little while. But again, our waiter was on top of it for us.The patio looked very romantic, but obviously too hot in July. I'll be sure to come back when the weather cools off and ask to sit outside.

Restaurant name  Pho Old Saigon Vietnamese Cuisine
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
This place is a dive, a dump, in a shady strip mall off an industrial part of West Grand Avenue, on the west side of the Valley of the Sun. But it has excellent Pho!It is only fitting that my 900th review on Yelp! is a review of a Vietnamese Pho Restaurant. This is the 77th DIFFERENT Pho restaurant I have eaten Pho noodles in over the past 2.5 years on Yelp. That's about 31 new Pho restaurants a year I have been averaging. More than one new Pho Restaurant  every other week! Troi Oi!Also, over 20%, or 1 out of every 5 of my reviews are for places that have never been reviewed on Yelp before. FTRs as seasoned Yelpers would call it. So suffice it to say, I don't mind venturing out and trying new places. And once in awhile, I find a little gem. Pho Old Saigon, like I said, is a classic Viet dive. Grungy strip mall, simple tables and chairs, no fancy decor, and gruff service. But when I ordered my current favorite beef noodle combination, Pho Tai Nam (rare and brisket of beef), a large bowl for only $5.95 (small is only $5.50), I was pleasantly surprised!The bowl was placed in front of me, and I could smell the deep, rich aroma of Star Anise in the broth! This is the essential smell (and flavor) of Pho! And the broth wasn't too muddy, so I knew that the broth was cooked with the flavor coaxed out of the beef bones and ox tails to create the rich aroma with plenty of Star Anise adde. It was heavenly to inhale!The beef was decent cuts of meat, and the Nam was tasty. They gave me a full plate of condiments, and something I rarely see outside of only a few places in the Little Saigons in Westminster and San Jose:Ngo Gai!Ngo Gai is the long, green, saw-toothed basil like veggie to add with the 2 stems of basil leaves they gave me to veggie up my noodle soup. Plenty of bean sprouts, green chilis slices, and a large wedge of lime were available, too!Perfect!I took a small condiment dish, filled it half with Sriracha and half with Hoi Sin sauce, and was ready to go!I tasted the broth first, all by itself, nothing floating in the soup, no added condiments yet, no sauces. Just beef broth! This is how I taste the the quality of the broth before I eat. Mmmmm. It was the best broth I have tasted in a Pho soup in many months! It equaled in flavor to the best places out of the 77 places I have eaten Pho. I sat down and watched the SBTN (Saigon Broadcast Television Network) that was playing on the TV, and started slurping! Dipped my meat into my half/half sauce, ate it, then chased it with a good slurp of noodles and broth. It was good stuff! That bowl of Pho filled my tummy from lunch time to well into the late evening, too!I had a Vietnamese Coffee with condensed milk to go with it. The place was nearly empty, only a gathering group of Vietnamese local men converging into the early afternoon to talk and eat. This is the best Pho broth I have tasted in the Valley, and in many other areas up and down the coast. The place isn't for everyone. It is hard to understand the staff, the place is dumpy, and it isn't in the greatest neighborhood. But if you don't mind a good Dive Diner atmosphere with excellent Pho broth and bargain prices, come here, breath in the broth, sip it, then start slurping!

Restaurant name  Zizis Vegan Take-Out
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Zizi's! Tucked away in the Gold Hill plaza just north of Ikea on Tryon. Storefront. Tiny. Lots of green paint. Super sweet (and talented) owner/chef Mer. Pro-veg and health paraphanalia lined walls and bulletin boards. Formerly a Mexican joint. Just behind them, one of those weird strip mall churches. A soul food place next door.But most importantly: The huge menu full of vegan-i-fied diner food, plus the ubiquitous smoothies, salads. I want to yell from the rooftops. Not only delicious, were my soy buffalo wings (the best I've ever had, if we're keeping score)... not only low sodium, my fried "fish" sammich... but relatively healthy. Not raw food healthy (lets face it - soy meat ain't the most natural substance around) but A-OK. Of course, we had to order fries to go with all of that - and even THEY were unique, slightly curried and spiced.This place is vegan start to finish but Mer pulls it off with panache - everything was super tasty and distinctly, carefully flavored. I haven't had a meal like this since leaving NYC and to be honest, some things (wings, chili) blew Kate's or even Curly's away. Take out only (but they deliver up to 18 miles out) and limited hours (12-8 daily, 'cept Sun and Mon) be damned, Zizi's is now on permanent rotation.Lawd! I've died and gone to vegan heaven. It's a shame that there aren't more vegan friendly places around Charlotte but that's what makes places like Zizis stand out. I'm still exploring their menu but so far some of my favorites are there "fish" and chips, "meat loaf" and "chickn parm". Man o man! The flavor of this food is amazing and I'd be cheating you if I didn't tell you to order the fries with the "special" seasoning. Normal fries just won't do! Biggest tip of all is to CALL YOUR ORDER IN. It'll save you some precious wait time because it takes longer than a minute to make amazing vegan food! Thumbs Up!Sincerely,One Happy Vegan!

Restaurant name  Pizza Bellino
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
I am slightly confused by the reviews for Pizza Bellino, as they range from thrilled to enraged.  Pizza Bellino is one of the closer pizza places to my apartment, but I just made it here recently.  I stopped in because I was starving, and they sell single slices for $2.  I got a great slice of cheese pizza!  One slice was enough for a small meal, and the sauce is very nicely spiced.  The cheese quality is good too.The service is pretty fast when you eat in, unlike Aiello's and Mineo's.  I have always had good customer service here as well.  There are crazy good lunch specials, and they always have deals in the Squirrel Hill Pennysaver.As one of the only places that delivers in Squirrel Hill, I can imagine it can be pretty slow and tense.  I would stick to eat-in.Good for a quick slice of pizza!

Review Text :
Our Garmin lead us through a very sketchy neighborhood to get here.  We were just about to turn back when we noticed the area got a bit more hipster.  Figuring that I could beat the plaid & mustache out of anyone who tried to do anything ironic to my car, we decided to go in.So glad we did!  This was the best Thai food I've ever had.  The seafood was tender, the peanut chicken curry was well balanced and the summer rolls were tender and delicious.A word of caution.  Order a little less spicy than you think you should.  They are judging heat by Thai standards, not by my pallid tongue.THERE'S A VERY GOOD REASON OTHER REVIEWS FOR THIS PLACE START IN ALL CAPS!It's because this place is de-freaking-licious!If you read my other reviews on Thai places, you'll see I always get the Pad Thai as my point of comparison.  This place served me the best Pad Thai I've ever had!  My wife was pissed at me because I was too busy stuffing my face to talk to her.  The dish struck the perfect balance of deliciousness with the sweet Pad Thai sauce, scrumptious chicken, peanuts, and green onions.  The sauce was incredible.  Pad Thai I've had elsewhere is usually too bland or overpoweringly sweet and fake.  Instead, Smiling Banana Leaf has cemented itself in my mind as the gold standard for Pad Thai.In the midst of stuffing my face with noodles, I managed to set aside some time to breathe and take in the atmosphere.  I'm glad I called ahead for a reservation because there were only a dozen or so tables in the restaurant--and it was packed.  The lighting was low and the setting was intimate.  I would definitely recommend this place for a date night--if you can control how fast you eat...  Remember to get a bottle of wine beforehand (unlike me).  It's BYOB.This place is delicious!Definitely make a reservation. I was skeptical when the hostess recommended making a reservation for a Tuesday night, but I'm so glad we did. The restaurant was packed! Granted, the place is small, but business was definitely booming. My husband and I ordered the chicken satay as an appetizer and the red curry and pad thai as our entrees. All of it was amazing. Loved the sauce that came with the chicken satay. I ordered my curry mild (level 3 on the spiciness scale) and it was perfect. I've noticed other people have mentioned the dishes weren't spicy enough - I guess I'm just a woos! My husband's pad thai was also tasty, probably some of the best pad thai I've had! Our server was attentive and friendly. They were the only server for the entire restaurant, but I never felt like we got lost in the crowd. My only complaint was not at the restaurant itself, but at my husband, haha! He forgot that it was BYOB and so we were left sipping on water. I don't think we'll forget a bottle of wine next time though! This place also does take out, which I'm sure we'll take advantage of one of these days.This place is so so highly rated and talked about I was surprised at how small it actually is!  I can't imagine what the wait would be for a dinner, let alone a weekday lunch, where every table was full still.  But it's super cute and intimate with the benches lined in cozy pillows.  My Pad Thai was good, but oh so small.  I think I received the lunch portion.  I didn't specify, so it was my bad.  But I gobbled my dish up in about 5.5 seconds and I wanted more because it was so good!  The shrimp was plump and the sauce was sweet, just how I like it.  Maybe it's my big American appetite, but I definitely left hungry.  Just a little taste of magic!Very good Pad Thai, yes.  But here's the thing... This place is SO highly rated I feel like I need to go back and be adventurous!  Next time, adventure's on!I can get down with the Smiling Banana Leaf. The dining room is cozy,  gorgeous and ornate from the jade green glass table tops to the celestial mural painted on the ceiling. Each table had it's own glass vase filled with vibrant yellow tulips too.This was a truly relishable dining experience. My waiter had the face of a Calvin Klein model and I detected a Western European accent, was it Austrian, or German? I dunno but he had it going on! Any who I had the shrimp tempura , pork dumplings and pineapple curry with shrimp.  The shrimp tempura was cooked too hard and was dark not light. That is the one and only complaint I have for SBL. The shrimp tempura was served with a peanut dipping sauce that was both sweet and tangy and full of peanuts.  The was a very nice touch.  Thai food has me spellbound.  I cannot seem to get enough , I blissfully devoured every spoonful of my pineapple curry with shrimp. SBL is BYOB so I brought along a four pack of wine coolers.  Day drinking at it's finest.  Is BYOB just a dinner thing,  I am still new to the BYOB game.

A locals' place specializing in Fish & Chips is always a welcome addition to the neighborhood!A quick look at the menu and with some help from the older gentleman working the counter and fryer - we put our orders in and took a seat.* 2 Cod Fillets ($8.89)* 2 Haddock Fillets ($8.89)Both orders came with fries, coleslaw, tartar sauce, and hush puppies.  I personally like the cod fillets over the haddock, while the Husband enjoyed the haddock over the cod.  The fish had a nice batter to it and we ate it all up.It's a simple restaurant with no frills that serves up some decent fish and chips on red and white checked paper in baskets.Other things on their menu worth checking out include fried catfish, popcorn shrimp, fried shrimp, calamari, soft shell crab, steamers, fried clams, fried oysters, and chicken fingers.Came back to redeem our second Groupon. Love this place. Chatted with Lazy Joe for quite some time. He told us to keep an eye out for another Groupon available in the near future. YAY! Although I'll come back without one any time. They're that good and cheap.The food was just as great as the last time. My fella got the AYCE shrimp, which is a steal at $11.99. I ordered the softshell crab sandwich which was also delightful. I haven't had one thing I don't like here yet! Which is rare for me, since I'm not usually a big fan of deep fried food. Everything's cooked to order, so you might have a bit of a wait, but it's worth it.Friendly owners and staff, great food and convenient location and hours. What's not to love about this place.Glowing recommendation from me! I'll be back - soon.Gluten free fried goodness! This is what I think every time I eat here. They have gluten free fried fish & chips and also onion rings. Their prices are super reasonable too! Located on rainbow & 215 area it's a great location. Also the employees are super nice. I suggest everyone to try this hidden gem!Dear Lazy Joe and family and friends and employees of Lazy Joe's Fish and Chips and all reading this review, I am glad Lazy Joe's Fish and Chips is open 6 days a week (everyday except Sunday). I have tasted the cod, the haddock, and the catfish which I liked very much for its simplicity and texture and I like the counter-order, neighborhood come-as-you-are atmosphere. I really liked the seasoned fries, Cole Slaw and tartar sauce. I especially like the price (all you can eat on Friday and Saturday all day). I really, really like that your staff seems to be treated like family, and your customers are too.To those people who don't like your batter, who don't like that you are closed on Sunday, who have no appreciation for the hard work you and your staff put into every meal... To those people, Lazy Joe, I say "forget about it" and I say you should "forget about them"!Lazy Joe, your restaurant is an anchor of the neighborhood. Your staff deserve respect. Your food is legit. And that's why this review is 5-stars. Because, Lazy Joe, you deserve 5-star reviews for the hard work and decency you and your staff put into each and every single meal.And the rest of 'em can K1CK R0CKS!

Las Lupitas follows the 3 "B"s that we always look for in Spanish: Bueno, Bonito, y Barato. Translation: "Good, Pretty (In this case appealing to the eye), and cheap!"These are some of the best tacos you'll have in Charlotte, but all food is to go. Order 1 lb. of meat, either the Carnitas or Barbacoa, 1 lb. of Fresh Cheese, and 1 lb. of tortillas. The tortillas are practically free, $1/lb, and you can see the ladies making them from scratch in the back. When I went they had 3 sauces for sale at the register and I bought the 2 spiciest ones, the spiciest one was way to spicy for my taste and I love spice. This is a great spot to hit up before a picnic or before having people over for "make your own taco" night. Best deal in town!I am not sure if they speak English or not, but since everything is out for you to see it would be very easy to order by pointing, please do not be intimidated, everyone who works there is SUPER nice. If you need a translator, I translate for tacos!Once you enter, head to the deli line or straight ahead to the lady with baskets on the counter. Someone will take your tortilla and/or meat order. Once you have your order head back to the front of store to pay at register. Add on salsa, avocado, or bag of cilantro/onion at the register. Those condiments need to be paid with cash. Everything else can be paid with credit/debit.The tortillas are absolutely amazing fresh and the real deal. Love their salsa verde too! Their carnitas are are okay...a bit greasy. The cheapest dinner you'll get for sure. Regardless, you can't beat homemade fresh tortillas. A must stop when in Charlotte.

Just happened to be working in the area and clicked on my Yelp nearby button. It was a Friday and what more could you ask for other than some tasty Fish.This is one of those restaurants that you would not typically go to unless you are in the vicinity or knew about it before coming here. The building is pretty old and they are located in an older part of PHX.They have an interesting menu with all sorts of fried critters as well as burgers, pastrami sandwiches and even the famous Philly cheese steak. Nice!Ordered the 3 pc Catfish / 4 pc Shrimp dinner and a side of Jalapeno Poppers. The poppers were stuffed with cream cheese and came with a side of ranch. The fish dish came with french fries and a side of tartar and cocktail sauce.Really enjoyed everything that showed up on my plate. The meals were simply prepared with a very casual eating area to enjoy yourself. Both the catfish and shrimp were tasty and I'm looking forward to coming back again in the future.This is not one of those high end eating establishments and you can even hit their drive thru when you're in a hurry. Just kick back and enjoy a cool mom and pop restaurant where you can actually see the family hard at work.See ya there next time when I'm in the area. Who doesn't like a big basket of fish and chips when you are hungry and just can't resist the craving. FISH FRY TIME!4.25 STARS

Review Text :
I've had way too much Chili's in my life. I keep coming back though, because my husband really likes Chili's. *sigh* The Chili's located off the Decatur and 215 is our most frequented Chili's seeing that it's closest to home. I'm a fan of the improvements Chili's has been making - they've really been stepping up their game. The restaurant here has been remodeled and looks more trendy, the presentation of the food has also been upgraded, a rewards system has been introduced, and a tablet at each table allows diners to order drinks and desserts and even pay their check. Chili's used to email coupons out like crazy but has ceased the coupon disbursement ever since the rewards system was launched. :( I pretty much get the same thing every time I come to Chili's. You guessed it, it's the black bean vegetarian burger! I get the Guacamole burger and customize the hell out of it, i. e., annoy the shit of our waitress. The fries are always awesome at Chili's. Dessert is meh.Service is mostly good here and we always eat in the bar area at a booth.PRO TIP: Come on Sundays for all day Happy Hour and eat in the bar to get FREE chips and salsa! Worth a Return Visit?It's inevitable. My guy loves Chili's.YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #142

Review Text :
11/25/11Decided to grab a quick bite to eat while the rest of the family went shopping, so I popped over to the food court to see what I could find.  Among the national food chains, such as Chick Fil-A, The Great Steak & Potato Co., Sbarro, Orange Julius, and Subway, I spotted Showmars and recalled reading a few good reviews on it, so I made a beeline and checked out the menu, which proved to be quite extensive: gyros, souvlakis, burgers, pita burgers, seafood platters, including fried flounder, hot dogs, and even baklava by the silce ($1.99, fyi)!  Service seemed very friendly and eager to help.  After a few minutes and a few questions, I decided to go w/ an Old-fashion Jr. pita burger (chili, cheese, coleslaw, onions, and mustard), hold the mustard, and a side of fries, for a grand total of $6.  (FYI, Jr. burgers feature one patty, regular has two.)  Combo plates were available, but I didn't want anything from the soda fountain.  Paid for the meal and was given a receipt and a buzzer.  Thought I'd check out the buffet spread at Maki of Japan (right across from Showmars) in the meantime, but I hadn't even crossed the path of chairs and tables to get to the other side of the room when my buzzer started to vibrate-- that was fast!  My platter looked very nice, but I lamented that my pita burger lacked surface veggies, not even lettuce (!), and the manager told me that only the original burgers had lettuce and tomato.  However, he offered to add lettuce for me- very nice!  I enjoyed the chili-burger-coleslaw combo; however, I did find the whole sandwich a bit sweeter than I'd prefer-- most likely from the sugar in the coleslaw.  Also, I would've eaten more of the pita had it been crisped/toasted.  No matter, as eating less of the pita allowed me to enjoy more of the crinkle-cut fries- the best part of the entire meal!  Those who like saltier fries may want to grab a salt packet or two, as my fries were a bit under-salted, even for my taste.Was happy to find something local in this mall's food court, and I wouldn't mind coming back to try other items on the menu!

Ok so we were at Dino's bar and were a bit hungry deciding what we were going to do to fill our tummy's as we had not had dinner. We were drinking and needed something on our stomach as to prevent the psycho drunk after effect as well.Albo's pizza is located behind Dino's bar and has a nice indoor seating option if you choose to dine in.We opted to place an order for take out in which they actually walked it over and delivered to us at Dino's so we did not have to wait :) Yay!We ordered a large Albo Special:pepperoni, sausage, ground beef, ham, onions, mushrooms, black olives, green peppers Pizza was good, and plenty cheesy which is a bonus as they are a pizza shop that does not skimp on the cheese! That is something that drives me nuts when you have to add cheese as an extra topping just to get a decent amount, not here!Pizza is good and the friendly personal service is even better :)My next trip to Dino's we may just have to order another pizza from Albo's :)They also had several pasta dishes that looked yummy as well! They have a wide and varied menu to choose from and not limited to pizza.

Review Text :
Short version: Cheap, delicious, friendly, unique. Get the crab curry soup.Longer version: Oh sweet, loving, though possibly non-existent God; this place is unfortunately hidden yet wonderfully comforting. I wish I could try everything. My only option, obviously, is to go back in order to try everything.I went with a few friends on  Tuesday night after having to go to the Verizon store at the Waterfront and not really wanting to eat at Red Robin (nothing wrong with Red Robin, though). They had 25 cent pierogies on special--obviously, we had 25 of them. They were perfectly browned, crisp on the edges, and after a little searching we managed to find the pile of onions that they were cooked with. The spinach artichoke dip was equally delicious, leading me to have faith in the other appetizers as well.For our main course, we all ended up splitting crab curry soup, fried zucchini, and the surf'n'turf (half of a crabcake sandwich and half of a house-smoked brisket sandwich). They had a sweet collection of craft beers on tap and the dude who served us was probably the nicest person I've ever met within the food industry. The crab curry soup was simple and exactly the dish I'd go back for.I can't wait to go back and explore the rest of what Blue Dust has to offer.You know the little dive bar, right by the tracks on your way to the Waterfront?  The place you have driven by 20K times and never thought to actually stop in cause it's a dive bar?  Hold on to your seats, folks, cause this isn't a dive bar. It's actually a freaking fantastic watering hole and surprisingly healthy and inventive pub.  One of my friends stopped by here and wrote something on facebook about it that made me think it was worth my while and it was way better than even expected. The hubby and I decided to split everything after ordering some beers - cranberry ale for me (not nearly cranberry-ish enough) and a Bell's Christmas White for him (excellent choice).  Their menu is a mix of reasonably healthy and nice and awesomely naughty - perfect for the holidays.  We started with the fried zucchini which we use as a bit of a guide as we eat our way around Pittsburgh.  Almost everyone has it, almost everyone does it horribly, horribly wrong.  Blue Dust was a fabulous exception.  The zucchini appeared to have been picked that day, it was sliced super thin and breaded and deep-fried to perfection.  It was served on a bed of lettuce which did pretty-up the plate, but also served to soak up the grease.  We then asked to split the lamb chili.  I assumed we would be given two spoons and a "go for it" kind of attitude, but they actually split the order in two and gave us two orders of the delicious garlic bread that accompanied it.  It was amazing!  Seriously amazing.  It was just lamb-y enough that you knew that you were eating lamb, but not so lamb-y that you were wondering if you were on the farm.  It was slightly spicy and really just a perfect winter meal.  We also split the sliders - crab, smoked turkey and brisket.  They were all amazing.  Very different and very tasty.  They came with local-made chips and a fantastic smoked tomato salsa that I really could have had a massive jar of to take home. Unfortunately, between the 2 and 3 course, I discovered the liquor menu.  Infused root beer bourbon?  Infused chai vodka?  A mixed drink with Crabbie's ginger beer?  Why didn't I look at you earlier???We will be back.  Many, many, many times.  A must stop on your way to the Waterfront.I stopped by last night before seeing a movie at the Waterfront, due to the convenience of the location and having a City Dining Card for this place.  Given the high ratings, I was expecting a solid meal here. Unfortunately, however, this place failed to deliver on several counts.Our visit got off to a shaky start when CM and I walked in and seated ourselves, per the instructions of the sign at the host stand. We sat at a table close to the front, and after perusing the menu for several minutes, nobody came to greet us.  We eventually approached to the bar to order, and the bartender apologized and said he hadn't seen us come in, and someone finally came to provide us with another menu and table service. When our waiter came to take our order, we ordered the red bean dip to share, my dining partner ordered the brisket tacos, and I ordered the lobster roll, which came to $34. Thankfully, the food came out pretty quickly after ordering.  In my opinion, the bean dip, which was thick and savory, and came with tortilla chips, was the best thing we ordered.  Although I didn't try CM's tacos since I don't eat beef, he mentioned they had so much meat that they were difficult to eat.  Despite this, he enjoyed them, however.As for the lobster roll, one bite revealed that the toast was burnt.  Despite habitually taking photos, I'm not in the habit of inspecting my food closely before eating it, since I've never been served something burnt before, and the lighting wasn't the best.  Because the toast on the other half of the sandwich wasn't burnt as badly, I was famished, and service wasn't the most attentive, I ate it.  The lobster seemed a bit tough, and the ingredients weren't super-flavorful, but it was okay.  Both entrees came with tortilla chips, as well as a oniony salsa that I wasn't a fan of.  After about 10 min., our server returned to check on us, and I pointed out the burnt bread, and he offered to rectify it by either making anther sandwich or bringing fresh bread.  Because I was halfway through the sandwich, I chose the latter.  While he should never have served me a sandwich with burnt bread, I do give him credit for fixing the situation.During the time that we were there, a weekly stand up comedy show that occurs during this time (8-10pm) was going on.  Although I had noticed that this would be the case, I forgot to mention it to CM.  Neither of us are huge stand up comedy fans, but one of the comedians was funny--the others were varying degrees of awkward.  The show is free, though.  It's possible that the presence of the show may have detracted from our service, but I can't say for sure.Overall, I was disappointed in my experience at Blue Dust, although I do give them credit for correcting the burnt toast issue.  Perhaps the food tastes better once you've had a few beers, but for my part, I wasn't super-impressed. I'd be willing to give this place a second chance, but it'll probably be awhile before I do so.

Restaurant name  Pho Thanh
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
I've been a Da Vang devotee for years and wanted to try a new Vietnamese place tonight and Pho Thanh didn't fall short. In fact, I think I might like this place a little better than Da Vang, but I'll rotate between the two since they're both so good.First off, the portions are gigantic! The Bun bowl could easily serve two and I had tons of leftovers for lunch tomorrow. They use the fat rice noodles instead of the vermicelli, but I think it made the dish a little heartier and certainly easier to eat with chopsticks.Hubby had the Pho and the broth was amazing! Savory, a little salty, and the spices were perfect. Perfect to warm your bones on a rainy day.The restaurant was more of a cafe style than family sit down, but exceptionally clean and the service was great. There was quite a diverse crowd in there for a Sunday night and everyone's dishes looked fantastic.Is it?  Can it be?  A Vietnamese spot I like better than Da Vang?Yes...Since my Vietnamese food loving friend introduced me to Pho Thanh a few weeks ago (thank you!!), I have already enjoyed multiple visits.  It is that good.  They are open early, too (8:30am!) so it is a good choice for a post-hike late breakfast/early lunch.A typical visit starts off with the #1 spring rolls.  They are huge - rice paper stuffed with shrimp, pork, lettuce, mint and sprouts and (yay!) served with peanut sauce.  Sometimes a Bahn Mi (sandwich) gets thrown into the mix - fresh soft bread and ample portions of warm pork.  On to the Main Event... Pho.  Their take-out menu states on the front "The Best Beef Noodle Soup In Town" - believe it.  They are not kidding.  I am a creature of habit, and always have the #113 - beef noodle soup with filet mignon tenderloin beef.  I like to have the raw beef served on the side, so I can "cook" it myself in the hot broth.  I am tempted to ask for extra beef the next time I am there.I don't know how long I can last until I need to go back.PhoIt's pronounced "/feu/"...does that help anybody?Okay...sounds like "fun" only without the "n", and "Thành" sounds like "tang", minus the "g".If you run "Pho Thành" through a translator, it translates as either "Cheese Bar" or "The Streets"...or, as they say in Ho Chi Minh City (nee Saigon)..."Cheese Bar".I couldn't say what a cheese bar has to do with this delightful little place...I didn't see any cheese on the menu, nor is there anything cheesy about the place...just straight ahead, well made, tasty (and although Dr. Andrew Weill shudders when he hears me say it)...healthy Vietnamese food!And while I'm on the subject of Dr. Weill...since when did a sweaty 350 pound recluse (with the remains of the entire turkey dinner with all the "trimmin's" that he evidently had for breakfast floating around in his beard), become the "healthy living" guru for a generation?I'm puzzled...not that I don't want his lifestyle...I do!Still, it's a mystery!There's no mystery at Pho Thành...just unpronounceable menu selections and great Pho!I've learned over the years to make my selections either by pointing at the menu and smiling or by saying things like "I'll have a number 2 and number 38, with a diet Coke, please".Back when I was very young and still had my swagger on, I would stroll into one of the great Vietnamese joints in Portland, sit down and say "Pho Me"!So funny!...At least to me.That phrase led to several misunderstandings, "incidents"  and police reports, as well as a lengthy stint of child support payments for little Nguyen Dat S. (although he really looks nothing like me...but I do get a Christmas card from him and his family every year...nice!).But that's the dimly remembered past!Yesterday, I met a couple of my buddies in the Mekong Delta (you know, the West Side vortex of great Pho...the triangle between Maxim, Da Vang and Pho Thành) and we had a great time at lunch!My buddies are both attorneys, suckling at the supple twin teats of misery and money and the stories they tell at lunch would make most people writhe in despair...but not us...we are made of sterner stuff!We split an order of Goi Cuon and Cha Gio and dug into our respective bowls of Pho...delicious, delicious Pho ...no question!All of the standard high quality Pho prep tools are there to perfect your soup...sawtooth herb, basil, bean sprouts, and enough hot chili in several different forms to cause you severe pain the next morning...it lets you know you're alive...important at my age!This particular Mekong Delta doesn't require a Ghe Nang or a Swift Boat to navigate, just hop on the light rail or risk your life in Camelback traffic and drop on by.Just don't say "Pho Me"...I had some really, really good Vietnamese food in this nondescript restaurant in the mini shopping strip at the northwest corner of Camelback and 17th Av. I came here with my friend and fellow yelper John M. around 3 PM on a Saturday to avoid the lunch rush, and it turned out to be a good idea. With fewer people in the restaurant at that time, service was relatively fast. The food was great ... and for the quantity and quality you get, it was unbelievably cheap! This is probably one of the best food bargains in the city. Why won't I give it 5 stars? Well, I wish they would be more conscientious about cleaning the floor. It wasn't really filthy, just littered with some napkins and drinking straws from the lunch rush when we were there. But I'll definitely be back again and again, because the food is so darn good and so inexpensive!Tonight was my second visit to Pho Thanh and again, I left with a very full belly (and not just because I'm pregnant!).  This place offers consistent, affordable Vietnamese food in large portions.Highlights for me include the fresh young coconut, the shrimp spring rolls, and the stir fry noodle dishes.  Although, everyone who I've seen go with the pho seems pretty happy as well.  The atmosphere is nothing special, but the company you go with will hopefully make up for that!  I went with my brother the first time and for the International Supper Club kick-off tonight, so needless to say, I was entertained during both visits.  Service is attentive although I did have to ask for my water to be refilled a couple of times.  They were great with our large group and were fine doing separate bills as well.  Oh, and they can do vegetarian entrees and pho upon request.Bottom line: Pho Thanh is a pho-nomenal choice for affordable Vietnamese in Pho-enix!For a year, I passed by Pho Thanh every day on my way to work. For a year, I never thought once to step inside. For a year, I had no idea how much I was missing out! This visit was a visit of firsts. My first time at this restaurant and my first time eating Vietnamese food. Both were spectacular! This restaurant isn't much to look at on the outside, but it's got everything it needs on the inside including friendly staff, cheap prices and delicious dishes. I will admit that the menu is completely overwhelming for a newbie like me. I had no idea what I wanted, but luckily I was dining with pros so they guided me in the right direction. I started with the spring rolls and opted for a pork bun. The spring rolls were really refreshing and I enjoyed the peanut sauce to accompany it. I wasn't a huge fan of the basil and/or cilantro that came inside, so next time I would ask for them to leave the herbs out. The bun was delicious and huge! I snuck some of my remaining peanut sauce in there and poured in the sauce that came with it. I had no idea that it was fish sauce but I'm glad I didn't because I gave it a chance and really liked it! The bun had pork, noodles and eggs rolls. I only ate about half of it and was completely stuffed but not in a bad way. It was the perfect amount of food with the right spices and heartiness. As I enjoyed my meal and company, I looked around and noticed how crowded this place gets with every walk of life!Guess how much my bill was for spring rolls, bun and a diet coke? Around $8-$10. I'm serious! For the price alone, I will return, but for the food and friendly service, I will return sooner.I am little late to review this, but better now than never.   I had a fun time attending the first Yelp AZ International Supper Club at Pho Thanh.   It was a perfect pick by Gabi as I was really craving for Vietnamese food that night.  I had ordered the Bun Bi Cha Gio (vermicelli with eggrolls, seasoned shredded pork, vegetables, crushed peanuts and fish sauce).  This is the best noodle dish especially when outside is so hot!   It will definitely cool you off.   I also had the whole young coconut.  The coconut juice and the meat were so fresh.  You might need to have some serious elbow grease to remove the meat inside the coconut.  I would warn the people sitting around in case you hit them.  Sorry to be so critical but I was so excited to have a "Vietnamese" restaurant in the 'hood.First off, I would like to humbly say, I eat Pho monthly, if not weekly.  Whether that be homemade or at a sit down, I slurp it frequently.Ironically, as the business name might suggest, I actually do not come here for the Pho.  My food instinct tells me the root problem lies in the broth.  Not enough beefy, meaty flavors.  You can throw as much cooked meat into a bowl of Pho but that doesn't make the broth better, in addition to the excess oily content.  There's definitely room to improve!Aside that, there are plenty of other dishes here that are very satisfying and evidently keeps me coming back. ** BBQ Pork Banh Mi (Bun Me): If you ever had a Chinese Char Siu Bun, it's basically the same thing but in a baguette with fresh vegetables.  The bun is slightly toasted and served warm.  Definitely, a winner in my book.  ($2.50) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gQMAcDm8kv8ev7x2BshMwg?select=ruAAr86Q1SOeE8ovHHUhRA** Beef Stew with Banh Mi: The stew broth is fantastic! Lots of flavor from the beef!  Just exactly how I would like it! Take a piece of bread, dip, soak in the broth, and eat away! Yum! (Under $6)** Bun Bo Hue: Besides Pho, this is typically one of the other go-to soup bowls.  Don't let the redness in the soup or the pork blood scare you, its the reason why its good! Ha, ha! The best part is eating the bone-in pig skin and meat. (Under $6)http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gQMAcDm8kv8ev7x2BshMwg?select=aHJ6RhEArYbl4194Z6c-Sg** Luc Lac w/ a side of White Rice: French inspired pan seared steak and salad.  The awesome flavors that is fused with the caramelized onions paired with fresh, crisped salad drenched in special, citrus vinaigrette.  Caveat: a tad oily, but it's fine!  When you hear it SIZZLING on a hot, stoned plate is when you know it's good! ($9)http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gQMAcDm8kv8ev7x2BshMwg?select=dxw6_gLECBo-fOFNvQImng** Ca Ri Ga (Chicken Curry and Potato): If you like curry, you will most definitely enjoy this.  It's basically a soup bowl of brothy chicken with yellow curry and potato.  Similar to the Beef Stew, you can order it with a Banh Mi (baguette), OR have it with Vermicelli noodles or White Rice.  I would go with a warm, toasted baguette, so you can dip, soak the curry and eat it in small parts. (Under $6)http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gQMAcDm8kv8ev7x2BshMwg?select=ok5oYmXE3cIQ3vfJl8gRXQThese are just some of my favorites that I get here, but you can certainly order much more on their extensive menu.  I stick with what I know and like, typically.The most important element of this place is the pricing! For lunch, its hard to beat!  The service is okay, they always start you off with a cold, ice water with lemon and then take your order after a few minutes of being seated.  Lastly, if you crave desserts, they are refrigerated and visible as you come up to pay for your meal. If you are lucky enough to work around or twelve minutes away (like I do), I highly recommend getting your Viet fix here.My pants get tight when I think about Pho Thanh.There is little else that I can say that would more accurately convey my love for this restaurant.We ate here on Friday night.  The food was good, but our server and the location sucks ass.As soon as we pulled into the parking lot (we got the last parking spot in the whole lot) we were accosted by some cracked out, black dude looking for a couple of bucks.  We told him we had ONE dollar and he looked annoyed that we didn't have more.  I scrounged around in my purse for the dollar as he peppered my husband (who was halfway in the car unbuckling the baby from her carseat) with questions about if we also had some change we could give him too, my husband repeatedly said NO we had ONE dollar.  After I slipped the dollar to my husband he offered it to Mr. Crack Head who promptly snatched it up and started across the parking lot to hit up the other people pulling in, and my husband was so pissed that he didn't even have the decency to say "thanks" that he started yelling after him about learning some manners.  Ugh!!   Anyway, we get inside and I have half a mind to complain to the restaurant management that they have someone outside harassing all their patrons, but the cold stare from the less than friendly server we had, a young Vietnamese dude with a neck tattoo, dissuaded me from attempting anything more than giving him my order number.  I can understand that a young man in his mid-twenties (?) probably doesn't want to be working tables in (presumably) his family's restaurant at 7:30 on a Friday night, and I can even imagine that maybe, just maybe, his English isn't that good (but I kinda doubt it, he was probably born and raised in the US, unlike the older man at the register), but I simply can't understand why he couldn't fake a smile for us and make us feel slightly less like annoyances, and more like valued guests here to spend their hard cash and enjoy dinner??     Okay rant over, sorry.So we both ordered the beef Pho with brisket and the food arrived within a blazingly fast 5 minutes.  The soup was hot, hearty and delicious!  No complaints there.  At the same time we ordered the food we each also ordered the sweet young, whole coconut for drinks and, unfortunately, it took another 10 minutes for the coconuts to arrive.  But when they did arrive they were delicious.We were never checked on after we had our food and our drinks were dropped off at our table, but I guess that's okay since we didn't need anything else and we were able to make due without our server's cold stare and indifferent attitude.  Anyway, the food is fast, cheap and delicious.  The bill was only $16 for Pho and coconut drinks for 2 adults.  You can't beat that price with a stick. Minus a star for the awful location.  Minus a star for the crappy server.  Aside from that the food is worth braving the location and service.I think that if the management could tell 'Neck Tattoo' to smile and pretend to be friendly, and to check on the guests at least once, it'd do A LOT to help with the customer service perception.Oh, and maybe also invest in a security guard to chase the panhandling, crack head out of the parking lot too...  ;)I'm definitely a Big Fan of this place and all the yummy items that they serve. The menu here is very large and the prices are very reasonable. The hardest part may be deciding what to order if you are not familiar with Vietnamese food.Been waiting a long time to visit this place. Seen a lot of great and happy reviews. Just happened to be in the area and had to check them out.Both inside and outside are very simple and basic. This could be how they keep the cost down and still deliver great quantity and quality. I was surprised how large the inside eating area was and the large amount of slurping customers enjoying their meals. Nice!Usually get the Pho with everything and in the largest bowl they serve. Here it is the #11 and it is huge. Decided to try out the Spring Rolls as well. This is always a good test to compare against other similar places.Both the Pho and the Spring Rolls were good. Really liked the soup and can't wait to come back and try some of their other tasty choices. Got my eyeballs and taste buds set for some spicy Bun Bo Hue next. Service is friendly and you may need to wave one of them down to get seated. When you are done you simply get up and pay at the register. This is pretty much the normal routine in these type of restaurants.Bring a hearty appetite and get ready to leave feeling full. I was able to get out of here with a crisp $10 bill and was concerned that I might explode. DYN-O-MITE!4.5 STARSLove the new improvements! They've taken over the adjacent store space so the restaurant is now bigger than ever. Service is always fast and the food is excellent and inexpensive, as always. This place is now the standard by which I judge all other Vietnamese restaurants in the Valley.

If i could rate Cabo Wabo a negative score I would. We arrive just in time for Karaoke, which I would give 5 Stars.  But that's where the good ends. We were not actually sat by the hostess just pointed toward the tables. No menus, so I'm assuming the frat boy waiter assumed we didn't want service. When I asked for menus he looked at me like I was nuts. Then 5 seconds after getting the menus he asked us, "so are you gonna order something?" Really?He never asked us if wanted drinks, I went up to the Bar to get mine. For a weak 8 oz margarita it was TWENTY DOLLARS!!!! For a pre-made Slurpee with house alcohol!!   I would never go back there again. They treated us like trash and we did nothing to deserve it. And to top it off I accidentally left an expensive souvenir behind, when I returned they didn't have a lost n found they said "we just throw it away". I tried to express the whole experience to the manager, his response was "oh well". WOW - worst service EVER!After missing out on trying the Bacchanal buffet with my friends (I got in a few hours later than they did), I was determined to try something new so that I would still have something else to write about.  Fortunately/unfortunately, that "something new" ended up being Cabo Wabo...which always seemed like more of a drinking spot than as a place to eat at.  Now I know why!Although Cabo Wabo isn't a mainstream type of chain restaurant, it's still pretty much a chain, and the food really reflected that.  I kept expectations to a minimum for my CARNITAS TACOS, and what I got was pretty mediocre...and overpriced.  Two tacos, Spanish rice, and beans for $15?  I know it's The Strip and all, but damn (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cabo-wabo-cantina-las-vegas?select=vguZqf4mTUutzMe9wgw8Sw#J9PUAWgzOp0UnrzmnXG4bg).  The taste of the carnitas was driven heavily by their generic sauce rather than the savory, seasoned flavors you'd get from something authentic, but at least the tacos were fairly full...so yay?As far as our drinks went, my friends seemed mostly satisfied with what they had.  I ordered the CHUPA CHUPA cocktail, which was kind of fun to drink but not particularly amazing.  Essentially, they flip a mini Corona into a regular margarita at your table, and you have to quickly drink it before it all overflows (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cabo-wabo-cantina-las-vegas?select=vguZqf4mTUutzMe9wgw8Sw#RV-cRSWcsgg5ITs4n6OcAQ).  Creative and unique, but pricey considering it wasn't that heavy on the alcohol. Amazingly though, what hurt more than overpaying for generic and medicore food was my lack of reception stopping me from checking in on Yelp when we first sat down.  As petty and trivial as that sounds, I would have seen the "Free margarita with the purchase of an entrée" deal before I ordered, and I could have saved myself $12 on that Chupa Chupa!  Ugh...A rating on Yelp is just an average, and after 300 plus reviews I think 2&1/2 stars is a little harsh.  After Yelp filters some reviews its up to us to decipher  the reviews that are left.  I've noticed several bad reviews recently for Cabo Wabo's & I must say I am surprised.  We arrived on a Thursday night & knew we would probably have to kill some time drinking while we waited for a seat, tough life I know.  We were pleasantly surprised when we were sat immediately at the outdoor bar over looking the strip with a clear view of the fountains shooting off across the street @ Bellagio.  When the wind blew just right we could feel  the mist from the fountains, which felt so good in the dry Vegas heat.  Cabo Wabo's was crazy packed but the bar back grabbed us some menus & took initiative getting us our first round of drinks (frozen margaritas & red bull vodkas) while we waited for our server to machete her way threw the weeds she was knee deep in.  It was a gorgeous night to catch up with my Pops & his wife who live here in Las Vegas & we could not have had a better time.   I can't stress enough how if you go into a restaurant with a chip on your shoulder anticipating bad service your gonna have a shitty experience.  You live in and or you are visiting a great city to party and have fun.   Raise your glass, have a drink, do a shot.... and chill out!  I thought the the food came out in a reasonable time and had no complaints with my service.   The guacamole & chips were money, the chicken chimichangas were as good as it gets (especially after kicking back several margaritas).   I thought my fish tacos with beans & rice were the bomb & devoured every bite.   I was so happy I got my dad to to eat some Mexican fare that night it could not have gotten any better.  This was one bill I had no problem picking up & we will be back on our next visit to Las Vegas.I know the reviews are mixed but I would roll the dice & check it out!YOU'LL BE SORRY IF YOU DINE HERE.I ended up at this beer joint because I was herded into it by a group of friends, who were starving and just wanted to sit down and eat.THE FOOD: Is commercial at best and expensive. A better dinning experience can be had by buying a Swanson Mexican TV dinner and taking it to your room. To make things worse, the service was slow. The waitress acted bothered when someone from the party made a request.THE BILL: They added an 18% gratuity and some other mystery charge( check your receipt for it)  When my friend confronted the waitress about this other fee, she was told that all places in Vegas charge this fee. Well, we ate at many other restaurants and never saw that added charge anywhere; CROOKS.Lastly, when we paid our bill, in cash, the waitress never brought our change? When my friend asked where our change was she said, "We always keep the change." LOL! AS IF! We made her give us our change back. She reached into her apron pocket, grabbed an uncounted amount of coins and said, "Here." (the rest of that was, "Now go away!")Go to Mon Ami Gabi, if you want superior food and a classy dining experience; it is only down the street, in front of The Paris hotel, and less expensive!Originally my friend and I were craving burgers and fries and didn't feel like walking inside Planet Hollywood to look for Gordon Ramsey burgers. She spotted Cabo Wabo Cantina outside of Planet Hollywood, across from where we were standing in front of the Cosmopolitan. We head over to Cabo Wabo we were immediately seated on the patio facing the strip (choice of indoor or outdoor seating). We enjoyed people watching, some in their costumes collecting tips for a pic. Some were very creative like Olaf whom looked like a Cholaf, a Mickey Mouse regect, 2 minions and a couple Egyptian guys. Our server comes by and takes our order. I ordered the carne asada plate and my friend orders the carnitas burritos. While waiting we're snap chatting away and I check in on YELP --- 1 FREE MARGARITA woot woot!Then 2 old men get seated next to us - and they were the same old men that wanted to take photos with us when we were at Bellagio. LOL it was funny... we should have gotten a tip for pic.Any ways, our food arrives and we killed it!! Not cz we were super  hungry cz it was delicious!!! Yummm... the rice, beans and carne asada (3) were just perfect. I've started to appreciate avocados and my carne asada tacos had a slice on each one... made me super happy!They had a live band playing behind us (more like a solo band). He was really good. He played his guitar maybe it was a Ukele and he was singing live robin thicke, Bruno mars, flo-rida, etc. He sang his version of the songs added a hint of Hawaiian island beat to it. I loved it! Our server was ok ((less the one star)) She was nice to my friend and I but rude to the old guys sitting next to us. They would call her and say "excuse me, excuse me" she looks at them and keeps walking. RUDE! I felt so bad cz all he wanted was a cup of coffee. - Maybe cz he was smoking in the patio and no smoking was allowed. He probably didn't know, there wasn't a sign or anything. Well this place is good for entertainment, food was good, vibe was great!

3.5 stars.It was dead on a Saturday night but they must have had a lot of takeout/delivery orders because they had run out of green curry by 7:30pm.  Kinda crazy!  The menu was set up well since there were photos for everything which made it much easier to know exactly what was coming. We started with the "Duck Spicy Salad" since this was something I'd never seen before.  The salad consisted of duck with pineapple, raisin, tomato, red onion, cilantro, green onion and spicy lime sauce.  That was 360 degrees of flavor although I would've preferred a little less duck skin. I checked out Dan "Thai Food Addict" P's review on my phone and he got the Khao Soi.  I'd never tried Khao Soi and it's not offered in a lot of Thai spots so what the heck.  The only way I could explain it would be imagine if Thailand had ramen.  It had a really good curry broth with 3 kinds of beef (sliced, tendon and chunks) with soft egg noodles along with crispy egg noodles.  I also agree with Dan that there should have been more noodles but maybe it's because I liked it a lot.  My wife got the tofu red curry which was fine.  Corner Thai has a big sign out front saying they serve the best Thai food in Vegas.  That's a pretty bold statement that they don't live up to, but it's a fine neighborhood spot.

I LOVE this place! It is a small bar owned by a guy named Brad. The best part is, it is a Vikings bar! Go Vikes! I first experienced this place when I lived in Ahwatukee. My friends and I were looking for a good bar to eat at and watch a baseball game. Brad's has a huge menu that can be overwhelming but I always enjoy having a lot of options. I remember ordering the Grilled Cheeseburger. It was two grilled cheese sandwiched with a burger in the middle. It was to die for. I have been back a few more times since then and every time, I have had a pleasant experience. I will recommend this place to people new in the area because I like it so much. I attended the Football UYE this past Sunday and, unfortunately, watch the Vikings lose but had a great time anyway because the bartender/server was great and kept our refills coming. I ordered the biscuits and gravy meal that comes with eggs and breakfast potatoes. It was delicious. Another person ordered the Pork Loin sandwich and it was bigger than the bun. I will continue coming here when I have the chance.Heads up, it is hidden in the Safeway parking lot on Elliott and 48th Street so make sure you are on the lookout because it is a small place.

It started out promising enough.  We were pleasantly greeted and seated promptly.  Reviewing the menu, many of the dishes looked good.  Our waitress seemed nice (despite the really long red sparkly fingernails - maybe not appropriate for food service?) - she brought water and took our order.  Then things went sideways...What we ordered:  Eggs Benedict with well-done hash browns, and the Arizona Burrito.  What we received:  Barely warm undercooked hash browns and poached eggs that were left sitting too long - the yolks were rock hard!  How long did those poor things sit before being served?  Ick.  The Arizona Burrito was supposed to contain eggs, sausage, bacon, potatoes & cheese.  While it was large and impressive to look at on the plate, where was the meat?  A few paltry pieces could be identified amidst the egg/potato filling.I would have liked to be able to ask to have my hash browns cooked a bit longer, or for my eggs to be cooked correctly, but our waitress DISAPPEARED.  Gone.  Where did she go?  Busy staff came and went (walking right by empty water glasses time and time again), but she was nowhere to be found.  She never came back to check on us, refill water or even give us our bill.  Another waitress passing by took pity on us, and went to find someone to bring our check.Breakfast is supposed to be a good start to the day, not an exercise in frustration.One more note - please remove the Christmas decor - it is the end of January.

Review Text :
La Condesa Gourmet Taco Shop After a long break from Yelp, I knew that eventually I would find myself in a situation where I could no longer hold my tongue, and my need to share would overpower my desire to remain silent. La Condesa GTS created just that situation. I entered this space wound tighter than a spring ready to pop. Surely there could be no way that it could meet the lofty expectations set forth by my fellow yelper's reviews. But there is something very pure about this place, and as I stepped through the over-sized wood door, I knew this southwest girl was home. The best way I can describe the atmosphere is Southwestern Minimalist. Monique H was dead on with her praises for the artwork - The Blue Demon (long live Alejandro Muñoz Moreno) proudly intermingles with Diego and Frida and the acid treated floors feel natural. I also liked that this is clearly a community effort, with the art work provided by two exceptional Mexican artists (Manuel Gilavalos y Garcia and Ricardo Ramirez) and the furniture/décor provided by Bellas Artes de Mexico. I love that there is already a partnership, holding this little gem up until it can take flight. The food is clean. The flavors crisp. The portions more than adequate, and the prices less than I would expect to pay for such quality. Most selections can come in the form of a taco, a quesadilla, or a burro, although there are one or two additional options under both the quesadilla and burro menus. Each flavor combination is clearly described and in a handful of situations, there are salsa suggestions outlined on the out of this world salsa bar. The best way I can describe this is to think of a wine pairing with a food that will make flavors pop... in other words, just try it because the sum of the parts is way better than the individual components! The Mayan Conchita Pibil and the Oaxacan Black Mole Chicken are two of the finest examples I've had of either. Both are mouth wateringly moist and fairly melt. I would suggest the Peanut or Mexican salsa as additional choices for the MCP for the spicy recommended habanera. The guacamole and cilantro salsas were both mild choices and if the mole were not already a mouthful of perfection, might be the additional layer of flavors that bring you to the tipping point. Personally, I found the pickled onions severed atop with some of the Jicama salsa, tossed in for a little crunch, just enough to make my eyes roll back in to my head. I mean seriously, if I could wiggle around naked in this stuff, it would be a really good night! The Aztec Tinga is deceptively simple. Your first bite may seem relatively ordinary, but then start the countdown. Within a few seconds, the flavors hit you like a wall of emotion. Your lips and tongue begin to tingle with the heat of the perfectly balanced peppers. My BIL has tried the Sonoran Carne Asada and was unusually quiet as he made his way through his plate, so I have to assume that was good as well. Finish things up with those out of the world beans, or some of the grilled Mexican Calabacitas and a meal just can't get much better. So much has already been said about the iconic salsa bar, there really isn't much I can add, except to say, try them all! You will find two or three that send you to your happy place. The staff was super friendly and more than ready to answer questions or make suggestions. It's an order at the counter and take-a-number kind of place, but you can generally expect several service passes through the dining room. My only cautions / suggestions would be to grab a takeout menu so you don't have to stand and look at the wall menu with your mouth gaping like a cod fish and be prepared to park along Palm if the street inset parking area is full. This is my new love. I will definitely be adding this in to the regular rotation. At a dinner plate with drink running you between 8 and 9 dollars (with enough food to make two decent sized meals) this is one indulgence I can fit in to my life with little or no rationalizing. Please take the time to check this place out and support yet another wonderful family owned business. Look around when you come in, because I may be joining Joel L on one of his weekly visits. : )Not sure how to follow Julie P.'s epic review, but I thought I'd show some support.La Condesa is a fantastic addition to Central Phoenix. Casual, nice people, amazing food.Like other reviewers, I'm partial to the Oaxaca black mole chicken and the cochinita pibil. Everything is delicious in any delivery system -- taco, burro, or (gooey and vaguely depraved) quesa.The salsa bar really gets me, though. Experiencing it is to suffer total cognitive arrest and disorganization; it's like love at first sight or stumbling upon a work of great art. Peanut, cilantro, de arbol... bring a sharpie so you can mark the little plastic cups and remember your favorites.Bonus points: The server remembered that I'd asked for strawberry salsa (they were out) on my last visit eight days prior, and offered a totally above-and-beyond apology. Must be something in the mole that sharpens the memory. Great place -- a gem.Really awesome tacos here. I ordered the black mole and the conchinita pibil tacos. One of each and a steak queso. I didn't expect everything to be so big so I really over did myself. The queso I figured was like a quesadilla but it really isn't anything like that. Closest description is a calzone sized gordita. And not the taco bell version. The cheese was gooey and the undercooked parts of the masa were delicious. It was awesome. I broke out the plastic utensils and went to town. Daunting none the less. But I managed to put down half of it before the coma kicked in The mole taco was delicious. The chicken was sliced and covered in red onion. The sauce was spicy and not sweet at all. And the whole thing melted in my mouth. The corn taco shells are soft and made to order. The conchinita pibil taco was full of flavor and dripped juices all over the basket. Delicious. The horchata is unbelievable. Full of fruit and pecans as well as cinnimon and nutmeg.the salsa bar is epic. there was at least 12 different salsas to try. the cilantro was really good. and i normally hate raw cilantro because i burp it. but this was excellent and really brought out the flavor of my food. also the strawberry salsa was hot with a hint of sweet and freshness. and the salsa peanut was very tasty. very. very.I'm buying a bike just to ride here.  A lowerider bike with two 20's in a trailer. So I can rock all the way there.for now condesa....you are in my top 10.This place is HOT on Yelp for a reason. We couldn't wait any longer and had to go try it after reading so many awesome reviews this past month; and now we must personally thank every person who recommended this place to us:Thank you my fellow Yelpers... if it weren't for you there is zero chance we ever would have stopped at this unassuming storefront in a pretty rough area of Central Phoenix. This place has a very 'hole in the wall' sort of vibe... when we first pulled up we kind of had an "Oh... this is it!" sort of reaction. We got scared at first because there was a big 'public notice' sign on the front window; we thought it might have been shut down, but luckily it was just a 'liquor license pending' sign. Whew, that was close. It's a pretty small and cozy place inside. The walls are decorated with some really interesting and fun to look at Mexican paintings and the whole inside just feels authentic; like you just walked into a taco shop in a nice quaint Mexican village. The lady behind the counter and the cook that night were very welcoming and fun to talk to. Upon pondering one of the paintings on the wall she even explained to us the meaning behind it. First things first... the chips and salsa were flippin great! Thin and crispy with a slightly salted flavor; but even better than the chips are the salsas. I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say that La Condessa has got the best salsa in town; and the biggest variety too. Out off all the salsa's we tried a few standouts were the peanut, cilantro, and avocado variations. For our main dish we got one of each taco on the menu... in the spirit of brevity I won't get into each specific taco; but I will say that we loved every single one of them. They each had very unique flavors with a sense of freshness to them, and pretty much zero grease. Each taco was also brim full with meat... they don't skimp on the product here; they give you your money's worth! Next time it might even be tempting to separate the two corn tortillas the tacos come in, and just divvy up the meat to make two tacos out of one! Last thing that must must must be mentioned is the Horchata. Generally this mysterious white drink is very hit and miss, well here it's a big time hit. It's unique and has all sorts of fresh fruits and spices floating in it... it tasted like some Super-Horchata or something; it was just absolutely to die for and is easily the best I've had. I highly recommend giving it a shot even if you usually don't like the stuff. La Condessa gets a 4.5/5... rounded down to a 4 for now, just because we want to go back and try the rest of their menu; which at that time if it's anywhere near as good as our first visit this'll be bumped up to a solid 5 stars. Hooray for another great Mexican place in AZ!The Countess, she is beautiful, she is talented, she is delightful and she is bountiful, she is saucy (in the "salsa" sense of the word, not the "descarado" sense of the word:)...she's also cheap:)But then again, so am I:)It's Taco Tuesday (as I write this...who knows when I'll finish it and post it...maybe next Taco Tuesday...maybe not:)But today, I needed to retox after my run along the mighty Scottsdale River (or the Crosscut Canal as the flatlanders refer to it:)I was going to wander over to Cien Agave, when my buddy called and said he'd gotten done with an open heart surgery early (usually, that's a very bad sign, but not today...he said everything went "swimmingly":) but after 12 hours of holding someone's life in his hands, he too was in need of a retox:)We agreed that it was time to go see The Countess:)I've seen a bunch of glowing reviews on good ol' Yelp and as I always do when I read the praise heaped on a particular place by my Yelp brethren and sistren, I thought "I'll be the judge of that!":)Not that I don't trust the reviews...I do, or I wouldn't have jumped in the rig, pulled the belts tight and lit the turbocharger in order to get my retox going:)No..."trust, but verify"...those words were given to all of us during an episode of Death Valley Days by a nearly washed up actor (whose name escapes me at the moment)... http://tinyurl.com/yfg9e39Well, it's all true enough...the black mole chicken is subtle but spicy...the cochinita is saucy and inviting...the dog shark taco may be made with the only fish that travels well to the desert (no, don't get too excited...not the best fish taco I ever had...but very good:)And more than enough to eat from an inexpensive platter of softball sized tacos (I know, I called The Countess "cheap" a few paragraphs ago, but what I meant was a solid value:)...Two big, round, tumescent taco's with rice and frijoles'...$7.59, USD:)And plenty of salsa...oh yes...lots and lots of salsa...saucy, saucy salsa:)None of the legendary "strawberry salsa" today (probably like the Yeti...plenty of sightings, but no actual evidence:)...but I didn't care...they still had a dozen salsas to choose from:)And all the salsas seemed to complement my taco's...how is it even possible that Peanut Salsa and Smokey Chipotle Salsa BOTH taste exquisite with the moles and the pork shoulder?I don't know...I asked my buddy...he's a trained physician and he didn't know either (so what good is he?...unless I need a heart transplant and then, you know...he's a god:)As I contemplated all of the fresh and interesting selections available at the salsa bar, I thought to myself "well, it's a bar, why don't I just pull up a chair and make a day of it?" :-)After The Countess herself came out and asked me to please eat at my own table and quit embarrassing myself and my lunch buddies, I remembered that this kind of thing is what got me banned from the Top of the Mark in San Francisco (although I will tell you what I told the SFPD...having a Caviar Bar with bar stools in close proximity is just asking for it:)We finished our delightful lunch without further incident and agreed that this place should be much closer to our respective homes and open 24/7 so we can walk over and grab a burro or a platter of tacos whenever we feel like it...which would be pretty much every day, for at least 2 meals:)Do you think The Countess will go for that?Life is all about creating a balance. This idea translates to a restaurant with its elements of food, service and decor.The gourmet taco shop La Condesa is still trying to find its own equilibrium, but the line of customers nearly out the door isn't giving the new establishment much of a chance.La Condesa is located on 16th Street, just north of McDowell, in a neighborhood that's no stranger to tasty Mexican food, including Tortas El Guero and the popular Barrio Cafe.With no shortage of good Mexican food, how does a new place stand out? They do things their own way.You'll notice striking artwork on the walls. The art is beautifully lit, and from a visual standpoint it's hard to look away, that's until you see the salsa bar.Once you place your order at the counter, you're given a number. Then have a seat and a staffer will deliver a basket of crunchy chips. This is when the fun begins, tapping that salsa bar.On each of my visits, the salsa line up was never quite the same, with at least six to choose from. Standouts include an Avocado Salsa that was vibrant and flavorful, the chunky salsa Mexicano and the Creamy Cilantro Salsa.If you run out of chips they will refill your basket, but try not to fill up on chips while you wait for your food, because you will indeed wait, and wait, and wait... On each of my visits the kitchen took from 15 to 45 minutes to deliver my order. But don't let this discourage you because some things are worth waiting for.The tacos are served on two 6-inch corn tortillas. You can order tacos ala carte ($2.99 each) or as a two taco plate ($6.99) with rice and beans.The beer battered Cabo Shrimp version was hot and fresh, yet perfectly crunchy while leaving the shrimp moist and tender. The Sonoran Carne Asada had a great flavor but was more like jerky, tough and dry.Burritos were mostly a miss, while paying a premium ($7.29). You can choose shrimp or mahi mahi. Mine were filled with too much rice and not enough seafood.However the Mayan Cochinita Pibil Burro ($6.99) was an absolute killer. Filled with luscious roasted pork shoulder, it was so tender you don't need teeth to eat it.The handmade Corn-Quesa is going to bring me back. They take fluffy corn masa and fold it around your selection of fillings, then use their deep frying to create a unique and substantial alternative to tacos and burritos.Being a purist, the Traditional Quesa ($5.49) was one of my favorites, simply filled with gooey Oaxaca cheese.The same Oaxaca cheese is paired with the earthy flavors of mushrooms in the Maria Sabina Quesa ($6.99).For me, the thing to order is the Azteca Tinga Quesa ($7.29). Stuffed with shredded chicken, tomato, onion and chipotle sauce, the flavors were complex and each bite was sheer bliss.Service is friendly and on some nights you might even see the owner's kids helping out.After two consecutive, relishing visits, I have declared La Condesa as my numero uno taco joint in the valley of the "Bertos". The obscure and hoody street it resides on has always kept me hesistating until one day! Before I immersed myself into the unknown, I had to do some Yelp investigation.  I wanted to know which taco(s) in particular people were raving about.  Coincidintally, the ones people tipped about were the ones I also adored! I kept seeing Yelpers talk about them dogfish shark tacos, so I knew I had to order those first along with the can't-go-wrong carne asada! First thing that happens upon entering the cool, wooden door, you place your order at the counter and find an open seat once a number is assigned to you. Being that they specialize in tacos, I focused on just that (for now)! They do have burritos and other things but its all about the tacos!  Here are your options:1 Taco: $2.99, will not fill you up, but it is still a decent size.2 Taco Plate: $6.99, you get 2 tacos of the same core ingredient (ie. Carne Asada, Fish) plus 2 sides (refried beans and rice)2 Mix Taco Plate: $8.29, you get to choose any 2 tacos from the menu, plus the sides I mentioned.Beverage is additional.What I have tried thus far:1. Dogfish Shark Taco:  Killer! What makes these so awesome is in the beer batter!  They are super crispy, hot and the fish itself is still soft and moist!  2. Shrimp: Again, Killer! Comes out very similar to the shark tacos, except it is shrimp!3. Carne Asasada: Holy cannoli folks! Some might argue that America's Taco Shop are better but I would say the quality and taste is near even!  Condesa might edge them with its overall composition and various salsas!  It had that mesquitte, charred off the grill kind of taste and cut perfectly to fit into a taco!4. Cochinita Pibil (Pork): The first three tacos I mentioned were pretty darn good! But this one stood out quite well on its own.  It was savory and packed with excellent flavors!  As the menu stated, it was slow-cooked, fork tender!The 2 sides-Refried Beans: Excellent! Rice: Excellent! perfectly cooked!The cool part about dining here is enjoying their Salsa Bar! If I recall correctly , there were about 10 different salsas to choose from!  The tricky part is pairing it with the taco you just ordered! Experiment, I say! As part of every order they bring you a basket of warm, house chips!From the outside, you would never assume that such a great taco place existed, but once you step inside you know something good is about to happen!  Every wall has some sort of hip and contemporary Mexican art, from flowers to people.  The overall decor is very tasteful and upbeat!Staff members are very friendly and courteous!I took my office colleagues out during my second visit and they have nothing but positive responses and is begging to come back for more!Whether you are a connoiseur of Mexican cuisine, tacos or just love eating good food, I highly advise you stop by!  For the overall great taste and value, its hard to beat this cool taco spot that will please all your senses!I really do think that I could live off their chicken mole tacos and the salsa bar! The service was wonderful, the food was above and beyond, and I am addicted to their cilantro salsa. The chicken mole tacos were overflowing with meat and topped with just a bit of pickled onions, perfection. Their quesadillas .....as delicious as they are, are not figure friendly. They are homemade corn tortillas stuffed with various meats, cheeses and veggies and then deep fried. I had the Oaxaca cheese & char-broiled Arrachera steak, which was ooozing out on delivery. Waaay more than I bargained for, good thing I was sharing. These are very indulgent and intensely tasty.Once I got a little into trying all their salsas, I decided to mix the cilantro salsa and the chipotle salsa...WOW!!  This was my husband's idea, have to give him credit. If you haven't been here already...go...if you have been here...go back, I know I will.Jim W was in town and that was all the reason needed to party, well at least have dinner.  Heather C and Ryan C also were able to show up.  This was my first visit here.  I arrived last and there were chips, guacamole (thanks Ryan) and several salsas already on the table.  About half way through the second basket of chips we placed our orders.  Most of the table got tacos and I got the Oaxacan Black Mole Chicken Quesa.  I also ordered the Horchata which was very tasty with the addition of nuts and fruit but when done left a pile of stuff in the bottom.  The Quesa was delicious, quite filling and actually made two meals for me.  Just a note: mole does not do any better in a microwave on high than gravy, but it still tasted fine.  Service was fine and she split the checks after she had already given us a single one.  We were dining fairly early but as the evening wore on it got pretty busy on a Thursday even with a major Haboob going on.  Definitely a place worth checking out!La Condesa, you stole my heart.  Gourmet Taco Shop indeed.  Your saucy molé put me over the top.You really know how to spice up a relationship with your many wonderful salsas.I loved your warm decor and warmer service.I can't wait to come back to sample your salsas and try more tacos.I finally made my way here to meet some friends on a trip to Phoenix about a month ago, then I met another friend here on my most recent trip.$3.99 gourmet street tacos.  Filling.  20 or so salsas.  Delicious.went into the dark bathroomflipped on the lightsscurrying ROACHES, as in plural, ran into hidingi squealedwe leftMy parents taught me, "when you don't have something nice to say, then don't say anything at all."Yelp has taught me, "when you don't have something nice to say, tell it like it is."Sorry mom and dad, Yelp FTW!I like my restaurants how I like my style, un-cramped; unfortunately, this place is packed full with wall to wall tables and chairs leaving about 3 inches in between you and the guy at the table next to you. Don't plan to come here during the lunch rush with a big group, you're lucky if you can fit one or two people through the door. The parking isn't that appealing either, you are practically parked in the middle of 16th street traffic. :-/La Condesa makes a pretty good taco, and their salsa ain't bad either. To their benefit, they do have some fairly unique salsa's to choose from, such as strawberry, peanut, and pecan; but in my opinion, unique doesn't necessarily = awesome. Any of their tacos will do you right, but my favorite is their pork.  In my opinion, and lets face it, if you're reading my review, that's exactly what you're looking for right? La Condesa over stated when they went with Gourmet in the name. Sure, everybody likes their taco's but who wants to pay $9 for two tacos and leave feeling like they were packed in like sardines in the middle of a seedy neighborhood? If it isn't obvious yet, I don't plan on coming back soon, I can take or leave their salsas and tacos and wouldn't be bothered either way.Happy Yelping Phoenix, hope you find that hidden taco gem you've always been searching for.The salsa bar is "all that and a bag of chips!" "Since when do you go to a salsa bar, where the salsas are actually really full of flavor, thick (not watered down), and unique?!" as my friends put it so well! It's sounds strange, but the pecan salsa was delicious! The peanut salsa was still spicy but had a hint of peanut in it, so it wasn't overwhelmingly "peanuty." There was a strawberry rhubarb pepper type of salsa. This may sound a little too strange for most, but it was almost like a spicy dessert type sauce. Don't forget to order some margaritas to wash those salsa and chips down. I would say you could get filled up on salsa, chips and margaritas alone here and be more than satisfied, but I'm not sure the owners would be too happy about that! The salsa variety was nothing less than astounding! And don't worry your precious little heart. There are traditional ones too: green tomatillo, chipotle red pepper, jicama, and cilantro... just to name a few!Slow roasted cochinitas pibil (pork) tacos, slow cooked chicken mole tacos, beer battered Dogfish shark tacos, battered shrimp tacos, el gaucho steak in chimchurri sauce tacos with guacamole. Oh gawd, yes! And affirmative... these were all eaten in one sitting.... well, with a little help from Bryan too. He's so thoughtful for that too. I might have died from eating too much. We live so far from here that I just wanted to "stock up," and I came oh so close to having to be rolled out of the place like that "blueberry girl" from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory!They claimed to have mighty good horchata!!The Horchata was indeed great!! :) I liked It! But not the best in my opinion, no place like Mexico could ever offer amazing Horchata to me thus far, nothing like the one's you'll find at street taco stands late at night in places like Cuernavaca, Chihuahua, Mexico city and or Acapulco! _ Anyways, coming back to La Condesa this place is super tiny, and should consider expanding to make it a bit more comfy, just my opinion! The taco platter I had included the Carne Asada , Pacific Fish and Cochinita Pibil taco. All three were okay, and just okay. The rice and bean were also A-ok, nothing too extravagant nor elaborate. I really think this taco shop could do better, they have the potential to, like their amazing salsa bar is a huge kudos to consider, and the staff too so you got that down Condesa, Keep up the good work and plenty of room for improvement if you care to know!Delicioso! This is a neighborhood hole in the wall that serves some pretty great mole. I am a mole fiend. Love the stuff. Can't get enough. Their's is dark, rich, spicy, and the right amount of sweet. (Also how I like my men, hey-o). (Just kidding.) Also, who doesn't love a salsa bar? I've never even heard of most of them: pecan salsa? peanut salsa? Um, why are you only giving me 4 lids for the to-go cups? Like I'm not going to try them all ...Yes, my 3 year old spilled salsa not once not twice but 3 times. Our sever happily cleaned it up all 3 times. Probably only 1 or 2 salsas that are mild enough for kids. Ours enjoyed the cliantro one and the Pico de gallo. She tried a few others but immediately downed water and her face turned a little red. She may have grown a little hair on her chest. Our favorite salsas were the peanut and guacamole. I had the street tacos. Carne Asada taco was on point. Ranking the 3 I had1. Carne Asada2. Al Pastor3. ChickenWish I could tell you about the rice but the girl ate it all, so if she ate it I'm sure you will enjoy it too. Next time I need multiple margaritas. Happy hour, anyone?!?!Came in on a Friday 5-ish for an early dinner with my friends. The place is cute, few tables, it's got a bar and 2 bathrooms. Salsa bar was awesome! There's tons to choose from.. My favorite was the salsa picante, jicama and the cilantro.. Ahhh soo good. I got the fried fish taco plate, the shark taco on the side and I also tried their horchata! The tacos were great! I love the rice it's got flavor to it and the horchata was very delicious! It's got fruit, cinnamon and nuts on top. Ok, so I didn't know it was big! I think the cup was 32oz, it's good for 2-3 people!!! The down side was the service..I don't know if the lady was stressed out because there's a lot of people and there's only 2 of them serving.. But they need to add more server/waiter during peak hours.. The guy was doing 3 jobs, at the bar, cashier and serving as well. I feel bad for them. We were waiting for our food for a long time, probably 30-40mins. When we got out of the restaurant, there was a lot of people waiting.. I will definitely come back again, just not peak hours.La Santisima Gourmet Taco Shop is my favorite place in Phoenix to get fish tacos and Mexican seafood.  The ingredients are really fresh, and everything tastes yummy.Service can be a bit slow and seating is limited.  So, I recommend calling and placing to-go orders.  If you try to eat inside the restaurant during peak hours, prepare to wait 30 minutes.I usually get the Baja Sur Dogfish Shark Tacos, but I also like the Cabo Shrimp Tacos.My boyfriend prefers beef, pork, and chicken dishes.  So, he usually gets the Sonoran Carne Asada Tacos or the Mayan Cochinita Pibil Tacos.  He also likes the Aztec Tinga Tacos.I have heard so many great things about this place (It was on Diner's Drive-Ins & Dives!) and we finally decided to get our taco-loving booties over there to try it! Ohhh my goodness, I am so happy that we did!! They have the most amazing fresh salsa bar with at least 10 different salsas made daily. Being a sauce lover, this was a complete dream come true. I recommend getting the two taco plate with rice and beans. I got the Aztec Tinga Taco (Shredded Chicken, Tomato, Onion & Aztec chipotle sauce) and it was SO juicy with the perfect combination of spices. I also got a Carne Asada taco that was delish! The restaurant is small and I hear it gets busy so I would recommend dining here during off days/times. We went on a Thursday night at 7:30 PM and it was perfect!!! We will for sure be back, i've been daydreaming of their fabulous salsa bar ever since we left!For our Sunday lunch we were in the mood for some truly authentic tacos and thought we'd give this place a try.Location & Aesthetics - located on N 16th Street in Phoenix which I noticed can be a little busy with traffic even though it was Sunday.Parking is a little poor (-1) with a few stalls located outside the restaurant, and some of these parking spots are shared with another business on the corner.  I did notice some other available parking in the vicinity but believed they were for other businesses.Unfortunately N 16th Street was busy, at the time of our visit, so you can't really stop alongside the parking spots to wait for someone to leave as that might cause some traffic on the busy street.  Thankfully there's a side street on the right that you can turn into to turn around.The facade of the restaurant cannot be missed with its brightly green colored painting and large saint figure adorning the front of the restaurant.  Another drawback the restaurant had going for it, in my opinion, is the small interior size (-1).  As soon as you open the door, you will immediately notice how small it is as you will see diners siting at their tables right at the door as you enter.  I can see this could be a little bothersome if you've been seated close to the front door, and with it opening and closing, doesn't bode well for a nice dining experience for some.There is a bench outside of the restaurant for you to wait for seating if the inside is full, and with no real shade and I didn't see any misters, that can be uncomfortable, I guess, during the summer months.Menus - provided to us as soon as we were shown where to sit and were pretty self-explanatory.   Service - We were warmly greeted by staff upon entering.  It might've been nice if we were asked if we've been here before but no problem as any questions we had, was answered promptly.Food - Once seated, you are provided with a bowl of tortilla chips, and there's an available salsa bar with a large variety of salsa dips to choose from.  The dips all sit on ice being chilled and have varying degrees of hotness.  From the 5-6 dips that I chose from, they all tasted freshly made and was enough to open the appetite.Prior to ordering, I was in the mood for some libations and ordered myself a mojito which in my opinion was perfectly concocted as you could taste the lime juice (tasted fresh), rum, right amount of sugar, and contained enough leaves of mint.For food, I ordered the -- Baja Sur Dogfish Shark Taco, Mayan Cochinita Pibil Taco, and the Oaxaca Black Mole Chicken Shark Taco with a side of rice and beans.  All three tacos tasted absolutely great and delicious.  There were all flavorful, seasoned well, fresh, not too spicy, and cooked just right.Definitely a place I wouldn't mind returning to.How can I not like this place? It has my name written all over it!My hubby took me here on a Saturday night because he wanted to get my take on this popular gourmet taco shop. We stepped into the dark interior which had a Day of the Dead décor and filled with ten tables for hungry diners.The menu is divided into five sections:Gourmet Tacos or Gourmet TaquetzinStreet TacosGourmet Burros or Cazuela Bowl Gourmet Corn - QuesadillasLonchesI ordered the Al Pastor Burro (spicy pork, salsa, pineapple, veggies) $9 and Daniel got the Tlaloc Vegan Burro (mesquite grilled cactus, caramelize onion, veggies and cheese) $9. Both of them did not have rice or bean inside (a.k.a. fillers) and still kept it hardy but not overstuffed. My Al Pastor had the spiciness and sweetness which you typically find but what made this burro special, was it was grilled on the top and bottom and the fillings were made from high quality ingredients. And for you cheese lovers, you won't find it inside but I'm sure you can request it. Daniel's burro was a healthy alternative and the cactus had a nice texture. My only complaint was it needed additional salsa to add to the flavor. Be warned ... take a Beano before this meal!All meals came with a basket of tortilla chips and unlimited trips to the salsa bar which had at least ten different types of homemade salsa to experiment. Most of them had a kick of spice to it and you can pick from chunky vs. smooth salsas. My favorite was mixing the Salsa Mexicana and Avocado Salsa. Talk about double dippin'! The Salsa Chipotle was also another favorite for us.Personally, the lighting was a little darker than I preferred during dinner. I wouldn't call it romantic but rather adventurous!Since it was a busy night, the two servers were on their toes and the wait for the food was reasonable. They had an extensive cocktail list with many of the diners enjoying their margaritas and homemade horchatas. I hope to return with Daniel to try the mole street tacos and say I ate at "Santisima"!

Ended up here since Poke Express is to go only. Easy parking access and killer AC made this fast food joint a relaxing place for lunch.I went with the double protein combo - beef & chicken teriyaki and stir fried veggies. The portion was large and  the beef tasted marinated - nom nom! Even the veggies were cooked just right and yummy over the steamed rice. BTW they offer a brown rice option.I'll be returning here for sure.

Review Text :
Stopped in here for lunch the other day. Quiet little independent Chinese restaurant that also has a Hawaiian style menu.Not many options for vegetarians, no tofu dishes to be found. Didn't really dig my noodles + veggies + pineapple dish, hence the 2 star rating.I tried this place for three reasons. 1)  I've been searching for a better Chinese food restaurant than where we go now. 2) Several weeks ago someone dropped off a menu at our house. 3) Decided to try something new. Delivery took only 25 minutets and the food arrived very hot. My wife ordered the beef with broccoli. I ordered the shrimp with lobster sauce. My wife took one bite and said the beef was tough and the broccoli was hard (it wasn't coooked enough). She also said her dish smelt weird. At that point I dug into my shrimp & lobster sauce. It was more like egg drop soup than any shrimp and lobster sauce dishe I have ever tried anywhere. I also paid extra and got fried rice instead of white rice. It was so bland it was inedible. Everything went  immediately in the trashWe  also ordered  Wor Wonton Soup and got a free entree which we were planning on having for lunch or dinner tomorrow. Since we put the entrees in the trash nd were hungry we decided to give the soup a try. There was large chunks of pork in the soup which looked good but after trying a piece I was sure that was not how the meat was supposed to taste. My wife agreed and we ended pouring it down the drain. We then tried the free almond chicken entree.  Again the dish was nothing short of  disgusting! so it went directly into the trash as well.FOOD: wanted to really enjoy it, but honestly, the food was detestable. We both  nearly gagged just after tasting it. To say our food was dissatisfactory is an understatement. STAY AWAY!!!! PRICE: Wasn't worth the price even if it was free.. SERVICE: Fast delivery.  CONCLUSION:  I have rarely been this disappointed with a restaurant . If I could give this place 0 stars I would. This is the worst chinese restaurant ever!Dinner cost $28.37 and it ALL went down the drain or in the trash. I will never order from this establishment again. STAY AWAY!!!!

Argh.The first time I ordered takeaway food here it was not ready when I arrived.  I arrived 5 minutes after it was supposed to be ready and ended up waiting for 50 minutes longer.  The food took 70 minutes rather than the 15 they quoted on the phone.Argh.But the food was really good.Argh.I would have just left but we were having a conversation with someone else in line.  The line of people waiting to pick-up was all the way through the restaurant.Argh.Good business practices would have been to offer everyone a discount or something, maybe even serve up some munchies and drinks for the crowd waiting and growing irritable.  But no.Argh.But the food was really good.Argh.The food was so good we decided to order from Hong Kong Kitchen II again.Argh.This time they said 20 minutes.  I arrived 30 minutes later.  And waited an additional 15 minutes.Argh.And one of the two entrees was beef and not chicken.Argh.I may go back to Hong Kong Kitchen II but only if I'm in a patient mood.  If I had caught the mistake in my order I have to wonder, would I be there another 30 minutes or more waiting for them to get the right food?Argh.Serious organizational challenges here.  Tasty food, reasonable prices and a possible good location for an episode of "Kitchen Disasters."Argh.

This place is the ultimate ASIAN KINGDOM!  You get an ultimate shopping experience with samples and music.  Now how cool is that?  I really, really, REALLY LOVE how this place gives you pre-marinated meat.  I love to shop for all my Korean food addictions here, and I get it all in one sweep.  Kal-bi, bugolgi, kimchi, and pork belly! All crossed out in one area.  I also love their various choice of ramen, I could stand in the aisle for hours reading every single one and putting them into my cart.  And get this, THEY EVEN HAVE MY CHILDHOOD DRINK! Milkis = YUMMMMMMM!Going to Greenland gets me excited.  What do you do when you go to a grocery store?  Buy food.  What do you do at a Korean grocery store?  Buy Korean food!  And I love me some Korean food.  Whether you're satisfying your current hunger at the food court or bringing home some food for later, Greenland's got you covered.The biggest reason I go to Greenland is for their BBQ.  They have several meats already marinated and ready to take home.  Buying your kalbi/bulgogi/etc. by the pound here and grilling at home is so much cheaper than eating out!  That wouldn't mean much if the meat and marinade isn't good, but luckily that isn't a problem.  Potluck coming up?  Pool party coming up?  Greenland's BBQ is my go to spot for bringing a dish.The other thing I've come to buy a lot of is the banchan they carry.  Gotta have the banchan with the BBQ!  Kimchi, bean sprouts, cucumber, fish cake...more banchan than I can remember!  Everything has been decent and consistent.  For someone that's never made banchan at home, this is my only option!Another nice thing is that it's no problem if you head to Greenland with an appetite.  No need to go grocery shopping while you're hungry, just stop by the food court!  Obviously the biggest reason to go to Greenland is for Korean food.  Me being a fan of Korean food makes me a fan of Greenland.After 8pm you can get discounted kimbap (beef and vegetable rolls) or chapchae (stir fried sweet potato noodles with vegetables) for 50% off if any are still available. I had some chapchae for around 2.14 for my dinner, good eats! The kimbap goes fast so try to get there before 9, you can get that for around 2.25 for 2 big rolls.This large marketplace also has some of the most hardest to find korean items you will find anywhere. Whether it's a brand name korean soju, red pepper paste, or candy, this supermarket has it all. There are also stalls inside the center that sell freshly made breads and pastries from the Lepidor bakery, and another one that sells fresh rice cakes. Along the outside, there are stores that sell electronics, travel tickets, as well as clothing.For a one-of-a-kind experience into a whole different world, Greenland is the place to go.I love Greenland market! It is an excellent Korean-owned asian grocery store and carries a lot of varied products. Their fresh meat selection is awesome. Everytime my Mom is in town I always make a trip to Greenland to stock up on Korean-style short ribs so that she can marinate them (and so that I can have a freezer full of Mom's delicious bulgogi short ribs nom nom nommm).The prepared foods section is very good too. I have had jobchae, kimchee, kimbop and seaweed salad from there.The food court is perfect for when you need a quick bite before grocery shopping, knowing that if you walk in to Greenland hungry you will end up buying everything in the store. My favorite food court item is the mussel champong (spicy seafood and noodle soup) from the stand in the corner, the name escapes me. So yummy.Be sure to get your Greenland Market rewards from the cashier. For every $500 you spend, you get a $10 coupon/voucher to use towards future purchases.Since no one has really listed all of the food court shoppes, here they are, from the closet vendor to the entrance inward: MIRAKTypical Korean food here. Meat dishes and soups. I've never tried this one. See photos for menu. SONG'S FAMILYThey have Kim chi fried rice, ramen for $3 or $4 although I think it's instant or about $6 with rice cakes. Haven't gotten a chance to try this either.  SAKURA SUSHITypical sushi rolls (Philadelphia, sunset, spicy albacore, tempura.) Cheap California rolls for $4. Also Haedukbibimbap (which is pretty much a Korean poke bowl) for $8 and katsu for $9. RED GATE WOKMore of a Korean/Chinese fusion. Lots of chicken options here like orange chicken. Also jjangmyeon, which are a good portion of noodles with a thick black sauce. Always served with pickled radish. HOT TOFUI've eaten at this place the most. I've had soondubu which a tofu soup served bubbling hot. Ask for an egg to be cracked in it as its bubbling. Served with a side of rice and fish and lots of banchan. Good price and really fills you up. I've also had the spicy noodles and pickled radish with cold noodle soup. These use thin rice noodles. The cold soup (it had ice in it!! :o) was delightfully surprising and really refreshing on a warm day. PHO THIEN HUONGThis one isn't Korean. It's Vietnamese. Extremely large menu. Pho, rice dishes, mi (egg noodles), bun (vermicelli noodles), egg rolls, banh cuon if you come early. My boyfriend tried the pho and he described it as very watery. Meat wasn't too fresh and you're better off going to the pho restaurant next door. Can't speak for the other menu items here though. So many choices and good food. Can't complain.Feeling like Korean food but not feeling like K-POP blasting at Soyo? You're in luck! Greenland Supermarket has a ton of offerings within the food court and a great assortment of items you can buy in the grocery store itself. I usually make it out here to by some pre-marinated meats that I grill at home and my favorite banchan (boiled peanuts, beansprouts, spicy anchovies, seaweed salad and fish cakes). They also sell raw shrimp unfrozen with heads intact, which is really hard to find at your local Smith's or Albertsons. They're not as big as the other grocery stories further down in Chinatown, but they also carry a lot of Asian staples (Japanese curry, variety of sauces, candies, noodles, tea, etc.). Pro TIp: Watch out for the expiration dates on the banchan, some fall quite sooner than others.

Review Text :
I drive by this Olive Garden countless times a day and I always think to myself "one of these days I am going to try it." After all, I always hear about the bottomless salad and breadsticks.  So, yesterday, along with the lovely Farrah A, I decided to do just that... we went to a late lunch at Olive Garden and guess what?  I'm here to tell you about it!Yes, it is a chain, and yes - I had low expectations... but I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised.  The service was fabulous thanks to the hostess that opened the door for us when we entered and exited, and of course thanks to Tony, our waiter.  The bathrooms were clean and although the atmosphere is a bit on the sterile side, I'd rather have that than a dirty restaurant!I went with the soup and salad - minestrone soup, and Farrah went with soup and salad - a creamy chicken and gnocci soup.  We also shared a mussels appetizer... I didn't love the breadsticks, and the mussels were a tad on the buttery side, but the soup and salad were both fresh and flavorful!  I had just one bowl of soup but several helpings of salad... and Tony didn't even flinch.  Farrah informed me that the Olive Garden chefs go to Italy for training and upon checking out their website, I see she is correct!  Here's what it says on their site: "Olive Garden's Culinary Institute of Tuscany is located in the 11th century village of Riserva di Fizzano. Every year Olive Garden chefs travel to our Culinary Institute to learn authentic cooking secrets from Italian Chef Romana Neri and Chef Paolo Lafata."Impressive, huh?I still prefer to support local, but I have to say... I would have no qualms about returning to Olive Garden again!Yes, folks, during my short stay in Phoenix, I somehow convinced Gabi K to come to Olive Garden for "endless soup, salad and breadsticks."  It's been a while since I've been, and they seem to have added a few soups to their menu, one, the chicken gnocchi. Very rich and probably fattening, but still recommended. So it was two soup, salad and breadstick combos ($6.95 each) and steaming hot mussels di Napoli ($9.25). Totaling out to $24.99 for lunch for two. And this location has a great staff, particularly our server Tony. Right on top of the water and salad refills. Gratzi, Anotonio!

I was honored enough to attend the "Restaurant Impossible" reveal dinner here last week & was really pleased with what the restaurant had to offer. I had never been here prior, as I don't get down to the Ballantyne area much.FIrst off, the decor is fantastic; however, it doesn't look like it belongs in a strip mall restaurant. :) Lovely IKEA wooden kitchen utensils hang from the lights & gorgeous stone fireplace in the middle of the dining area...Props to Taniya Nayak (from HGTV) & her team for making it look so nice! Dion L., Katie M., & Simone M., & myself ordered several different appetizers to try: fried green tomatoes, crawfish mac 'n cheese, black eyed peas hushpuppies, & shrimp & grits.  The taste & temperature of every item was perfect. The presentation was nice, as well. Oh & the sweet tea...absolutely southern sweet tea!For our meal, we all chose something different & had every intention of sharing, but after the meal arrived, we couldn't bear to share. :D  I chose a hamburger (it has a "special" name, but I can't remember it) with fries. The hamburger came with lettuce, tomato, which were fresh. The hamburger was thick & juicy. There was about a handful & a half of fries, which after eating the hamburger (& sampling all the appetizers), I couldn't finish the fries.Our waitress Amy, was a real sweetheart & talked with us quite a bit.  The owners were there of course & they came around & spoke with everyone.  Such a nice & humble couple!The restaurant isn't that big, they do have booths & table seating.  You do feel comfortable being here.Good Luck, Sweet Tea's! I hope you will continue serving the south Charlotte area for a long time!This place started bad and ended worse. My two friends and I have been wanting to try this place since they reopened. We all work in the industry and are big fans of the show so we were excited to try a restaurant they redid. We gave it a few weeks for them to work out the kinks. Needless to say it was quite disappointing.We arrived around 8:00pm on a Saturday night. When we walked in, a young girl dressed in street clothes with a messy hairdo like she just roller out of bed came up to greet us.The table was already set with silverware and menus. Right off the bat I noticed that the menus were different. One of the menus had additional side dishes listed and a couple changes on the entree side. I also noticed this place was a little empty for a Saturday night. They close at 9pm so maybe they are busier in the early evening.For how slow it was, it took our server way too long to greet us and take our drink orders. When she finally came over we all ordered sweet teas. They have a variety of different fruit flavors to choose from. I ordered the strawberry and my two friends ordered peach and regular sweet. The sweet tea cost $.99 and the flavored teas cost $2.99. She brought back a red colored tea, a peach colored tea, and a regular sweet tea. We paid $2.00 for fruit syrup?! You would think paying $2.00 extra would get you some sort of muddled fruit and simple syrup concoction. I mean the place is called Sweet Teas right?After she dropped off the teas we ordered some apps: the Augusta grilled cheese and the black eyed pea hush puppies. When the apps came out, we noticed that the Augusta grilled cheese had no pimento cheese or spiced Dijon mayo like it said in the description on the menu. It was literally a normal grilled cheese sandwich with a few American cheese slices. The hush puppies were ok. They had a really dark color on them like if they were cooked in old burnt oil. The buffalo ranch sauce, I thought was tasty but my friends did not like. For entrees, I ordered the chicken and waffles, and my friends ordered country fried steak and shrimp and grits. My chicken and waffles and my friend's shrimp and grits was the only reason I gave this place two stars. Both dishes were cooked well and tasted good. My chicken did have that same color as the hush puppies so I could only conclude that they needed to change their fryer oil. The country fried steak was a real disappointment. It was tough, over cooked, and under seasoned. The white pepper gravy was tasteless and gelatinous. The mashed potatoes were stiff, like they had been sitting in a hot well since that afternoon and 'sizzled' collards were a joke. I can understand frying collards as a garnish like you do for the appetizer but you expect someone to eat that as a side dish? Why not re-purpose the collards and actually make good collards? And if you do, put that as the side, not the 'sizzled' ones. After dinner we decided to try dessert. You can't screw up fried Oreos or sweet potato pie right? Wrong! The fried Oreos were burnt to crisp in the old fryer oil and they gave us one tiny scoop of ice cream. We asked the server for another scoop and they gave us a huge scoop but added a dollar to our bill (not that I'm complaining about a dollar). Sweet potato pie is suppose to by creamy and smooth right? This was some sort of cake like dense pie with marshmallow fluff and something else we couldn't figure out. It did seem like they put thyme into the batter or whatever it is they made. Good idea, bad execution. After dinner, we were told we pay at the register. We got up to pay and the same street clothes messy haired girl got up after the owner?? told her to ring us up since she was busy talking with a table. Not to mention, this girl left while we were eating, went to buy clothes and brought it back to the restaurant to show the other two servers. How do I know this? Because she stood at the front of the restaurant showing them off item by item. A bit unprofessional if you ask me.Anyways, everything is handwritten with no PoS system. We were splitting the check so we just had to tell the girl what items we had and she punched it into the cash register. Sounds simple right? Wrong again! She tried to charge my friend $58 after she told her she had an app, flavored tea, entree and dessert. There's no way all that cost $58 with an $11 average entree price. We were standing there an extra 5 minutes because she did not know how to work a cash register.As you can read, this place is just not good. I didn't know the Sweet Teas previous to this one but I'll say it couldn't be much further off. The food, service , and overall restaurant were bad. You could say maybe we went in too late, but if that's the case, this place won't make it long without having consistent food and serviceA coworker and I decided to give this place a-go after hearing they were taken over by Restaurant: Impossible.I never saw the inside prior to the RI makeover, but it looks very nice inside now compared to your standard dirty strip mall eateries.  It was an "okay" experience.  I ordered the stuffed burger and bacon with cheddar were my victims of choice for stuffage.  I was indeed highly disappointed.  I don't honestly know what I was expecting in the bacon - oh yeah, it to be cooked. I'm not a fan of the "floppy" seemingly undone chewy bacon, and that was "tough to swallow." With that said, the fresh cut fries were the best part of lunch. And that's a good thing for a spud fan.The service wasn't much to write home about either.One benefit in stopping by for lunch is - if sweet tea is your beverage of choice - it is complimentary with the order of a lunch menu item.Another disappointment was a Yelp "check-in" offer for a free dessert item was not accepted, as I was looking to forward to nibble upon some highly rated deep fried oreos.Finishing up the lunch hour, ready to pay the bill and head back to the workplace is when I came upon a big pet peeve I have in restaurants... standing at the register to pay the bill. I'm not at a fast food joint, so I expect the wait staff to handle my bill. This instance it's just kind of awkward waiting around for someone to show up to the register and waiting for everyone in line to be cashed out. Especially more awkward when there isn't a lot of room near the register for a cashing out crowd to gather and a new patrons to enter.I definitely would like to make it back and try something other than the aforementioned disappointing stuffed burger.With the news Sweet Tea's will be on an upcoming episode of Restaurant Impossible, I had to check it out. Unfortunately I was highly disappointed. I arrived @ 12:30 and was seated pretty quickly, as the place was somewhat quiet. I ordered the fried green tomatoes to start and all I will say is grease! From the greasy breading to the greasy collards, I pushed them aware with disappointed. I ordered the rosemary chicken with mashed potatoes, or should I say mashed potatoes with a side of chicken. The chicken was almost rare and greasy. The mashed potatoes took up the entire plate and the gravy, or at least what they called gravy, was diluted and watered down around the plate. In addition, they were partially cooked with an overwhelming amount of garlic. The decor was nice, but I found it quite strange that my waitress sat me, served me, and rang me up at the counter. She was very polite, but there seems to be a disconnect b/t the service. One server sat at the back table laughing and telling stories to the other servers as they walked by and yelled to her Dad a few times in the back of the house. Unfortunately it hurts to write this because I had high hopes, but I will definitely not be back.Where to start...I'm from Raleigh,NC and spending the weekend out here, so of course I want to check out any restaurant featured on the famous Restaurant Impossible. I'm visiting a few days after the "revisit" from R.I. So I figured they'd be on their "A-game" after this but boy was I wrong. This review is based off my observations of waiting inside the place for 30 minutes.      I saw everything from empty tables; just waiting to be used, non-bused tables the whole time I was waiting, there were people that got sat when we arrived who, when we left, had still not been seen by anyone yet. Also there was a group of four paying for their ticket on the old and outdated ticketing service. This was unbearable to watch, I just felt embarrassed for the workers using it and the customers waiting as the staff fumbled around asking who had what. I did notice that the red hat society was there and even they had issues with service. Another issue I saw was a table had been waiting for a prime rib entree and after waiting they were informed that there was an issue with the food and out of something else now. This whole experience was at 1230pm...How are you out of anything that early in the day?! So this was all while waiting. So when we left I waited behind and spoke to the girl ringing people out. I asked to speak to a manager and she said that the wife was cooking and not able to come out and talk with me. She informed me that the manager said not to sit anyone because they were short staffed. I was just flabbergasted at her response and just careless attitude. She did offer to take my name and number but I declined to provide such information to a business that can't even correctly and efficiently ring out their paying customers. It's just amazing how this place was on a great show yet service suck so bad. I mean...words can't describe my disappointment in this place. I will not be returning anytime to this place. Oh! The only positive mark I will give this place is the decor. They really did a fantastic job on the decor, it was very nice and clean. The IKEA kitchen utensils hanging off the light fixtures looks great in person. I had high hopes for this place but I just couldn't believe l experienced and witnessed before even sat in my 30 minutes there...Not my cup of tea. I went in with some friends for an early dinner. The place wasn't too busy when we arrived and it's seat yourself so we grabbed a table and sat down. Our waitress was super friendly but the food just didn't do it or me. I'm not an ice tea drinker (I know...I know) so I can't comment on that but here goes:For our appetizer we ordered the deviled eggs which come topped with chicken and bacon. How could you mess that up??? Well, the presentation was just bad. It looked like they just threw the eggs and toppings on the plate. To make matters worse, the flavors just were not good. It was like the chicken came out a can...ugh! No thank you.For my meal, I ordered the chicken and waffles. I knew based on previous reviews, to ask for my syrup on the side...to avoid syrupy chicken. But let's just say, again that the textures and flavors were a huge miss. I expected the waffle to be light and fluffy...nope. Instead it was dry and crumbled with each bite. That's not a good thing...the saving grace was the tabasco butter. Now, that was yummy.The chicken was not crispy and I wasn't a fan of the skin...See I am not one of those girls that takes the skin off and only eats the chicken meat...Nooooo....normally I eat it all. But not here...the skin nor the chicken were good for me. So pretty much Sweet Tea's just wasn't for me.We saw this place featured on the Food Network on "Restaurant Impossible" like many other people and figured we had to give it a shot!The look and feel of the restaurant is nice.  Clean, cozy, warm with nice decor and more of an upscale, brunch looking place.  You would not be able to tell that from the outside.The selection of food is a combination of traditional American and Southern comfort food.  It's nice that all entrees come with a free sweet tea.  Unfortunately, I did not realize this and got a flavored sweet tea for a little extra, which turned out too be a little too artificial tasting, but not a big deal.I naturally had to try the chicken and waffles, and it wasn't the best I've ever had, but not the worst either.  It was just OK.  My husband got a cuban sandwich though, and that was pretty tasty!We were able to cash in on our free dessert for having checked-in using Yelp and went for the bread pudding which was VERY tasty.  I am a huge sweet tooth, so this was right up my alley.Overall, I'd come back since I frequent that area often, but wouldn't go out of my way for it.

Restaurant name  Feast Buffet
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
If you want the BEST buffet in Las Vegas, do yourself a favor, hop in the car and drive 9 miles to come here.  They have the best Alaska King Crab and best Prime Rib of all buffets I've had.  And trust me I've had many.  The unique thing about this Feast Buffet is that they will stir fry your king crab with butter, onion, garlic, tomato, and cilantro.  You can also request it spicy like I did.  It smells wonderfully and tastes even more heavenly.  I am not kidding.  None of that ice cold crab leg crap!  The crab legs here are fresh, big, sweet.  One word - PERFECT!!!  I come here and chow down 2 huge plates of king crabs.  My hands get all greasy and I had to use 20 paper napkins, but I don't care!  The carve station serves the most tender prime rib I've ever had.  They also serve turkey, rotisserie chicken.  Oh, the fried chicken is also great.  Like all buffets, they have Chinese (best egg rolls and fried pot stickers), Mongolia Beef station, Mexican, Italian, dessert, soft serve and ice creams.  This by far is my favorite buffet in Vegas.  OK, it's in Henderson.  The price is very reasonable, around $20 for dinner.  I haven't had to pay since I get coupon from them (which was why I first tried it).  But I'd drive here and pay to eat even if I don't have the coupon.My personal pledge to reserve Vegas buffet outings for out of town guests only went out the door this past Friday as the Husband and I checked out Green Valley Ranch Casino's Feast Buffet.Friday and Saturday nights are Surf and Turf nights from 3:30 pm to 10 pm, which ultimately means AYCE crab legs and whole roasted pigs.  It's normally $21.99/pp or $19.99/pp with a Stations Boarding Pass.  But for the month of November, an additional $3 is discounted - making dinner $16.99/pp!  (And with my coupon in the mail for BOGO free buffet - that meant $16.99 for two people!  What a deal!)The line was already long when we approached the restaurant a bit after 4 pm.  It didn't take too long for the line to get moving though.  There were hoardes of people in line for the crab - specifically the steamed crab legs.  But then there was this other line - you can have them stir-fry your crab legs however you'd like.  Ultimately, you grab your crab legs (or other food items), and then tell them what sauce you like and how spicy.  You can skip the wait and get cold crab legs and it's all the same.  This is what everyone swears by and the reason the Feast Buffet at GVR does well!  Other unique items at this buffet worth mentioning were the clams on the half shell, something I couldn't indulge in sadly enough.  But they do have milkshakes to order, which I was more than happy to help myself to! Other useful buffet info:Breakfast:Monday - Friday: 8am - 11am$7.99 per person or $6.99 with Boarding Pass CardBrunch:Saturday - Sunday: 8am - 3:30pm$20.99 per person or $18.99 with Boarding Pass CardAYCE crab legsLunch:Monday - Friday: 11am - 2:30pm$10.99 per person or $9.99 with Boarding Pass CardDinner:Sunday - Thursday: 3:30pm - 10pm$20.99 per person or $18.99 with Boarding Pass CardAYCE crab legsThe Buffet King says....This is one of my trust worthy lunch spots off the strip when I'm hungry for a buffet but not wanting to pay the high prices of the strip buffets...BTW.. Not all station feast buffets are created equal..... trust me....Why do I like this place?  Let me tell you...1)  Awesome Asian cuisine selection...   Love their Eggplants, Mabo Tofu, and most of all, Chinese BBQ pork!  (Be sure to get those ones that has a little bit of fat on it!)  So good!!! 2)  Pretty tasty Italian section... meatball were my favorites and the Alfredo sauce was pretty creamy too!3)  Pretty good selections from Mexican, American, and pizzas!  But I never get to try those because I'm so addicted to the eggplants and the BBQ pork....4)  Nice salad bar!  Caesar salad here is soooo much better than souplantation's5)  Nice Dessert Section with various pies and cookies..  (And NSA choices as well)  Cold goodies are gelatos in 6-7 flavors....Weekday lunch is only $9.99.. the most expensive meal is the Friday night Seafood running at $27.99 (but as expected because it's seafood)  All other times are less than $15 bucks easy even dinner.....Here is a great tip for you all!Before leaving...  Be sure to stop by the gelato, ask for your favorite flavor shake!  YES!! Pick your favorite gelato and the nice staff will make you a delicious ice cream shake in no time!  We love our espresso and Pistachio flavor shakes!This is a hidden secret of sorts... but don't say I never share any goodies with you all!

Restaurant name  The Fillmore Charlotte
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Another sold-out show at The Fillmore and another brutal disappointment.  This place cannot, I repeat, cannot manage a big crowd.  Period.  I tried to go into it with an open mind since my last review apparently ruffled a few feathers, but I'm sad to report that nothing has changed or improved since my last visit in August.  This place is a cluster fuck and that's putting it nicely.  The poor, poor design of locating the bathrooms all the way  in the back on the right side basically resulted in a total bottle neck of people pushing and shoving their way down the two stairs that lead from the bar at the top to the bathrooms and smoking area down below.  The security staff, instead of helping people get through and easing the crowded mass, decided to shine their flashlights in everyone's faces while standing against the rail, arms crossed over their chests, looking like a bunch of worthless thugs.  Any attempt to get into the actual bathroom area was often quickly thwarted by someone yelling at you to stay out of the fire lane even though you are simply attempting to get out of the way to help everyone else actually be able to move.  The staff here is the WORST EVER.  That ranges from security to bartenders and everywhere in between.  I've been to smaller venues all over the country that have had bigger crowds and managed them more efficiently.  I made the mistake of giving it another try and I definitely will not be back again after this nightmare.  Sorry Dave.I've experienced the Fillmore in two ways: private events and concerts. This review isn't about the former; the Fillmore is just fine for private events, and the success of such an event depends on the event organizers rather than the venue management.  As for the latter...Well, the Fillmore sucks. I apologize to its fans, but it does. My most recent visit totally destroyed whatever respect I had left for the place.We saw the Flaming Lips, and being the Flaming Lips, they were awesome. The Fillmore management, however, was so awful that we ended up leaving with at least 30 more minutes of Lips left.  I shall try to break it down for you:1) Staff.  The staff at the Fillmore is consistently, outrageously rude.  The one pleasant person we met was in the will-call box. It was downhill from there. Entry security treats everyone as though he or she is a suspected terrorist, and the bar staff consists mostly of snotty twenty-something girls who don't seem to realize they should at least try not to directly insult customers, since they are working for tips, after all.  Speaking of bars...2) Drink prices are ridiculous. I paid 7 dollars for a Dixie-cup of watered-down Miller.  A more reasonable portion would have set me back nearly 10.  I expect to pay higher-than-usual prices at concerts and such, but that is truly ridiculous. The Fillmore knows it, too: there's a strict no re-entry policy so you can't go next door for a drink while you wait for the main act.I could have lived with the above things. The music is what's important, right? Bear with me while I explain the breaking straw.3) Crowd control. The Fillmore is a small space, with no dividers of any kind on the floor.  Combine that with what I suspect is the management's habit of overselling tickets, and things can get quite unpleasant as a bunch of drunk people try to cram as close to the stage as possible.I'm almost 6' 8", and people seemed to view me as an obstacle to be overcome.  My feet were stepped on constantly; I was shoved more than once, and someone actually put her hand on my shoulder and tried to push me downward so she could get video with her iPhone.  All this is beside the fact that everyone around us was smoking, and given the no re-entry policy, it's impossible to step outside for some fresh air if this causes you to start sneezing.So, one might ask, why wasn't security keeping people from more or less stabbing each other in the back to touch the hem of the Lips' robes?  Well, security was back in the VIP section, chatting it up and making sure no commoners violated the sanctity of that space.  Useless, they were.I understand shows can be messy, and shows like the Flaming Lips even more so.  But the Fillmore ruined this experience.  I will think twice before I ever spend money on tickets there again.I'm a live music junkie and the Fillmore is a great venue to get my fix.  It's big, has great sound and is multi-leveled to help out the little guys.  The tickets are on the pricier side due to the live nation partnership, but that means it also attracts the biggest names in the business.  Try your best to pre-game beforehand if you're trying to catch a nice buzz for the show because drinks are $10~ a pop.  I always grab a few drinks and food at VBGB before every show, it never disappoints.  The bathrooms are large and always clean as well, you definitely can't say that for many music venues.  The only thing that keeps this place from 5-star status is drink prices, but I always make sure I have a few drinks ahead of time so it's not too big of an issue for me.

Restaurant name  Spice 9 Indian Cuisine
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
On the advice of a friend I tried out Spice 9.  It being the first visit, we just went for the lunch buffet to try out a selection of items.  We could smell spices from the parking lot, in a good way.  The buffet provided a great quick lunch with lots of choices.   There were several tasty chutneys, including tamarind and a more unusual coconut.  The buffet selection included the Mughal staples:  rice, naan, tandoori chicken, butter chicken, and vegetable curries, but there were also more homey Indian dishes like a yellow dal with green peppers, lamb curry, sambar and rasam, an eggplant dish,  and dry curries (just veg and spice without a heavy sauce).   The spicing seemed very authentic, and the level of heat was definitely higher than in the average Charlotte Indian restaurant.   It isn't "take your face off" hot -- if you're one of those people that think every meal is a chili pepper eating contest you might be disappointed.   The spice blends come out nicely and aren't dominated by the heat, and dishes that are supposed to taste different from each other and use different spice blends, actually do taste different.  I lived for a few months in India when I was younger, so I'm pretty picky about Indian restaurants.  This is one I'll go back to.  The restaurant is located right across the road from Concord Mills just south of Lowe's.   The interior is nicely decorated and definitely has an upscale vibe, not like the usual strip-mall place.   Note:  disappointingly, the name of the restaurant is not a Vonnegut reference, although that does not affect the deliciousness of the food.This is actually a 4 1/2 star review.We had originally intended to have dinner at Carrabba's, but there was a misunderstanding about their call ahead seating, and their wait was too long.  (A second experience with Carrabba's can be found here http://www.yelp.com/biz/carrabbas-italian-grill-concord#hrid:q8auN9lts15ggk5MPTa9oQ)  Instead, we chose Spice 9 for my husband's birthday dinner, and I'm glad we did.  Upon entering the restaurant, we were greeted by a delicious aroma of mixed Indian spices.  We were seated right away.  I noticed that the decor was contemporary and understated, but quite attractive.  They hit a nice balance with the lighting between a light on your table (so you can actually see the menu and what you are eating) and enough dimness to create a more intimate atmosphere.  This would make a nice date restaurant (nice enough to be special, but not overly fancy or fussy).The menu contained a very nice selection of proteins and preparations.  I liked that the descriptions were detailed enough to give me an idea of what to order, but I wish that there had been some sort of indicator as to level of spice (only the VERY spicy items were marked as such).In every Indian restaurant I have previously eaten, both naan and rice have been included in the dinner, but this was not the case here.  This fact and the desserts are the reason that I would have deducted 1/2 star.As an appetizer, we ordered the Assorted Vegetarian Platter (6) and the Assorted Bread Basket (6).  The vegetarian platter included maybe 10 pieces of various vegetables dipped in a chickpea batter and fried, and included 2 delicious dipping sauces (one containing cilantro, and the other perhaps tamarind).  The bread basket included naan (good) and onion kulcha (FABULOUS).For our entrees, we chose the: -Khazana Tandoor (18) which had chicken, lamb, and shrimp.  I sampled the lamb and chicken, and both were quite tasty.  There was easily enough food here that it could be shared, particularly if you also ordered bread and rice.-Chicken Tikka Masala (13) which was UNREAL.  SO so so so good.  I was going to order something else, and chickened out at the last minute.  I'm glad I did!  Chicken was tender, sauce was perfectly seasoned, with a great mouth feel.  A couple of hours later, I am still thinking, "MAN, that was good!  How can I sneak over there for some tomorrow? lol"-Prawn Pepper Fry (18) Contained both black pepper and spicy peppers (with seeds left in).  I sampled one shrimp before any of the other dishes came, and my lips were still burning 30 minutes later.  I'm kind of a spice weenie, though.  Before it set my mouth on fire, though, I was surprised and impressed by the complexity of flavors in the shrimp.  It was one of those dishes where you taste different levels of flavor, one after the other.  Really good, and I would order it again, if it were not for the heat level.-Some goat thing.  I don't know what it was.  The idea of eating goat creeped me out, and dh ordered it super spicy anyway.  He did say, though, that it did not have a lot of meat, and was mostly bones.  He liked the flavor, but I can't say anything else about it without getting a little weirded out.For dessert, we decided to order 3 different items (which we had NO idea about taste or presentation), and all sample them:-Gulab Jamoon (3) OK.  Kind of like denser doughnut holes with a thin cardamom syrup.  DH took one bite and said it tasted like dish soap, but I didn't mind the flavor as much as the squishiness.  I was thinking that they would be drizzled with the syrup, but they were soaked thoroughly.  -Rasmalai (3) Sort of a denser-than-ricotta cheese square, with cream and nuts on top.  EWWW  It was a grainy, strange texture (2 people mentioned spackle), and the flavor did not agree with any of us.-Qubani Ka Meetha (5) sort of an apricot jam served on vanilla ice cream and topped with nuts-Pretty decent, but not a very large serving for the price, and not very specialRemember that we had never had these dishes.  For all we know, this is exactly how they were supposed to be.  The service was prompt, and our drinks were never long before someone came along to refill them.Overall, we were very happy with the dinners we were served, and agreed that we would eat here again without hesitation.

Restaurant name  Two Hippies Breakfast Joint
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
FINALLY!!!!!!!i had a 30 minute break during work this morning and on my drive down 7th ave i noticed two hippies breakfast joint was officially in business. walked in and the place is HUGE, and unlike their other locations they have places to sit down and eat inside, plus little stools all along the outside.their menu is HUGE and they serve breakfast all day, plus burgers and chicken sandwiches and such.  their breakfast bowls can be made as burritos which is what i did. you can choose up to 6 add-ins including chorizo, bacon, green chile, an assortment of cheeses, garlic, onions, peppers, the list goes on...and it comes with a side of potatoes.  i think they're lacking (besides chorizo and sausage) some kind of shredded meat (like machaca) or chicken for their breakfast burritos..and good hot sauce (the ones on the tables were blah). great friendly service and one free refill on your coffee. place is cash only, and the ATM takes forever. this place is going to be very successful in the future...breakfast all day and bomb breakfast at that.I debated on this rating for awhile, but ultimately decided that I can't bump it up to a three star.  There were just way too many things here that disappointed me.  From the outside, the place is adorable and I love the bright color, it's really inviting.  However, I hate the place inside.  Had the decor been overkill hippie like in the burger place, I could sorta dig it, but this was all just halfway and I don't like a pair of pointy boobies staring down at me from a poster.  I HATED the rolling chairs that bumped into everyone and everything.  The place is entirely too cramped.  A lot of people get their food to go, so there is no reason to have that many tables.  There are just too many obstacles to make this even a semi-comfortable dining experience.False advertising makes me angry and had I come here after 11:30 on the premise that breakfast is served all day, like they advertise, I would have been fuming.  Why call yourself a breakfast joint if I can get a burger all day but not some scrambled eggs?There is way too much crap on the menu and I think that this place could really be much much better if they pared it down to just breakfast bowls and sides.  Practically everyone got one anyway, why slow the line down with messy pancakes and waffles?  Like Glenn said, there should also be little order forms that people can fill out while waiting in line.  Things would go so much smoother from there.Aside from the many many things that irritated me, the food was only okay.  I got the breakfast "bowl" which is a great value, but was left a bit disappointed.  I love being able to choose my own ingredients, so that was cool, but the distribution of ingredients is sporadic.  Some parts of my egg were covered in cheese and bacon, while the mushrooms and sausage were sparsely sprinkled.  I would rather have it even all the way around.  The potatoes tasted okay, but were really greasy and ultimately made me not feel good later in the day.  That brings back the same feeling I got from the uber-greasy magic mushroom burger a while back.  Not good.I probably won't be back unless some dramatic changes are made.  I don't mind waiting in line for food, but I hate waiting a long time after I have ordered.  I also don't understand how a "hippie" place that boasts of using organic ingredients could go and use inefficient, very expensive, not to mention environmentally unfriendly plastic and styrofoam containers.  That's a big boo from me.I am a Two Hippies groupie.  The owner and I are from Buffalo, so it's nice to see the Flutie jersey and memorablia from back home.Starving, after being sick for 4 days, I texted Tony A (@lightrailblog) to meet me for breakfast.  We toyed for a few momets, via text, on where to go.  I hadn't tried this place yet.  I used to live across the street from it and waited, with much anticipation, for it to open.  I waited for three months and finally got to go.Same type of ordering structure as the Beach House and Mushroom Burger places.I chose the bread pudding, fried pickles and of course a breakfast bowl.  You get 3 scrambled eggs and up to 6 toppings of your choice.  All is served over potatoes.  I chose sun-dried tomatoes, spinach, green onions, roasted garlic and monterey jack cheese.Our drinks and bread pudding were ready right away, so we dug in.   The bread pudding was really good, moist, and came with a side of icing.  Perfect starter (or dessert) for breakfast!Our bowls took about 15 minutes.  I knew there would be a wait, because everything was cooked to order.  The place was packed, but at least I had my bread pudding to munch on.  When the dill pickles and bowls were ready, we pigged the F out!  The toast was butter and chewy.  You could tell it was grilled.  Asked for ranch for my pickles and you could tell it was homemade ranch.  This wasn't Hidden Valley Ranch, no siree bob!I'm stuffed.  I have the leftovers in my fridge and can't wait to dig in later.Minus one star for the potatoes.  Not the best; not the worst.  I will definitely be back again, especially since there were hot firemen to stare at during my meal.Two Hippies Breakfast Joint FTW!!!two hippies finally jumped the sharkbandwagoners, please disembarkserve "breakfast" now  (quotation marks)at Two Hippies Breakfast Jointi can tolerate their burgersand I hate to be the baggerwielding keyboard as my daggerbut I need to make my pointbranding brains, have set the barbut kitsch can only go so farand i can only give two starsthough some yelpers still anointhippies as the second comingbut must say, that I was bummingwhen my breakfast burro, runnyegged me past my brekkie point even though you're pretty cheapwould rather pay much more to eatgood food, bisquits & gravy's, beathippies, you disappointlike fonzie, on his water skisjumps shark, a link, so you can seehttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpraJYnbVtEeven ron howard, as richie, c'sthe demarcation pointstick with your burgers, pluck the eggsyour pizza? toss.  also the dregsmore concepts? dudes, i humbly begno! (exclamation point)I went to Two Hippies Breakfast Joint open-minded the other day... I was in the area and jonesing for some healthy but filling breakfast food.  Conveniently located just off 7th Ave between Indian School and Camelback, I pulled in when I saw the place and joined just a handful of other peeps inside.First of all, the ambiance of this place is right on with their name... very hippy like.  Adorning the walls are all kinds of posters including the likes of Grateful Dead, Animal House, Rocky Horror Picture Show, Led Zeppelin, and even one of Bob Marley smoking a big fat jizzoint.  There are also license plates from all over the country, an old school pinball machine, and some bicycles.The staff was super friendly - it's the type of place where you order at the counter and they call your name when your food is ready.  I looked at the menu and debated between doing a breakfast bowl and a bowl of oatmeal with a side of scrambled egg whites.  My decision was made when I was told that indeed the oatmeal is not the instant kind.  And they even served it with soy milk and blueberries per my request.  My dining companion went with a breakfast bowl burrito style and was happy with his order too...The only negative (which I now see is in some of the previous reviews) is that it was disappointing to eat in and have our meals served on styrofoam... not only is it not so enjoyable to eat on styrofoam, but it's very un-hippylike!  It's worth noting that this place has more than just breakfast - they also have burgers, hot dogs, sandwiches, and salads... and they have free soup daily!This place was better than the reviews reflect, especially for the price.  I would definitely return but since it's a bit out of my 3 mile radius, it may not be for awhile.  That should give them enough time to switch out the styrofoam!

I love Taste! It's like my official weekday breakfast spot. I mean where else in uptown can you have a made to order egg white omelet with spinach, mushrooms, tomato's, turkey sausage and Parmesan cheese.....cooked in olive oil?? Absolutely nowhere else folks! Yesiree, this is my spot! My only wish would be that they offer salsa as a condiment because I'm tired of having to walk over to Salsarita's to complete my omelet experience:-) They also offer the real deal steel cut oatmeal with your choice of fruit, walnuts, raisins, cranberries, granola, or brown sugar.......talk about cholesterol friendly........man please!  In my honest opinion, for breakfast it just doesn't get any better than this. Yes, I miss Spratt's dearly, but I have a huge crush on Taste right about now. I won't comment on lunch because I've had hit or miss experiences as it changes often. My review would not be complete without recommending the cupcake area for those stressful days....my favorite is the red velvet with a whipped topping.........to die for!  5 stars for breakfast without a doubt!

Stopped here to grab a bite before my return flight to Vegas.  After browsing the menu for a minute, I decided on the Chicken Philly Sandwich w/Fries and a Blue Moon.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/B1jlDEUrVyPgR4vOMnaiKQ?select=q-ml8IWsnNgvx1CeL1SKGwThe Sandwich came out in a decent amount of time....If I was in a hurry to catch a flight, I would have made it, but I was in no hurry, so I was able to enjoy my food without rushing.  The Chicken had a nice flavor to it, but it was a bit dry for my tastes.  The proportion of Peppers/Onions/Mushrooms/Cheese was appropriate and the flavors complimented each other well.The Fries were excellent.  Cooked just right, they weren't soggy  but slightly crispy, which is how I like it.Overall, it wasn't a bad meal for an Airport joint.  It is a 3.5 Star place rounded down.Return Factor - 65%

Review Text :
18 had been on my sushi radar for quite some time as my wife and I would pass by on Rea Rd. I'm a HUGE sushi fan and am rarely disappointed with the fare just about anywhere. Guess we caught these guys on an off day...We made it in on a Sunday afternoon for lunch. They open at 12:30pm for lunch on Sundays, so a little later than usual for some. We were one of the first couples to make it in and there were only a few warm bodies working the kitchen. The hostess, whom decided that nonverbal communication would suffice, sat us and then stormed away. I'm not too picky with hostesses, but she didn't event greet us? A simple hello and feigned smile would be acceptable. Not the end of the world. Once seated, our server was quick and gave us menus, filled drinks and took our order. Started with tempura veggies and shrimp. All came out very swiftly and were tasty. The soy/hoisin sauce was delightful. Here's were the meal went downhill....Other couples and families started to file in and took up about 8 tables inside and outside. There was only ONE server and the manager. This is a bit unacceptable if you're opening for a 12:30pm lunch. I would understand if it were an earlier lunch, but you should expect a lunch rush....around lunchtime. Just a bit odd. Our drinks remained empty for a good 10 minutes and our sushi took more than 25 minutes to land on our table. I actually watched my sushi plate sit on the counter for a a good 10 minutes before our server picked it up. Once my sushi order was delivered, our server came back and asked if we needed anything...He had completely forgot to enter my wife's sushi order. Not the end of the world, but if the sushi order sheet has two sides, you just have to check both sides. It took an extra 10 minutes for my wife's sushi to arrive. All of the sushi was flavorful and well executed. Just a little put off by the service. I would definitely give 18 Asian another chance. These are just a few problems that can be easily fixed. As a huge sushi fan, and these guys delivered on the flavor front, I look forward to a more memorable visit in the future!

I'm all for a little competition in the crawfish world - but Cajun Crawfish is definitely not up for the challenge.  I was super hesitant with all the negative reviews, but still kept in open mind.It's a large restaurant space with additional seating in the back around the corner with TVs abound  However, it's a pretty sterile environment, blame it on the high ceilings.We started out with two pounds of Crawfish ($9.99/lb) with their House Special seasoning and Medium spice level.  (They have a warning that says their "spicy level is two levels higher than normal".)  The Husband did ask ahead of time if the crawfish was big and fresh, and the waitress said it was.  She also pointed out the tank in the back so we could have a look.  (I did walk over there to take a peek and noticed they had lobster and clams in the tanks too.)  You also get one side of corn and potato for order two pounds or more of crawfish.When our order arrived in a silver bowl, we noticed a difference right away.  This wasn't the way we wanted our crawfish, and that was our mistake.  The Husband asked for some lime, salt and pepper to make a dipping sauce, but that couldn't help this crawfish.  Sure, they were large, but they were also dried out.  There was no head juice to suck out at all.  When you break the head off, you can tell there's something wrong immediately.  And the sauce in the bottom of the bowl is this watered down concoction of something or other.  I don't think it's as fresh as they say it is, the ones in the tank are just for show I think!    The staff were friendly, and really anxious to refill our beverages.  But it couldn't make up for the sad crawfish.  We left after our two pounds and headed up Spring Mountain for Hot N Juicy Crawfish instead.  We didn't order the famous shrimp that gets all the ravings, but did see some on someone else's table, and they were large indeed.  But then again, this restaurant is called Cajun Crawfish, not Cajun Shrimp. I did ask if they had any grand opening specials (especially since other yelpers mentioned it), but we were told they weren't offering them anymore.  However, I did notice an ad offering a discount on beverages just the other day.   Oh well.Overall, Cajun Crawfish doesn't measure up for good crawfish the way I like it.  Sorry.06.07.10 Update!  In a recent magazine article, they are changing their name from Cajun Crawfish to The Crawdaddy Crab House.  Hope that helps with business!

My wife and I came here to use a Groupon we purchased.  We used to come here periodically but haven't been back in years with the proliferation of new restaurants in the area. We were brought iced tea quickly and a basket with some corn muffins and butter.  Our server, Desiree, took our order promptly.  I got a cup of baked potato soup with bacon and chive topping.  It had a lot of cheese mixed in and it was excellent.  It didn't help with my cold much but it was worth the try!For our mains, we each got the 6 ounce filet served with large potato wedges and a ramekin with creamed spinach and some browned cheese on top.  The seasonings on the potato wedges and the steaks were very tasty and the steaks were good like we ordered.  We had the smaller steaks so there was room for dessert.  We should have shared.  They were very large.  My wife got the brownie with ice cream and I got the pecan and chocolate pie.  Both were very good.A few things about the service.  Evidently there's only one person serving at the time we were there and we waited several minutes for someone to come to seat us.  Later, Desiree had to take care of all the tables and our wait for things was longer than need be.  A very pleasant meal in nice surroundings.

Good food. HORRIBLE service! We were a larger party, so they sat us at the little craft table or whatever it was in the market. That's fine. We wanted dinner, so we were okay with that.What wasn't fine was they didn't even clear it off. They left a price gun and a bunch of paperwork on the table. Strike one.We have three different people approach us in the time we placed a drink order, and received our drinks. One member of our party ordered a beer on draft, and they brought him a bottle. I ordered a diet coke, and they brought me a canned diet coke. Not in the mood to pay for multiple cokes, I switched and ordered sweet tea. After waiting FOREVER to get our drinks, we had a different person approach us to take our orders. This time it was a woman, and she did a great job of explaining the specials to us, but when I said I'd like one of them, she told me they were out of it. Okay, so why bother telling me about it? Strike two.Some of us ordered appetizers, and about twenty minutes after we ordered them they arrived. My husband and I had the hummus, and it was delicious. What wasn't awesome is that they give you a decent sized bowl of hummus and like 6 small wedges of pita bread to dip in it. I guess we were supposed to scoop the rest out and eat it with a spoon. Anyways. About 45 minutes AFTER our appetizers, we finally received our meals. Everything was fantastic. I had a delicious mediterranean pizza and my husband's steak was delicious. But this is the part that outraged me. Our waitress was God awful at filling our drinks. Two of us had sweet tea. We asked FOUR times for refills, and we never got them. She kept saying they were brewing fresh tea and she'd bring us some out, but she never did. After they took our plates, we waited about another 30 minutes for the check. Finally, I was at my wits end and asked for a manager. The slow service, I can handle. The crap on the table they sat us at, I can handle. The bringing out a bottled beer when my friend specifically ordered draft, I can handle. But having to ask FOUR times for a refill is outrageous and unacceptable.

My friends and I stopped by Bernard's Bistro for some brunch yesterday. It was a beautiful day out in Lake Las Vegas, so we opted to eat on their patio. The waiter was very nice and even made sure our table stopped wobbling. That was much appreciated. My friend and I couldn't make up our minds between the Marinated Grilled Chicken Breast open faced sandwich, Caesar salad or French onion soup, so we ordered it all and shared. It was so much food! We couldn't even finish half of the sandwich between the two of us. Everything was delicious and the ingredients were very fresh. The sandwich was on sliced French baguette and had grilled chicken breast, cilantro pesto, tomato, avocado and a slice of green olive. I'm not an olive fan, so that went to my friend. I should mention that the sandwich is generally served with their house petite salad, but I asked for Caesar and they were kind enough to substitute it at no additional charge. We both really enjoyed the soup and salad. I'm not a big onion fan, but their version of French onion soup was amazing. It was slightly sweeter than others I've tried, but it was perfect. There was a generous amount of onions, bread and cheese. They even top it with fried onions which added a nice crunchy texture. I highly recommend it! The salad was very fresh and had the perfect amount of dressing. I don't like too much dressing on my salad, so if you do, you may want to ask for extra.  My two other friends shared the Gazpacho and a Tuna Salad sandwich. I tried both and they were also very good! I'm very picky when it comes to tuna salad, so I was pleasantly surprised by theirs. They add balsamic vinaigrette, so that made it taste surprisingly delicious. The Gazpacho was served with avocado and tasted great as well.All in all, this was a great experience. I would definitely stop by again!The smell of fresh bread, The pretty plates, nice painting on the wall.  Escargot was delicious!  Dipped the fresh bread in the escargot sauce so yummy!  Wasn't sure what to order but I chose the salmon. Very light but filling. Food was enjoyable and we had a great date that evening.

Came here with my family for lunch.  It's average.  The Pad Thai ($7.95) was so/so.  It lacked flavor and the noodles had a "spongy" texture.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/s5TJlFtdXcx_tXC4tlttlw?select=OCCiEEum8v0DRHQScPUURwThe Fried Rice was pretty good.  Fresh Veggies and just the right amount of Egg.The Egg Rolls ($2.95) were above average.  Not too oily, crispy, had good flavor.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/s5TJlFtdXcx_tXC4tlttlw?select=kflj_odI0WlvqxVylF1I8QEverything else was just OK.Not worth the drive from Scottsdale to Mesa.Return Factor - 30%My Friday night plans fell through and wound up with my son and his boyfriend and we were starving I asked them if they were up to trying out a new Thai place that we haven't been to yet and they answered back quickly with a yes, let's go!We got their around 8:45pm and the place was sort of emptied out, but it was perfect for us. I also noticed that I got a free Thai Tea for checking in on Yelp! How sweet is that!  For starters we ordered the chicken satay, the chicken was delish and full of flavors, the peanut sauce was amazing! My son and I at the same time said we could bath in the peanut sauce it was that good! Apple doesn't fall far from the tree I guess. But that sauce is amazing! Love it! One ordered the Massaman Curry, mild and that dish looked so very yummy! He said it was delish too! The other one ordered the Chicken Pad Thai mild without bean sprouts and he loved it too!I ordered the Chicken Pad Thai as well, but had my Thai hot baby, bring on the heat I say! I enjoyed the Pad Thai, the noodles where perfectly cooked, the chicken was very tender and so tasty! The pad Thai did come with tofu, which next time I know to have it without tofu but since it was already on my plate I went ahead and tried it out, and well it was flavorless and blubbery, like you would imagine a whale to be. It's not my thing, but I tried :) .My son and I have a favorite little Thai place on the other end of Mesa that we love, but I think Thai Spices just might have knocked them out, can't wait to come back and try the pineapple fried rice of course with chicken!Probably the best Pad See Ew I've ever had, but let's start from the beginning...Immediately upon walking in, I was given... bar none... the most hospitable reception in my short history of dining.  It was comprised of a greeting (including being called by name) and a hug from the cutest little thing, who I had just met.We started off with a chicken satay app, which was accompanied by a creamy peanut sauce and cucumber salad.  Removing the delicious skewered meat from the wooden spears brought me back to days of yore, when I would covertly poke my little sister in the closest appendage, with the sole purpose of evoking a squeal, all the while under the auspices of my no-nonsense parents.My go-to Thai dish is Pad See Ew.  I've seen it spelled differently, but I'm hip.  This dish was one to be savored.... no, to be fawned over and then savored.  Using my meticulous chop-stick skills, I pampered each delicate noodle into my quivering mouth... which evoked blissful visions of lazily floating down the Chao Phraya river... and mind you, I've never even been to Thailand.I'm not saying the dish was laced with opium, but at some point, I do recall fancying a ride atop an Asian Elephant passing through the seven levels of the Candy Cane forest.My lunch companion, Chris, ordered the basil fried rice, which was more akin to an architectural wonder than an entree.  Using his meticulous spoon skills, I witnessed him moving mountains... of succulent rice and fixins... never to be seen again, for at least eight hours.And just when I thought our culinary journey was disembarking, the same vision of loveliness appeared to my right, presenting a showpiece comprised of cake, cream and maraschino cherry.Knowing my chop-sticks would only make a mess of things, I grabbed a spoon.  It had been so long... but it felt good in my hand.  A little cold.  I raised that utensil to the sky, and with an intense bellow, I cried "By the power of GreySkull, I shall have you as my own".  As I started my initial swipe, I noticed Chris had already gotten 2 or 3 bites in during the fanfare.BAM!  The cake was bursting with coconut gusto, or maybe it was the ice cream.  I'm embarrassed to think of what I probably looked like as I descended into that dessert feeding frenzy.I'd like to offer apologies to any staff and/or patron within line of sight.  I don't get out much, and unfortunately whenever my taste buds are stirred up like that, its plain and simple mob mentality.  I cant get in their way!  I wont!After paying the tab, I bid a fond adieu to the huddled kitchen crew, and noticed their horror stricken faces.  The audible syllables "Mujumbo hielan friacah" lilted through the air as I passed... which I believe meant: "Great manly warrior"... no, my bad, wrong dialect... it actually means: "Portly destroyer with awkward shirt cleavage".I look forward to my return visit, where I will exercise self control... or maybe just exerciseHad a pumpkin tofu curry ($7.95) and tried some roaring tiger and Thai boat noodle soup. The pumpkin curry had a thick red curry with perfectly cooked veggies and silken tofu. It was flavorful and just the right amount of spice (I requested medium). The roaring tiger came out in a sizzling platter. The sizzle and smell was amazing! The beef was marinated well. The Thai boat noodle soup was a large portion, with tender beef, rice noodles, and a lovely tasting broth. Service was uneven as we had attentive service initially, but then the waiter forgot to refill drinks and check up on us as the meal progressed. The prices are very reasonable for the quality and quantity of food you get. If you're in the Mekong Plaza area this is a tasty option for Thai!

Question 1. How the hell do people in Montreal stay as thin and svelte as they do with places like Resto La Banquise perpetually having a line?Question 2: How the hell can you have a menu with only about 25 different types of poutine and a few hot dog and hamburger options and perpetually have a line?Question 3: Why hasn't the poutine crazed infested NYC (I know it has been tried in the LES but, really, that's it?).Questions I pondered after waiting in line in the freezing Montreal winter cold for 25 minutes, being cramped at a table for 2 and eating 2 small orders of poutine: one, the classique, the other, the smoked meat with pepper sauce.Surrounded by Quebecoise families (all skinny and French speaking may I add) and tourists alike, this poutinnerie has been deemed best poutine in Montreal. Hmmmm. I wouldn't say that. But, it was solidly good and there is definitely a poutine wow factor with the amazing long list of varieties from Mexican Poutine topped with guac and sour cream to the pizza topped with pepperoni, mushrooms and peppers.I preferred the classique version over the smoked meat and pepper sauce version though having the combo was definitely a smart move. Too much of the same taste would have been old and definitely not worth the calories. The smoked meat however wasn't filled with flavor and was a bit of a let down.In and out in like 30 minutes filled to the brim with delicious gravy covered fries with cheese curds = 4 stars. Worth the wait for the poutine? Hmm, I don't think so. Worth the wait for the tourist factor and feeling part of the local scene and being able to say you've dined here to locals? Yep.So we had to try poutine while in Canada. I already bookmarked this place before getting here and true enough this was one of the places our concierge at the hotel suggested to get some in the city.Before even walking in, I could already smell the thick aroma of grease in the air. What was I thinking, right? Fried food galore! Very hip and casual atmosphere. The place was loud and packed with a younger crowd mostly in groups. Tables are tightly situated right next to each other. We could hear conversations to our left and to our right but that didn't bother us. It was rather amusing. After perusing the menu, I decided to get their POUTINE LA SAVOYARDE: bacon, onions, Swiss cheese, sour cream atop a bed of fries covered in "gravy". Yes, Americans call it that but I hear Canadians prefer to call it "brown sauce". Ok, so it's delicious, but not out of this world amazing. In fact, it's quite overwhelming. Halfway through, I was already forcing it down my throat. It's heavy! No wonder we had people stare at our table when they saw our food. The poutine was only a side dish for my friend and I, while everyone else had it as their main order. And yes, we each had our own poutine! I got the HAMBURGER STEAK as my main entree. This, too was fried and oozing with the goodness of its juices. The patty was well-seasoned...very yummy! I enjoyed this so much more than the poutine.Friendly staff and service. Only complaint was the wait for our food. Others who came after us got their orders before we did. Maybe because we had main entrees and they all got poutines only? I guess... Cash only here with an ATM machine inside but they also accept USD. So thankful for that.Oh and they're open 24/7! Probably because this is good drunk food. Hah!

For my 500th review it had to be good and friends helped me find a great Mexican place that fit the bill.  The chips are hot and the salsa is fresh.   Corn tortillas are the norm!  Chicken tacos are meaty.  The bulls eye for me was the ground beef tacos - lots of flavor!  Simple, no-frills, good food.Plus we had the drink of the day, a cucumber margarita.  I've never tasted anything like it and can't wait to come back.  And to top it all off, the price is right!  Just one more reason to drive through Central Ave more often.

Review Text :
I'm mad now.We've been to Tverskaya three times now, and the food has been excellent each time. The prices are reasonable. On our most recent visit, my fiance and i treated our friends to dinner (see Crystal V.'s review). However, we used a restaurant.com gift certificate, and apparently this was a mistake.Near the end of our meal, our waiter informed us that the mandatory 18% gratuity specified on the gift certificate went directly to restaurant.com instead of the waiter's pocket. In fact, he further explained that this was how restaurant.com was able to offer such steep discounts on their certificates. I conferred with my fiancee, and we both understood this statement to mean that the waiter would be receiving no gratuity unless we left extra. Naturally, we left extra - another $25 on top of the 18%. We received good service and had a lovely meal, so why not?Everything was fine until we got home and my fiancee sent off an email to restaurant.com, who promptly informed us that the waiter receives every penny of the 18% mandatory gratuity. In other words, we just left our waiter a 38% tip because he lied to us.Frankly, I feel a little violated. We have never been shy about tipping, and we were already intending to leave a few extra bucks to make up the difference (we normally calculate 20% and then round up). It is a shame, because I truly enjoy their food and I had a wonderful evening dining with friends. But I can't shake the feeling of being lied to, of being scammed. If you do go to Tverskaya, don't bring a restaurant.com certificate. If you do bring a certificate, be aware that the 18% is going to the waiter, not the website.After this, I'm not sure I'll be going back. There are plenty of other restaurants in town that value my business enough not to try and scam me.

All I asked for was some Asian flavors.  And with Chinese, Korean, and Japanese menu items, I would have assumed this wouldn't be too hard.But I've had better home cooked meals for a ton cheaper.Lettuce wraps-meat was tasty, but it was just plain chicken in plain lettuce...no garnish, or dipping sauce...nothing...most boring wraps ever.Dumpling Soup-Huge portion, flavorless dumplings, flavorless broth.  Simple can be beautiful.  This was not.Seafood Noodle Soup-For being neon red, it was not spicy or particularly flavorful.  The "noodles" were actually cheap spaghetti....really? Were actual Asian noodles of any kind too expensive?  The seafood in it was over cooked and also flavorless.Looks like Asian food, Smells like Asian food.....why doesn't it taste like Asian food?

Review Text :
Well. This is it, Mellow Mushroom. I am breaking up with you. For whatever reason, we just can't seem to hit it off. We started eating in the Happy Valley location but after a long string of back luck we decided to try the take out route.On one occasion eating in, our server went home after taking our order and never brought our food. On another, we waited over an hour after taking our order to get our pizza but when it arrived it was burnt to a crisp (and had the wrong toppings) on several occasions we were seated and it took 20 minutes for someone to even acknowledge us. Call it bad luck or whatever but dining in has never really worked out for whatever reason.Sigh, but now, "take out" isn't even "working out". We've had two incidents of driving to the restaurant at the time we were told to pick up our order and then we had to wait another 20 minutes because it wasn't ready. And on top of that our orders are consistently coming out wrong - and for the prices I'm paying, I deserve better. Originally, what I liked about Mellow Mushroom was that it was a little bit different than other pizza places. Unique pizza and sandwiches, sort of on the expensive side but a nice change of pace. Not outstanding but different. Generally, I have a problem with the service. I've probably visited this location about ten times (and as a former server myself) I have to admit, I've never been to a restaurant in recent memory where the staff is so unprepared or uninterested in what they're doing. From greeters who don't greet, to servers who disappear to food that arrives late (and often wrong) to getting the wrong check from a table of 8 (there were three of us at lunch) - we've just had so much bad luck with this place.Working in a restaurant for years, I know that things happen and I'm willing to forgive and forget. And for Mellow Mushroom, that doesn't seem to matter much. On the last incident where we got the wrong order, no one even apologized. I can forgive mediocre food if the service is excellent but after so many chances, the only consistency I've found here is frustration. I tried. I really tried. But we have to break up. I need to find someone who appreciates me as a customer. If you are interested in the gluten-free pizza or if you enjoy a nice selection of beers, Mellow Mushroom is probably a good option. But at this price range, there are a lot of better options close-by that are less frustrating. I really don't like leaving negative reviews (the last restaurant I wrote one for is now out of business) but I hope Mellow Mushroom can improve and give others a better experience.

Though we intended on going to the smaller late night location, somehow the wrong Yelp click, give me directions led us here.  I have to say I was thrilled with my misclick; the view was spectacular. I haven't had the opportunity to see Downtown with the covered lights and people bustling about; this was definitely the way to do it.Great french fries, my salad was okay, beers were inexpensive, the meatballs looked good, nice empanadas, and a happy full set of tummies for all.Friendly staff, beautiful lofted glass ceiling, separate dimly lit bar, full drink menu, plenty of cozy booths with views, what more could a girl ask for?Date Rating: 4Pick up Scale: N/A (almost empty when we came, it was closing time, great space though has potential).Strong Suggestion: Don't confuse this location with the nearby smaller cozy one; but if it's early and you don't want to wait it's pretty much the same menu.==Vegas Birthday weekend continued==Feb 18th-Feb 21stThe first to arrive in Vegas were the three Chris'. Christian (christiang.yelp.com) Cebo (cbooz.yelp.com) and myself. After getting settled in our room and having a few drinks to start off the trip, we decided to grab a bite to eat here at Firefly. Christian has been here before so he suggested it. Great pick my friend!GOOD:- Various items to choose from. Great menu.- Bar. While waiting for a table, decided to grab a few jack and cokes.-Firefly fries (parmesan, herbs, aioli) Who doesn't love fries!? - Terra y Mare skewers (grilled shrimp, filet mignon, chorizo sausage, salsa verde) Came with 3 skewers. Another good choice.- Fried calamari (spicy gribiche dipping sauce) One of my faves. I mean who can resist deep fried rings that resemble foreskin!? Squeeze some lemon all over and you're set.BAD:- Right when the waiter comes up and asks what we want to drink, this is how the conversation starts:Waiter: "what can I get you fellas to drink?"Dude: "Oh, I like your hair!" (he had an awesome mohawk with designs shaved on the side)Waiter: "oh thank you, I like yours too!"Dude: *looks at his friends* (they are already clowning) "what!? it was the first thing i noticed!"What an awkward way to start the dinner. Nothing wrong with complimenting a guy on his hair. The compliment from the waiter talking about how he likes my hair set up a whole night of ridicule. Yes the "dude" was me and yes the waiter liked my bald head, big deal. UGLY:- Firefly. The name of the place. Had us singing this song all night. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psuRGfAaju4But instead our version sounded like this.You would not believe your eyesIf 100 real buff guyswas the last thing you saw as you fell asleepWhy did we stop and stare? These buff guys are everywhereAre we at excalibur?Oh wells, We don't really careI'd like to make myself believeThat one guy danced slowlyIt's hard to say that I'd rather stayAwake when I'm asleepCause everytime he dances you get weak!'Cause we'd give a thousand hugsHugs from these SD thugsOur hugs are equivalent to turbuLANCEWhy is this in our heads?Maybe we should go to bedPlease don't jump on yelp and start a threadI'd like to make myself believeThat this room is turning slowlyIt's hard to say that I'd rather stayAwake when I'm asleep'Cause everything is never as it seemsWe should go to sleep!!Why did that song come out that way?? After a few drinks, ok maybe after A LOT of drinks and always seeing THUNDER FROM DOWN UNDER ads you know why that came out that way!When you do Vegas with us, be prepared for some great laughs. That's how we do!!Firefly has the coolest dome in part of the restaurant that looks out onto Freemont Street. You can see pretty much the whole thing, and while inside you can also watch the giant TV canopy thing if it's time for the show.Misti Y took me here for dinner on my last night in town and I really enjoyed it. They serve up tapas style foods so we got a ton of small plates to share including the manchego mac and cheese, artichokes hearts on little toasts, lentils and veggies, bacon wrapped dates, and spicy shrimp. All of it was pretty good, but my favorite actually turned out to be the artichoke hearts. I know, I know! Who would have thought compared to manchego macaroni and bacon wrapped anything, artichoke hearts would win, but they did and they were damn good.Firefly also has a pretty decent drink menu including a sparkling sangria cocktail that I ordered. Yes, it's sangria made with sparkling wine. It was chock full of fruit, too and fairly sweet so it you don't like sweet drinks you may want to try something else.

Review Text :
It pains me to lower my rating for Illegal Jack's but it has to be done.I returned here last week for a friends birthday and while I do enjoy the relaxed surroundings, I came away very disappointed.Since my last visit, Jack's have done something which puts them in the same boat as companies like Ryanair. They have started doing 'add on's.' So you look at the menu and think yum, I think I will have a Burrito! That is £6.50. Oh wait, you have to add an extra 75p on to that to put beef in your Burrito. That translates as paying £6.50 for a tortilla with some rice and beans. Not cool. Why can't you just buy a Burrito for £6.50? Why not include the beef in the price? I really don't think a tortilla, rice and beans is worth £6.50. Then the sneaky assistant behind the counter asks if you want sour cream and jalapenos, in the same way that they ask what type of salsa and beans you want. There is no mention at the extra cost. Your £6.50 Burrito quickly turns into costing you £10.10 with a cup of coke. The Burrito is huge, but you quickly realize it is made up of mostly rice and beans with very little beef. It is all rather tasteless and bland and the realization that it cost over a tenner makes it worse. I want to love this place because the idea is brilliant, but I think the prices do not reflect the quality or flavour of the food.Maybe some outrageously good Tex-Mex experiences have made me a little jaded or maybe all the reviews on here made me hope for too much, but this was simply not all that great. Sure, the burritos and quesadillas (the two dishes my wife and I tried) are huge, but the fillings are bland and mushy and adding extra toppings to fix the taste issue will quickly make things even more overpriced.This simply isn't good Tex-Mex. Kudos for trying - the guacamole wasn't bad - but right now, all you'll find here are some lifeless rice, beans, and tortillas wishing for a bit of spice and a whole lot less mush.

The BF and I were driving around trying to find a late night meal somewhere new. There's only a handful of places we rotate past midnight and sometimes you just want to find something else. He remembered from a different Winchells that the garlic mushrooms were good. I love fried mushrooms and indeed these were solid, good flavor and crispy. They normally are on the menu in a appetizer platter, but you can order it solo for $5.99 I think. BF wanted breakfast so he grabbed the chicken fried steak and eggs. The CFS was nice, crunchy and had a decent gravy. The BF said that the home fries was the best he's ever had. Indeed they were nice.  They were perfectly crunchy outside, but inside was fluffy and soft. Sometimes great comes in doing something simple right.I wanted to get a hearty salad so I opted for the Cuvee (spring mix w/ apples, grapes, candied walnuts, smoke gouda, hearts of palm, broiled chicken, champagne vinegrette). It was a really tasty salad that had a bunch of stuff I love. It's the kinda of salad I would put together for myself, but it's like I'd never have all those things on hand to make a hearty salad at home. The chicken was juicy and it was crusted with garlic and herb, ingredients were fresh and it wasn't overtly dressed. Service was decent and friendly. On a random note, sitting by the fish tank was nice since I do like watching stupid fish chase each other around. I've been to two Winchells now. I liked this Winchells better than the one further east on Craig. I think they cooked everything much better at this one so I think I'll come back to this one.

Review Text :
I felt like I was walking into an old man's club. Basically because it was all old men and us four ladies eating breakfast. Apparently old men appreciate a bountiful breakfast, because that's what you get! The servings are incredible! They're massive, so get ready to eat and maybe not eat again that day! I really wanted just a basic breakfast with all the fixins, so I ordered the Bountiful Breakfast: two eggs, home fries, and sweet sausage. I opted to order a chocolate chip pancake instead of having the Italian toast the breakfast came with because you know... I didn't already have enough food!Everything was as expected for a greasy spoon diner. Greasy and good. i thought the pancake was delicious with tons of chocolate chips! And at around $8ish bucks this was a steal!I visited Eggs-R-Us for Sun. brunch this past weekend.  My friend and I were in this part of town to hit Antney's, but we wanted to put some real food in our stomachs before indulging in ice cream.  Eggs-R-Us was the closest place I had bookmarked, so we decided to check it out.  Note that it's a bit hard to find--it's right next to the liquor store in the shopping plaza.Upon walking in, most of the tables were occupied, and the ones that weren't needed to be cleared.  Since nobody greeted us, we went to seat ourselves at a table that was being cleared.  At that point, we were given menus and our order was taken fairly quickly.  However, our order took longer than I expected to prepare (about 30 min.)--to the point that I asked the waitstaff after 20 min. if the cooks had our order.When our food finally came out, my order was incorrect.  I ordered the almost famous breakfast sandwich with home fries ($5.79), but it came with hash browns, instead.  I pointed this out to the waitress, and, fortunately, she quickly rectified it.  The breakfast sandwich was about what I'd expect at a diner, which is fine--except that the eggs were folded unevenly so that part of the sandwich was full of them and part of it had almost none.  The home fries were underseasoned and underwhelming, but the mistaken order of hash browns was much better, so be sure to get hash browns when given the choice.  My friend ordered the bountiful breakfast with hash browns minus the toast ($5.99), and was satisfied with its quality.Overall, my visit to Eggs-R-Us was so-so.  The food, for the most part, was fine, but I was underwhelmed by the service.  In addition to the slowness of order fulfillment and the dirty tables, I had to ask another waitress to refill my water.  I get that Sun. afternoon is a busy time, but getting food out in a reasonable time frame and filling waters a couple of times are basic service expectations.  I wouldn't go out of my way to return, esp. given that I live in the city near the Bloomfield Sandwich Shop, which offers similar food and ambiance with *way* better service.  It is a convenient stop if you need a meal before hitting Antney's, though.

Review Text :
When Jared asked me what I wanted to do for my birthday, my reply was "dinner at Modern Steak."  So, that's exactly what we did... and I couldn't have asked for anything more!We walked in and were immediately impressed with the extremely glamorous atmosphere.  Like, over the top, swanky, cool, but not quite overdone - almost like Vegas decor.  Ruthie was our server and she was fabulous!  I knew exactly what I wanted when I walked in... Jared took awhile longer.  But Ruthie was patient and sweet.  I started with a dirty martini.  Jared ordered a glass of Cabernet a little while later.  We ended up ordering a bunch of stuff and sharing.  Yes, I was the birthday girl, but I did manage to snag a copy of our receipt.  This is what it looked like:-Meris King Crab App - $24-Asparagus - $9-Rst Mushrooms - $10-Ketel One Martini $13-Chopped Salad - $9-Chilean Sea Bass - $$35-G_Manifesto (J's glass of wine) - $12-12 ox Meyers NY Strip - $30----------------------------------------Total before tip - $152.21I loved loved loved the chopped salad... lots of chopped up veggies and the perfect amount of Champagne vinaigrette.  And the beautiful thing about sharing at Modern Steak is that they split everything in the kitchen... and the portion sizes were still quite generous.  The king crab app is served warm and is melt in your mouth delicious but it literally comes in a jar full of a butter sauce so be forewarned.  The mushroom and asparagus sides were amazing also.  I honestly enjoyed every bite! In addition to what is listed on the bill, we enjoyed fresh baked potato and parmesan herb bread... delicious!  And the sea bass was fantastic and the steak was perfectly done per our request.  We skipped desert but ended up having another drink in the bar with friends.What a perfect way to celebrate my birthday!This will for sure be a go-to place for special occasions in the future.  Oh, and if you go, make sure to pay a visit to the rest room - it's adorable!  Lastly, a hidden Yelp tip, courtesy of my dude: "if you buy $100 worth of FRC gift cards, you'll receive $120 worth in return. That is a pretty good immediate return on your money; much better than my stock portfolio... enjoy!"Not just a fan.  A huge fan.  A large Kobe Burger fan.I started my night here, on the dazzling patio, infront of a fireplace, with the game playing on an overheard plasma screen.I was lounging back against the cushioned seats, a pillow providing the ultimate in comfort on each side of me.  And I held a "Jalisco flower" (hornitos anejo tequila, grapefruit, st.Germaine elderdlower, sparkling wine) in hand.Then my entree arrived.  A gorgeous, succulent, flavorful Kobe burger with Parmesan truffle fries, and blue cheese fondue to dip it in.  My tastebuds, my heart, my very soul, melted as I took that first bite.  I was in love by the time I dipped my first fry into the divine bleu cheese fondue.I don't regret my decision to eat a burger this night.  Despite the melange of fabulous and priced to pain steaks such as midwest prime beef, all natural American raised beef, and many seafood entrees.  It was one of the best I had savored in the valley.For the discerning beef eater, there is a featured heart brand akaushi filet for $78, or snake river farms qagyu rib eye for $62. Seafood specialties include maple bacon glazed Scottish salmon, miso glazed Chilean sea bass, and day boat scallops.A la carte sides include mascarpone creamed corn, cauliflower gratin, roasted brussel sprouts, sweet potato purée with burnt marshallows, baked potatoes, and classic man n cheese.My burger was more than enough to satisfy my cravings, but so overjoyed that I had the sweet potato puree.  It was like thanksgiving around a campfire, with s'mores.And if it had not been for my most wonderful dinner partner, I never would have sampled the Incredible lobster chowder.  A seafood party in my mouth.This definitely goes on my list of places to impress your palate, and/or your date.To note:  Perhaps the modern steak craze will die down once it has worn off its nouveau, but currently the place is packed to the rafters with diners, drinkers, and singles on the weekends.  Reservations are a must, four stomachs an even larger imperative.I was very impressed, I must say. This might sound a bit nerdy, but I was pretty excited all weekend to write this review. :-) From what I know of the Fox Restaurants I figured Sam would not fail with this new concept. I heard that the concept behind this one was to create an atmosphere for a steak house that women would feel comfortable in. Thinking about other steak houses they all feel a bit dark and uncomfortable. Anyone can feel comfortable and invited into Modern Steak. It has a very clean, bright and cushy feel. The patio is apparently climate controlled, I was unable to test out this rumor myself, but I believe it. So.... we sit down, the server greeted us in a timely manor, I ordered a black tea and my friend ordered the green tea. Probably some of the best iced tea I have had in a long time. Come to find out that this tea was specially blended for Modern Steak, woot woot, Sam Fox is kind of a big deal I guess. haha Point being, get the black tea, way good! We then checked out the menu, lunch menu as were out and about shopping after recovering from our New Year's hangover from hell, and came to find the prices really weren't all that crazy; $15 for a Kobe beef burger with fries or slaw, $11 for a huge Cobb salad, $11 for a club samy, $23 for a steak, you get the picture. We ended up getting the Cobb salad and the Kobe burger to split. Without us having to ask they split both entrees on to separate plates and bowls for us, AND didn't try to squeeze unnecessary money out of us by charging us a "split plate charge." That made me happy. Both items were fantastic and way more food than the two of us could finish. I will quote my friend (who works at one of the better burger joints in town) as saying "This burger si way better then ours." We were even too full to try any of the desserts that I am sure would have been amazing, speaking from experience at other Fox Restaurants (i.e. the amazing chocolate banana crepes at North). I cannot wait to go back for dinner... at which point I am sure I will need to find a rich date to take me, as the dinner prices/entrees are a bit more than lunch, but that is to be expected. Go check out Modern Steak if you get the chance, it's well worth it!5/13/10Simply amazing!!  Came in, and zeroed in on the two sliders up for sale at $2 each during happy hour.  These were the most-flavorful sliders, offering up the best mouth-feel (due to the aiolis and the focaccia bread they're sandwiched in), I've had in a very long time, possibly ever!  I'm kicking myself as I type this review for not ordering more (I had only one of each)!  The only complaint I had was that service was a complete opposite of what I experienced the first time around (when I had Clayton as my server).  I'd say that the whole time I was at the bar, I probably only spoke to my server (and I mean to say that she only visited and spoke to me) maybe three times- the first to greet and ask me what I wanted (I asked for water and also her suggestions for well drinks, and she didn't have many ideas to give); the second for my order and ticket in a glass ready to close; and the third for other possible selections I might want before closing the ticket.  A total 180 degrees from the excellent service showered on me by Clayton (props to you!).  If I haven't been back to have more of these terrific sliders, I'd have to say it was bec. of the lukewarm service I experienced this afternoon.What initially was a five-star review I must drop down to four.  Maybe next time, I'll be lucky enough to spot Clayton tending bar...Modern Steak screams cool. It just does. The exterior, the interior, the vibe, the colors...everything screams cool. Food: I've tried a variety of food options here yet surprisingly, never the steak.Their burgers are amazing. I know what you're thinking. What's so different about the Modern Steak burger? Well...it's on a sweet and soft roll, it has some great special sauce and the meat is great quality. Their fries are salty and delicious. And how do I even subscribe the chopped salad? Well, chopped it is but it's full of every great veggie on this planet...including avocado. Decor: I could probably hang out at Modern Steak all night and be completely happy. The white and blue accents and the atmosphere makes you feel so fresh and so clean. I heard the decor is copied after the Marie Antoinette movie and I think she'd be very proud. From the lighting to the trendy furniture, it's got an awesome vibe. And the bathrooms. Well gentlemen....when your girl is MIA, before you call the cops, check the bathrooms. Fully equipped with couches, this is the bathroom I wish I could copy and place in my own house. I actually wish I could copy the entire Modern Steak decor for my home. Happy Hour: I don't know how long this is lasting, but right now they are having the most amazing happy hour! $5 drinks and $2 food items. Yes, I said it correctly....two dollars!! An awesome meal and drinks for $10? Yep, that's what you can do at Modern Steak right now! So in summary, this is a great location for a night out with friends, a nice date, if you want to grab some drinks at the trendy bar or you want to relax and lounge of the comfortable patio...you've got to check out Modern Steak!I love the juxtaposition of Modern Steak. A straight forward, steak house type menu in an Elton John over the top decorated space. My goal, one day, is to swing from chandelier to chandelier while chowing on my Kobe burger. Our service was swift, friendly and well...practically perfect. The soft sour cream and chive butter with the foccaccia style bread is a total knockout. I was smearing it on my lips like Carmex. We started with the lobster chowder which was served in these hot metal bowls. Chowder was ok. Not amazing and definitely could have used some seasoning (nutmeg, allspice!?)...lobster was adequate, if not a little chewy. Mac n cheese was also good, but nothing to make me do my Meg Ryan from When Harry Meets Sally impersonation. The Kobe Burger? Total home run! Outstanding. Perfectly cooked. Love the homemade 1,000 island, the applewood bacon...all yummy yummy. As were the fries which were served with a side of ketchup. Missing was the trendy aioli that so many other restaurants seems to offer now. Modern Steak gets a solid 3.5 stars Love the textures and colors and am looking forward to swinging by again soon.not a fan.i truly believe people are tricked by the decor. it really does make you feel cute and happy, but it's like a wolf in sheeps clothing bc the food and service suck. this applies to every fox concept, i've decided. our waiter was a diva, and not in a good way. he rolled his eyes at me several times and all i did was ask for lemon with my water. then i asked for vinegar and oil on the side instead of on my salad. it came on my salad so i asked politley if i could have a new side salad. he got so pissed and grabbed my plate without saying anything. when he returned he just slammed it down in my face. i would have walked out if i wasn't with people. i hate rude servers. then i ordered the kobe burger and it was burnt on the outside.  and it had no flavor. i had to salt and pepper the crap out of it.  last time i pay $17 for a gross burger and rude service, i don't care how effing cute your patio is.Tonight I ate in the dining room of Modern Steak and got another taste of the delicious menu offerings. For the feast we started with a chopped salad, grilled artichoke and roasted winter squash. Each item was delicious and a great way to get our taste buds warmed up for the meal. At first I was hesitant to try the squash since I'm typically not a huge squash fan, but one bite and I lost all former memories! The squash melted in my mouth and was seasoned with a butter and cinnamon spread. I probably could have eaten the entire dish and been satisfied, but on to entrees we went! While my willpower fought between the salmon and burger, I decided to let the salmon part win that night (even though the burger looked so good). The salmon was bacon glazed and placed upon round sweet potatoes. The portion was huge but I found a way to consume half of it which was plenty for me! I did manage to eat all of the sweet potatoes though which were too good to pass up! The waiter was friendly and kept the meal flowing. Bravo Modern Steak![Happy Hour Review]+ 3-6:30PM+ $2 or $2.50 [What??! you ask!] I know, right.+ THE Catch: PRICE PER ITEMWhat has been ORDERED:+ Parmesan Fries with Aioli - $2, Very share-able, comes in a basket, seasoned well and crispy+ Oyster - $2, fresh fresh fresh, comes with lemon, cocktail sauce and hot sauce+ White Shrimp - $2.50 each, more-less mediocre+ Half Market Soup - $2, the great thing about their soup is its really simple yet excellent in taste, had Onion Soup and Mushroom Soup on 2 separate occasions+ Roast Beef Slider - $2, thinly sliced meat, cooked nicely with soft buns and delicious sauce+ Regular Slider - $2, nicely cooked patty, with soft bunsWine - Red, White, Bubbles - $5 per glassThere's a handful of cocktail drinks for $5I recommend sitting at the bar if you want quicker service.  The Happy Hour specials are offered in the Patio area as well.  Just about every time I stop by, there's always room to sit.  Bartenders are friendly and attentive.  For the elegant and vintage-style that offers cheap bites, its a no brainer that Modern Steak does it the BEST.This restaurant is so "pretty."  Reminds me of Vegas restaurants...My boyfriend and I came here for happy hour a couple of times (3-6:30 PM) and we loved it!!  We ordered:-Parmesan fries w/ aioli-$2, large portion, tastes so good and seasoning is on point. Sauce complements the fries great.-Roast beef slider -$2/each, best of the picks for Happy hour, so good and the horseradish is amazing.  Meat was soft and the sweet bread was perfect.-Curry soup - $2/bowl, this was amazing!! We shared this the first time and wanted it again our second visit, but the soup changed.  But the flavors meshed well and tasted like curry in a soup form.  All happy hour food items and drinks were $5 or less, a bargain!!  Wines include reds, whites, and bubbly.  They also have liquor such as Skyy vodka, Cruzan rum, Jim Beam bourbon.Chairs in the patio are red with marble white table tops.  A beautiful design in the ceiling cut out in the patio frames the very hip and trendy outdoor area.  Inside, they have cushioned orange seats and glass, glass, glass everywhere.  It was like I stepped into a design from Architectural Digest.  This restaurant is gorgeous and a great place to have happy hour in Scottsdale.Definitely a must try in my book!

Review Text :
The Skinny: better than your average sandwich shop with a nicer ambience but not much more than that (3), service: we apparently hit the cafe around 1:00 but it still took 10 minutes for us to get our orders down... and we were the first ones in line (2) value: it's not bad - around $6-7 for a decent sandwich however it's not worth the drive to come here and eat. (3).This place obviously caters to the office buildings nearby given it's remote location hidden by the towering adjacent structures. We wandered in while the suits were getting their fix of illy coffee with lunch.First of all, despite it's moniker, this place has nothing to do with baguettes. We ordered two sandwiches - one ham and cheese and one pressed panini with a curry chicken filling.The bread is more of a ciabatta-type affair - a 6 inch loaf with a dense texture and a little mildy unpleasant hard chewy crust. This is not the light centered loaves with the pleasant crust that I was anticipating.The ingredients inside the sandwich were very good - the slices of chicken in the curry sandwich was sufficiently moist and tender while the sauce was pleasant. The ham and cheese sandwich was made with fresh ingredients albeit the bread was only okay for me. I was a little struck by how disorganized the people in the back were - there were three sandwich makers/servers in the back that were looking for direction from the cashier who I believe is the owner. This unfortunately was sufficiently distracting enough (plus he took a phone order in the interim) that it took about 10 minutes for us to place our orders.Yeah - this place serves a better sandwich than your average place but is it something to go back for or drive across town? I'm not so sure. 3 stars.I'm a true night owl at heart and I was so looking forward in trying this place that I literally set my alarm clock to wake up super early to beat the lunch crowd here.The location may seem like a scavenger hunt... if you're coming from Rainbow Blvd., making a right onto W. Sunset Rd., you'll drive up and when you see tall office buildings and shiny reflective windows, you'll know you're almost there.. make a left as soon as you see an entry to go in... stay on the left side of the whole complex and when you see the office building number 8337, it's behind that building and you'll be making a slight right passing it. Baguette Cafe will be next to Bank of America. Hope these directions help in your hunt if you decide to give this cafe a try.I walked in and was greeted right away with a friendly, sweet smile from a gentleman named Olivier. He asked me my name and if I worked in one of the offices nearby and I told him no, but that I stopped by because I wanted to try this cafe. He was happy that I came here and started to passionately talk about what's the specials are today and specifically told me each ingredient that were in those dishes. He was very informative as if he knew everything by heart to the very last seasoning. I love it when you can tell when someone has the "fire" for flavor and food... He enjoyed telling me everything as if he was sharing his favorite recipe with me. All this, while I don't have any makeup on... I know scary right??!?!? It's not even Halloween yet!! Yikes! And he still treated me as if I was his #1 guest. I ended up trying the Prosciutto Baguette which consist of: mixed greens, tomato, prosciutto, salami, blue cheese, walnut, and celery spread. My sandwich and a handful portion of mixed green salad that had a tangy dressing on top of it was plated on a rectangular white glass dish. Olivier brought me some utensils and hope I enjoy my meal. From the first look at this Baguette.. I was afraid the bread would be tougher than leather to chew and harder than rock to break glass.. BUT it wasn't at all the case. It was tough on the outside, since most baguette are made that way and soft in the inside... almost spongy. The bread was good, but I was chewing way more than I ever did when eating a sandwich. I actually woke up the next day with a slight sore jaw, but I remember Olivier mentioning that I can order it Panini- style instead of Baguette. There wasn't anything wrong with the Baguette, as a matter of fact the whole sandwich was satisfying and all the ingredients complimented each other. The celery spread tasted light and fresh with a touch of tartness... it kept me guessing what's in it, but it was a delicious spread that softened the saltiness of the freshly cut prosciutto. The walnuts even made it mellow, in a sense giving it a smooth flavor. The blue cheese wasn't so profound, but you can taste it was there. Overall, I did enjoyed this meal. I washed my palate down with some Green Tea Pomegranate Iced Tea that they served there. It was the bitter kind without having any sugar, but I like it sometimes like that. I bought two muffins on my way out: the Pumpkin and Strawberry. I recall Olivier bringing out a fresh batch of muffins when I first walked in the cafe... they ran out of the Banana Nut Muffin, which I wanted to try, but the Pumpkin Muffin was out of this world delicious! I originally was only going to one bite and start my errands, but it so happens that before I knew it... I did my own magical act and the Pumpkin Muffin disappeared in thin air into my tummy. I know I didn't know I had such talent, but I was still in disbelief that I ate it all in a few seconds. Poof!! Abbra Cudabbra give me another Pumpkin muffin!! :( Sadly I couldn't make it happen and my muffin bag was still empty... darn. I saved the Strawberry Muffin for my date and he asked me if it was still good?!??! Ooo I wanted to hit him upside his head, but no no I'm not a violent person so I told him.. of course it's still good, they made it today!!! What?!? Is he crazy to think I'm going to give him a rotten, spoiled muffin??! Come on! He later told me he ate it for breakfast the next day and it was good. This cafe isn't a fast food order and BAM it comes out in a flash... no siree bob... they make it after you order and use the freshest ingredients. If you have time to relax, then you'll enjoy this place... but if you want something quick... maybe a salad or muffin doesn't take that long... they have a good selection of salads if that's something you are looking for. Fraps, hot chocolate, smoothies too! They have outside seating as well and bring out the food for you when it's ready. They even play catchy, fun even romantic french music.. nice listening pleasure while you grab a bite to eat or wanting to relax over some tea or coffee. Even though it might be challenging to find this cafe, you'll be happy you took the journey to find it.So, this place is pretty much amazing. Everything lives up to par. The food, coffee, and service. It's a small little place hidden in a business complex, but if you're smart enough to find it - then you deserve to eat there !! Think of it as a treasure hunt. If you take the time to find it, you'll be rewarded in the end. The owner, Olivier, is a very friendly man. If it's your first time, he gladly explains almost everything he has on his menu. And what I liked most, is that he takes the time to find out your name and shake your hand. Not many establishments do that. Although he does have a set menu, the soups, quiches, & tarts seem to change almost every day. Plus, I do believe he just has other random food items available each day, so be sure to ask him what he has for the day [though, I'm sure he'll tell you before you get the chance to ask]. I had the chicken curry sandwich, an item not regularly available on his menu. Damn, it was delicious. Good flavored curry, tender chicken, great baguette, plus some fresh herbs and such. I hope he has this on a more regular basis. For you vegetarian and/or vegan folk, he has quite a few options on his menu, and he said he was looking to add more. The croissants there are supposed to be really great. I wish I could confirm this, but unfortunately I'm not a big fan of croissants. They're just too buttery and flaky for my taste [a lot of people judge me for this, but it's OK. =p]. But, I will comment that they did LOOK good. Overall, a great place to meet a friend for lunch. Or get some studying done [ free wifi !]. Plus, with an always changing selection of food, you'll always have a chance to try something new. When you go, be sure and eat a croissant for me.This place is legiznit!It's usually tough for a business to live up to the hype, but I've been on a lucky run lately. Baguette Cafe recently popped up on my radar thanks to some stellar ratings. I'm glad to report that Olivier's humble little joint in an unassuming business park next to the freeway... is all that and a baguette (of chips?).I went there for lunch today. I had read about some amazing soups, so I decided to get a half sandwich and soup combo. For the sandwich, I chose their curry chicken on a baguette. Are you kidding? How could that not be good? But the thing that blew me away was the soup. It was some sort of sweet potato concoction with puréed carrots and some curry spice. It was pretty incredible. In hindsight, that soup was the perfect thing to pair with my sandwich.If there was one thing to complain about, the portions are kind of small. But that's just my American brainwashing speaking. Honestly, the meal satisfied me completely. I will definitely return.Olivier at Baguette is one of the nicest people I've come across in a long time. Seriously, stepping into this casual coffee shop/cafe is like stepping into a friend's welcoming kitchen. Provided of course that you have friends who know how to seriously handle themselves in a kitchen.Misti Y brought me here for a quick lunch and some work time. Free wi-fi is always a plus and Baguette Cafe provides that. But, they also provide a nice, simple meal as well. I tried a combination of the veggie soup and a crunch salad. Each portion was half sized which meant they were perfect together to provide a whole meal.The soup was a cream instead of what I expected (I expected more of a broth with whole vegetables cooled in there), but it was a fantastic flavor. The crunch salad was simple and simply delightful - chock full of jicama, carrots, and other such crunchy veggies.The prices were more than reasonable and if I'm not mistaken you can get a baked good made fresh that day to round out your meal. One note - this is strictly a morning and afternoon spot as I'm fairly certain they close at 5 pm on the weekdays and aren't open on weekends at all.I've had this place on my radar screen for a very long time.  I finally decided to give it a try when I was in the area recently.  The name is kind of misleading.....I was expecting a sit-down restaurant with table service, what I found was a Coffee Shop (a la Starbucks), except it's locally owned.  I was a little disappointed because I had built up a huge appetite and the menu was very limited.After a few minutes I decided to get their Cheese Pannini.  When I arrived, there was only 1 person in front of me, so I thought the service was going to be fast.....it wasn't.  It took almost 15 minutes to make my Paninni.....which for a sit-down restaurant wouldn't be bad, but for an order at the counter type place, it's kind of a long time.  I arrived just before the lunch rush (11:30 am)....while I was waiting, it got very busy with 10 people in line or so.  They are single threaded here with their food preparation, so I can't imagine how long they will have to wait for their food.Anyway, when my food came out, it looked great.  I couldn't wait to take a bite of the Paninni.  It was as good as it looked, very good!http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA?select=iM-bmUJgFX3I3lpLT57uTQhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA?select=E2YbzDiWAomUXZQu3VtjSwThe Tomato Sauce in the Paninni was great and full of flavor.  The Bread was very tasty too.  The Paninni came with a very small side of greens which also went well with the dish.  I wish there were more greens.Overall, it was a good experience.  However, for those with large appetites, I wouldn't suggest it....the portions are too small and ordering two Paninnis wouldn't be cost effective.  The joint is situated between a bunch of office buildings and is suited more for that crowd than a casual diner.  The staff is very nice here and makes a sincere attempt and getting to know their guests.  They asked me what my name was and where I was from, where I heard about the place, etc.....and they knew several of the people who stopped by for lunch by their 1st name....I'm guessing by the way they were dressed that they worked in one of the buildings nearby.Return Factor - 30%If my office was closer I'd eat here nearly everyday (as it is I make the trek 1-2x a week!). Olivier is a fabulous host and seems genuine and passionate about the quality of his food. Yup, it's just a sandwich shop, but I cannot think of a better soup/salad/sandwich spot in town. His food reminds me of eating in a cute cafe in Paris without the price tag! I typically get the Proscuitto salad and one of his yummy soups. They change daily and have yet to disappoint. The cream of mushroom was the best cream of mushroom I've ever had. I look forward to trying more of them every time I go. My favorite new addition to the menu is the FRESH Thai coconuts !! I adore coconut water so getting the chance to drink out of a fresh coconut from Thailand on my lunch break is a major treat.I won't deduct any stars for this, but it's a major bummer there is never any quiche when I go at lunch. Apparently it sells out at breakfast. I keep crossing my fingers and hoping he'll have some at lunch time someday!!  The selection of baked type things is relatively limited in general, but I appreciate that they make the baked good fresh so it's hard to have a huge variety on hand at a small restaurant. I adore Baguette Cafe because there is decidedly nothing Vegas about it. Fresh healthy DELICIOUS foods served by a charming owner - I've found my favorite lunch spot in Vegas.Wow!  Yelp comes through again!  I've driven past this place on the 215 quite a few times but couldn't be bothered to figure out how to get to it.  Then I had a meeting in a very confusing office complex off of West Sunset and, viola, there it is!  I had to try it.It was breakfast time so I got the omelet sandwich in a freshly baked croissant and a funky monkey blended drink, which is a mocha drink with banana.  They even did it decaf!  The funky monkey was delicious and the omelet was a nice surprise.  Spinach, a variety of flavorful cheeses, extremely yummy.I love that the owners speak to each other in French.  Gives the place a certain je nais se quoi, you know what I mean?  I'll definitely be going out of my way to visit this place again.Before I write this review, I have to mention that Paolo D. said this place was "legiznit"I have to say that I agree with most of the Yelpers, this place is pretty awesome.  I'm not going to go on about the food, because everyone has pretty much summed it up.  But one thing that I am surprised that no one has mentioned are the prices.  I had been complaining a lot lately that I couldn't get a decent sandwich without spending over 10 bucks.  This place is different, you can get one for around 6 bucks, which is great.  And if you're afraid like me that you won't get full, get a decent sized salad or soup for another 3ish bucks.  But this is a perfect lunch spot on a work day.  The food is legiznit (did I just say that??)  The portions aren't huge where you're going to be in a food coma, and you're not going to spend your life savings.  What a deal huh?if you're staying near the strip, baguette cafe can be a little bit of a drive...especially bc there's a lot of construction going on and you WILL get lost...even with a nav...give yourself about 45 minutes or so to get to the restaurant...that being said, you will not be disappointed...chicken panini, celery root soup, and toasted baguettehttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA?select=N_KsuGRY32M3FQg9f3ToGAchicken panini with chipotle saucehttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA?select=REXaEwWwSSxtp44mGvmNMQcelery root souphttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA?select=VfiJkKgaJL9cTLgEf5oFMAthe sandwich and soup were delicious...the only reason baguette cafe doesn't get a fifth star is bc the service can be a bit slow even when they are not that busy...it probably took at least 30 minutes for everything to come out..i would still go back for the food...and to hear olivier (the owner) talk in his french accent...Merci BC!I finally got to visit BC now that I live 4 miles away! :) My bestie Jenny C and I really enjoyed our visit here.I had the breakfast combo and paid extra to change it to a carmel macchiato and croissant. I paid a total of $8 :)))Oliver was nice--- asked for my name-- brought out my food and even water for my puppy.We sat outside with our dogs and I enjoyed free wifi!I'm excited to come back and try out more things on the menu!I love Paris... french food... and cafes... so Baguette Cafe really hit my yummy spot!Love it here!-Miss Yelp 2012WHO: Anyone you want to take on a lunch date ;) *nudge nudgeWHEN: Monday through Friday from 7am-5pm.WHERE: On Sunset & Durango, close to the corporate buildings.WHY: For their tasty French baguettes.WHAT: My best friend and I decided we needed to have lunch. And since I had heard such great reviews about this place, we decided to go and try it out.First thing's first, I love Olivier!! Anything he said, I believed! And because he said the Yellow Curry baguette was one I should try, TRY is what I did. And yes, Olivier does it again! Such a great sandwich, with a touch of spice, and a cup of tomato basil soup... This had to be the best lunch I've ever had!Olivier charmed my friend into trying the Moroccan baguette (which I will have to try next time), and she also fell in love with how well-made the sandwich was.For dessert, we tried the newly made Peach Tart, which was UHHMAAYYYZIINNNGGGG! It was not too sweet, and just the right amount for both of us.I'd love to go back and try some of their other baguettes and pastries SOONER THAN LATER. In the meantime, check it out for brunch & tell me how much you LOVE the yellow curry baguette 8).This is the best find I have found on YELP. I LOVE this place and can't wait to go back! I was bummed it's closed on the weekend because I wanted to take friends that can't get out during a weekday. Their (working friends) loss. The location is obscure but the food is INCREDIBLE. I love the diverse delicious menu options. I especially love knowing it's locally owned and operated by family. I can't wait to try different things. I had the Eggplant panini w/ prosciutto ~ toasted. It was so good I knew I would be back after the first bite. PROS:Eggplant panini with prosciuttoChicken Pesto sandwich (black board special)Velouté of mushroom soupCHOCOLATE TWISTFresh innovative foodLocally owned and operatedPrices are lowCONS:Only open on the weekdays.I've had BG bookmarked for a long time and now that I've been I am a big fan.  One of the first things I noticed was the very enthusiastic owner who seemed so excited about his food and everything.  That is one of my favorite traits of an owner, when they are excited about their food and excited about the people are going eat their food. The line was almost out the door and I could hear the excitement from right at the door.  Which is always a good sign.  I think we all ordered the Bosc!? Bosk!? Bosq!? however you spelt it it's all sounds at least 6 of us maybe 10 just because how he explained what went inside.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/baguette-cafe-las-vegas-2?select=5LkJ582csgxifnT_0pTL1A#5LkJ582csgxifnT_0pTL1A It wasn't on the menu but ask for it you're going to enjoy it. It was delicious.  I also picked up a green tea frappe.  Just trying to stay cool.Everything they made looked and smelt so good. I wanted everything.  They made sandwiches, pastries, soups, salads, frappes, and coffee drinks.  Items are reasonably prices. It was very busy during a mid week lunch and the seats filled up.  There are more seats outside in front and if you're lucky some in the shade of a tree. I was fine with eating outside even though it was hot there was a nice breeze. I have their quiche and their other sandwiches on my radar.  I'm just going to work my way through everyone's pictures. I'll be here more often.I had heard so many good things about this place I was excited to finally get the opportunity to try it! The menu is small but don't be discouraged, I heard a lot about the Chicken Curry Sandwich but it was no where to be found on the menu. We asked and we received. My husband got the Bleu and Brie Panini, had chicken, Brie, blue cheese, walnuts, celery, and mustard spread. It was good, he loved it. But I thought my Chicken Curry Sandwich was better. I can't wait it get it again. The baguettes the sandwiches are made with are perfect. The cafe is small and at 3pm it was almost full. The staff was friendly and tried to get to know everyone that came in. Prices are worthy of the quality.I'm looking forward to try one of their soups and dessert!Tucked into the corner of a business complex, Baguette Cafe may be a little difficult to find (even with the maps posted on Yelp)  but well worth the search. It is a small, cozy spot that gets rather busy during the lunch hour. I met Christie O. for lunch recently, at 11 am there was ample seating to choose from but within the hour, every seat inside was taken and there were even some patrons seated outside. Baguette Cafe is owned by an amazingly friendly and highly skilled chef named Olivier. He was in back when we arrived, but we received very friendly service from the sweet employee manning the counter... and Olivier came out a little later to say hello and ensure everything was to our liking. What a charmer that man is!Baguette Cafe is serving up BIG time taste at really inexpensive prices... My lunch was a half a sandwich (tuna salad), a cup of soup (cream of sweet potato) and a large iced tea, and it cost under $10! The soup was lick-the-cup delicious and the baguette that the sandwich came on was perfectly chewy without being hard. The portions are not huge, but for me it was the perfect amount of food. While I am not vegan, it is always nice to see places that care enough to offer up vegan selections for those that are. Most menu items can be altered to accommodate different dietary requests. I definitely look forward to another lunch at Baguette Cafe, and I think the next time I go in, I will have to try some of the baked desserts Christie and others have raved about!I've had this bookmarked for a while and realized it was closed weekends. Now that our days off are weekdays and our friends who have the same day off as us live in the SW, it was time to finally check something off my list that has been sitting there, patiently, for years. We were gonna order off the menu until we were told the two specialty sandwiches. There was a yellow curry chicken sandwich and a moroccan sandwich that had north african spices, goat cheese, red bellpepper, etc. Both sandwiches were great sounding so we chose those. I liked the moroccan a bit more, but only because Im a sucker for those flavors combos. The bread was nice, good balance of crusty and softer bready center. Got the ice tea of the day - green tea citrus gingko which was refreshing. I like places the brew fresh, and brew something a bit more unique that plain black. The service was really friendly - it was the owner of the place at the counter. He was super enthusiastic and caring of his place. They brought out our food outside and came to check on everyone outside which I didn't expect. It is always a nice touch for counter service places to still have some sort of service. I think the price to quality ratio was very good. It seems they use better products with an emphasis on natural, healthy choices and nice to have places not charge a arm to get fresh choices.I can see why people like this as their casual lunch spot. I think there are other similar sandwich and coffee type cafes like these you can compare it to, and this I think this probably ranks top notch among them. I will be back to try more and try a specialty drink next time now that it's near places we frequent.I have had Baguette Cafe bookmarked to try for a while and finally stopped by on my lunch break to try out a sandwich. Baguette Cafe is a bit hard to find the first time. I had trouble locating it since it is nestled with other office buildings, but had the address thanks to yelp and soon found my way. I was impressed with how many tables and chairs there is outside. It was a glorious day out too and many people were eating out there.When it came time for my order, Olivier, one of the owners was glad to go over the different sandwiches with me. I ordered "The Prosciutto" priced at $6.95 and it came on a baguette. The sandwich had prosciutto, salami, mixed greens, tomato, walnuts, celery and blue cheese spread. The sandwich had a good taste, but the bread was tough to chew and rough on my gums. I have been told by other yelpers that getting the sandwich "panini" style isn't so rough on your jaw/mouth, but wanted to try it how it came on the baguette the first time. I also didn't taste any celery and only tasted one bite of blue cheese and felt the sandwich could have had more meat in it to match the rough texture of the bread, but did I did think what was in-between the bread tasted good.  I also kindly asked him if he would do the honor of choosing a dessert for me to have later. The reason I asked him to chose for me is because I would have went with the same ole thing and I'm sure that would have tasted great, but I wanted to try something different. Sure enough, what Olivier picked out was nothing I would have picked on my own and now after having it, I was left craving more.Should you want to cater breakfast or lunch for your office, Baguette Cafe can handle that for you. With the right amount of notice they can deliver and set up the food so call and ask for details. If you are feeling like an omelet, sandwich, wrap, soup, salad, fresh juice or even a latte, they have that too.Go for a sandwich...but don't overlook the soup, every one that I tried was delicious. (Butternut Squash with Ginger this time...amazing! ).And I can't leave without a muffin or 2 for later. My husband loves the real Ginger Soda.Staff is always friendly!  And they are in the process of putting up a better menu on the wall.Gotta love Baguette Cafe!!MLK Day, 2014.  After having just finished a lovely holiday bike ride, I met up with two of my favorite foodie kiddos, Derek and Petra, and their moms since I knew they'd be off, too.  Long a Yelp bookmark, it was finally a great day to dine here since they're closed on the weekends.  After zig-zagging through the parking lot, I found the cafe.  Every table was taken and there was a short line at the register to order.  Thankfully, one party vacated while we were in line, so our party of five could sit down inside.  This place is very popular; after I checked in on Yelp, a plethora of recommendations were thrown my way in the comments section.  I was told to get the soup of the day, no matter what it was.  When I got to the register, Olivier, the friendly proprietor, told me the soups of the day were cream of zucchini with parmesan and cream of roasted pepper, but the latter wasn't ready just yet.  I chose a cup of the zucchini soup with a half of the 3 Cheese sandwich with added turkey for protein.  I spied the croissants behind Olivier and asked for one of those, too.  Petra ate the zucchini soup and Derek munched on a raisin croissant; these kids have good taste and that's why I eat with them a lot.  We all enjoyed our food, including the new acai bowl that's been added to the menu.  There was a steady stream of customers the whole time we were there and, in fact, the line was to the door by the time we left.  Word on the street is that Olivier is opening up another establishment and it will be open on weekends; if that's the case, I will certainly be back more often with the little partners in dine (and their moms).I have to give it to you Vegas Yelpersfor giving this completely hidden gem,that is hella off, off, off, off, the Strip cafe(break out the GPS)the accolades it deeply deserves.I know it's wrongthat I didn't want to post my reviewin order to preserve this secret spot for myself,but, in the end, it didn't matter since300 other Yelpers still found about and yelped it.Anyways,The food here is just absolutely delicious.And the vegan option simply makes it that more special.Sandwiches are made withfreshly baked bread and an eclectic selection of tasty ingredients.The soups are lovingly made from scratchand the freshness and qualityis pretty evident with each wonderful sip.Moreover,Oliver made our visit feel more like going to a friend's home than a cafe.He is warm and inviting, super amicable, and to hear him gush about the food, makes you realize how much love and pride goes into the cooking.I do not give out five stars lightlyand is more rare that I give such a high reviewafter a first visitbut Cafe Baguette is like no other place I've visited before.After reading Dyanna L.'s review of this place, I hit the Bookmark button faster than a fat kid runs to cake (I'm a fat kid and when I see cake, I run exponentially faster at even the whiff of cake). Gathering medical records from various hospitals for myself and my Gammy, she asked if there was a place to grab some food that didn't suck. Knowing that Dyanna and I have similar tastes and FINALLY being able to check it off the bookmark list, I arrived here at Baguette Cafe. I highly recommend using GPS to find this place. It's tucked in with a bunch of medical offices and business buildings.The place has a fast casual environment. A huge portion of the space is occupied by the food prep station, espresso bar, and the kitchen. The space was mostly empty and there were a few patrons enjoying the Spring day outside.The menu is huge and written on a chalkboard, there were a variety of sandwiches, soups, and salads. There were vegan/vegetarian/carnivore options. I talked to the owner, Olivier, and he was knowledgable, answered all my questions, and made me feel welcome.My vegan cream of veggie soup was amazing. A green mush color, but full of flavor and it wasn't overly salty. It was balanced and delicious. I ordered an eggplant sandwich in vegan glory and my grandma got the tuna salad. Both were nice potion sized and excellently prepared. I love when you can taste freshness and that's what was delivered.Baguette Cafe was all that I hoped for and all that I dreamed it to be. I can't wait to find myself in the SW area of town to dine her for a quick, comfy, casual lunch again.ce qui est-il à dire à propos de baguette café?Maybe that it is the greatest cafe in the WORLD!!! MuahahahahahahaAHEM! Anyway, I frequent this lovely cafe as often as I possibly can. My office is only about 4 minutes away. That's very dangerous. Luckily I have a bit of self control and a tight wallet. The owner greets everyone as they walk in and gives each and everyone the attention they deserve when you get to the counter. He will answer any and all questions and never rush you away for the next customer. He knows his regulars very well as each business should. It adds that extra touch of special. Only wish I would have is that they be open one day over the weekend, so that I may bring my family more often.So instead of going through what I have tried, I will just fill you in on my favorite. 99% of the time I go with The Turkey sandwich and I switch out the Swiss for mozzarella. Turkey is always moist and everything is fresh. Caramelized onions are also included on this sandwich. Along side every sandwich is a petite salad with the most delicious dressing. I have yet to figure out exactly what it is. All I know is my mother and I are addicted to it. ADDICTED!! It's like a delicious drug. We also go with a classic black tea which is always brewed to perfection. Occasionally we will do a muffin or cookie, but we have to be extremely hungry. Let me end it this way, I've never had a bad experience here nor have I had anything that was not delicious!Delicious is an understatement!!!!il ya beaucoup de choses merveilleuses à dire sur baguette café!Not every place lives up to the hype.  That said, I find it even rarer for a place to exceed expectations.  Baguette Café has done that for me!Baguette Café is one of the absolute best breakfast/brunch/lunch cafes you will find for the dollar!  Please know that I am way more into savory Items that sweet varieties.  I have a lot of friends that shell out 4 strong stars here for the pastries, but I am so into their savory items!  It's an easy 5 stars in my book.Chef Olivier is one of the nicest and more engaging owners you will meet.  Passionate about food, he takes time with any willing audience to impart a depth of knowledge about the products being used in your meal.  This may not change the way your meal tastes, but it certainly enhances the experience for anyone that remotely cares about what they ingest.  The quiches here might be the best I've had in Vegas...and if not the best, they are certainly in the conversation.  A light and buttery crust gives way to a balanced and scrumptious filling.  Their soups are equally enjoyable.  They change regularly, but are consistently wonderful!  I also have a lot of love for their grilled sandwiches--The Curry, Blue Brie, and Moroccan all worth trying out.  Limited hours prevent some from enjoying Baguette Café, so check out the days and hours of operation before you head over here...but do make a point to stop by and enjoy their offerings!As an insightful reviewer has pointed out, the best way to get there, if you are going west on 215, is to exit Buffalo and take Raphael Rivera.  That way you can avoid the Office Park maze.Owner/Chef Olivier is super friendly and introduced himself as I perused the menu- opted to get two sandwiches to share with my guy (the Eggplant and the Chipotle) along with a cup of the soup of the day (roasted red pepper). Sandwiches were made fresh to order, brought out wrapped up tight and hot to the touch. Wait time was a reasonable ten minutes.Chipotle was delish, with chipotle sauce, chicken, bacon, avocado, and pepper jack cheese- lots of flavor and a tiny bit of kick without too much spice.Eggplant sandwich was better than expected, with fresh-grilled veggie, mozzarella, and tomato pesto, served on a fresh and chewy baguette that held up despite the moisture of the sauces and the ample amount of stuffing in the sandwich itself.Soup was good and clearly homemade- flavorful and creamy without feeling heavy. Cup is a tiny portion, BF inhaled it and I barely got a taste. Didn't expect him to enjoy this flavor but it was gone so fast, he must have! ;)Wish hours were more convenient for early dinners or weekends to visit regularly. TIP: Location can be difficult to find. From Sunset, turn into the office park and wind your way to the very back (towards the highway). Yes, you can get here without being on the 215 access road.A real 4.5-star rating for lil' Baguette Cafe. If you're in the area (or work nearby), there's no better place to pick up a fresh 'wich, salad, or juice. The menu is small, so they don't spread themselves to thin here. That being said, theres something for everyone. Eggs all day, salads (with various greens and meats), pastries and hot & cold sandwiches are all represented. I've yet to hit the pressed sammies, but The Turkey, crispy greens and egg baguette panini (w/ ham added) are enough to have me hooked. Everything tasted fresh and the portion sizes were perfect for lunch.The real knocks here are the location (NOT easy to find from the road. Use the map in the Yelp app) and that the place is a bit small. When the queue reaches 4+ people, you might be waiting outside or right on someone who is eating. Avoid the lunch rush and you're money!I stopped at Baguette Cafe two years ago on a Saturday to find out they were closed on weekends.  With much of their business coming from the office buildings where, they're located, that's probably a goof idea because even though it's along the freeway, it's off the beaten path.There was no line and I ordered a Moroccan sandwich with chicken, one of their grilled sandwich options.  This sandwich can also be made with eggplant for a vegetarian option.  With it, I ordered an iced black tea.I sat at a high top table on the side so I could watch the people do their work at the grill and espresso machine.In a short time, my sandwich and tea were on my table.  The sandwich came with some mixed greens with a little dressing.  The Moroccan is made with goat cheese, roasted tomatoes, roasted red peppers, and is topped with a North African spiced aioli.  The sandwich was quite good and the mixed greens were a perfect amount for a lunch portion with sandwich.  I really liked the North African spiced aioli.  It gave the sandwich a very good flavor.The cafe has a nice area for outdoor eating between the two buildings or in front where it's shaded.  It looked very pleasant but the morning was still cool m so I stayed indoors.I would have tried a pastry but there wasn't much of a selection left.  It looked like the pastry people had come through and bought everything in sight.I do like this place but it really is inconvenient to get to from where I live.  It's a good option if you're in the area.  If you're coming west on the 215, I'd exit at Buffalo and take the frontage road from there to the business park. Going to Durango would involve some backtracking.Friday morning and wanted more than the usual Starbucks run, I finally found this hidden gem tucked in the back of a large business complex when you enter off Sunset.Baguette is a quaint breakfast/lunch spot that caters not just to the surrounding office community but to savvy locals who want good food and a great ambiance.Olivier is welcoming and greets every guest like an old friend. The pastry chef moves about the kitchen bringing out scrumptious treats like tarts, muffins and the fresh baked croissants. These croissants will completely spoil you forever. It would have been a sin not to have one. The warm buttery aroma wafts through the air like a warm blanket for your olfactory senses. Close your eyes, sit at a table bathed in morning sunlight, drink a fresh mango orange juice, then take a bite of heaven.The Croissant & egg omelette was incredible. The omelette is prepared to outstanding culinary standards, the croissant is light, flaky with a thin layer of buttery soft dough that almost melts in your mouth as you take a bite, there is a light tomato basil sauce that elevates it above all other breakfast croissants and it is served with a small house salad so you can have a serving of greens.I am elated to have finally experienced Baguette Cafe and will make this a regular morning ritual at least once a week. "Bon Appetite!"You can't go wrong with a place like this that bakes their own goods, especially a warm buttery croissant like I experienced on my morning visit. I was originally just have a croissant and espresso, but it soon turned into a buttery croissant filled with scrumptious fluffy scramble eggs, Swiss cheese, Black Forest Ham, and with garlic infused mild tomato spread served with a side salad for around $7. The croissant was absolutely heavenly with its flaky exterior and buttery moist center. It came with a filling amount of ham, and the eggs were very well prepared with a soft  fluffiness and spot on seasoning. The Swiss cheese was nicely melted and the tomato spread was just right. Its flavor let you know it was there, but did not overwhelm the croissant breakfast sandwich. A great way to start the day indeed.The side salad was fresh, crisp, and light dressed with a tasty balsamic creamy dressing. The espresso was very smooth but with a rich robust after taste. Best of all, my meal with the coffee was all for under $10. Also service was outstanding and very friendly. When in Vegas, I will be stopping in again.This is a great little cafe/sandwich shop that I discovered through Yelp. The location is a bit out of the way for me and it is located inside an office building complex. We weren't sure if it would be open on that Saturday morning, but I had it bookmarked for a while and it was on the way home back. We were pleasantly surprised to see that it was open, and although adequately filled, there was no unnecessary wait times. If you know me, you know that one of the things I abhor is waiting a ridiculous amount of time for a breakfast joint. They had both inside and outside seating.Upon walking in, we were warmly greeted by Oliver whom I assume is the owner. He was friendly and welcoming, but most importantly appeared extremely passionate about what he was doing. He went over several items that just finished baking and even made a couple of suggestions. Ultimately we settled on the pesto chicken panini and the brie panini with a white mocha coffee. The ingredients were fresh and quality while the portions were fair for the price. I enjoyed the pesto panini especially. The menu is extensive, offering many options for the vegetarian and non vegetarian lifestyles. They had a great selection of breakfast fare including quiche and various croissants.I am excited to come back and try more of their menu.

I am not sure where to start......  After meeting some friends for a bbq my wife suggested that we stop for a few drinks at Augie's.  We arrived about 8:15 and the place was pretty busy.  We found a seat at the bar and ordered a couple of beers and cheese sticks.  I guess they didnt hear our order because we received Pretzels and cheese instead.  Not a big deal but WTF....  They had music playing and a customer who looked somewhat like Jabba the Hut (seriously) wasnt satisfied with the volume turned it up many times and the staff kept turning it down.  This was happening while many families were there trying to enjoy there meals.This bar came complete with a overweight drunk girl that was making her way around the bar and kissing multiple guys and trying to jam her tongue as far down their throat as possible.  She apparently was friends with the young female bartender who continued to watch her and give her shots.  I guess I expect this at other places such as Roman's Oasis but what a treat to see this while enjoying a few beers and Pretzels.  Dont stop reading......  We are just getting to the good part.   I noticed a drunk young guy sitting at the end of the bar.  He had a baseball cap on and his face was very red.  His eyes were closed from time to time while he was waiting for his friends to return.  I could tell he was trashed...  I told my wife to take and look and sure enough when she did, he threw up a little bit on the bar and his hand.  He cleaned it up a bit but just sat there.   I told both the bartenders and they did NOTHING....   A few minuted later he had major projectile vomit at the bar.    I told the manager (who apparently couldnt see what we were watcing) and he went to talk to the customer.  The manager asked him to leave but I guess in not a very forceful way because the customer finished his beer and then left.   The end of our incredible visit was capped off by the following event.  The bartender came and told me that "the guy at the end of the bar wants to buy you a drink".  I asked "does he want to buy me a drink or my wife?".  She stated that he wanted to buy us both a drink.  I told her "no thank you".  My wife went to the restroom shortly after this and "the guy at the end of the bar" followed her.  He returned before she did and came over to talk to me.  He explained that he was a regular at the bar and continued talking to me about a bunch of nonsense and soon I just ignored him until he left.  I am confused why a self proclaimed college student would want to buy us drinks. This place needs help...   I am not sure the owner knows this is going on.  If the owner is the manager I spoke to, then he is in way over his head.   It will not survive.....  If it does, it wont be from me spending money there.

Serene ambiance found at Midori. I joined a few friends here for lunch.  The dining area is large and clean with seating around a sushi counter.  The decor combined with their music is very calming. Service here is great.  They are very polite and so attentive.  Our drinks were refilled often with quick preparation of our meals.  Since it was lunchtime, they offer 9 great bento box specials.  They are all served with miso soup, salad and steamed rice.  The box specials also include your choice of sushi roll.  I had the shrimp tempura (bento D).  This comes with chicken gyoza and my sushi election of shrimp tempura roll.  Delicious! The tempura was light and airy but didn't take anything away from the shrimp.  With a fantastic lunch deal, wonderful food and service, I would recommend stopping in to see why I enjoyed it so much.

I'd always thought knishes were starchy piles, tough on the outside, doughy and potato-y on the inside and only to be eaten when thoroughly hung over. Today, I had my perspective broadened, thanks to Gleiberman's. Buttery potato, zucchini puree surrounded by toasty, light puff-pastry. Wow.This awesome little kosher enclave sits pretty far out off of Providence road, in the Providence Square shopping center. A diner-esque restaurant adjoins the store's space. A deli counter full of classics is to the left as you enter - egg salad, kugel, kosher meats, chopped liver (and today, a huge tray of zucchini-potato knishes. Yum). Aisles full of kosher products, canned, jarred, bagged, boxed. Things I had never seen nor heard of before. Rad.Fridge and freezers full-ish of kosher entrees, cheeses, tofutti, etc. Familiar brands like Tabatchnik and Ba Tampte but many, many others. Kosher wine. Shelves were a little bare- since I had stalked the place via their awesome webpage, I had expected to see more "bounty". Maybe Sunday was to blame.People were smiley to me as I wondered, poking and prodding various wares. The diner's menu, although not extremely veg-friendly, looks interesting enough. For Israeli imports and kosher products (there's a whole freezer full of weird, vegetarian "cutlets") this is the place. Hallah.Note: closed Saturday, open 'till 5 Mon-Thurs, late on Sunday.

Review Text :
As soon as we finished eating here, we drove home, I ran into the house, opened up my laptop to write this review.  That's how sublime this meal at Genaro's was! I have a new obsession...the chicken, plantains and tres leches cake.  Read on, fair Yelper.  Read on. On the outside, the restaurant didn't look too impressive.  Inside, it was super clean and diner-like, complete with a row of stools and a counter to eat at, and a cake case.  (More on the cake case later.) Oh, and the modern white light fixtures make the space look classy!Here's what we had: Passion Fruit Juice: Made in-house and delicious!  Pure passion fruit, no strange pink color.  Just the juice and what I guess is water and sugar.  Chicha Morada: Our server was so awesome, and after we sang the praises of the passion fruit, he brought us little samples of this Peruvian drink.  We were told it's fresh made from corn and fruits and cinnamon.  Sounds strange...looks like wine, but tastes like...a fruity, spiced fall drink.  Really refreshing over ice.  My husband ended up ordering the full-sized one. Shrimp and Avocado Appetizer: Think of a dreamy creamy shrimp salad, scooped into two avocado halves.  Really refreshing and fresh tasting. Served with a hard boiled egg. Peruvian Corn: This corn made me laugh...it looked like a puffed up mutant of a regular ear of corn!  The kernels were ginormous...about the size of a small marble, or Trident White gum. The corn itself is strange in that it doesn't taste like corn...more like a starchy potato.  But it was nice to scoop cheesy sauce over it, and have it as a side.  Genaro's Salad: What's cool about this salad, is the mix of veggies in this salad.  It's got some spring mix and iceberg lettuce, but then beets and some carrots and avocado and cucumber...I think I saw a green bean too.  It comes with this green, I think cilantro dressing, and comes in a taco shell bowl.  What a flavorful mix. Sample Platter (For 2, but could be for 4!): This was HUGE and fantastic.  Forgive me if I forget something, but it included half a rotisserie chicken, 8 ounces of steak, 10 ounces of pork, two different sausages, and two sauces.  The chimmichuri (sp?) is THE BOMB!  I mean fresh, savory flavor explosion!  The chicken is by far the best roast chicken preparation I've ever had.  Juicy and flavorful. My favorite meat.  The pork was very tender too, as was the steak. Cilantro Rice: Great side to go with meat!Plantains: I agree with Victoria S.  The plantains aren't cookie cutter looking, and are fried just right and caramelized.  My husband and friend took down the first order, and got a second plate, they were that yummy. The kicker.  THE TRES LECHES CAKE.  Holy cow.  I dream of this cake and want this as my birthday cake.  Every day.  Yes,  everyday shall be my birthday because of this cake.  My friend Keith was taking a spoonful, and I grabbed my spoon and knocked the cake out from under him and ate it!  (Half jokingly!) The cake is moist, and topped with, yes, a marshmallow like topping, and smothered in another milky condensed milk-like liquid.  It's so purely milky, it's like eating a carton of whole, sweetened, fresh milk.  I'm dying.  I'm dying right now.  The only thing I recommend doing...is ask your server which desserts are made in-house.  Obviously this cake.  However, the chocolate cake, I'm 90% positive looks from Costco.  Our server was great and said the tres leches is the best, so we went with that one.  Every server we encountered here was kind and helpful and made us Peruvian-food virgins feel comfortable and excited about coming back.  Next time, I'm picking up a whole chicken to bring home for dinner!

Restaurant name  Dandelion Market

Review Text :
So, first of all, a couple of disclaimers:1. My only experience with Dandelion Market was on a Saturday night. 2. I am not from Charlotte, so therefore not familiar with the best places to go or neighborhoods to seek out my kind of scene. 3. I do not do well in homogeneous environments. So yeah, I didn't like this place. On the night I was there, it was disgustingly packed. As in, can't turn around, have to elbow people, feel really bad for the short people, feeling claustrophobic kind of crowded. It was insanely uncomfortable, especially because the crowd looked so... Stepford. If J. Crew doesn't make up the majority of your closet, don't expect to find your kind of crowd here. Just so you know. Nothing they can do about that, I feel like it pervades most of Charlotte, but they *can* control the crowds. Even when we went downstairs we found ourselves standing in the entryway just for a little bit of breathing room. They've got a fine beer list but when I asked for a second Two Hearted Ale they made a big deal about changing out the kegs and then proceeded to totally forget about me. I had to flag down another bartender after waiting for 10 minutes, and he poured me one straight up. Not sure what it is about this place that draws in such a large percentage of the city's population, but I think it's safe to say that I don't get it.It takes a lot to make an entire group of people happy. You know what I'm talking about here. We all have that friend that can find a reason to complain about something. Yet, every time I go here... my crew is always happy top to bottom.I have taken part in many a birthday, engagement party and even baby shower at Dandelion Market. Anything from 4 people to more than 30. The most recent: a going away party for a friend. We had a group of about 15 people... many who are very demanding and do not understand the science of service industry. You know the type... they run you to death. Our server was phenomenal. That's the way it is every time.I could write a novel on service. I'm impressed with each visit. Let's move on to food. I have had a little bit of everything on the menu. No complaints about any of it. Some better than others. Here are my pics: Grilled Lamb Lollipops, Sausage Stuffed Poblano Pepper (I get this EVERY time), Southern Caprese, Sweet & Spicy Green Beans, Brussel Sprouts and the Butter Sauteed Sea Scallops. The brunch menu is also pretty good. Bonus: Dando does a Bloody Mary bar.Great beer selection. Good bartenders. A lot of different specials throughout the week. The place is packed on weekend nights.That's Pretty Neat #1: the big wooden table upstairs is attached to a chain-conveyor type contraption. They pull it up to the ceiling after the dinner crowd. Pretty cool to watch.That's Pretty Neat #2: you can order the entire market menu for $275. I haven't had a chance to do this yet, but I think it's such a great concept for a large group.Dandelion is brought to you by the same bar masterminds behind Connolly's, Tyber Creek and Prohibition. Consistency and quality employees are the reasons behind all their success. Keep up the good work guys. Cheers!Great lunch spot. The best grilled cheese in charlotte. Love the tapas menu and the tea options.Very low key style and priced to please. Good lunch for around ten bucks and great service.Note: I recently emailed them about an incident I read about online and they replied with a very satisfactory statement and explanation.

A generous 1.5 stars unfortunately.  The service was good.  The atmosphere was very basic but I don't mind that.The food was just ok and the place had an odd smell that really impacted everything.  If I may depart from plainspoken English for a moment;  olfaction is such an integral part of a gustatory experience that any meal can be significantly negatively impacted by the presence of unpleasant aromas in the environment.As I was eating my eggs, bacon, potatoes and toast and being negatively impacted by the smells around me it occured to me that they are next to an animal hospital and I ate at another restaurant once that was similarly situated and I encountered a similar problem.Hence, note to self:  in the future, take a pass on any restaurant in proximity to an animal hospital.

It's not like I needed any persuasion to come here but KOMP 92.3 was giving away FREE bbq, NHRA race tickets, a $3K bbq grill ,concert,movie and comedy tickets plus  lots more.Entering the shopping center here you can smell the bbq and damn was I hungry. After signing up for the drawing I had to get a full meal.Even though they had a feast at their tent you could grub from. I wanted my own!!Suprisingly there was no wait to be seated and we got the table right next to the fireplace.My son & I decided on the 3 meat combo w/St Louis Ribs,Beef Brisket & Chopped pork. 2 sides come with it so we got their incredible Wilbur Beans & Drunkin Apples. Plus 2 drinks $21!!The service here is great, fast & friendly very helpful and quite entertaining too.So, no suprise the food came out quickly---The chopped pork is the BEST! Smoky,crunchy and so tender & moist. The ribs are great but I like mine dry-rubbed no sauce. The brisket is great but has no crunch and they sauced it too.The sides here are incredible bbq eats. The Wilbur beans are so good with brisket & chopped link in it. The drunkin apples are quite a delight too. Amaretto sauce over tender sliced apples sprinkled with cinnamon.The meal was great-no doggie bag needed here. The service was fun & friendly and the whole atmosphere takes you back to the county fair & bbq cook-offs. The trophies are impressive but the fact the nail it every time out is more impressive. I have tried over 40 bbq place s in Vegas and I still say Dave's is the BEST  !!

I was so sad to see Sugar & Ice had been replaced by Pizza Place at the end of the Esplanade. Before thoroughly scouting the menu, I remember letting out a shrieking "NOOOOOOOO!" in fear I would not be getting my tomato bisque fix. Hungover, starving, and grumpy from a lack of sleep, my heart sunk. Whyyyy?? WHYYYYYYY?!That is...until my friend shook me back into reality, pointed at the menu, and said "SOUP!! TOMATO SOUP!" Hell. Freakin. Yes. A light at the end of a tunnel.$5 for a hearty bowl of blissful cure after a night of drunken debauchery is just what the doctor ordered. Throw on a couple of $2 meatball parmigiana sliders and you've got yourself quite a lunch. This must have been the cheapest lunch I've ever had in Vegas, especially considering this was the Wynn and you're surrounded by nothing but upscale and classy restaurants. It was a bit chilly that day, but I couldn't resist grabbing a seat on the outdoor patio in front of the majestic waterfall. Thank goodness for heating lamps. The food slowly came out (and by slowly, I mean slooooowlyyyy), but alas, everyone received their orders and we began stuffing our faces silly.The sliders were a hit! For $2 a piece, that's practically free in Vegas. Each bite melted into a mushy, meaty, cheesy surprise. I especially loved the bagel-like bread they used. The tomato soup was a generous portion, topped with bits of croutons. I even sprinkled a handful of parmesan cheese for that extra kick. I could die a happy woman after this meal.The pizza was a bit interesting. The Carne (which consisted of pepperoni, sausage, and ham) had one slither of sausage. That's right...a slither. Strange, no? Same with the Meatball pizza. Unless this is a new style of the thin-crusted Italian delicacy, I'd recommend skipping it. They still serve gelato like Sugar & Ice did, but the weather wasn't working in my favor to taste this sweet treat. If you want a comforting and tasteful bite for lunch without having to break your bank, definitely check this place out...and get the sliders! They're amazing. Don't forget to check out the gorgeous view on the patio.Nestled past Dior, Alexander McQueen, and all those Manolos is Pizza Place. Upon first look this place is spacious, clean, and looks like a place you can sit down and really have a great lunch which luckily is exactly what happened. Unfortunately it was a bit too cold out or I would have definitely sat on the patio overlooking the waterfall which obviously contains the best seats in the house on a warm summer day. When you walk in the counter is on the left side, sporting a refrigeration unit full of gelato (if I wasn't so full I would have gotten some!). They currently have a lunch deal where you can get a 12-inch pizza, a salad, and a side for $24.50. Kind of steep, but here's the best part: they have vegan cheese! And it's not Daiya, it's Teese. Now Daiya right now is the #1 vegan cheese since it's soy-free, easy to find, and tastes delicious but damn it if Teese isn't gunning for the top spot. If I could find it in grocery stores like I can with Daiya, it would be a very difficult decision to make. Anywho, we got a veggie vegan pizza (olives, red peppers, baby bella mushrooms, and onion), a house salad, and garlic knots sans cheese & butter. The garlic knots were good, but could stand to be a LOT more garlicky, and 4 of them instead of 3 would have been nice. The marinara that came with it was decent. The salad was alright but a bit small; I didn't like the vinaigrette all that much. But the pizza... oh the pizza. All the toppings tasted SO fresh, especially the mushrooms and the Teese is probably the best cheese substitute I have ever put in my mouth. All Matt could ask is where we could buy some! I wish I could have eaten more of the pizza but 2.5 slices was all I could do. $24.50 isn't so bad for two people to enjoy a meal in a nice environment. We both left pretty satiated. I will definitely be back to have more of that pizza, and maybe give Matt more pizza so I can try some vegan gelato ;)

I've only beeen here once, but the service was bad enough to write about, whether it was a fluke or per usual.Which sucks, because the food was pretty good and the atmoshpere 'like way phun, dude'.   It was neat to see Tommy Chong and his wife in photo on the wall, sitting at a crappy table, enjoying the grub.I also got to reminisce about all the clandestine times I had in this very building when it was a crappy, hole in the wall head shop instead of a crappy hole in the wall sandwich shop, and I was the longhaired leaping gnome tie dyed store manager with my '59 VW panel van parked out front.But all my daydreaming came to an end when I saw Dopey and Grumpy, the two painted and peirced up grrrls they had running the show, put the big Bogart on customer service skills.  (There was no GIVE in their puffpuffgive equation.)The lady that had the misfortune to arrive at the ordering counter a few minutes after I received my Aculpolco Gold BBQ chicken sandwhich was there a full 4 1/2 minutes before placing her order.  The whole time, Dopey was in the back area, doing dishes by the sound of it, while Grumpy stood out behind the counter near the grilling area on a personal cell phone call.  She was yelling, crying, dropping F-bombs, and just bleeding drama, while speaking, come to find out, to her mother.  Never a word or even glance at poor, mousey customer, who also said nothing.  Eventually Dopey came back up front and the order ensued, but while it was being made, everyone in the building got the irie joy of hearing Grumpy repeat back to Dopey everything we'd just heard from the phone call.The owners should put as much effort into having just the right Customer Service as they do into having just the right Look for their staff.   Instead of a Suicide Grrl with crusty hair serving it with bad attitude or indifference, I'd rather have a nerdy, ponytailed, hornrimmed glasses and cardigan wearing book-worm serve me my silly drug-named sandwich with a subtle smile and wink.  As a matter of fact, that sounds kind of sexy...

Review Text :
Heads up, Guy Fieri, while this place shares its very small parking lot with a Shell station, it is no "gas station food"! I just had lunch with Sam. Literally. When I asked where he got his delicious dolmas (grape leaves stuffed with rice and herbs) and he said his wife makes them, the skepticism was on my face. They were perfectly formed and the flavor was intense. He backed it up by showing me his personal lunch from home and sharing it with me to the detriment of the fries in my combo which I was unable to finish after gorging on meat-filled dolmas, stuffed cabbage and squash (none of which are on the menu). And, for the record, his wife's cabbage rolls are AMAZING and should be added, at least , as a special! So, while dining with Sam he explained that he hails from Chicago where he owned and operated a similar establishment and has come to the Valley to join his sisters, one of which owns King Gyros (http://www.yelp.com/biz/king-gyros-phoenix#hrid:66ywkbFKsg_1IA03dK_JSg/src:search/query:king%20gyro) which boasts its own 4 star Yelp rating after 16 reviews. Besides the dolmas ($3.95 for 6) and some of Sam's lunch from home, I enjoyed a falafel pita combo ($5.99). A lot of times falafel, similar to meatballs but made from ground chickpeas, is dry and demands the accompanying tahini sauce and then tastes of nothing but sesame paste (blech!), but this falafel is moist and flavorful. Sam serves it with tzatziki sauce instead of tahini and since I can't stand tahini anyway, this is a bonus for me! I also tasted my friend's gyros which was ginormous! He ate half, if that, and was bringing the rest home -- the pita was overflowing with moist, well seasoned meat. I'm not a hot dog girl, as I've mentioned before, but Sam is very proud of his all beef Chicago dog ($1.99) which he cooks on the grill; still, an Italian sausage ($3.25) is more my speed. Without a doubt, I'll be back to Sam's!P.S. The fries were hot and delicious and had a yummy seasoning sprinkled on them. :)So this place is really good. Gyro, stuffed with meat, tender yummy meat, plenty of sauce, soft warm pita. Onion and tomato Frys, hot, fresh, seasoned and plenty of them. Service, as expected... Excellent. I love when people ask how it is. Location, next to NOT IN a gas station on the south east side of the road.

"Adios"I came here for the last time today. A shame really, since it's only a mile from my house. I've had ongoing bad service from one particular bartender who always seems to be there when I come in. Just when I think I have her shift schedule down pat so as to avoid her it changes.Today she messed up my margarita order and still insisted on charging me even though it was totally wrong. I didn't even drink a fourth of it. A time prior she called me a "degenerate gambler" after seeing me put money into a video poker machine for the first time ever in this place. I criticized her for something(can't remember what) and she told me I was overly sensitive. Then she mentioned to me later that her mother was sick and I gave her a blank stare and said: "Do you see me being sensitive now?"Sheesh.I used to come here two or three times a week since it's close and often ate here as well. On average, I would say I dropped over 300 bucks a month here. Apparently, that wasn't enough for politeness from her.Anyway, I'm not going to keep relearning her schedule. It's easier to just not go back.So a little while ago I left the last money I'll ever spend there in the hands of the barmaid who forced me to find another hangout. No matter, I thought. There are plenty of other places around.And out the door I went.

Restaurant name  Tortilla Flat Superstition Saloon
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Tortilla Flat is the kind of place you take out-of-towners when they're grating on your nerves and you threaten to leave them there unless they pull their act together. It's also a fun place to take out-of-towners and claim they have the best Mexican food in the state, only to see their disappointment when you get the Grande Nachos. Speaking of that restaurant, that's the best place to take MJB, hand her a red pen and their menu/newspaper and say "Go for it, baby. I found 14 grammatical errors above the fold." Okay. So that last one makes me appear to be an elitist, egotistical, insensitive prick. On a serious note, Tortilla Flat is a great place to take someone (or yourself) after Canyon Lake. It's only a few minutes away and is such a quaint locale. The dollars on the restaurant walls are enough for the trip. Walking along the river and seeing the power of water over stone is another reason. And feeling the sand that's been washed down is spectacular. (I have a sand collection of my travels and those of my friends, so sand in alcohol bottles means something deep to me...I just didn't have an empty bottle this time.) The food isn't great, but the staff are all characters and isn't that what a town of six permanent residents is all about??I don't know about anyone else, but to me, this place seems sort of doomed. Based on the history lesson we learned in the tiny museum shack, Tortilla Flat has burned down or been destroyed somehow about 3 or 4 times. Consider the fact that it was supposedly started by a no-good, ragamuffin, low-down dirty thief/murderer who lost his booty somewhere out in the desert, maybe it wasn't meant to last this long. But this is America! We can keep anything alive and running if it earns enough money! Hallelujah, praise the sweet Baby Jesus!According to some mathematical equation, they've estimated that the saloon/restaurant has over $80,000 in single dollar bills stapled to the walls, kindly donated by tourists and lookie-loo's from Round the World. The town itself was most recently purchased by some company for over 1.3 million dollars. It was originally purchased for $11,000. As of today in the Year of Our Lord 2013, the great attraction of Tortilla Flat is the burger in the restaurant, the live music in the saloon (only part of the year) and the Prickly Pear Gelato in the ice cream parlor (which you can't taste before you buy). It also doesn't hurt that the drive there is quite beautiful. We did it on a motorcycle and had a grand old time swooping around the curves and passing elderly out-of-towners in their comfortable SUVs. Might as well do it once if you live here, but I'm not sure I would recommend it to visiting Snow Birds.

Restaurant name  Chart House
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
I really liked the ambiance of the Chart House.  From our comfortable, contemporary booth unusual looking fish swirled about before our eyes in a large and tall tube-type aquarium while we dined.  The place was sleek and modern, beginning with two 6-foot hostesses in black miniskirts, appearing much like human bookends, who confirmed our reservation and gave us a friendly greeting when we arrived.  The aqua floor upon entry looked like water, which added to the sea mystique.Our first dish was dramatic, with a nice presentation of true meaty jumbo shrimp that were shooting off steam from dry ice.  A complimentary bread basket was small, but it was ample for 2 diners, and contained good brown and white bread, as well as tasty rolls.  New England Clam Chowder was good but unusually crunchy from celery, while Diane dealt with a Lobster Bisque that was rather heavy on the brandy.  Sauteed Mushrooms were juicy, and this side was very large and lasted all the way to dessert, but the sauce on the sizzling skillet was not that tasty.  However, a lovely chopped Spinach Salad with egg, mushrooms, and red onion was.  What I particularly liked about this dish is that the various parts were presented in side by side fields of color: a column of yellow egg placed next to a column of green lettuce, and so forth.  Then it was left up to the diner to toss all ingredients and the fine dressing together as desired, which I found to be fun rather than an annoyance.I then enjoyed a good pan-fried pink Salmon enhanced by a blanket of crisp prosciutto, while Diane ultimately enjoyed  very tasty Stuffed Flounder.  I know, because I tried it too!  But, the Flounder that was originally brought to the table had to be sent back, because the first batch was too spicy for my spouse's delicate palate.  I appreciated that the request for a less spicy breaded Flounder was cheerfully accommodated, and although it took awhile for a new entree to be cooked, the manager personally brought out the replacement, and it was made just as requested.  We also shared a side of great Yukon Gold Mashed Potatoes, and I had fine Green Beans presented on my plate.Our dessert of a Chocolate Souffle that had properly risen was good but not what we expected to receive.  It was real airy--more like a tasty meringue than a sumptuous souffle.Service was impeccable!  It was attentive, and there was not one service error by our very competent female server.  In fact, the worst thing that occurred happened days after the meal when all photos of the food but one were lost in a failed effort to store them in a backup drive.  Hence, the single photo that appears with this review.  But at least that photo was taken just after a slew of dishes had been placed on the table.  This was the first and only time my photos for a Yelp review were totally lost before they were loaded on the restaurant's site.  May it be the last!Chart House was never on my radar.  I used Yelp to find a place to have dinner before the book club meeting and up popped Chart House.  It turns out that I've walked by it a number of times and never knew it was a restaurant.  I only thought it was a bar/lounge.  But, behind that large fish tank is another side and that's where the restaurant is.I was seated promptly right along the glass of the fish tank.  It's a great place to sit because you are almost constantly watching the fish swim when you're not eating--eating seafood even.  I wonder if anyone would like an enclosed, sealed calf range in a steak house.  My server was Haley and she was good.  She took my order after answering a few questions.  I was brought my iced tea (blackberry, bottled Republic of Tea) and a runner brought some bread and butter.  The bread was OK.  The rye roll was good.  It was brought warm.  The flat bread, soda wafers were quite dry and not as good.For a started, I ordered the ménage soup.  It's a trio of small cups of their three soups--lobster bisque, gazpacho, and clam chowder.  The gazpacho was hands down the best.  The clam chowder was good.  The lobster bisque was average.For the main course, I got their spicy yellowfin ahi served with a ginger soy sauce and wasabi cream and accompanied by wasabi mashed potatoes.  The ahi was cooked very rare--just seared and off the grill.  It was excellent and the wasabi sauce was very good.  The wasabi mashed potatoes were also very good.For dessert, I had ordered the hot chocolate lava cake.  The menu states to leave 30 minutes prep time for specialty desserts and when I was ordering dinner in the beginning, Haley asked me about this.  I ordered the cake then so there'd be plenty of time to make it at the correct time during my meal.The cake was excellent.  Chocolate goodness topped with Heath bar crunch and vanilla ice cream.The meal and service were very good and the fish tank is lots of fun.  It was a hoot watching the people watch the fish.  The tank is 75,000 gallons and has dozens of fish.  Haley told me that a diver is in the tank daily for cleaning and feeding.  The only drawback was that I was at the first table in from the lounge and some of the happy hour people were quite loud when they got some alcohol in them.Using the term "fine dining" here is a bit of stretch. The service here was lackluster to say the least, but the food was good enough to keep me in high spirits. I brought my family here for a little Valentine's Day late afternoon lunch. When we showed up, the place was empty. Literally, we were the only people sitting in the restaurant which was a little awkward. We were sat promptly and we immediately were in awe of the enormous fish tank. This floor to ceiling is an aquarium lovers wet dream is amazing, ha! It's placed right in the middle of the restaurant and gives diners a great place to rest their eyes and thoughts during lulls in dinner conversation.We ordered apps and drinks and so far so good. A bottle of wine for the table and I opted for Moscow Mule. It was ok, a little heavy on the ginger beer and light on the vodka. I prefer it the other way around. The apps were amazing; the Kim Chee Calamari was like crack, I would smoke it if allowed. The Kim Chee added that vinegar flavor that went great with lightly fried calamari. There fried veggies and a amazing sauce that accompanied this dish. I highly recommend ordering this dish, but be ready to share because this plate of food is huge! We also ordered the Coconut Crunchy Shrimp and these were great. A little outshined after the Kim Chee dish, but still very good. The shrimp was still juicy and not over cooked and the coconut breading was light and just a tad sweet. Yummers. At this point in the meal we were all talking, plates were licked clean, and starting to stack up. Just as the restaurant was just starting to get busy our soup and salads were arriving, so you'd think the server would remove the plates that were stacked up, but nope, they stayed on the table. After salads and soups were finished (BTW - Lobster Bisque was quite delicious) this new set of plates and bowls were now added to already decent pile of tableware. There were five of us, so lets do that math... 5 plates for apps + 2 bowls of soup + 2 large salad plates + 2 bread baskets + 5 bread plates +1 bottle of wine + 3 wine glasses + 2 cocktail glasses, and a partridge in a pear tree. That's about 23 items on a table, half of which were dirty and no longer being used. Now, in a normal fine dining restaurant, these items would be cleared immediately and the table would be re-dressed with silverware and napkins. This did not happen. The main course showed up and the food runners realized there was absolutely no space for anything on the table. They placed our food off to the side and cleared the table, this took about three minutes. This just shows the amount of stuff that had piled up. Finally, the table is cleared and the food is delivered. I'll mainly focus on my meal, but I did try a little bit of everyone's and it all was very good. I ordered the Stuffed Flounder: Crab-stuffed with lemon shallot butter and Yukon Gold mashed potatoes. This was delicious, the flounder was perfectly cooked. The tender fish was juicy and just flaked apart when cut into with my fork. The crab was a like an amazing edible surprise, that I had forgot about it until it poured out on to the plate. This plate was not only gorgeous, but a giant seafood flavor bomb. The carb lovers side dish was the beautiful golden mashed potatoes. Buttery, creamy goodness! To close out the meal we tried their dessert specials... Hot Chocolate Lava Cake and Chart House Souffle. These were both meh, but I'm not a sweet person. So don't take my word for it. Wow. I feel like I just had a brain baby with this review. Even though the service was weak, The Chart House's food is stellar and definitely worth the price.  FOODIE NOTE: The food prices here almost triple once the lunch menu is done being served. So, if you're a baller on budget you might want to lunch it up.Some people come to enjoy their huge aquarium. We came to escape the Downtown madness...oh, and the food!I frequented the Chart House on Oahu many times. I had fond memories of their happy hour, great view, and amazing food. I did learn that many of them are now Landry's, including the one here in Vegas. However, upon viewing the menu, I was happy to see it was similar to the Chart House menu I remember. I was very happy to have included a meal here during my Downtown staycation for Valentine's weekend this year. Here's what our table had to eat, devoured is more like it!Kim Chee CalamariSpanish Blues MusselsFilet MignonLobster TailTour de ShrimpChocolate Lava Cake. Ordered. Got full. Vowed to attempt next visit!The food was great. Kim Chee Calamari was recommended to us, it's very different than your typical calamari appetizer, but delicious! I would probably pass on the mussels, it was prepared well but nothing spectacular. My boyfriend enjoyed his perfectly cooked filet, but noted that the 4oz lobster tail add-on wasn't worth the price. My favorite shrimp preparation for my Tour de Shrimp entree was with the cedar plank chimichurri. As you can imagine, this was a classic case of "Your eyes are bigger than your stomachs." We had pre-ordered the Chocolate Lava Cake (takes about 30mins), however, we didn't come close to having room for it. Leaving with our doggy-bags, we promised to return for dessert another night!I'd have to say that Chart House is more casual than I anticipated. I wouldn't choose it for a romantic night, I'm not sure if it's kid-friendly, but definitely a great choice for dinner with friends and family. Last but not least, we had the pleasure of having one of the best servers ever, Valerie. She was amazing! She made great menu recommendations, timely and efficient, great personality, and at the same time, let us have our evening without hovering the table. We didn't think our entrees took a long time to arrive, but she said it had been delayed in the kitchen. The manager came by to apologize for the wait, and Valerie still checked up on us. As we apologized for cancelling our dessert, she was quick to say it was no problem and effortlessly sold it to her other table. We will definitely request Valerie for our next dinner there!Chart House, you fed us well. We will be back!

Review Text :
What has happened to this Nathan's is really sad. A couple years ago it was a separate restaurant that had a New York delicatessen theme that celebrated the Nathan's legacy. Forget the World famous Nathan's hot dogs, because in my opinion their super cheeseburger with the crinkley cut fries was fast food taste up in the fast food stratosphere. The prices were ridiculously high. I accepted that I was on the Strip enjoying a treat that brought me back to being a kid enjoying Nathan's. Then the Nathan's curse took over this location. Bad management is a curse that has destroyed many Nathan's locations leaving them shuttered across the landscape. After they replaced the Nathan's restaurant in Bally's basement with a food court location it has taken a massive nosedive from 3.5 to 1 star.   In the past week, I dined in this Nathan's twice. Before my dad arrived from New York at Bally's for a family staycation, my brother and I dined here. I was disappointed to see the super cheeseburger go just like it did in Arby's years ago. So, I ordered a bacon Philly cheesesteak with the crinkley cut fries. It came out to $17 and change. Nathan's isn't true fast food. There is usually a delay between ordering and pickup. To make up for it, they give you a beeper that goes off when the order is ready.   The bacon Philly cheesesteak is the antithesis of the crinkley cut fries. Where the fries should be inducted into the Fast Food Hall of Fame, the bacon Philly cheese steak should be redesigned. The taste was dull and it appeared that the meat wasn't soft. The bacon was blah.   My dad loves Nathan's food and just like me believes they have a great product with many of the restaurants poorly managed. We would have no idea how bad. He ordered two hot dog with fries dinners and a Philly cheesesteak with fries dinner. And a diet coke and regular Coke. To make a long story short the guy that served us forgot the Coke and the third portion of fries. There are like six combination dinners and the guy fails to realize that the Philly cheesesteak with fries comes with fries. Duh! So, my dad walks up to the counter to explain the error. Instead of being polite and recognizing the order, he tells my dad to go to the back of the line. Obviously we don't want to spend a vacation night waiting on a line for fries and a Coke. I'd walk to the adjacent Subway concession to pick up a fountain drink. Another flaw of this Nathan's is there is an obvious lack of supervision. There were no managers and they obviously threw a Nathan's employee that wears a Pan Asian cap to the wolves. The employees wear a badge with the manager's number (supposedly) that you are to text to see how they are doing. My dad texted him and no response.    I don't like giving one star reviews. However there is a difference between a nice guy and a fool. Hopefully the same supervisor that doesn't read customer's text messages reads Yelp. This kind of service is killing Nathan's. Recently Nathan's has closed restaurants in the Venetian, Arizona Mills, and a couple on Long Island. If this service persists, I see this location going down the same path. As far me I am going down a different path that leads away from this Nathan's. One Star: Boo!

The name says it all. This is one hot bagel shop! This could be one of the best bagel shops I've found in Phoenix and I would have never expected to find it way up in North Scottsdale. This bagel shop is delicious. The bagels are large, hot, soft and extremely delicious. This local eatery has a line out the door on weekends and it's for a reason. The breakfast bagel sandwiches are to-die-for. The cheese, egg and bacon combo sandwiched between a hefty bagel makes it worth waking up early on a Sunday morning! I will be visiting again soon for the deli because I hear that it's a must to stop by and experience their lunch.

- We were there for St. Patty's Day, March 17th     I was introduced to this nicely hidden spot by my best amiga Ly, she suggested their food for our St. Patty's celebration. We had for starters the rolls with the Romaine lettuce and they were pretty tasty after we added some of their hot sauce, and ultra hot as in temperature, both myself and Chris burnt ourselves, but that was our own fault, yes it was funny :) .     The Chicken Pho (Fauh) was great, hot, minty rich flavor and the noodles were well cooked too!!! Such BIG portions though, neither Ly nor myself finished our bowls. But they were OH SOO Delicious.      Thanks for the amazing meal and great time!!

This place has really improved over the last few years, and it's a staple with the folks at the neighboring offices.  I believe they brought in new management a few years ago and it's made a WORLD of difference in both service and quality of food.Unfortunately I'm a fan of fried (yah, I know) popcorn shrimp and Alaskan whitefish, and they prepare both beautifully here, in traditional "fish camp" style.  They really shine at lunch time, where daily specials are around FIVE BUCKS and you get dinner-size portions!  They do have broiled options, but those aren't available as lunch specials (however they're still priced reasonably).  One thing I like about them is that they're flexible.  This means that you don't HAVE to get fries with your meal; you can opt for a baked potato if you prefer and they don't say anything or get confused as some places do.  Or you can get double fries/no hush puppies...whatever works for YOU, not them.I think one of their star options is the "family pack" they offer.  This has got to be one of THE best deals in town, especially when trying to feed a family at dinner.  You get a TON of food for $27 & change (including tax!).   For under thirty dollars you get your choice of TWO seafood options (ie two lbs of baby shrimp and eight pieces of flounder), a very large box of hush puppies, and a very large box of fries or four baked potatoes.  You also get a TUB each of cocktail sauce, tarter sauce and cole slaw.  Plenty of food for a family of 2-4.  OH - you also get a half gallon of tea.Service here is always speedy and friendly as well, and that has a lot to do w/the change in management I believe.  I worked in the neighboring office for many years & for a while a few years ago we actually boycotted them for quite some time BECAUSE of their service.  But now they're wonderful!  Orders are always correct and on time (especially important when time is of the essence), and the employees are always super friendly and accommodating, and seem genuinely interested in making sure your experience is the best it can be.Harbor Inn - a great option for traditional seafood in the University City area.

Review Text :
I like it here!After hearing how great this place was, I had to see for myself.  Happy Hour?  I'm in!  Upon arrival, the first thing I noticed was the open and inviting decor - bamboo floors, high ceilings, a beautiful outdoor patio... what's not to like?  Oh, and ladies, the bar had purse hooks!While Calistro serves "healthy cuisine", please do not translate that to mean "cardboard-esque and tasteless".  Each item we tried was delicious, full of richness and flavor.  I learned that 80% of the ingredients used are organic, and most are from local vendors.  They even have organic vodka.  Did you know that organic vodka existed?  I didn't.  It was a very happy HH, indeed.Flatbread - a wood-fired combination of tomatoes, pesto, basil and fresh mozzarella.  It was much larger than I expected, and the flatbread crust was perfect - even the cheese-less edges which I usually don't eat...Wood Roasted Ravioli - from the Shared Plates section of the dinner menu.  I had never tried a "baked" ravioli and these, prepared in the wood-fired oven, were outstanding!  The filling was a sweet and savory combination that I really enjoyed.Short Rib Panini Sliders - were it not for the bread (which was toasted just right), you would not need to chew.  The braised short ribs are that tender.  Beautiful!Angeline Pinot Noir - a pleasant taste of California wine country (blend of Sonoma, Mendocino & Santa Barbara grapes).  I like Calistro's presentation - the wine is first poured into a small individual carafe and then a portion is poured into your glass - you pour the rest when you are ready.  Maybe it is for aeration, but visually this makes me think I am getting more than one glass - yum!I did make my typical mistake of not leaving any room for dessert (when, oh when will I learn?).  The Chocolate Soufflé Cake the couple next to me had looked amazing.  Darn!We were in North Scottsdale taking photographs of the desert, and ended up close to the Calistro Bistro.  So after all the glowing reviews, we decided to stop in for Happy Hour on a Sunday and give it a try.  Wow, were we impressed.  We were the only ones in the place (except for a bridal shower in the back room), and were asked where we would like to sit.  Being chilled from being outside in the rain, we opted to sit at the seating area where you could view the chef's working, and directly in front of the cooking fire.  We were offered drinks, and since my designated driver doesn't drink, was given a choice of a number of teas.  The one she selected was fabulous (according to her).  I saw that they had Anchor Steam Porter on tap, and I was in heaven,  They have a wide choice of  appetizers on their happy hour menu, and we tried several of them - the pork taco, the fish taco, the flatbread, and the short-rib Panini sliders.  All were delicious.  They were all so appetizing, we couldn't pick a favorite between the fish (salmon) taco, the pork taco, and the flatbread.  The meat in the sliders was fantastic, but the toasted panini  was slightly over browned.I might add that the waitress originally brought us an order of hummus that someone else ordered, and it looked so good, that I thought my wife was going to arm wrestle her  for  it.  She said that the next time we were there, that was going to be one of her choices.I do not give many places 5 stars, but I will on Calistro.  There were so many pluses - allowing us to sit where we wanted (I was impressed that the even allowed us in the way we were dressed), Anchor Steam Porter on tap, delicious food, interesting flavors, lovely décor, and wonderful servers.  All in all, a delightful experience on a cold, windy, rainy day.I had grand expectations for Calistro Bistro! I love farm-to-table. I love the fresh, local food movement. Sadly, it just didn't measure up. A nod to our server, as service was excellent and the "that spicy mango thingy" drink (a Serrano pepper & mango infused tequila margarita) is unique and will please those of you who like cocktails with a bite. But, that's about as good as it got. "Farm-to-table" inspires visions of entrees with crisp, fresh, complex and discernible flavors. Our food reminded me of standard hotel fare. We started with the crab cake and while the crab was very good there was way too much filler. To the extent that I would get whole bites of filler, disappointing my palate with a mealy bready effect. Next, one of each of the street tacos. Both were terribly -- like disgustingly -- greasy. Beware: hold these puppies right over your plate because as you angle them for a bite, a river of taco-seasoning -infused oil will stream out the back. And, the chili-powder flavor didn't do it for me. Finally, the Arctic Char entree: the vegetables and the fish were each overcooked. Though, there was some potential as the cut of fish seemed quality and the veggie selection showed good choices. Besides being overcooked, there was no flavor. None. Nada. :( So, all of this disappointment and $95 later (not including tip), I think it's safe to say I won't be making the trek to Calistro Bistro again.

Restaurant name  Il Vinaio
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
I am so sorry that I have to write such a negative review of this new restaurant, because it's family owned and operated, and clearly trying hard to provide an upscale experience in a less-than-optimal atmosphere.  However, Il Vinaio missed the mark at every given opportunity.I came in for a group event that had been scheduled as a wine tasting with wine samples and a cheese/fruit/nut appetizer included for $15 a head.  When our party arrived, we were informed by our host that a different large party had also booked a wine tasting, and would be sitting in the semi-private area, and would be doing a wine tasting so we could not.  I have yet to receive an explanation on why we could not do our wine tasting simply because another party was doing one simultaneously.  Needless to say, this immediately dampened the mood.Our server, who I gather was the restaurant owner, was pushy with having us order two bottles straightaway, though our entire party had not arrived, instead of by the glass, and this theme continued through the evening.  He continually seemed irritated that we were not ordering as much as he would have liked us to, or that it took us time to decide which dishes to order, etc.  We all agreed that he was a bit snippy, and he didn't provide us much in the way of recommendations.The wine itself was fine, particularly the Schloss Riesling, and the food was decent, as well, with very generous portions.  The cheese plate was good, but it was not impressive that the female owner was not able to tell us what cheeses had been served to us when she came over to ask us how our experience had been.  The cheese plate was the one thing we all raved about and wanted more information on, and all she had to say was, "we serve lots of cheeses and mix it up. I think there was a blue cheese that was made in a cave."  That was disappointing, and I expected much more from an owner.As stated in other reviews, from the outside, it looks like an old Marie Callender's or Furr's Cafeteria or something of that ilk.  Even inside, you can tell that it was once a place that had a buffet, and was clearly built in the early 70's.  However, you can see that effort has gone into revamping it, and it's decent.  Not great, but decent.  At least it has its own parking lot.  It was so disappointing to have our plans changed for us and then to have less-than-stellar service as a result.  We all spent more per person than intended, and did not receive what we had reserved our table for.  The service by both owners did not seem very personalized or knowledgable, and that is the opposite of what I'm looking for when I visit a more upscale wine bistro.  I don't think I'll be back, and it's really too bad.

Hi, first time reviewer, long-time reader.  Yea.  You might be asking yourself what made me get up off my butt and begin to actively participate in this shenanigan we call web 2.0.  Well I'll tell you what.  It's tacos.  More specifically dollar tacos.  EVEN more specifically, the best tacos I've had since a street corner in Veracruz, Mexico.El Casa Grande is an extremely authentic quaint little restaurant on South Blvd.  I can't vouch for their whole menu, but what I can vouch for is there tacos.  Every Tues & Wed they have dollar taco night.  These are the best nights of the week.  The tacos are simple soft-shell tacos with the flour tortilla quickly fried in some butter on the grill so their edges get slightly crisp.  They are then filled with the most delicious, succulent meat possible; all of your choosing of course.  Options include al Pastor (pork), Carnitas (fried pork), Beef (steak), Barbeque Beef (BBQ steak), Chicken (chicken), and Ground beef (you guessed it).  They then get topped with cilantro and diced onion.  They are served with a warm jalapeno pepper, a grilled onion (scallion bulb) -- which are worth ordering as a full side, and a lime.  Furthermore, every table gets FREE chips / HOMEMADE salsa.In a nutshell, this place is as authentic as it gets and cheap as a handshake.  Tonight, I had 4 tacos and a Negra Modelo for $7.97 and left stuffed.This place is worth the visit to a part of town you probably avoid.  Go.  Go now.(also -- if you're worried about it being too authentic -- the kitchen received a 98.0 sanitation rating which is higher than the cafeteria for the hospital where I work.  :-P)

We get ready to walk in.  But a red faced, fiesty grandma stammers out and yells back to her husband" Why the hell were you such an a$$ in there?" Grandpa yells back " Because they were a$Se$ to me ! ".  So whoever "they" were, I'd like to say screaming old couples scare me. A senior fight that could result in both maybe having angina and needing CPR is no fun. They yell and cuss another 5 in the car, and thankfully drive off. Just another Friday night at Bambini's?  The host says "no" thankfully!Inside, it's friendly (Whew), bright, loud, and lively with lots of people, including kids, loud TV's, loud employees, and off key Happy Birthdays. An employee drops and breaks a wine glass and his co workers laugh before getting the mop and broom.  The two narrow dining areas are separated by a wine display rack. The lamps are bright and colorful. The strong smell of pizza and garlic match the noise levels.Our waitress brings our menus and some water. While looking at the menu, I read the yelp reviews, and it was obvious we'd have to order garlic knots appetizers.  Garlic has some awesome health benefits, and is so good on soft french rolls. It was awesome and somewhat greasy but really addicting. I had the baked ziti topped with cheese.  It was enough to feed 2 normal sized adults, but barely enough for my Samoan 6'2" 16 year old nephew who plays high school football. My brother ordered the baked lasagne, good but not anywhere as large as my ziti. TBoth dishes had a strong tomato, garlic, oregano taste with the right amount of sweet, salt, and tang. Both dishes were loaded with cheese, and came out piping hot. It took 20 minutes for out waitress to bring our order, as there was no pre-made stuff here. Both were about $13. and I took 2/3 of my order home. Abondanza for sure. This was authentic Italian, and reminded me of some of the casual places I'd eaten in NYC.  We come to find out that the owner is from the Big Apple, and came to North Vegas with his old world recipes from Italy.      To finish off the dinner, the gelato guy in the front said he was generous with his scoops.  The gelato is made by a local shop.  They had two of my favorite flavors - pistachio and mango.  Very creamy, dense, sweet, and rich in natural flavors.  Wow, I could only eat half of a large order.  All in all, an awesome dinner with no septagenarians in a mortal combat, yes!This is the best Italian eatery since Metro Pizza! The garlic knots are by far the best I have had since I was a little kid.I eat here on a regular basis and it really says something about the place when you see the same employees each time who seem to genuinely love working there. They always give me an honest opinion when I ask about a menu item which I truly appreciate. I always have a hard time deciding what to order it is ALL good! I live in Summerlin and make the drive over here just for Bambini's!The baked stuffed shells are simply to die for. The ricotta is spot on! I had it on a recent visit a couple days ago and really liked it.The subs are full of flavor and they do not skimp on what they put on themIf you are going for a sub I would recommend the "Our Famous Sub" it is just great! I like it both hot or cold it just depends on my mood. I do like mayo on it so I ask if I am getting it to-go for the mayo, oil & vinegar on the side so I can put it on myself. It it just easier that way so you don't have a sloppy mess by the time you get home.Ok, the pizza is the true *star* here. I have had the "white pizza" and again with the ricotta being so spot on it is just a win win.  If you are looking to share a pizza with others at your table I recommend the "mixed cold cuts pizza" it is THE best item on the menu. They have an area where kids can make there own mini pizzas. I have even seen schools bring there kids in to do it. There are TV's everywhere usually playing sports. If you wanted to host a large party they have 2 nice sized banquet rooms just for that. You can dine inside or outside on the beautiful patio. If you want to phone your order in for pick up that is as well an option. They have a nice case as you walk in of yummy desserts. On the door I have seen a sign requesting you not bring your own drinks inside. I would never think to bring my own drink to a restaurant I am going to sit down and eat at but apparently they have a problem so I wouldn't recommend bringing your own drinks. They are not open Monday's.FUCK. THIS. PLACE.FUCK EMThis is the worst pizza place in this city I have ever been to, and let me explain whyyyy:First off,  I've never been here before, but it was the closest pizza place that I came across on my way back from Nellis AFB to a friends house, and I wanted to surprise her with pizza.I walk in and place a takeout order for a large Margarita pizza. Simple enough right? No. No apparently this is the hardest fucking thing for a chef to accomplish, cause I wait 30 minutes before the guy at the front hands me a small box. What the hell is this? I ask. This is a small pizza box, I ordered a large.Indeed, they messed that up. But I understand mistakes are made sometimes, so I don't throw a bitch fit and the guy at the front apologizes, replaces the order, and offers me a complimentary scoop of gelato. Great, a cup of icecream for waiting an hour for a fucking pizza, seems legit to me! So I wait for another 20 minutes, and the cashier rushes back to me with my large pizza. I understand it's not his fault, but the fault of the incompetent chef in the back, so I graciously accept the pizza and leave. Phew! Glad that's over!So I get inside my car, and set the pizza in the passangers seat, I think to myself, gee, I should probably check the pizza to make sure it's the right kind. Cause chances are that chef is a moron. This is what I open up to:http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=4N-HU_T32hLENLntsNKNBgEDIT:So funny, I had a link to the picture, but apparently the company, or some grouchy loyal customer complained and Yelp took it down, but fear not my friends, it's all over facebook.I get a fucking pizza soup. Great. Just great. With an hour of my time wasted, I'm literally pulling my hair and way too pissed off to go back in there and complain, cause I probably would of threw this shit in the chefs face. This shit wasn't even cooked all the fucking way. What if me, my friend, and her little sister got sick from it? I try my best to go to local pizza shops here in town, but it's fucking places like these that make people stick to the corporate chain pizza places. Atleast they know how to cook a fucking pizza all the way through.This place needs to fire their dumbass ass chef and get a new one before they go out of business. Complete horseshit!I eat here if not every week, every other week. The owner takes great pride in putting out great food. I have eaten pretty much everything on the menu and never had a bad meal. I never leave hungry either. The portions here are very generous. Inside is clean and there are tables or booths. They have a couple huge banquet areas too if you want to host an event here.This week I ordered my usual Italian sub as well shared an Italian antipasto with my wife. The sub is just good. you can get it hot or cold. The sandwich has lettuce, tomatoes, onions, banana peppers, ham, salami, cappicollo, provolone & oil and vinegar. I have them put the oil and vinegar on the side since I have mayo added just make sure things don't slide around and I can add the amount I want. The salad was generous for being the small order. Very good and fresh. The shared sandwich and salad really hit the spot.The pizza is what you really should try first here. The deep dish is the best. When you order stuff like pizza or pasta it does take a while because it is made from scratch. Order some garlic knots while you wait because they are the best in town. There is a make your own pizza station for the kids. Bambini's is closed Monday's.The cashier, who's name is Angel stole $8 from me. I placed a togo order on Tues. Nov. 5 2013 at  exactly 6:00 PM from a server named Angel, this is according to my receipt that also shows a charge of $30.25 that was paid using my debit bank card, but after checking my bank statements today I noticed a charge for $38.25 to my bank card from bamstealurmoni! Now to be fair, I have not yet confronted Angel,  or his manager about this overcharge to my account as of yet, normally in a situation like this I would wait until after the problem was resolved,  giving the establishment time to investigate,  and offer a resolution before I would start publicly accusing them of being thieves, and make no mistakes about it, that is what I'm doing, I am accusing Bambinis of being a shady, dishonest, untrustworthy, thieving,  dirty, disgusting grease pit hole in the wall solely based on the employee's they choose to represent them, but the reason I am sounding off now is because Angel was a total jerk from the get go! This guy has a serious attitude problem!  Sorry, but I don't  tip somebody $8 for taking an order, I would however tip if he served me, even if he was still the snot nose little prick that he is, I would still reward him for his efforts,  assuming he wasn't thief of course! Tomorrow after they open for business,  I will inform them of this crime,  and I promise to either update this review,  or remove it based on the outcome,  but unfortunately they have lost me as a customer,  I believe in supporting locally run businesses,  and many times I have recommended this place which I now regret,  the I.A.P. who now hold there monthly meetings at this place being one of them,, I am not looking forward to telling them how wrong I was! Maybe this is just an isolated incident,  and this is just on bad employee giving the whole establishment a bad name, we will just have to wait a see, like I said, I will follow up on this review,  and if in a week from now Angel is still employed here being allowed to steal from their loyal, hard working unsuspecting customers,  then we will know just what kind of place this really is, but if he is dismissed from his duties of representing this company as being petty little crooks I will have no other choice but to spread the word far and wide warning people of this scam, I have many outlets to voice my concerns,  I am very involved in the community, and very rarely do I speak ill of an small business working hard to make it. but when you steal from me I get angry. I have no tolerance for scam artists in my town!  That is all for now,  but I will keep everyone posted.  Thank you.*first update,  when I posted this review a few minutes ago, a picture came up with it, a picture that I posted some time ago which I have forgotten about! When I see a  business on Yelp that does not have a picture, and I support the business,  I will post a picture for them to help advertise,  I'm only pointing this out to illustrate how hurt, betrayed,  and utterly sickened by what was done to me, for a measly $8 they lost a loyal customer, and now have their reputation at risk.

Review Text :
This place is awesome. Because Phoenix isn't a walking city, I tend to not go to coffee shops to do a few hours of work, choosing instead to sit on my couch with laptop in hand, but Urban Beans is the kind of place that makes me want to spend a few hours being productive--or just surfing Facebook. (Isn't it funny how you can feel productive doing social networking when you're at a cafe surrounded by semi-urbanites?)So, what makes Urban Beans different from other local coffee spots? A few things: the staff is really nice, the plugs are plentiful (although watch your step when you're crossing an open area), and they have really good, affordable food options. (Try the pear flatbread or the quiche!). My biggest complaint is the music. I'm OK with emo but some sort of batshit-crazy guy doing spoken word over Enya-like strings is enough to throw me--the ultimate multitasker--into distraction land. Keep it simple, folks, and this place may just become good enough for the coveted five stars.Urban Beans is definitely a great find in Urban Phoenix. While this coffee shop makes its home on busy 7th street, the second I stepped foot inside, I forgot what was going on outside. Urban Beans has the perfect environment of independent coffee shop meets a clean and modern space with an eclectic touch. There's plenty of seating inside and out and they even have comfy chairs at the tables. Free Wii Fi and electrical outlets make this the perfect work space and the food and drink options make it the ideal one. The iced coffee here is delicious and I was happy to learn that they have sugar free chocolate syrup which is far and few between! It is pricey though and was $5.04 for a large iced coffee. I would definitely be in trouble if I worked here too long and too much! But the coffee is good and the environment is even better so I will most definitely be back.Me: What's the wifi password?Him: 'thankyou'" all lowercase.Me: Thank youHim: that's rightMe: No, I mean thanksHim: No, thank youMe: Right, I'm just to say thank YOU for giving me the passwordHim: Saying it to me won't help though, you'll have to type it into your laptopMe: You're funnyHim: thank youMe: ...is the password. Got it.Only at Urban Beans do you get a complementary Abbott and Costello routine with your coffee. One of my fav new spots. Love it.

I've been a big fan of the other Thai House location for awhile now, so I was excited when I noticed this fairly new location was up and running and a lot closer to where my current home is located.  I've ordered take out from this location twice and both times I've been completely satisfied.Tonight I called in the following order for four of us:-2 orders of summer rolls-1 order pad Thai with chicken and shrimp - medium spice-1 order pad seu eu with shrimp and extra broccoli - medium spice-1 order eggplant with  mixed veggies-extra riceMy brother picked it up fifteen minutes later and it was delicious!  Each dish was filled with flavor and just enough kick.  Everyone enjoyed the meal... not only was it affordable, but it traveled well.Now if Thai House would only open another location in Old Town, or if they delivered, I'd be one happy camper!  But in the meantime, I highly recommend take out from Thai House.I am a big fan of Thai House here and the other one on Pima. I come here when I have a large group as the other one is smaller inside.As often as I come here, I never had anyone complaining about their food before. Everyone I came here was pleased with quality of food they serve.My ultimate favorite here is Mus-sa-mum. Always order with beef and spicy level 5. This curry is sweet, so the spicy level 5 is just perfect for someone like me, cannot handle too spicy food. I also love their Thai Fried Rice. Taste so much like Japanese fried rice (or fried rice in Japan).I ordered something new today, spicy eggplant. Surprised with rich flavor, I think this dish is going to be my regular item.  Pad thai, pineapple curry, yum woon sen, satay... they are some of my favorites too.Price is very reasonable, we had seven people at lunch today and ended up being only $65 before the tip. We couldn't even finish everything we ordered.  Food comes relatively quick, great place to eat lunch.  I may not check in on Yelp as often as I come here but I am a regular here and the one at the Pima road.I enjoy being accompanied by knowledgeable customers during my first time experiences at new restaurants, so I was quite pleased when Yuko suggested Thai House after our late afternoon hike at Camelback.I had read her review the day prior to coming, so I recall her photo of what appeared to be a peanut curry.  It's a name I am not familiar with: Mus-sa-mum... but its a taste I will crave until my descent into frontal lobe dementia is but a forgotten memory.  It was a delicious peanut curry sauce, with strips of beef and chunks of white potato.  Some sauteed button mushrooms would have been divine, but I'll keep that recipe in my pocket for now.  I think I'll call my version: Mush-sa-rum.I already have a twinsie, so I opted for their green curry over an "I'll take that as well".  It was every bit as delicious as my first green curry, so dont worry, Murray.  All arrived at the table with a large bowl of sticky rice.  After spooning both curries over my starch, my chop stick skills impressed my hiking partner so much, that she commented "Why dont you just use a fork"I would love to come back and try a noodle dish, or a Tom Kha, or some egg rolls.  The food was wonderful, portion sized generous, and the kids working didnt hassle us for hanging around and carrying on for an hour or so

I'm stunned at the hate towards Bice Bistro.  I've spent two evenings there this week and received superior service and excellent drinks and food.  Located in the Westgate section of Glendale, Bice Bistro is one of the only options for a relaxing meal in a classy setting.  Coming from the Philadelphia area, the last thing I expected was to eat pasta in the Midwest.  A two hour hike up and down Camelback Mountain yesterday morning changed my tune.  By dinner, I was ravenous for a meal that satisfied.  One look at the homemade pasta options on the menu had me ready to give it a try.  My fresh pappardelle tossed in tomato sauce with a touch of cream and topped with mozzarella was just as good as any pasta dish I've had in Philly's Italian restaurants.  My mom's angel hair pasta, with chunky tomatoes, garlic, basil and mozzarella was excellent.On both evenings we arrived early enough to take advantage of the happy hour specials, offered until 7 p.m.  Every drink we tried was perfectly made and with premium spirits.  My vodka martinis with blue cheese stuffed olives were wonderful, and despite arriving with only ten minutes left of happy hour time to spare, our bartender allowed us to pre-order our second round so that we could take advantage of the specials.  On our second visit, we received a warm welcome from the manager, who waved as soon as we walked through the door.  Every staff member we encountered was pleasant and engaging.  With price points in the $12 - $20 range (give or take a few selections), I find it hard to believe that anyone would complain about the cost.  Go to McFadden's or Yard House if you want fries with that sandwich.  Bice Bistro is a much needed dose of class in an area that is overpopulated with typical tourist trap destinations.

Review Text :
I'm so excited there's some authentic New Orleans cooking now in Las Vegas! The place is cute and family owned-operated. My extended family all lives in New Orleans so I'm quite familiar with the cuisine. I'm also a very harsh critic! *$4.25 - cup of gumbo. She puts sausage, chicken AND seafood in her gumbo. I found it heavy on the chicken and light on the seafood. The flavor was great. Really took me back to NOLA! Basically was a chicken/sausage flavored gumbo with a couple shrimp thrown in.*$11.99 - 1/2 dozen charbroiled oysters. *sigh* I'm pretty spoiled here. I didn't find these nearly as good as real new orleans charbroiled oysters, but they were still enjoyable*$9.99 - Shrimp poboy with fries. The poboy was a little small compared to what I'm used to , but otherwise it was perfect. They fly their bread in from new orleans and the shrimp were so delish! The best poboy I've ever had outside of nola!Overall I'll be back. Their dessert menu looked incredible (bananas foster, bread pudding!). Prices weren't bad ($7.99-$12.99 per entree). Service was polite and speedy. Give them a try Yelp!Location: Everyone knows where it is but probably hasn't ever been there lol.Restaurant: ClassyService: Two Thumbs Up!Eats: Charbroiled Oysters, Shrimp Etoufee, 1lb of Crawfish, Oyster Po Boy.Drinks: Diet Sprite & Purple HazeWe're in LOVE!!!Location: We drove up and the first thing that I saw were the bright neon lights to the Holsum Bakery Sign and there she was, just after the eye piercing neons... Lola's.Restaurant: She wasn't hard to find, sits at the 15 & Charleston. It's a very quiet parking lot but as soon as your start walking towards the restaurant, you notice the people sitting outside and a faint sound of some Jazz music coming from the inside of the restaurant, which, um, we like, like a lot! Ok, Valley Girl moment gone.Our visit was on a late Friday night, 8:30ish, we had made reservations but we didn't really need them, this visit, as we were seated right away. The restaurant is still young and fresh, they just opened in October but I have a feeling that once people start finding out about them, reservations may be mandatory because they sure do put some yummies in your tummies! Our friend that was with us mentioned that a lot of his co-workers eat there for lunch and it does get pretty busy during that time, so, heads up, make a reservation.Fleur-de-lis. Saints. Mardi Gras Beads. Umbrellas on the ceiling.  Jazz music, I hearts. I've never been to NOLA, I've only been exposed to anything NOLA by my Uncle, either by telling us stories about and such but they sure are representing anything and everything New Orleans in there that it makes me feel like I'm there! Very welcoming. Atmosphere, A+++Service: Quentin was our server. Very sweet gal and on top of everything! Refills and everything without asking and very knowledable when it came to the menu. There's nothing worse than a server that's clueless about what they're serving and we did not have an experience close to resembling that, awesome job!The Yummies: We shared the Charbroiled Oysters, I had the Etoufee with Purple Haze and bites of the Hubster's food, the Po Boy and Crawfish with a Diet Sprite. There is not one complaint about the flavor of the food! Everything they brought out had great presentation and tasted great. I loved that with the Crawfish, they gave us a bucket, unlike a  local restaurant that has you throw it on your table just to have the juices spill all over your lap, yum. It was the first time that I tried Purple Haze beer, it's a wheat beer, the haze, with a hint of rasberry, the purple and it was quite yummy, so much so that I ordered 2 :). A friend of ours ordered the catfish and bread pudding and he enjoyed it. In fact, when the bread pudding came out, he took a bite and his eyes rolled to the back of his head,... I'm pretty sure he liked it :DAs we were eating dinner, we were approched by a woman with a pretty smile, a Fleur-de-lis hanging from each ear and introduced herself, it was Lola! She was so nice and we chit chatted for a little bit and even took a photo with her :)During dinner, my husband turned to me and said "This is the flavor that I've been looking for!" I completely agreed with him, everything was spot on. Yea, we'll be back.A great authentic American Cuisine.  I have to say , I am not a huge purveyor of Southern cooking, however, after reading yelper Michelle W review of the place, figured we had to give it a shot.  Had clients in town from Italy and France and one of my colleagues wanted to try Rhythm Kitchen and so I suggested Lola's.1.  Quaint - When you are traipsing around the Charleston area, me thinks the last thing you are going to think about is quaint, cute, cool.  This place is all that and has character. Small, few tables, small bar, and it has just enough of whatever it is to make it just right.2.  Service - Dominic was there when we entered waiting for our guests. Very nice, knowledgeable, gave us the scoop on the wine he preferred and also on the food.  They set up our table nicely and when we had to add one more, they were very accommodating. We had a party of 9 in here and they took care of us.  I think the place serves 20-25 total?3.  Food - I was looking to give our out of towners a unique experience to try something uniquely American.  So this is the place we chose.  Crab Cakes and Craw Puppies - The crab cakes were very substantial, flaky, moist and tender. I enjoyed it.  It was one per order, however, as they are decent size, we asked for each to be cut in two pieces and we ordered enough to share. Ordered craw puppies for the table, never having this before.  Deep fried seafood is the best I can describe this.  Not greasy and bite size tasty bits of seafood. Nice.  Each is the size of a small meatball, 5 per order, so we split two orders.  Jambalaya - to me, the right blend of spice, rice, seafood. I also ordered the shrimp as an addition and it was just right. Juicy and hits the spot.Salmon and Sweet potato fries - I think this was the only let down.  The fries had such great flavor yet the salmon was very dry  Dry fish is not too bueno, so this was  of a downer.Gumbo -Seafood soup like bouillabaisse or cioppino.  I did not have it but one of our friends did. It looked really, really good.Etoufee - I thought this was something a bald buy wore as he got older?  Perhaps I will need one soon.  Naw, this is a dish similar to the gumbo, just that it is thicker and more like a stew. Whereas the gumbo has seafood, this one here has either shrimp or something else, was the choice, but it was not  mixed like the gumbo.  Now I did not order this, but man did my friend enjoy it. Very nice.Sweet Potato Pecan Pie a la mode with ice cream - YOu have to come for the desserts.  This is what the wifey and I ordered, and it was really great. I am going to go back for their Banana Foster Bread Pudding.  Don't be shy, order the dessert!!!GK says, check this place out for sure! I enjoyed it as a unique dining place. Not sure if it is a frequent place for me yet, however, I am going back for other desserts, so I will let you all know.My husband and I had lunch at Lolas on 6/20th and were pretty disappointed. At first we were seated asked for our drink orders and shortly after we ordered our food but that is where the service ended. As we watched around us tables were getting bread it seemed at random and although we ordered entrees didn't see a crumb. It took 30 minutes for us to get our food and when we did it was cold. Not just the top of the food but all the way through like it had been sitting in a pot out back and they just slopped it on a plate. My husband had the Jambalya and it was cold all the way through, only the shrimp on top were hot. He said it had no flavor at all. I ordered the shrimp and grits and it too was cold like mushy paste with some hot shrimp on top. I liked the flavor but it was more like left overs I just got out of the fridge from the day before. My guess is they plated the rice and grits and forgot about it then 30 minutes later realized they didn't add the shrimp, topped it off and the waiter dumped it off on our table. If we were not on our way to a conference and hungry as all get out we would have complained and refused it. What made it worse is, no one came back to refill our drinks which were down to the ice the entire meal, the waiter just dropped off the food and walked off and we didn't see anyone again until we were done and ready to pay our check. It's a real shame because I had high hopes for this place. We love small mom & pop restaurants and this one unfortunately unless they shape up, train their staff and check their food quality before it leaves the kitchen will be seeing the doors close sooner than later.I am a road warrior.  I am used to eating alone, but I never get used to be treated poorly because I am eating alone.  I was really looking forward to eating here, but they would only seat me at a tiny 2 seat table with a total stranger...how awkward that would be.  They had 2 tables open, but they were being kept for party's of 2.  So, I walked.Came here after doing a google search of Diners, Drive Ins, and Dives for Las Vegas...  I've been craving cajun food, specifically jambalaya, so opted to try here.A Small divey restaurant with the interior adorned with lots of New Orleans memorabilia--paintings, ornaments, New Orleans Saints items, etc...  Along with the dim lighting, put me back in time to a setting in Louisiana...Service was fantastic.  The outgoing server helped me think aloud with my decision on what to order.  The pic of the crabcake looked interesting, but I didn't think I could finish it along with my entree.  I discussed their Po Boy which was featured on Triple D, but I had been craving good jambalaya for a long time.  Sooo ultimately, I went with jambalaya.Big mistake.The rice in the jambalaya was extremely mushy.  Killed the whole dish.  Obviously not freshly cooked and sitting in a huge pot of sauce for hours.  And where was the chicken and sausage?  Sparsely added... Why not 3 stars instead of 2?  Mushy riced jambalaya should never be served if you are charging people money to eat it...  Just my 2 cents...Triple D Stamped. Fried Oysters reeled me in. My aunt suggested this place and a fried oyster po'boy sounded good to me! Bun- super soft, lots of fried yumminess. I split a sandwich with my mom so i could have room for their famous bananas' fosters bread pudding. as i write this review, i just fcking realized that i didn't get their famous banana fosters BREAD PUDDING, but their plain banana's fosters. I guess i was still suffering from the 8 hour traffic jam we were stuck in earlier and maybe a bit hypnotized by the cutie server we had, but yeah, i ended up with a dessert i didn't order. I didn't love it either, but i'm sure i would have loved their bread pudding version Damn it!!! I guess i'll have to make my way back to get that dessert one day!When my father was in town we decided to pay homage to my hometown state of Louisiana and with the crisp, chilly weather ghosts of Gumbo past had me cravin' cajun. I've had Lola's bookmarked for a long time and based on Yelp reviews, it seemed legit. Walking in, I noticed a stack of King Cakes and Louisiana paraphernalia decorated the walls (beads, fleur de lys, Bourbon Street signs, and Saints flags). I felt like I had stepped into a restaurant in the French Quarter, it was small and quaint. Recommendations are strongly recommend. My father and I lucked out and were seated at a hi-top table near the bar. Our server came over and greeted us with a smile and warm, "Hey y'all! What can I get you to drink while y'all are lookin' over the menu?" authentic accent and all. (Seriously, it's a portal to Louisiana and Southern hospitality.) I ordered a sweet tea (which is SO hard to find West of the Mississippi - besides Texas) and our drinks were ordered promptly arrived with warm, freshly buttered and flashed grilled bread. We both ordered a cup of Gumbo and we're still narrowing down our choices.The Gumbo arrived with lightning speed & was on point. It was thick (a lot of people think it's a soup, but it's very much like a stew) and filled with chunks (not bits) of Andouille sausage, shrimp, chicken, and okra. Tasted like home; it was excellent.For entrees we ordered Crawfish Etouffee (my FAVORITE Cajun dish of all-time) and Shrimp Creole. The etouffee was amazing, the butter, garlic, and green pepper flavors well balanced and there was just the right amount of heat. The good times we're definitely being had by my mouth. Shrimp Creole was also amazing, tomato-y, peppery, garlicky, onion-y paradise. The shrimp were also huge (love me some oximorons). I found out that their shrimp, crawfish, and catfish were flown in from Louisiana. At this point we were way too full to try dessert. I am planning a second trip back to explore more of menu and to give that Banana's Foster Bread Pudding. I got to live the Louisiana state motto: "Come fall in Love with Louisiana all over again" on my trip to Lola's. It's great to know that there is great Creole & Cajun cuisine just around the corner. Excellent service. Standout, authentic food! A warm, friendly atmosphere. Laissez les bon temps roulezer in your mouth at Lola's!4 1/2 stars. NOLA cuisine  has got to be top of my list of favorite foods I enjoy so checking out Lola's for the first time during the week excited me. Private parking here so no issues. They offer outdoor dinning but I was dinning solo and opted to sit in the bar area since they were quite busy that evening.Started off with a bowl of NOLA gumbo which was full of yummy ingredients and had a kick to it which made my forehead break a sweat!  I followed with an entrée of crawfish entouffee which was delicious.  My friendly waitress suggested dessert and I didn't hesitate a second - chose the Fosters bread pudding which was topped with ice cream. It was awesome! Overall a great NOLA meal and the staff here was fabulous. I'm looking forward to returning here again and again!I'd been looking forward to coming to this spot since seeing it on Triple D and to also support my fellow New Orleanian.  The site was so cute & decorated with New Orleans fare throughout.  Tables were secure and it was clean.  There is also a grill in the front.  It is small but intimate. Servers were very nice.  Hence one star.If you enjoy cayenne pepper & a runny nose, this is your spot.  I am from New Orleans, born & raised & I was insulted.  This food had absolutely no flavor.  Not only did it not have flavor the gumbo was uneditable it had so much cayenne.  It tasted as if the only spice was cayenne and no base in any smoked meat or flavor enhancers like bay leaf, smoked necks as the base, and garlic powder, onion powder, granulated garlic or anything.  Nothing I had was from home.  I also had the crawfish.  Sadly cayenne was the star.  The potatoes that they added to the boil were not boiled with any kind of salt. Ever had a boiled or baked potatoe without salt?  Horrible.My table mate had the crawfish étouffée.  Cayenne abounded and no flavor.  She said the rice was fluffy.  Another table mate had the green beans & I'd ordered the greens.  Greens lacked anything & tasted like they came from a can.  Bacon pieces were obvious.  The green beans had a good crunch & a little flavor.  We also ordered the grilled oysters for our table.  They were seasoned with Italian dressing.  Different and average.I do not understand all the four & five stars here.  Palates are different but good food never changes and is consistent.  Lola's is a wanna be Louisiana kitchen.  We have a Lola's in New Orleans & I encourage every Yelper to eat there if ever in town.  This Las Vegas Lola is an imposter in the highest order.On our first night in Vegas, after a long heavily trafficked drive, we decided to stay in and order take out. You have to know what to order here because it can be delicious, but it can also be blah. Bear ordered the shrimp over grits and it was mind blowing. MIND BLOWING!!! I ordered the jambalaya and it was yuck! YUHUCK!!! So think carefully before you order, ask them what their specialties are, what's popular on their menu, etc. An other thing I was extremely unhappy with, and I don't know if it's the same in the restaurant but, their take out portions are tiny. The pictures I'm about to share shows the food as it came before we started eating. Considering the amount of food, this place is heavily over priced!! I would go back for the shrimp and grits, but I would eat it there so I could demand more food lol

Restaurant name  Boardhouse Serious Sandwiches
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
North Vegas has a slew of chain restaurants and some "just okay" independent places.  The Boardhouse Serious Sandwiches shop , though, is a winner. Sure, it's pricier than a mediocre Subway.  But taste  wise, you can't compare the fast food mass made subs of one and the seriously made Boardhouse food.. I had the pastrami Nami on rye, and my brother had the turkey.  The pastrami was aromatic and warm, thinly and evenly sliced and lean.  It was placed on very soft, thick rye bread.  With mustard,it was a beautiful, tasty, tall sandwich.  I didn't try the turkey, but my brother didn't say a word the whole time he devoured his sandwich. He said the other sandwiches, from Tuna to roast beef, are all really good.When in town next time, I hope to try the other items and their cookies. Their featured item on their web homepage is a fat turkey sub with cranberry. It makes me drool...so I always keep a napkin at my computer. I love a place that's all about quality..I just wish they were in the OC.Boardhouse Serious Sandwiches-Timber's newest experiment with 4 location across the Las Vegas Valley.First I even heard of this place was an ad I received in the mail. $2.00 off per sandwich, Buy 1 get 1 Free after 4pm and $10 off a $25 purchase on the Weekends. GREAT DEALS!!The ad had their menu printed on the back and the sandwiches all sounded quite appetizing and a little different variation than you see in most sub shops in Las Vegas.My 1st attempt at coming here I show up at 10:30 on a Sunday and they didn't open until 1 am so I went elsewhere.This time it was 4 pm on a Friday and I was hungry so I ordered 3 sandwiches to go. A Beef Dip,A BBQ Beef and a Pastrami Nami. The cashier was fantastic-very helpful,perky and informative. She said they were owned by Timbers Gaming and had been open since June 2009. Not on twitter yet but a TV commercial airing soon.The sandwiches are a little pricy $7-8 each -one size fits all.(smaller than a footlong bigger than a size inch)-one type of bread.The 1st sandwich was the beef dip. Thin roast beef , horseradish and onion. The beef was ok but not real impressive and this was the BEST of the 3 sandwiches.The 2nd sandwich was the BBQ Beef-same beef as the french dip slathered in bad bbq sauce and some onions thrown in. Nothing memorable here.The 3rd sandwich was the pastrami-It sure looked good-lots of pastrami-I only made it through half and had the WORST heartburn. It seemed like it had a TON of pepper. Too thin pastrami and it was a little dry and chewy not moist and tender like GOOD pastrami is.Overall the employees were very enthusiastic, the place had a real cool surfer vibe to it and a simple menu but it's a little too expensive and not impressive at all.It's nice to see a new place popping up in this economy but I do not have alot of hope for this place -especially this location. MOST of the customers will be college kids looking to eat cheap and Port Of Subs is nearby.

Just an update to my previous review. A few reviews had complained about having to pay for chips & salsa. On my most recent visit, chips & salsa were free as long as you were purchasing a meal item...

Review Text :
I love America. I love tacos. Not always in that order, but let's continue. I've been a few times already. And have yet to order a taco. That's because America's Taco Shop could easily be named America's Quesadilla Shop. But, we know, that wouldn't stick. I've had the carne asada quesadilla with lettuce, guac and monterey jack. Definitely on the smaller side, but hey, it's $4.50. And then there's that Mexican Coke. Pricier than the U.S. Coke. Oh. Wait. We're talking beverages here folks. I left the 80s behind years ago! Yep. Mexican Coke has REAL sugar and not HFCS. I"m not a real anti HFCS kinda guy...but let's just say, this Mexican Coca Cola really rocks my meats and cheeses! But, it's $3. So you gotta feel in a fancy lunch mood. My last visit I added an order of chips and salsa. All said, with tip, was over $13. A little pricey. But I didn't mind. Kind of like buying Kiehl products at Neiman's. Or a brick of brie at AJs. Or the expensive toilet paper with chamomile and lotion. Worth it! Especially the latter. I"m just sayin'!Great service. Friendly, if not a bit too aggressive. Last visit Miss America herself was there with her cute and chatty daughter. I loved it! Though my kids are limited to a Schnauzer, I like seeing family together in the biz. America. America. God bless your tacos. From sea to shining sea. From 7th St. to 7th Ave. God shed your guac on me....I was driving down Melrose District when I saw that America's Taco Shop served breakfast. I needed something to eat, so I pulled over and went inside. They do not have a big vegetarian menu, so I just ordered a breakfast burro without meat and potatoes. It was decent, but this place is probably not my first choice for breakfast. They also should not advertise it as a Burro. A breakfast burro is pretty huge and the one that I got was the size of a breakfast burrito.

I spent a good 30 minutes on my drive home yelping pizza places that cater to vegetarians & local to where I live. this location is less than 5 minutes from my house and easily accessible. awesome right? I thought so till I ordered.My order was simple enough, small white pizza ordered as is & a cup of minestrone soup. The brunette hostess rang me up and said it would be about 25 minutes. This was at 630... so I waited in my car and went inside at 7. Around 7:10 and all the other patrons coming in and picking up their orders, the hostess told me it would be a few more minutes. Few moments later, she quietly says that my order had been "forgotten" and she was "sorry" and it would be another 20 minutes. I didn't even get my pizza until 7:41. And when I finally picked it up there was no compensation, no coupons for next time, just a simple "Sorry" with a shrug. Terrible service at best. there wasn't a line or anyone waiting to be seated. everyone else had been given their order and mine was pushed aside. I suggest eating elsewhere when you're craving pizza/pasta... unless waiting over an hour sounds appetizing.

This is not your neighborhood Chinese restaurant.The flavors are familiar but the ingredients, their incredible quality, and the respect they are given are not.  There is a balance and harmony to the dishes that make each ingredient to sing.Warning, you're gonna have sticker shock when you first look at the menu (beef broccoli $28, fried rice $20) but do look.  Don't make the mistake I made on my first visit, after winning big in the poker room, I told the server to bring me a house specialty.  Yep, a $300 Chinese dinner for one. For starters, the Crispy fried beef roll and enoki mushrooms and the simple salt and pepper tempura ice fish are delicious.  Both so perfectly cooked, crispy on the outside and moist inside.Seafood is where this restaurant shines.  Most items can be prepared multiple ways.  Ask the server for a recommended preparation if you're not sure.  The spot prawn with salt and pepper was excellent.  Incredibly sweet and the head, so clean and creamy.  The giant clam (sashimi style) was delicious.  Clean ocean flavor with a hint of sweetness and some chew.  For the less adventurous, the lobster tail with the spicy XO sauce is a winner.  Layer after layer of flavor from the sweet lobster meat to the spicy, fermented sauce.  Tea works best with the flavors of the food.Note:  Avoid ordering typical Chinese takeout items.  You will end up factoring in the price and then comparing them to your favorite local place.Highly Recommended if you win big and if you are willing to try new things.This will be my very first review for Yelp.  I don't normally write reviews because 99% of the times I eat out I am with my husband Dennis T.  Now, for those of you who are familiar with Dennis' reviews you will understand why I don't find it necessary to write reviews.  He says it all, and in a much more creative and descriptive way than I ever could.  Who would want to follow his act?Dennis decided for Valentine's Day that we would eat at Blossom in Aria and follow it up with the Viva ELVIS show.  Excellent choices, but I won't be reviewing either one.  My sole reason for writing this review is to make you and the management at Blossom aware of an excellent server named Jackson V.  Immediately after I was seated he presented me with a perfect long stemmed red rose for Valentine's Day.  That was a very nice surprise, but not the reason for my review.  Jackson was simply one of the nicest servers I have ever encountered. We asked what kind of hot tea they had and after naming three types we weren't sure if we wanted Oolong or Jasmine.  We expressed to Jackson that we thought it was Oolong that we liked and ordered a pot.  After he poured our tea and we both tasted it he inquired how we liked it.  I said it was okay, but I really think I prefer Jasmine.  Without our prompting he immediately went to the kitchen and procured a piping hot order of Jasmine tea and gave each of us new teacups.  Now Dennis has two teacups in front of him and when he went to pour the second cup of Oolong tea for himself he learned just how hot that pot was and spilled the tea in the process.  Jackson and another server immediately appeared to clean up the mess.Dennis ordered potstickers as an appetizer and asked for and received five different sauces to complement them, including a small vial of red wine vinegar.  Dennis did not know to hold on to the top when pouring the vinegar.  You guessed it, the top came off and red wine vinegar was splattered all down the front of his shirt in a curious polka dot pattern.  This time three servers rushed to our rescue.  Jackson left and promptly returned with a glass of club soda and small cloth so we could attempt to clean up his shirt, to no avail.Now I am probably one of the pickiest eaters in the country.  I hate all vegetables (except potatoes if you consider that a vegetable), only eat a couple of fruits, and don't like anything spicy.  Even black pepper is too much for my sensitive palate.  You know how they say your taste buds change every seven years?  Well mine are still stuck at age seven!I ordered the Wor Wonton Soup without any vegetables because Jackson said it wouldn't be a problem and I did receive it sans vegetables.  I ordered the Honey Walnut Shrimp without the fruit and it also was presented the way I ordered it.Everything we asked for we promptly received from a smiling Jackson who was not even slightly fazed by my weird ordering style or Dennis' mishaps.  Blossom's management should know what a gem they have in Jackson.  He was efficient, courteous and friendly and Dennis and I will request him the next time we dine there, and I highly recommend you do the same.   By the way, the food was also excellent and deserves this five-star rating.Blossom was one of the restaurants in Aria that I had never been to even though I had read very positive reviews of the restaurant.  I had a ticket to see Zarkana so I went last night and ordered from the early dining menu which is a prix fixe 4 course meal.I started with the corn egg drop soup.  It was standard fare.  Very tasty and a good starter.  Next came Next came crisp fried beef roll with enoki mushroom and Mandarin brown sauce.  The rolls had a crisp exterior and very good tasting, moist beef inside.  The brown sauce was flavorful.  The main course has a choice option and I went with the beef tenderloin with portabella mushroom.  The beef was coated with black pepper and there was a small amount of black pepper sauce with the meat.  Accompanying the meat were stir fried bok choy and rice.  The meat was so very tender it could almost be cut with a fork only.  For dessert, there were two mochi--red bean and green tea.Service was superb!  The servers knew I had a 7 PM show.  Since the restaurant opens at 5:30, time is an issue.  The courses were brought out in a timely manner with enough time between so not to feel rushed yet never was I tapping my foot nor looking at my watch.  They know what they're doing!My server, Kenny, was very polite and pleasant.  The restaurant is quite elegant.  It was relatively quiet with modern music playing at a low, background volume which would be conducive to conversation.I have to return and order à la carte when I can try some of the very interesting things on the menu.

Review Text :
We got in around 7 pm into Las  Vegas, everyone was hungry. We didn't want to go to a buffet. We wanted something simple, since we had a bunch of kids with us. When we checked in at the resort, they gave us a menu for Rosati's Pizza. It even had some family value coupons and they deliver. Spaghetti, Pizza & Wings it is then. The coupon "Family Pasta Special" ($25.99) was for (1) Family Spaghetti or Mostaccioli, (4) Bread Sticks, (6) Meatballs & a 2 litter soda. We chose the spaghetti w/ meat sauce. When they say "family" they mean big, large as in a full tray of spaghetti. That was not what I expected. And it was very very good. The bread stick was garlicky, also good. The meatballs were delicious. (A must order) Matched well with the spaghetti. Highly recommend this deal. Like I said, I didn't expect the special to be so much food, so I ordered more. Hawaiian Luau Pizza, Canadian Bacon & Pineapple. This was just okay for me. The kids loved it though. Buffalo Wings (24 pcs) Delicious. Fried to perfection. The sauce was not too vinegary (the way I like it) I could not stop eating them. Yummy!!Fettuccine Alfredo was also a hit. Pasta was cooked perfectly and the sauce was creamy without being too rich. Delicious Service was good. From the lady taking the order to the gentlemen who delivered it. Even got a courtesy phone call to tell me he was parking (it's hard to find parking where I'm staying) I appreciated that It was a very good Family dinner. Everything tasted delicious and getting a lot of food was a pleasant surprise. I'll definitely be back.

Shabu Shabu aka Japanese fondue has a home in Montreal!This is  actually a really fun place to eat at. Seating is around a horse-shoe shaped counter/bar  which takes up the whole restaurant. You have a choice of broths (spicy or traditional) and you choose which kinds of meats and veggies you'd like. You're also given a bowl of rice on the side. You "cook" the thinly sliced meat in your broth   a la fondue style along with the veggies.Everything is super fresh and super healthy. You can overeat all you want here and don't have to feel bad about it afterwards at all! It's a great cheap date spot!

Review Text :
Not a fan of Jimmy John's and find nothing gourmet about their sandwiches. The location on Mill has a bad set up. The door to the counter is only about 5 feet so when it gets busy customers try and pile in, then the people behind the counter are constantly yelling for them to move out of the doorway.. It's a mess. Also the seating is great for 1 or 2 people, but bring more than that and you are SOL. I really don't like that there is not 4" option, only 8". I'm not hungry enough to eat an 8" sub for lunch. I want options! I ordered the Italian night club and didn't read the menu close enough to see they include mayo on it. I HATE MAYO. My sub was drenched in mayo, seriously like a pond of mayo. Gross. I couldn't taste any vinaigrette. Who ever heard of putting mayo on an Italian sammy? I think I'll stick to Silver Mine should I need to get  my Mill sub fix on.I would give them 0 stars if it was available. This is the worst jimmy johns in the area. The manager has a bad attitude and makes you feel stupid. Let me tell you about the last time I was there a few weeks ago.Granted it was about 1:30 an and was relatively busy.I ordered a few club lulu sandwiches with cheese and a bag of BBQ chips. The sandwich was made by the time the cashier swiped my card.  We sat down near the soda machine and munched away on our sandwiches and talking about random events that took place during the nights adventures. As we finished up our sandwiches we decided to grab the BBQ chips on the way out because we got all fought up in conversation that I didn't get a chance to eat them. And yes I think the BBQ chips are there best option. K here's where the whole thing when down hill. As I started walking out I got grabbed and almost thrown down by one of the employees that was making the sandwiches. He grabbed the chips out of my hands and yelled "I Don't think so dude" and then he started telling people in the restaurant and the staff that I had already eaten my chips and that I was stealing another bag.! Are you freaking kidding?!! He assaulted me then embarrassed me in front of everybody because he thought I was stealing a freaking 1.50 bag of chips!!I asked to speak to the manager, at this point I was furious. I explained to him and confirmed with the cashier that I paid for a bag of chips and the sandwiches. they were made so fast that we just sat down and ate the sandwiches and grabbed the chips on the way out. He said. " well that's bs, my employee says you already ate a bag of chips and I believe him over you so, unless you want to actually pay for something were done"Just a bunch of poorly trained staff, who abide by there own set of rules. Poor poor jimmy johns. Actually disappointed they let this happen

Restaurant name  Tottie's Asian Fusion

Review Text :
'Twas Wednesday night before Thanksgiving and the airport was a zoo...We picked up my sis nonetheless, like any good family would do.We were hungry for something different and perhaps something new...Finally a decision was made to head to Tottie's Asian Fusion 2!Fresh spring rolls, Totties Rolls, Soup, Eggplant, Curry, and Rice...We shared a bunch of tasty dishes and the atmosphere was beyond nice.--Enough of the rhyme, I just have to declare my love for Tottie!  She's the sweetest lady and a damn good chef.  You cannot go wrong at either location.  This new one is located inside the Lincoln Village Shops by Trader Joe's and Fogo De Chao.  Tottie's is our go-to place for Chinese, Thai, and Vietnamese... some of our favorite dishes are the panang curry, spicy eggplant, and pad seu eu, but we've never had anything from Tottie's that we didn't like.  Next time you're craving anything Asian, go to one of Tottie's restaurants - you can't go wrong!And for weekday lunch specials on Tuesday through Friday (11am - 3pm), Tottie's offers entrees served with steamed rice and a house salad starting at just $6.50 - such a deal!Although this Tottie's location has been open just a few months, it's time for an update... We've already been a handful of times and never been disappointed.  Tottie and her staff are extremely attentive and friendly every visit.  And the food... well, I could eat here all of the time and it would never get old!  Although our 'old standby' dishes are consistently cooked just right, we often try to order something new.  Tonight we shared the sizzle rice soup and a noodle dish that we'd never tried before... it had chow fun noodles, broccoli, bok choy, carrots, in a brown sauce.  It was delicious!Despite being full, we also ended up trying the banana pudding... and it was the perfect sweet ending to the meal and the long day!  Each bite had just the right amount of banana, mochi, ice cream, and who knows what other surprises, but it was damn good!***One last reason for an update: the shopping center is still undergoing major construction.  Do no let that deter you from going in.  Tottie's is staying open through it all!This is one of the best Asian restaurants in the valley. When you first visit you will notice that the decor and lighting is superb - suitable for a date night. The staff are gracious. Most importantly tho, the food here is fantastic. From the spring rolls and kung pao to the egg drop soup. Every meal I watched come out (to other tables) looked better and better. Now that I trust them I will return to sample some less cliché dishes.This also happens to be one of the least expensive lunch places in the area.You must try the Tangerine Shrimp. My mouth is watering right now just thinking about the to-go dinner that I ordered for my bf and I from Tottie's 2 last night. Mmmmm Mmmmm Mmmmm. Scrumptiousness!But back to the Tangerine Shrimp, it's sweet, it's a little sour, it's drenched in a blackish glaze (so don't freak out if it looks like black globs of shrimp, like I did), it's surrounded by orange slices, it's fried in tempura.... and it's amazing. Judging by looks alone, this dish does not look appetizing. But what it lacks in visual appeal, it makes up for in taste. You will be missing out if you don't try it.Now on to the rest of the Tottie's extravaganza, we ordered:- Kung Pao Shrimp - Fresh and crisp vegetables chopped into little cubes, tons of whole peanuts and succulent meaty shrimp in a spicy soy flavored sauce. Peanuts and shrimp in every bite!- Scallops with Black Bean Sauce - Fresh veggies and HUUUUGE meaty scallops in the most amazingly flavorful yet light black bean sauce I've ever tasted. OMG good.- Pad Thai with Chicken - Thai stir fried noodles (not overcooked and not undercooked, instead they were moist, flavorful and cooked to absolute perfection!) yummy fried egg pieces, crisp bean sprouts, shredded carrots, flavorful chicken (it was moist! not dry at all!), and topped with millions of crushed peanuts. Pad Thai heaven.- Fried Won Tons - For only about $6 you get 10 of these little drops from heaven. Won tons encasing pork and formed into little ball-like shapes - I'm astounded that I liked these as much as I did, as I'm not a huge pork fan. But the meat inside was so moist! And flavorful! They came with a sweet and sour dipping sauce as well as a spicy mustard sauce, another true taste bud delight.Now, a couple of notes before you head on over to Tottie's 2:- Portions are pretty large. We had leftovers, but I must admit that I stuffed myself silly with food.- For the high quality of the food, the price point at Tottie's is excellent. Yeah, it's on the pricier side of Asian Fusion food, but it didn't feel like Tottie hijacked my wallet. Entree's are around $10-12 each depending on if you pick shrimp, chicken or beef (shrimp will always be the most expensive - but SO worth it, as this is high quality seafood).- Take out is an excellent option if you don't feel like eating at the restaurant. It's fast and easy.- Their online menu has sushi items on it, but if you go to the N. Scottsdale Rd location they don't serve sushi. Originally I had tried to order some but on the phone I was informed that sushi isn't on their menu - so if this is what you desire, go to the spot on East Thomas Road.Hands down, the best Asian food I've tried in the valley. I'm officially a Tottie's 2 addict. I was so immensely satisfied with this meal, and now I'm dreaming about the leftovers I have for lunch...Last night Tottie cooked me up a special "diet" plate. She started with fresh steamed shrimp, chicken and dry fried those with cabbage, red pepper and onion then finished with fresh spring onion and cilantro. Let me tell you, it was amazing! No oil, no sugar, no starch but ALL flavor! Along side she brought me a dish of spicy Tottie sauce which is made from vinegar, chile and garlic.. again sugar free but still packed with complexity flavors and major heat! Tottie is just an amazing chef, owner and person. Even this morning I'm still reeling about the experience I had at Totties last night, I felt just like family.4.5 stars Oh Tottie's. I think I love you because our names are similar... Beyond that, you have earned my love based on your DELICIOUS food and friendly service! The first time I went to Tottie's it was for my Favorite Bear's birthday party. I arrived before Happy Hour ended and scored a Sake Bomber (or two?) before we were seated for dinner. I let the birthday boy handle all of the ordering. He knows what I like! I don't remember exactly what all we had but I do know that I want an IV drip of her curry sauce in my arm at all times. I also enjoyed her pork belly lettuce cups. Yep, PORK BELLY. It was so good! The second visit I had, I ordered a duck with creamy curry noodle dish. It was not on the menu, and you're lucky if you can get it, but if you do, I wouldn't mind if you named your next child after me. You're welcome. The duck was tender and flavorful. The noodles were perfectly cooked with the most delicious creamy, spicy curry sauce. I could eat it every day. Seriously. During our meal, our server was friendly but a little absentminded. She also seemed like she was new because she wasn't terribly knowledgeable on the menu. At the end of my meal, Tottie asked me about my food and thanked me for coming in. I am looking forward to my next visit to Tottie's The food is great, the servings are huge, the prices are reasonable. I know 5 stars from me is in their future!An offbeat bistro just north of Downtown Scottsdale that knows the key to good Asian fusion: mix the menu, not the dishes.Tottie's offers large portions of hearty, and authentic, Asian cuisine that ranges from Chinese to Vietnamese to Thai to the owner's native Laotion.We began the meal with an order of Vietnamese summer rolls, packed with shrimp, greens, mint, and a roasted pork that brought to mind char siu. The peanut dipping sauce added a pleasant touch. This was followed by a silky Panang curry, an on-point pad thai, and a ginger-basil salmon. There were no weak links, even if the Panang curry was a little muted and the pad thai noodles on the thinner side.For the size of the dishes and quality of preparation, the meal was a good choice for a late lunch.Driving south from the Grand Canyon on a Sunday morning, we were late for lunchtime and hungry.  Tucked away in a small strip mall was this location of Tottie's, and what a "find" it was.The décor at Tottie's is pleasantly understated and quite attractive.  Table placement and noise levels don't detract from the dining experience.  With an emphasis upon the cuisines of Thailand and Vietnam, the menu is geographically varied and large.  Yet, contrary to the current trend of Pan-Asian bistro restaurants, portion sizes are ample.  The food is satisfying, generally authentic and aesthetically plated.  As a guide, the kitchen uses an Asian standard of spiciness; "moderate" heat will pack a punch, albeit one which we found to be agreeable.Lunch began with a shared appetizer of Vietnamese-styled rice paper summer rolls.  In comparison to others that I've eaten, these were uncommonly thick, and a bit difficult to eat out-of-hand.  Shrimp, shredded pork and mint were apparent, but an overenthusiastic use of vegetables muted their flavors.  The accompanying peanut sauce was successful in balancing the flavors, but was a bit under-seasoned in its own right.An entrée of red Panang beef curry was true-to-form in its Thai seasoning.  Accents of lemongrass and galangal, two aromatics often omitted from corner-cutting preparations, were apparent.  If a bit heavy in its liquid portion, the dish was otherwise spot-on.The salmon filet in a basil and ginger sauce was both generous and quite tasty.  Very well balanced in its seasoning, yet not overpowering the taste of the fresh fish, this dish was an unconditioned success.Shrimp Pad Thai rounded out our shared lunch entrees.  Ample in portion, a vermicelli noodle was used.  Pad Thai is best judged by how effectively the kitchen balances the key flavors of sweet, spicy, salty and sour, and lesser substitutions for tamarind sourness is usually where the preparation suffers.  In this case, however, slight demerits go to an inadequate representation of the sweet component-- perhaps the easiest area to master.  Although a bit unbalanced, the shrimp Pad Thai was still very good.Our server, Rain, was enthusiastic, pleasant and prompt.  Before adding a generous tip for her services the tab for this enjoyable lunchtime feast for 4 totaled under $55; an excellent value for the dining experience received.

Review Text :
Our fellow yelpers have been raving about Pho Village in the Korean Plaza marketplace and we decided to give this place a go! First thing to notice is the matching furniture creates a nice zen-like environment right off the bat.  It looks like they spent a few more dollars on the furniture.  They also have an open kitchen atmosphere, so you can actually take a peak of how things are being made.  This is a good sign to me since a restaurant who is willing to show off their kitchen must be confident of it!Started off with #4. Cha Gio " 4 Vietnamese fried eggrolls" ($5.50).  I like restaurants that give you the greens so you can wrap your eggroll up.  Plenty of lettuce, mint, and the other stuff to make it quite complete.  It did take awhile to come out, I barely had a chance to wrap one up when our main entrees arrived.  The Husband said he could see that they were pan-frying it, which could explain why it took longer.  As a result though, it stayed hot longer since I had put the egg roll down to work on my pho and it was still quite hot when I got around to it.I went for the standard #11. Pho Dac Biet "Special combo with rare slices of steak, well done brisket, flank, tendon, tripe and beef balls with rice noodle. " (Small $5.95) The Husband said the broth tasted more 'perfumey' than other places.  I just noticed that I only got one piece of beef ball in my soup.The Husband wanted his staple - #28. Hu Tieu Hoac Mi Bo Kho "Beef stew with egg noodle" ($6.50) but they were out of it that evening.  He settled on #32. Com Ga Hai Nam "Hai Nam style chicken served with seasonal rice" ($7.50), which is something I usually get.  First off, it definitely looked (and tasted) a lot better than Pho Little Saigon's and Pho Thanh Huong Restaurant's versions.  They give you a lot of rice with this dish, perhaps too much since you end up eating it all. It was decent, but I've had better.  (Then again, it's always hard to compare this dish when you've had it homemade!  But I'll keep looking nonetheless.)Overall, Pho Village was a good experience overall.  The real test will be when the Husband gets to test out their version of the beef stew though! 3.5 stars.

Good shrimp and wings! Hook has been in Pittsburgh since 2005. This Hook location is on Federal Street on the North Side across from the library. It is a take out only location.As far as seafood they offer catfish fillets, nuggets, cod, perch, regular and jumbo shrimp, oysters, scallops, tilapia and whiting. Dinners come in small, large and family sizes. All dinners come with cole slaw, fries and bread. As far as chicken dinners they offer gizzards, nuggets, tenders and wings and they are also available in small and large sizes. Wing dinners are available anywhere from 3 wings to 150 wings. They also offer chicken and fish combos including: catfish & wings, perch & wings, catfish cut & chicken tenders and perch & chicken tenders. For sandwiches they offer crab cake, cod, perch, tilapia, whiting and chicken tender sandwiches. All sandwiches come with fries and cole slaw. For sides they offer cole slaw, okra, fries, hush puppies, jalapenos, onion rings, mozzarella sticks and jalapeno poppers. For desserts they offer cheese cake, peach cobbler, banana pudding and assorted cakes. I really like their fries and jumbo shrimp. The jumbo shrimp are HUGE! The wings are very good also, they're just on the small side. I like my wings big like at Honeybee's in Homewood.I don't know what kind of magic unicorn pixie dust they sprinkle on their food, but whatever it is, I can't get enough!After years of hearing a friend ask me if I've tried Hook Fish and Chicken yet, I could finally answer yes.  And then I finally understood why she kept asking.  I tried the combo featuring 6 whole wings, fries, slaw and bread.  It was all just. So. Good.  The bread (your basic white sliced) is placed on the bottom, like a cloud that any grease from the wings can soak in to.  The wings and fries are packed into a styrofoam container and sprinkled with their infamous seasoning and then closed tightly with a rubber band placed around to keep all that goodness from spilling out.  The menu is basic, just pick your fried food of choice (wings, tenders, fish, shrimp) and sides (even fried okra).  My meal was $8.  It is cash only and take out only with an ATM on site.  You can call ahead but most orders are ready in ten minutes.  Be warned, you will become an addict.  "Why did I only get 6 wings?" I kept asking myself as I have been dreaming of those wings ever since.

I am impressed! We got a Winner! This Gem of a restaurant is right behind my house, amazing how many times I have passed by and not stopped in to give it a try. What the hell have I been waiting for? Went to dinner with my pal Karen tonight and said this is the night we try something new! This restaurant is very comfy and cozy, love the booth seating so relaxing. What we ordered: PORK PHAD THAI NOODLES, (thin noodles) mmmm melt in your mouth, nice flavor with that hint of sweet. BBQ CHICKEN W/ SHRIMP FRIED RICE, 1/2 of a chicken, generous portion, I had to take a thigh home I was soooo stuffed.

Lip and finger licking good, almost had another mouth orgasm, I was sooooooo close!Black sweet iced tea, I swear must have had 5 refills this time.Service amazing as always!My first and last time eating at Thai Original BBQ.  Oooooh, how dramatic!  I bet you can't wait to see what disaster I incurred!   Well, none.  I got the right food that I ordered, it was close enough to being available at the time promised, and the service and price were fine.   No, the reason I won't be back is that compared to all of the other quality Thai offerings Vegas has to offer, it simply wasn't good enough.  I will be the first to admit that Thai BBQ is suffering the affect of being the ~21st Thai restaurant I've tried here in Las Vegas, many of which are outstanding in every aspect.  I can't help but compare any new Thai restaurant to class acts such as Weera Thai or Prommares, neither of which is exceptionally far from this location of Thai BBQ.   All that being said, let's get to it:I called in my order of a Chili Chicken lunch special because it seemed closest to what I normally order when I get Thai and also because of the lovely photo uploaded of the same dish in the photos here.  No seriously, look at this beautiful dish:  http://s3-media2.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/IBxLi-C_it0Rm-m6N0TQDg/l.jpg     I was told it'd be ready in 15 minutes and I arrived probably a few minutes beyond that.Upon entering it took a few minutes for the solitary server to get my order.  It wasn't an extremely long wait and she did seem very busy waiting actual tables so it didn't bother me.  If she was on her phone using snapchat or tumblr or sextor or whatever new app the kids use nowadays, I'd be a little more bothered by this.  Got back to my office and was a little disappointed in a few things.  1) That pic I posted above?  Mine looked nothing like that.  The chicken was chopped up sloppily and not beautifully ground up as you see above.  It was like going to Wendy's and expecting to get that 99 cent burger that can barely fit in Wendy's mouth on the commercial, only to receive one that your pet hamster can gobble in one bite.  2) No eggroll.   As a matter of fact, there was nothing but the chicken dish and the rice.  Now nothing extra was promised or advertised, but it seems pretty customary for most Thai restaurants to provide SOMETHING with the lunch special besides the discount.  If anything it adds a little value that I could have used after being charged $2 for my brown rice upgrade.   The food that WAS provided, tasted okay, but not great.  The rice seemed a little mushier than I prefer, and as I mentioned before the chicken was pretty haphazardly chopped up.   Sorry Thai BBQ, that ultimately winds up being worth 2 stars.  If you'd have gotten to me a year ago, you probably would have eeked out a 3.  Where's Doc Brown when you need him?

Review Text :
For fast food, this place hits it out of the park. First off, the counter space, drink station and salsa bar are always clean. Service is prompt and courteous. As you might guess, (el POLLO loco) their specialty is chicken - "flame grilled," though I've never looked for the flames, personally. They offer all kinds of applications from whole chickens (wings, thighs, legs, etc.) to sandwiches, to tacos, burritos and salads. Heads up: the street tacos are TINY. The burritos are dense (loaded with beans, rice and cheese). Today, I tried the new jalapeno chicken sandwich. It was good but lots of condiments: jalapenos, pepper jack cheese, southwest sauce, lettuce and pico de gallo that distracted from the chicken. Interesting bread - like a hybrid between cibatta and a Wonder bun. They boast a citrus-marinade which they also use on their beef. I don't know that I've ever tried their beef though... the chicken is moist and flavorful. Maybe, one day, I'll mix it up a bit!Another cool thing about this place is: there are numerous options for combo "sides" including beans and rice but als fries, corn on the cob and mac and cheese and more!I'm surprised I had never eaten at El Pollo Loco.  But Jeff Lewis seems pretty fond of it, either that or El Pollo Loco pays him extreme amounts of money to eat it on the show.  And I LOVE that show, so I thought I might love El Pollo Loco, too.I went with the twice grilled chicken burrito, not sure if the twice grilled part referred to grilling the chicken twice or grilling the chicken once and then grilling the burrito.  It was the latter.  Anywho, filled with chicken breast, pico, sour cream, guac, and a little cheese, it was quite tasty, and probably pretty healthy wouldn't you think?  I like that you get a little bag of tortilla chips with your order.  Also sampled the black beans, but they were a barbeque bean, not my thing.It was fun to see strawberry soda on the fountain, too, which I had to have, much to my husband's horror.  This from the man who drinks orange soda routinely.  The restaurant was reasonably clean, but my shoes stuck to the floor, perhaps from someone else's sickeningly sweet strawberry soda.  It was a nice change to have your order brought to the table.  I hate the lingering at the counter you get at most fast food restaurants.Too bad my somewhat healthy burrito had 796 calories, and 39g of fat.  While I might return to El Pollo Loco if convenient, I wouldn't go out of my way for that kind of nutrition.  I would opt for a (insert name)berto burrito instead.And BTW, you can catch the new season of Flipping Out Tuesdays on Bravo.  Now that's useful information!

Need meat? Go to Oink!It was -1C outside, I could no longer feel my fingers, and my tummy was a-rumbling. I was on George Street but none of the cutsey cafes or restaurants were floating my boat. I knew what I wanted. Hot pig onna roll, with chilli sauce.I had heard of Oink before, through Yelp, and it was HIGH on my 'must try' list. So I took the extra 15 minute walk just to get here. I was not disappointed.As all the other reviewers have said, this is simple and does exactly what it says in the tin - or is on show in the window. Pork, slow roasted, inna roll with a few optional extras: haggis or sage stuffing; chilli or apple sauce; small, medium or large. Done, done and done.It's simply amazing. Hot pork, fresh from the pig (literally, it's in the window in all its tasty, crackling glory) on a fresh roll. Simple Scottish fare, no frills, but delicious.Sorry, there are no veggie options. Also, if you get squeamish about seeing the animal you're actually eating, it might not work. I am a self-confessed food snob. I don't like wasting my pennies or tummy-space on mediocre fare, and usually I'm a deli, fancy schmancy type. But whilst this is simple, it is very, very good. Although probably not for my arteries.Oh, quick note, there are no toilets when you sit in. Worth knowing.As tasty as the piggy looks from the outside, I wasn't too impressed with my oink sandwich. I ordered mine with BBQ sauce and after taking the first bite, I found the meat to be dry. I quickly asked for more sauce. You know it can't be that good if I'm asking for more sauce to make it taste better. In addition to the dryness, the meat was room temperature. I guess this is how they're served, but I would've preferred mine to be hot. Other than my not so special sandwich, the shop is cute since it's on a lovely street just off The Royal Mile. The workers weren't particularly friendly, but nice enough to serve me my sandwich. Some people love it, I just wasn't a fan...Well ...........................Oinky goodess in a bap!!!I went here a good few months ago, and I loved it !! How pllued pork has taken off and it is soo tasty. This little place is great for meat craving. We got a pulled pork roll with stuffing and we managed to grab a little seat next to the window and chomp chomp. Its not the fancied of places, infact id say that its more of a takeaway, grab and go styleee. Definatley worth trying and great value for money.

I've been a Las Vegas local for 35 years. I rarely go to The Strip and now I remember why!We politely declined the server's offer for another round of drinks. At which time, she told us that if we didn't spend another $10 per person, we would have to leave.I was OK with the fact that they had a $10 per person / per hour beverage minimum. I wasn't OK with the waitress telling me (3-minutes after I paid my bill): "you've already paid, so you can't just sit here....we have people waiting for tables". I was completely stunned! We had not even finished our drinks. For the record, there was no one waiting in line.As for the food, mediocre at best! As for the service, Josie G's face might have cracked if she smiled. This is an overflow restaurant. A place where diners go to eat when there are no other restaurants/seats available. My suggestion: if The Skybox is the only seat in the house, WAIT UNTIL ANOTHER SEAT OPENS!

Review Text :
Yimmy's is truly a delight. Yimmy's was one of those establishments that I just bustled past work day after work day. Until a lovely co-worker of mine invited me to join her there for lunch one day and off I went.  I did not know ahead of time what a pleasantly filling and hearty lunch I was in for. Yimmy's is a true hole in the way on the ground floor of a busy office space. It's located on Smithfield. On the inside there are two tiny tables that just barely fit inside of the restaurant. I am no sandwich girl so I played it safe and opted for a ham and cheese.  This sandwich knocked my socks off. It was piled high with salty chipped ham and two thick slices of American cheese, freshe romanie lettuce , tomato and just the right amount of mayo, with a pickle spear. Thanks Yimmy's you make a mean sandwich that left me well fed and happy for the rest of the day.

Well, that girl we all know that is "Always Fresh" and "Always Juicy" is hanging out here at Terminal 2 at Sky Harbor Airport. (Isn't that conflicting images? Just Sayin'!)No, she isn't waiting to meet a Pilot sugar daddy. She is here to give him some of her hot goodness. Dave's little girl is all grown up now, even though she still has freckles and pigtails. Of course I am talking about Wendy. Who did you think I was talking about?When I lived here in the Valley of the Sun 6 years ago, this Terminal was pretty sad, old and tired. But they have done their best to update it, and add more fast food choices, like Wendy's. I haven't tasted Wendy's Hot and Juicy offerings in a long time. They now have many breakfast combos including an attempted upscale sausage egg melt panini. They also have what the military would call S.O.S, or commonly known as "Sh*t On a Shingle" (Creamed chipped beef on toast). But here it is on their biscuit, true to there southern image, although I believe their HQ is in suburban Ohio. They have several SOS type options, including sausage and chicken.I tried the $4.59 2 sausage and egg burrito combo. It sounds like a great deal until you realize  that the burritos are about the size of a Milky Way bar. Still, like Wendy, they were Fresh and Juicy.This used to be an A-OK restaurant when they first opened. Who doesn't like a square burger and have it cooked to order?Been coming here on and off since day ONE. Usually the food is pretty tolerable and it gets me to my next location - Wally World. Just park the car in the middle of the parking lot and you only have to get out of the car once.This location seems to always be a little tricky. The French Fries are normally cold and we have to go up and ask for some fresh ones. The Burgers and Chicken Sandwiches are not too bad depending on the roll of the dice and whether it is a full moon or not.Service is rather poor and the inside could probably use a makeover. Today they asked me for my name and somehow they interpreted (Mark) for Bark. Could this just have been a Freudian slip or are we making Dog noises at me?It almost seems that ever since the famous Dave Thomas left the picture this place has just gone downhill in general. Plus we miss the old lady with the white hair in the commercials. Ok ... WHERE"S THE BEEF?2.25 STARS

Review Text :
Yeah doggie, doggie. This is what I'm talking 'bout Madison. Food. Service. Atmosphere. Check. Check. Check. I had the opportunity to whisk Elites Bob S and Scrantz outta their home while they are without kitchen and met them down the street for my first jac attack. I dug it. Lots. First off without even asking the waitress let me know I could try any beer I wanted (it's like she saw the indecisiveness coming outta my pores). She grabbed a taste of Oso;s Hop Whoopin' which on tap is pretty spectacular. Not as hoppy as I thought (score, as I'm just learning to embrace bitter... I'm a naturally cheery person) with grapefruit notes (my fave of the round citrus). For din din I went with the fried cod (3rd week in a row I've had fish fry) and I have to tell you, it was one of the best I've had. For frozen, battered deep fried cod, it was pretty darn flaky. You can get potatoes pancakes alongside but I opted for frites and I'm glad I did. They're seasoned really nicely and served hot... like frites should be. (If you get the Mussels which Bob did, frites are served in this cornucopia like contraption that makes it look like they go on for daaaaaaays. Easy sharing!) Scrantz had a roasted veggie salad with an amazing smoked salmon atop. So much smoky flavor in the bite she shared with me. All in all I was quite pleased with my first trip and can't wait to go back to try more of the menu. (It's probably no coincidence that my favorite restaurant in Tucson... old stomping grounds... is Jax!)I had been wanting to try this place for a long time and this weekend was finally able to do so. It's seriously so good. I can't wait until my next visit. Honestly thank god I don't live within walking distance because I'd be broke.They don't take reservations, but we called on our way there and the host said he had a table for 2 if we got there within 15 minutes. We did, and sure enough our table was waiting for us (awesome). We started off with a beer and cider for me, and could tell right from the get-go that the service was going to be stellar. And it was throughout our dinner.We had the almond stuffed dates as an appetizer and they were absolutely phenomenal. Best thing I've eaten in a very long time. We then split the roasted beet salad and pheasant flatbread (gluten free). Both were divine. I was particularly impressed with how yummy the gluten free flatbread was, it was clear that it was homemade. The entrees might be a little pricey, but it's so worth it. Best meal I've had in quite some time, and even my mom agreed. I cannot wait to come back!We stopped by for happy hour. The bloody marys were average at best. The bartender was an exquisite jerk. Rude, negligent, and brusque, he charged us full price for our drinks, and after we pointed out that it was happy hour, he stated "oh yeah, the only reason you're here." We didn't eat anything, so I'd feel bad totally slamming the place, but man, get your service mentality together guys. That was just bad.

Review Text :
Had a delicious steak and strong drink with the wife. The salad was tasty (a bit heavy on the dressing) but the calamari was on point. Would definitely go back again as it was worth the cost.This was my first time eating at this location in the Old City, I had previously eaten at their downtown location several years back so I new what to expect, or did I? For a starter I ordered escargot stuffed mushroom caps with garlic herb butter which I have had in countless locations but nothing like this, the mushrooms and snails worked perfectly together and the garlic butter herbs was more of a rich emulsion, thick, decadent and a flavor that will have you swooning. My Salad was mixed field greens, garden vegetables with a vinaigrette and I asked for goat cheese and walnuts. The dressing didn't have quite enough vinegar for me but I had a lemon wedge from my water which took care of that, still and all, it was a wonderful fresh nicely presented green salad. The Keg is known for it's Canadian beef, especially It's Baseball Cut Top Sirloin which I had not had before, so I ordered it cooked rare with garlic mashed potatoes and green beans. This cut of meat is so thick it can only be guaranteed rare or a medium rare without burning the out side, so don't try to order it any other way. It was cooked to a perfect rare with all the tenderness of a Filet Mignon and the wonderful intense beefy flavor of a sirloin. The garlic mashed potatoes were perfect along with the green beans. This was a very good steak dinner and the escargot...well you will have to go and see for yourself because words are woefully inadequate to describe this rich garlicky buttery herb flavored delightful escargot preparation!!!

Review Text :
3 1/2 starsIf I may I'd like to begin using a new phrase: Hole-In-The-Strip-MallThese are little hole-in-the-wall establishments -- no,... joints -- that come in and set up shop in an empty pad at a strip mall without really remodeling beyond cleaning up a bit and hanging some thing on the walls.Tasty House is a brand spanking new Hole-In-The-Strip-Mall occupying the carcass formerly known as Panda King Express at about 15th Avenue on Bell Rd in the glorious NoPho wastelands.They offered a quick, friendly greeting and a huge menu of fresh-cooked ameri-chino fast food.  A large selection of Lunch Specials for $4.95 caught my eye, coming with your choice of steamed or fried rice, and choice of egg roll, drink, or soup (choice of egg drop, hot&sour, or wonton).Get the idea there are lots of choices here?  This is no terriyaki bowl assembly line; they've got just about every imaginable combination of vegetables, tofu, chicken, pork, beef, shrimp, and even offer Duck.I sat and she brought out the food after several minutes, hot and steamy.  The plate had a scoop of rice in a corner, and the rest was FILLED with my General Tso's Chicken -- seriously a ratio of about 80% meat.  She said that if I wanted any more rice or soup to just let her know.    8^ )   Great service!My first experience with the new Tasty House was tasty, indeed.  I believe the wonton soup was about tops that I've had, with no skimping on wonton, meat, onion/scallion bits, or especially flavor.I let them know that since they offer plenty of choices for non-spicy chicken (S&S, lemon, orange, pineapple) that they could notch up the spiciness on their General Tso's a bit.I will return to Tasty House, despite their bleak location, whether they pretty it up or not.  As long as the quality, portions, and flavor I had remain consistent this could become a four star regular cheap lunch for me, but if they did pretty up the digs, I'm sure a lot of others would feel that way, too.A hole in the wall Chinese fast food spot with some "tasty" options. Tofu dishes for veggie heads too!Ryan C described this place perfectly, so check out his review ( http://www.yelp.com/biz/tasty-house-chinese-restaurant-phoenix#hrid:dPH4TU9Ys-04gmbkYPj5Yg ) to get a good picture of what this place is like.I dropped in for lunch today and was also impressed by the $5 lunch specials. Unfortunately, they had zero tofu dishes available on the lunch special menu (there are 3 or so tofu dishes on the dinner menu). I inquired about this fact and they hooked me up with a custom tofu dish lunch special deal! Now that's good customer service!I got the tofu with vegetables dish, which is some tasty thinly sliced tofu, deep fried and doused in a ameri-chino sauce. A selection of vegetables is also tossed in, with white rice and a veggie eggroll finishing off the dish. All this for $5.XX! Noice!I really dug their tofu dish and the low prices. I'll be back to try their other offerings.Tasty House has 4 reviews -- two of which have been chosen as ROTD on separate occasions.They may have gotten lucky with the infamous yelp algorithm, but they really do deserve it.4.5 stars   ( even for a Hole-In-The-Strip-Mall )The quality, portion, and price all combine together in a trifecta of value.They are really friendly, ingredients are always fresh, and the food really is tasty!Fried/Steamed dumplings is a new favorite.  They are thicker and more doughy, like dim sum -- and delicious!

Review Text :
Looking for some late night grub, we stumbled across this taco shop chain on Blue Diamond.  The employees seem a little tired or lifeless, but what do you expect at a 24-hour joint!  Regardless, we were content after our meal, and had a great morning sleep.Out of all the items we ordered, my least favorite...even though I devoured the whole thing...was the taco de lengua.  Tongue lacked some flavor and wasn't tender enough. The taco was bigger (in size and cost) than what I'm used to.   Their chicken taco (crunchy shell) was a lot better....with a peppery taste and loads of cheese.  The Horchata was just okay for me...I had better.  But why complain when the Mexican drinks are bottomless like the other fountain drinks!?My favorite was the Carne Asada nachos, with a mountain of flavorful asada, cheese, cilantro, tomatoes, guacamole, and beans (we opted for no sour cream).  It was so good (and greasy), we ended up ordering another "mountain" to go.  Up next....Carne Asada Fries!

A new benchmark has been set for pubs in Las Vegas. In my initial review, I praised the amazing service and exceptionally friendly atmosphere of this hidden little gem on the western edge of town, but I also mentioned that the food was nothing to get excited about.Well that has all changed with Sagos new menu. I have two words - GREAT JOB!Moving the menu closer to the restaurants Baja theme, management has introduced a completely new menu filled with some great selections like fish and shrimp tacos, homemade pizza, a delicious chicken avocado sandwich, a new twist on the BLT with a tomato jelly that rocks and much more.If you go, and you will, you have to try the Ceviche - cradled in what looked like a sea-shell shaped crisp flour tortilla, the taste is fabulous and the serving size to price ratio will fill you up but still make you want to order another.Way to go Sagos, you guys have hit all the marks now - great food, great service, great atmosphere. I'll be there - soon.If a bar offers match play, we're there.  The reviews certainly didn't hurt the place either.  They had a "text and receive $20 match play" but they informed us it took 24 hours to put it on a player's card so we would get it the next time we came.  That's a lock for repeat business.  We also had a restaurant.com coupon but it wasn't necessary during happy hour since all drinks were $2 and appetizers were half off.  Everything is full price if you use the coupon.  We ended up ordering chicken fingers, chicken fajitas and the carne asada tacos.  Everything was just OK.  I didn't really like the tacos since the salsa was already put on them and the beef was kinda cold.Wednesday night was insane.  All the regulars were there for the video poker drawings they do so if you're planning to play, avoid Wednesday between 5pm and 8:30pm.  You will not get a seat at the bar.  The staff was friendly and attentive.   Went back again last week on a Tuesday to redeem the free play and got a plate of the carne asada nachos which were better than what we ate before.  All the patrons sure love their slots and everyone knows everyone else for the most part.  The restaurant area was dead both times but I imagine it would be packed for certain sports events since the TV's are decent.  The football deals sound sweet so maybe we'll try that in the fall.  They also just sent us another $20 match play in the mail along with a bogo entree coupon for signing up for their slot club.  I guess we're going back!

I wish so much that I could give this 5 stars!  I wish so much I could sit and work here for hours!  I wish so much... that they had internet!  That's the whomp, whomp moment right there...The cafe is adorable, set inside the beautiful Chatham Village.  Chatham Village in Mt. W is like this little Victorian colony of townhouses that you would never imagine are hidden up there.  But they're there.  And the residents are lucky enough to enjoy this adorable little coffee house right next door.But it's so much more than a coffee house.  They have a huge menu full of lunch offerings besides the drink menu.  The drink menu alone is impressive for a small, hidden cafe.  I ordered the roast beef panini with horsey sauce.  It was tasty and came with chips and a little bowl of oranges.  At $7, it was a steal!  Living up here I'd make this my go to meeting and work spot but it doesn't have wireless internet.  I hate to be a spoiled Millennials (okay, I'm barely that), but that's kinda annoying.  Maybe it's just that environment where it's not necessarily needed.  Don't know.  But I'll be back for a quick bite with friends fo sho!

I think this is one of my favorite places to be on a warm summer night.  I love to sit outside and gaze at all the twinklies....it is the most beautiful view of the city.  My man and I like to sit upstairs in the lounge area.  The bartenders are great.  The service is spot on.  Their food is really good too.  We always get the cheese tray, it has the best selection of cheeses and sweet touches like honey and fig marmalade.  I am a huge tapas fan so we typically get a bunch of appetizers and split them.  They have a nice wine selection and it is reasonably priced.  This place is really sexy.  Check it out.Can you say scrumptious?  Man, this place is what's up!  I mean seriously!  It's something about Italian food that makes me weak....I just love it.....but this place is just on another level.  Everything is fresh and homemade pasta.......homemade pasta?  Who does that?  Certainly none of the Italian spots I've been to.  All I can say is I hope this place is around for a very long time because I am in food love!I'll get to the food in a sec, but I was digging the plush dining upstairs and the incredible view of the qc.  They have tables and sofa's outside on both levels so I imagine it gets very lively in the summer.They start you off with bread and a bean spread that my 4 year old loved(I swear the kid will eat anything:-) The brushetta had a shrimp salad topping instead of the normal tomato mix, and it had a bit of a pepper kick to it, but it was good.  The bolognese and the smoked chicken and spinach agnolotti was some of the best Italian food I ever eaten.....ever!  I mean change your facial expression with every bite good!  Let's keep this place in business......for my own selfish reasons:-)A Vivace Tale...A long, long time ago... there was a date night.... And it went a lil like this...Well, wasn't the best experience for a restaurant, but the positives...  The waiter was very attentive.  I think I drank about a gallon of water before we got our appetizer, which was the eggplant dip (Perfect)   He also offered a GREAT wine which complimented the meal very well!  I try for a vegan diet, which can be hard if you don't call ahead, so the options here are extremely limited, I got a cheese-less pizza ( a fail-safe at any Italian establishment) and it was more of a tasteless one.  But the company was good :)  If you make a reservation, ask for a table that's separate from the wall or not along the windows.  Awkward Turtle moment when you have to move someones purse to get to your seat on the bench as they managed to cram an extra table in.  If you get stuck at one of those tables, be prepared to have little privacy and be involved in a myriad of conversations that are going on around you.THEY GET A 4!  So, this is an update to an earlier review, I was contacted by a few of the customer service reps and they insisted we try it again!  So, they get a star for wanting to impress us!  I'm in!  LOL, so I will definitely update this soon!  Vivace is trying for a FIVE star, and I'm looking forward to it!Once upon a giftcard...So, thanks to an attentive management staff, we tried Vivace again... SCORE!  It was amazing!  We took the suggestion of wine and was without a doubt, right on point!   The chef prepared a 3 course vegan meal and it was A-Maze-Ing, I got lost in the flavors!  YUM!  The appetizer was a variation of Bruscetta that was made very decadently with butternut squash and flavored with vinaigrette.  Mouth waterin' good! :)  On to the main course, was a great hodge podge of arugula, shrooms, squash, broccoli and many more that I can't remember... Let's just say I got my servings in that day!  The flavor was awesome.  dessert was really done very well as well, with apples and cinnamon in a flaky pizza dough wrap topped with raspberry syrup and powdered sugar!  Welll, hheeelllooooo there!!! Great job Vivace, we shall return, And they lived happily ever after!:-P**Gem Alert**I have found another rare delight in Charlotte. This restaurant is right outside of Uptown but worth the travel. It begins with a perfect ambiance that is extremely complimentary to an all around delightful dining experience. You are able to bring your own bottle of wine and that truly helps keep your check in check. They prepare all the pasta on site and it is deliciously fresh. We started off with the mussels appetizer and we couldn't get enough. So many mussels!! And the sauce is the kind that you need to soak up every last drop with the bread. Which we did! For my entrée, I order the Smoked Chicken and Spinach Stuffed Angolini.. MMMMMmmmmmmmmm (see picture).. It was superb. My wife ordered some shrimp and pasta dish that I didn't try because my face was glued to my plate (See 2nd pic). I wish I went a little slower and enjoyed it more, but that is what the second trip is for. Right? I obviously recommend this restaurant and suggest you put it high on your list of places to try in the area.Helpful Facts:* Free valet parking* Great bar are if you have to wait* Huge wine selection if you don't want to byob/byow* Excellent service and knowledgeable staffEnjoy!-Ian M.Oh, Vivace. I had long wondered why I was never a huge fan of Italian cuisine. Too many experiences of overly-filled plates of pasta with heavy, sweet sauce I suppose. My negative streak was meant to be broken here! Vivace has tuned my palate to the finer side of Italian eating. These guys have a killer location in Metro and their space is coveted by many. Juxtaposition alone lands them a whopping high-five. Hello, greenway and view of Uptown. Little did I know before my visit. We stumbled in on a lazy afternoon for a 3:30pm lunch. Perfect timing for a quiet meal on the patio. We had one of their over-sized umbrellas all to our selves with a glorious Uptown backdrop. We weren't even aiming for romantic but it comes standard on the patio. Huge fan.Our server was very helpful and knowledgeable with the menu. Took into account the weather (rather hot) and recommended some refreshing appetizers and drinks. Greatly appreciated his recommendations. I ordered a Limon Cello. Fresh lime juice, triple sec and soda water. Here's the breakdown on the "Cellos." Not an instrument. Nay. In fact, there are several choices and all made from fresh fruits and juices in house. Quite impressive and the freshness doesn't lie. Apps: Bruschetta. Holy wow. This is the best bruschetta I've had in the Queen City to date. Perfectly balanced with fresh bread, sweetness and fresh basil. The tomatoes are smoked in house. Yes, I said smoked. The flavor is incredible. Comes with six 1-2 bite pieces. Each should be savored and perhaps taken from your fellow diners if they aren't paying attention. I was tempted to lick the plate. Incredible flavors swirling on each crostini of joy. Cheese Plate. Man. What a treasure trove. We chose all 6 cheeses to try. Served on a woodblock with bread, honey, an apricot marmalade and a cranberry chutney-ish jam. Each cheese had it's own interesting note. Spicy, sweet, fermented, strong, mild and so on. No combination was incorrect with the jams and honey. I'd get this again in a heartbeat. Entree-ish: Prosciutto di Parma pizza. The dough was thin, chewy and served as a perfect catalyst for the rest of the flavors. Fig spread, Gorgonzola and arugula danced very lightly on my palate and complimented one another nicely. This pizza was great. The proscuitto was only on half since my wife is a vegetarian but it was great. Mild and salty like it should be. Dessert: Pistachio gelato. Creamy and choc a boc filled with pistachio pieces. Served with a biscotti. I only wish there had been a few more pieces of biscotti since it worked so well with the gelato. So glad to have tried Vivace finally. Looking forward to heading back in the near future for a further look into their pizzas and greater entree selection. Cheers! (or, Ciao!)I don't know why but Italian restaurants have never been on my go-to list when it comes to dining out. I think it was the result of dining at too many Italian restaurants that hardly impressed - heck, I could cook Italian better than that.BUT I'm a big fan of Vivace. It's Italian cuisine on a whole different level: refined and delicious! I've been to Vivace a couple of times before and I liked it - but we're rarely near Midtown so we hardly make it in. Big mistake. We need to make into Vivace on a regular basis!We arrived on Friday evening after work and were seated in a booth with a great view of their open kitchen. I love seeing all the action in the kitchen. The chef was nice enough to send out an amuse bouche of a perfectly seared scallop with olive oil.  It was a perfect bite. After looking over the menu - everything sounded so awesome - my husband and I decided to start with the fried calamari. It was crispy and tender at the same time.  Perfect calamari.For my dinner, I ordered the primi of the pappardelle bolongnese with goat cheese crema and a big bowl of mussels!  My husband ordered the larger size of the risotto with crab and corn. When my pappardelle came out, our server brought out another dish of their special homemade pasta with squash, squash blossoms, and sea urchin butter for my husband because the chef didn't want him to be without a plate. Super classy chef! Now, when I heard sea urchin, I perked up, my hubby, on the other hand, looked terrified. But he ate all of it and is no longer a sea urchin virgin!  I also cleaned my plate of pappardelle :)At this point we were getting full and wondered how we were going to get through our entrees. But when our entrees arrived, feelings of fullness were pushed aside and we dug in.  My mussels were perfect (I know, I say perfect a lot) but they were. A savory broth with the sweet tender, mussel meat. My hubby's risotto was perfect (again!) - I snagged a bite and declared that I was going to order the risotto next time. You're probably thinking we passed on dessert but when we heard that they were rolling out their new dessert menu we had to try something! Something turned out to be 4 desserts: Cinnamon sugar focaccia with honey, marscarpone cheesecake with a homemade graham cracker crust, chocolate bomba with ice cream and a cherry inside, and espresso ice cream with cherries. OMG - I loved every one of these desserts. The focaccia was light and airy, the cheesecake had a wonderful texture, the bomba was decadent, and the ice cream was was rich and creamy.Needless to say, we were stuffed. Our server was great, she was super attentive and very knowledgeable of the menu. The restaurant is beautiful and I love the modern decor. Vivace changed my thinking when it came to restaurants serving Italian cuisine. They've done it so right that they have ruined me for any other Italian restaurant. We'll definitely be back.I recently attended an event in their private upstairs dining space. This space is FANTASTIC for private events, small receptions, or even (hint, hint), holiday functions! It has a private and fully-stocked bar, a large space that can be appointed to seat a fair number of guests (or, set up for over 100 if you do hors d'oeuvres (lighter food far, antipasto, appetizers...). Additionally, there is a beautiful (really nice!) private terrace/balcony up there. I was able to meet the event manager David, and he was delightful. I'll try to remember to upload a picture of his card. He was very bright-eyed-and-bushy-tailed, and super friendly. The way they do events is quite simple, and reasonable... you don't have to pay a deposit, instead, you simply sign a contract committing to rent the space, and have a minimum to spend on food/bev. So if you want to have a sit down dinner with x guests, he'll just work with you and say we just need you to spend at least $x on food and beverage. I'll add, this is exactly how we've done it at Ruth's Chris and other CLT establishments for my holiday parties. You also have the option of setting a specific menu, going a la cart, or, picking what apps/etc you want set out or passed. They'll work with you. Also, they have complimentary valet (don't forget to tip!). This is a MUST for any restaurant in Charlotte. While there is a free and close parking deck, I prefer the convenience of pulling up and letting someone else worry about finding a spot. :) Plus, (random factoid), they're next to Trader Joes - so you can stock up on that oh-so-delicious Cookie Butter. Dang it, now I want Cookie Butter. I digress...The particular event I went to only had hors d'oeuvres, which simply means I didn't get a chance to try their entrees or pastas (which I would have liked to try). Oh well, it gives me a goal next time I'm there. So what did I try? I first had what the waiter said was blue cheese stuffed fig. Errr... I like fig, and I love blue (or any kind of funky-) cheese, but I was not a fan of this. But, don't let that discourage you because many of my fellow guests did seem to enjoy it. For me, the ratio of bold cheese (really bold!) to fig was off. Dare I say, too much cheese? GASP! I said it... oh well. (Though, really, you can't ever have too much cheese... or bacon.) Darn, I'm off track again. Ok... where was I? Oh yes, hors d'oeuvres. They had oodles of olives (that's fun to say... try saying it 10 times fast!). The olives were fresh, flavorful and diverse. Yum! They also had blue cheese stuffed olives, which I enjoyed! Of course, you have to appreciate both olives and blue cheese - if you do, this would be a treat. We had a huge antipasto platter to pull from. It had an olive spread (almost like a tapenade meets hummus), which was good on their pita-breads. They had an assortment of quality meats (spicy and yummy salami and pepperoni), and even better quality cheeses on the platter. Now, the show stopper for the night was the cheesy fried risotto balls. Let me be clear, if you dine here (event of not), you MUST ORDER THESE! Delicious and perfectly balanced. They went very quickly, and despite the lovely staff hustling to refill them, they would run out many times before the platter made it to the table. That good!Lastly, I cannot forget to comment on the drinks. They had VERY STIFF drinks (read: strong). This I actually think is an upsell... I had trouble drinking my mixed drink, but generally, when I pay the market rate for a mixed drink, I want value in the booze-to-mix ratio. This place has it down! Of course, they have a great assortment of wine and beer as well.So, while I can't comment on the traditional dining service, or the heavier entrees, I do recommend Vivace based on my experiences here. Great location, easy to get to, valet parking, and quality ingredients in a modern-but-sleek restaurant.

Caribbean, mon!Some water in the desert.Get the chili dog!Dillon's is a chain down in Arizona.  BBQ is their specialty.  Kind of like the Famous Dave's of the Southwest.  Have been to the Glendale location in the past.  Solid.  This place brings it to another level.  Situated on Lake Pleasant, just outside of old timers land in NW Phoenix burbs. They have a vernicular to get you down to the Lake? How cool is that? I am sure that I will appreciate that in my later ages when I retire down there in my golden years.  Look at the old guy getting busy!:http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dillons-morristown?select=wkEu8lVCFfLLd9oek0jHqA#wkEu8lVCFfLLd9oek0jHqAAnyways, their chili dog is out of this world.  See my picture.  Comes on a hamburger bun with two sliced dogs, topped with cheese and jalapenos and BBQ pulled pork.  Just died and went to heaven.  Gives the Gopher Bar a run for its money. 4.99999!

Chai!  After days of thinking about it, I finally had chai.  I feel really guilty that I hadn't been here before, since I can literally walk here.  Comfy couches, lots of tables!  One even had a gigantic checkers game on it.  Three huge video screens on the wall.  I'm not sure what mood the owner was in last night, but it was all Madonna (yeah, bitches!), Shakira and Britney videos.  OMG she did a remake of "I Love Rock n Roll" which really pisses me off.  *grumble*Anyway, they have a pretty big menu.  Their hours are awesome:  They're open till midnight during the week and 24/7 on weekends.   FTW!  Now I know I have somewhere to go late at night for a hunk of cheesecake.This place needs some decor.  I mean, the pointsettia was nice and all, but what happens after Xmas?  Walls are bare except for the screens playing girl-pop.  They make all their own desserts (except for the muffins) and have a large coffee/tea menu.  I'll be back.  If I see that Britney video again, though, I will slay kittens.

If you are in the Glendale/northwest Phoenix area and are craving good Chinese food, this is the place to go. The restaurant is very clean and nicely appointed, and the staff is very friendly. A quick glance at the prices in the menu will immediately tell you that  your dining experience will be very easy on the wallet. The quality of the food is definitely above that of most of the Chinese restaurants in this area of the Valley. Since I'm often in this area, often hungry, and often craving good Chinese food and have a limited budget,  I believe I've found a new favorite dining spot.

We (me and husband) are pretty happy with the location of this new wine bar, since it's within bike-riding distance from our house. The decor is nice, cool patio with couches, full bar and a nice little menu. We met some friends there last Friday night thinking it would be semi-quiet since it just opened, but it was pretty busy, not complaining, I'm happy places around here are busy. The only thing is it was packed with cougars, cougars acting like 20-year-olds, so not really our thing. But maybe it will calm down after it's open a little longer, crossing our fingers, we really wanted to like this place.02/04/10Happy hour w/ Violeta.  Loved the furniture (dark wood and slightly reminiscent of old Mission churches or Spanish villas that one may find back home- I'm from the Philippines), and the ambience.  I liked how the doors/paneling opened up to a patio- it was a little chilly that afternoon, but I imagine that w/ the perfect weather we have now, happy hour at TLR would FEEL nice.  What I did not like about the LR is that it was NOISY.  Now, I didn't mind so much that the music selections were eclectic (country to jazz to classic rock, and even Motown); After all, we were AT The Living Room, and, as in different households, one can find different music playing.  No, it was just too noisy.  I'd hate to imagine what conversing would be like if the doors opening up to the patio were closed...  What I also noticed was that while there were smatterings of all age groups (there were even children running around in the patio!), most of the people there were in their mid-40s to mid-50s.  I usually check out happy hours at restaurants for the food offered, and not to meet potential love interests, and this venue would definitely be somewhere I'd just go for the food MYSELF.  I can't even picture being able to do some work on my laptop here... maybe it'll be different in a few months?Service was a little bit lacking, but the place was packed!  A chair was even taken from our table (I didn't mind, but I think V. did, since she was keeping her fingers crossed that her hubby would join us).  As for the food, we were going to keep it light by ordering bruschetta.  (I knew that TLR was affiliated w/ Scottsdale's 5th & Wine, and I had tried and enjoyed the bruschetta there.)  The bread pieces here were sliced much thicker than those at 5th, and while they may have reminded me of Postino's bruschetta, the flavors, while good enough that I enjoyed the dish, made me wish I was at Postino's, or even at 5th & Wine.  Especially when it was so noisy we had to raise our voices to hear each other; Violeta wasn't enjoying the music; and children were running around not two feet away from me.I would like to give TLR another chance, and hopefully, my guests and I will find a younger crowd (no children present, please!) to enjoy the ambience, music, and food with.Don't ask my why, but I was pleasantly surprised and not expecting to find a place like the Living Room hidden on Queen Creek Road. But, I'm happy to see that it exists! When I arrived, the exterior looked like a winery and should have been surrounded by grapevines instead of parked cars. I walked through the entry of large wooden doors and to the left drinkers lounged in an open bar area while restaurateurs ate in the surrounding tables. The atmosphere was cozy and true to a wino's environment with dark wood and wine everywhere. The restaurant was surrounded by a patio equipped with my favorite: fire places! Since it was a cold night, a fire place was a perfect touch. At first it seemed like we were under dressed for the atmosphere, but after looking around in more depth, I noticed that people were dressed in everything from Scottsdale bar goer clothes to jeans and t-shirts. So I came to the conclusion that like more places in AZ, any attire goes as long as your clothed. The food was decent for the type of food they offer. We shared the bruschetta trio to start which was similar to other wine bars I've visited. I went the salad route which was like a Mary Poppins salad because it didn't seem to ever disappear! The sandwiches also looked tasty but if you're hungry with an appetite, I suggest getting an appetizer with your entree. Men, do go here expecting a hearty meal. I would suggest ordering two appetizers and your entree if you're really hungry. So in summary, this really did feel exactly like a living room and now I want to check out their newest location on 7th!I sure wish my living room looked like this place! Great interior design with a classy, sophisticated atmosphere. I recently planned my boss's 50th birthday here and we had a great evening! Thanks for great service, we had one dedicated server and he was on it! We also planned to have appetizers and pizzas delivered throughout the evening and it worked out perfectly! We had some flatbread pizzas, bruschetta planks, spinach artichoke dip, sliders and cheese fondue. Plenty for all of our guests and everything kept disappearing so we clearly enjoyed it! The restaurant was packed on this particular evening and the staff handled it like champs. I would hold other parties or events here, making sure to plan the menu and discuss our wants with a manager ahead of time. I totally forgot to mention the layout of this restaurant. It's pretty cool. There are a few really neat wrap around patios. And inside the dining room has an open layout with smaller little nooks for larger groups. Check it out, you'll definitely be comfortable in this living room!Chandler can be pretty darn cool. Just take a look at The Living Room, a happening indoor/outdoor bar with an attractive wait staff, tasty sangria and om nom nommable eats. Now that I work in Chandler full-time, it's quickly become my favorite go-to for happy hour and lunch, with a vibe that's more downtown Phoenix than family-filled suburbs.The place is open and airy, with the indoors spilling out to the patio, no wall dividing the two. Dark wood and burnt orange furniture decorate the space, with the funky color scheme giving the spot a Mediterranean vibe. Comfy couches surrounded by fireplaces outside are perfect for lounging, while high-tops and an expansive bar with sports televisions inside give drinkers and diners more options.The place gets packed during "normal" happy hour time, but if you're a day drinker, you're in luck, since happy hour prices are available from open to 6 p.m. Definitely try a glass of sangria ($5 during happy hour) - I loved the red version I got, since it was really fruity but strong. There's an extensive wine list, as well as a mixed cocktail selection, if fruity sangria isn't your thing.The food at The Living Room is also mighty tasty. The Caprese sandwich ($9.95), with thick mozzarella, a pesto sauce, juicy grape tomatoes and a balsamic glaze that perfectly ties everything together, is delicious. I love it with a mixed green salad with lemon caper vinaigrette - the salad reminds me of another favorite salad of mine, at The Main Ingredient in Phoenix.Even if you don't live in Chandler, I'd say The Living Room is a destination spot and should entice you to venture out South if you don't usually head that direction.Patios like this with the AZ weather are the best! We had a good size group and took up most the patio but the server was able to keep our drinks filled and food when we wanted it with no problems! They have a good wine selection, great appetizers, and great service. There was live music on Sunday evening. I am really glad to have found this spot that I didn't even know existed. The brucetta's were great, I had 3 of them! Someone in our group said the cheese dip was really good as well. 2 glasses of wine and 3 bruchetta's were a good deal at just over $20.

I love Chinese food. There I said it. Now I can get this review properly underway.I'm not that familiar with the south hills because I'm a city kid. I don't venture outside unless I have reason to. A friend invited me out that way for dinner here knowing how much I enjoy Chinese food and she said she just knew I would like it. Boy was she right.Silk Road is located in the heart of Caste Village in Whitehall (which that itself I need to explore more). It's modestly decorated and basically looks like your run of the mill sit down Chinese restaurant.Every time I go to Silk Road I order the following:Appetizer: Spicy Wontons. I was turned onto the spicy wonton at Silk Road and have been loving them ever since. It's the traditional wonton from your wonton soup with a spicy peanut sauce. I believe you get 8 of them for $6.Snack: Egg roll. They probably have one of the best egg rolls ever.Entire: Pineapple beef. I NEVER order a beef dish when I eat Chinese except for at Silk Road. The pineapple beef is probably THE best Chinese meal I've ever eaten. I feel horrible because I feel any description I give it will not to it justice. The portion is enormous so no matter how greedy I'm feeling there is always plenty to take home (side note: I always ask for extra rice)Dessert: Fortune Cookie, duh.Please, please, please go eat there! And maybe try something else because I'm not sure if I can be persuaded to change my order anytime soon.

What a gem!  How does anyone find it?  This mom and pop shop is securely tucked away behind Providence Road.  You could throw a rock either direction and hit Providence Cafe or Wolfman Pizza but still never see it from the street.  So there's strong support from regular customers keeping them open.  As a matter of fact, they're only open from 11 to 3 for lunch so we went and I got a ham sandwich that's pretty good.  The meat is high quality but the bread is plain store bought bread.  But then I realized the real deal is the burgers, so I'll be back to try one out.  All sodas are in bottle form and the mesquite bbq chips are great.  Water in a tall cup is free.  I like that they don't force you to buy a bottle.I saw an awesome looking Cuban sandwich and while standing in line a short five minutes three different people ordered the rueben sandwich, so that also sounds like one of  their specialties.  Give 'em a go!I walked into Mueller's today, starving, it was 315p, I asked what was their closing time.  3p.  But they graciously made a burger for me. That is way beyond the call of duty. Very nice.  And the burger was damn fine too.

Everything up to the point of my wedding went well.... the ladies are very on top of the whole ordering process and very nice to deal with. I wouldn't have even written a review except I feel like they could have been a little more apologetic  about delivering my wedding cupcakes late to my reception. I had all my guests sitting watching the assembly of my cupcake tower when they were to be delivered an hour before the reception was set to start. Then I get an email notifying me that I was late making final payment but since they neglected to call me to ask for payment they were going to wave any and all late charges.... Um, if GSS had called me right after my wedding I would have paid the balance in full so I really didn't understand the email letting me know how kind they were to wave late charges that would have been their issue to begin with since they neglected to phone me to get the balance after services were rendered. It was kind of like they wanted to write me and tell me how kind they were waving the late charges when it was their fault for not calling me sooner. When I emailed them back explaining that I was disappointed with how late the cupcakes were delivered all I got was a "sorry".... "please call us as soon as possible and make final payment".... not what I expected. Cupcakes were cute and tasted pretty good, from what I was able to taste.... a little pricey but that's the trend I guess. I was disappointed in their lack of remorse over the late delivery and their annoying email about neglecting to call me for payment, I think I should have at least received some kind of a peace offering.Sealing the deal!I saw the sign facing the 215 for weeks.  Drove by one day only to find out it wasn't open for business yet.  As the weeks went by, I stared longing at that sign EVERY damned day, wondering when the hell I was going to get my chance.Then, by chance, my wife decided she would get me some sugar and they were open!  She came home with a really nice bag that contained these attractive pink boxes with clear cellophane lids (presumably to see the contents, eh?).  Unfortunately for my review, she's not very detail oriented, so I can't really tell you the exact names of what she bought, nor can I even describe the store and what other goods they offer.   Here's what we ended up with, according to her recollection:1.  Cake pops: They were chocolate cake with a chocolate shell.  Besides my not understanding the whole cupcake fad (is it really going to last?), I have hated - no really HATED - the whole cake pop thing.  All the ones I've had were either tasteless, dry, way too dense or a combination thereof.  These, however, were the anti-thesis to all that I have hated (HATED) about cake pops.  These were rich, moist and cake-like (as opposed to tasting like they mixed a pound of frosting with some leftover crumbs to hold it all together).  The only thing I hated (HATED) about these particular cake pops is that they were too doggone small.  One bite.  That's all it took.  :(1.  Red Velvet cupcakes: ok, so it didn't take a genius to know what this one was.  These were tasty, but not as moist or rich as the red velvet I know and love.  Ok substitute, but not enough to make me crave them.2.  Peanut butter cupcake: I'm not really a fan of peanut butter pastries, so I didn't even take a bite.  She liked them, but she was short on adjectives, so I can't really elaborate.3.  Bacon Banana cupcake: un-holy-freaking-rock-my-sugar-tooth-believable.  If you know me, you know I'm a bacon addict.  This cupcake was a revelation, a total mouth f***.  But let me back up and start at the beginning.  Once upon a time, there was this little confection that didn't smell all that enticing.  Had it not been for the bacon chunks on the frosting, I would have skipped it.  The scent was a bit confusing, starting with overt rendered bacon fat tones and an undercurrent of burnt sugar.  Not the most appetizing combo in all honestly.  Anyway, after cutting it in two, only then could I smell banana, which really threw my nose for a loop.  Then I took a bite.  I can't say it was heaven, nor that it was the best thing I have eaten in my life.  What I can and will say is that the flavor combination just works.  The sweet of the frosting and salty of the bacon are harmonious, with the tropical banana adding a whole new dimension.  I love inventive dishes that a cook/chef prepares that tries to let you in on a secret.  Sometimes you're just not meant to understand that secret and other times, when you get it, it totally makes you respect the thought and effort behind the creation.  The bacon banana cupcake really sealed the deal for me.  I'll be back to try some other unique creations.  Whatever they're baking, gimme some sugar baby.After our Hot N Juicy UYE, most of the group headed here for dessert and was it a trip worth taking.  I had just bookmarked the new business--yesterday was their second day open--when Shirley and Teri decided we'd go here after the UYE if we weren't too full.We picked out what we wanted and took it to a large dining room type table with some fresh flowers for their grand opening.  I got a macaron that was filled with gif and goat cheese.  What a wonderful combination!  Light crisp outside shell and a smooth interior.  I also got a box of 6 macarons to bring home--maple bacon, s'mores, pumpkin, and Nutella.  I can't remember the other two but they look great and based on the one I ate last night, they will be good!!  The macarons are about 3 inches in diameter--more like the ones at Bouchon than other bakeries that sell them.While we were having our treats and chatting at the table, the owner came around with a sample of their rich hot chocolate.  It was very good.For those who have been to a movie or were out shopping, this is a nice place to stop and unwind a bit.  Order some wine and have a sweet.  The interior is very pleasant and the staff is great!  Considering this was their second day open, they did a great job when the seven of us descended on the place.  They're open late on Friday and Saturday.To the owner--after you've got everything in order there, open another location on the west side of town.  Then I'd see you more often.In the area and craving a sweet I decided to check my bookmarks and lo and behold Gimme Some Sugar popped up on my Yelp app bookmarks. Having heard some good reviews from trusted Yelpers I was excited to give them a try. I walked in and the place is super cute. Clean and well-decorated. I was greeted warmly by the three girls working at the counter. They were ready for any questions and had plenty of suggestions for me while I perished their inventory. I had my heart set on a macaron and they are huge. Interesting flavors as well. I decided on the fig & goat cheese and the maple bacon. I also had some questions on some pricing for specialty cakes and towers and they were very helpful and assisted me with all my questions and gave me lots of information and contact information if I decided to order something for the future. The macarons were flaky and moist. I didn't love the flavors, but they were ok. I took a few bites and didn't really feel the need to finish them. I'd be back if I'm in the area to see what else they have to offer.4.5 starsGimme Some Sugar is such a unique bakery on this side of town!  First thing I noticed is how luxurious and beautiful it is.  The sparkly and modern decor make me feel like I'm in a boutique hotel.  I'm taking a half star off simply because our chairs and table were very "wobbly".  The furniture, while beautiful, does not seem durable.  There are so many indulgent treats to choose from, e.g., mini NY style cheesecakes, huge macarons in a variety of flavors, cupcakes, cookies, cake pops, etc.  And almost everything can come with a little bit of a twist - a freshly baked cookie a la mode, a side of milk with your warm cookies, or add strawberries and balsamic to your cheesecake.  Delectable!  This bakery serves alcohol and is open until midnight on the weekends!  This is such a dangerous find for me considering I can practically walk to it from my house.  My late night dessert prayers have been answered!Gimme some sugar, gimme some artificial tasting frosting and then gimme my tooth brush. Sorry to be the buzz kill of the group, but I'm not loving what I had here. We ordered 3 different macarons, Nutella, Maple-Bacon and Late Night Snack. The first bite of each, all I could think of was how artificial it tasted. It tasted like someone had stuffed store bought cake frosting in between the macarons. I took a bite of each and couldn't finish any of them. The rest of their dessert cake wasn't that appealing. They had inidividual size treats, like dirt cake and the such, but each costing around $6? Gimme (no pun intended) a break. Way overpriced on all of their desserts here. Would much rather spend my money and calories elsewhere.How can somebody who's always had a sweet tooth like me not love this place? I've been telling myself I'll cut back on my sweets intake - it's been a battle that I keep losing. Since this shop is in the same complex as a  Gold's Gym - that's a good enough excuse to indulge in sweet treats, right?The shop is so cute. Black and white interior and the colors come from the beautiful cakes, pastries and macarons they have. I'm actually wishing my birthday was much sooner so I can get a birthday cake from here. They serve hot chocolate, tea and coffee, milk, juice, soda...and alcohol (at night). Champagne, wine and beer + dessert? Can I just live here? Before I continue, I must say that my love for macarons started when I first had them in Paris - oh l'amour! So, I'm not one of those that eat them because they're trendy or whatever. The fad can die but I'd still love macarons. These French cookies are my faves just like chunky chocolate chip cookies. I'd go to a macaron shop at every city I visit for comparison and get macarons in ALL their flavors. So, I'm glad the Vegas area has Gimme Some Sugar. My true test for macarons is pistachio macarons but unfortunately, they didn't have it when I went but I think you can special order items a day before.They have 10 macaron flavors at a time. I think 2 are seasonal flavors and 8 mainstays. I've tried 10 flavors: fig & goat cheese, Snickerdoodle, strawberries & champagne, Nutella, PB&J, grandpa's blueberry pancake, birthday cake, maple-bacon, Snickers Candy bar and chocolate-covered strawberry. I got 14 macarons - I had to get an extra fig and goat cheese macaron and 2 extra Nutella macarons. I also got a fresh fruit pavlova and a green tea cheesecake. As for the macarons, here's how each ranks:5/5: fig & goat cheese, Nutella, chocolate-covered strawberry4/5: Snickerdoodle, PB&J, Snickers candy bar, maple-bacon bar3/5: strawberries & champagne, grandpa's blueberry pancake, birthday cakeGreen Tea Cheesecake:I love green tea and not a lot of places have green tea cheesecake. The crust is crunchy. The cheesecake is deliciously creamy with a good green tea flavor. It's topped with a thin sesame nougatine and a raspberry. Amazing! 5/5Fresh Fruit Pavlova:A pavlova is a meringue topped with fruits. It's light and crisp. It's like a "healthier" dessert if you will. 5/5They warned me that the birthday cake was really sweet and that I shouldn't get it if I was torn between that and another flavor. Hooray for honesty! The fig & goat cheese macaron sounds a bit unusual but it's actually good since I love goat cheese. Sweet fig + tart goat cheese...yum! Nutella is a no-brainer...it's instant love for me. The strawberries & champagne sounded real good and looks so pretty and dainty but the flavors were mild but really sweet. I think the strawberry flavor needs to be more pronounced. I got lucky to have the last maple-bacon macaron. Score! The service is amazing here. Very friendly and honest. I was holding up the line with all the desserts I got and I felt bad for the people behind me who came in just to pick up 2 items. But one of the girls who was helping me out offered them a cookie so everything was fine and dandy. Sure, the desserts here cost an average of $7 apiece and the macarons are $3.50-4.50 each - the macarons are HUUUUGE though (the size of your palm or about 4 macarons) and the ingredients are of quality. Hello? I don't mind paying for something good. You can actually get $1 off with a Yelp check-in. And if you buy more than 6 macarons, you get 50cents off each additional you buy.I was smiling the whole time I was in the shop like a kid in candy store. My friend who was driving me around even said, "see! It's that smile that makes driving here worth it".There has been a lot of attention for this new bakery off of Stephanie and the 215 and I'll quickly chime in to add my experience with them.We visited the weekend they first opened and things were still new, kinks were still being worked out.  However, I did enjoy that first visit with the tasty pumpkin cheesecake.  A month later, I ordered a custom birthday cake for good friend, Shirley B., who's a big fan of Gimme Some Sugar.  I e-mailed GSS with my requests for a cake with a Hello Kitty and SF 49er theme because those are two of Shirley B.'s favorite things.  Ashley responded promptly and we coordinated on the details.  The resulting birthday cake was just the thing and the surprised look on Shirley's face when we presented the cake at her birthday dinner was priceless; she loved it.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gimme-some-sugar-henderson-3?userid=7Oe6ikklTjVBbEFw9emLcA#xMTMOVBqAc0YKsVJaeUGEAFirst-rate customer service from the beginning to the end with Ashley and her shop.  That is a rare thing indeed and I give them five stars all the way for filling the order above and beyond.  I'm a fan and we'll definitely be giving GSS more business in the future.Thanks Bethany E. for recommending Gimme Some Sugar. Located in a strip center in Henderson where parking was no issue.I happened to be in the area so I made it a point to stop in and check out the larger then norm macarons. I purchased two macarons - peanut butter and blueberry. Being a huge peanut butter fan I favored the peanut butter and thought the blueberry was on the overly sweet side. I also returned another day and tried the berry mascarpone but was disappointed the outer layer was on the hard side.Besides individual desserts I saw some of the custom cakes they make and was blown away by the creativity of the dessert chef here. If you're in the area stop in for a macaron  -  compared to a LV Blvd bakery they are a real bargain.Do I give it 3 stars? Do I give it 4? Usually if I can't decide I go with the lesser until they have proven me wrong. I think eventually I will up this review a star. But based on my first experience we will start with average. All of my yelp friends always talk about this place, check in, post pics, and its so close to me house! Finally after work one night I had a sweet tooth and stopped in. Off top, 5 stars for décor and customer service. I love the old school classy barber shop, winery, ladies saloon style all in one. I was instantly greeted with a smile and a hello. Lighting was dim, but appropriate. I was instantly drawn to the berry mascarpone cake. 2 of my favorites in one. $7 for a small piece, I was disappointed. Not enough mascarpone and it was like a berry gelatin. Not bad, but not what I expected. I took home, chocolate covered strawberries (3 for $6, decent), cookies, macaroons, and a couple other randoms. Prices were ok. I could imagine myself loving this place and enjoying a glass of wine n cupcake after work entirely to often. Who's my first yelp date down for drinks and desserts?! Jessie B? Shirley B?Items Selected:Salty Caramel Banana CupcakePeanut Butter BlondieSnickerdoodleBirthday Cake Macaron - Rainbow Sprinkles, Vanilla ButtercreamMocha Madness Macaron - Gianduja Crisp, Coffee Buttercream, Coffee GanacheSnickers Macaron - Chewy Peanut-Caramel and Chocolate Ganache dipped in Chocolate and PeanutsFig and Goat Cheese Macaron - Honey Sweetened Goat Cheese and Mission Fig JamLocated just off the 215 in Henderson and receiving nearly universal praise from palates I trust "Gimme Some Sugar" from Jean Philippe protégé Kristen LoVullo had long been on my 'to visit list,' and thus when nothing in particular struck my fancy for dinner on Saturday I did the only thing a healthy, responsible adult would do - ate dessert for dinner while watching House of Cards and drinking home Siphon Brewed Ethiopian Chelelektu from Heart.  Without a doubt a 'cute' shop with friendly service provided by a young lady named Brenda it was just after 7:00pm when I walked into the small store and with a short line fronted by a woman and her daughter planning a 'Sweet 16' party I spent some time perusing the items and chatting with other customers, seemingly each with a different favorite amongst the store's nearly twenty options.  Featuring plated desserts, custom cakes, jars, cookies, and other take-home treats it was with an eye on variety that I ordered when I approached the front of the line and self-selecting a few favorites along with two selections confirmed by Brenda to be as good as the crowd had suggested I made my way to the door immediately indulging in a buttery cinnamon-laced snickerdoodle with crispy edges and a soft center, the first of a half dozen +1 items tallying $25 after tax and tip.  Showing some restrained and retaining the rest of my purchase for the twenty-seven minute drive home it was with coffee in hand that I continued my tasting first with a bananas-foster-esque cupcake that was plenty moist but somewhat marred by overly sweet frosting but moving on to the dense peanut butter blondie things improved substantially, the dense square loaded with rich chocolate tones and roasted organic peanut butter, a classic combo only improved after a minute on a warm skillet.  Moving finally to what has seemingly become LoVullo's 'signature' item, it was with a quartet of macarons that I rounded out my evening and with each palm-sized cookie featuring a characteristic crackle over rich flavors, the texture of the crmb was actually far more dense than the Parisian classic - a moist cake-like consistency akin to the American whoopie pie and although perhaps not 'traditional,' entirely delicious - both the dense chocolate dipped Snickers and rich, savory Fig and Goat Cheese "Whooparons" undoubtedly justifying the nearly hour-long round trip...though if they ever decide to expand I definitely see a market for a second shop in ever trendy Summerlin.A bakery that also serves alcohol? I'm in trouble! This place has all your favorite vices: indulgent sweets, quality wines, and even savory scones. If you have a crack habit, I'm pretty sure it's baked into the delicate, double-layer fruit Pavlova. This is also the only place you'll find macarons the size of your palm- higher price, lessened opportunity to try multiple styles, but the flavors are spot-on! The popular ginger-fig has been a bit elusive, but the strawberry-lemonade has ample, balanced notes of each, plus a smear of jam in the middle. Everything in the cases looks like a work of art. On the downside, they're priced like art, too- $5.25/macaron, $7 for that tiny but tasty Pavlova. Great spot for a special occasion, like a Girls Night Out or a birthday meetup with friends, but not an easy spot to visit regularly.After 346 Patisserie closed, I wanted to find another go-to Henderson dessert shop. So far, this place isn't it.Gimme Some Sugar is the "Bake Shoppe" located off 215 and Stephanie. They offer refrigerated desserts such as tarts and cheesecakes, baked goods ranging from muffins to macarons, tea, Mothership coffee, and alcoholic beverages. The cushioned chairs, chandelier-like lights, and black rear wall would be nice to enjoy at night, but it's a little odd to step into this kind of place during the day.They offered me a couple of samples while I was perusing their selections. The chocolate ganache brownie had a rich chocolate flavor and sweetness, and I would have ordered it if I wasn't set on maximizing variety from my visit. The peanut butter blondie wasn't bad, but it was boring and not as rich in peanut butter flavor as I would've liked.I made several orders. The fig & goat cheese macaron ($5.25) is huge, as all their macarons are. They're roughly double the diameter of a standard macaron and are taller as well. The goat cheese was a delight, and the fig jam and macaron shell provided the sweetness to cement this as a dessert - maybe a bit too much sweetness, but not problematic. My issues were with the macaron shell's texture. It didn't lack crunch, but the exterior fractured into pieces with my first bite, and the interior seemed more mushy than chewy.Next, I tried the mixed berry scone ($2.45). It is advertised as "light and flakey" and "studded with fresh mixed berries." However, it was decidedly neither light nor flaky. Granted, it was soft, but the interior was indistinguishable from an average muffin, and it wasn't that crisp on the exterior. It was, however, too sweet - yes, even for a place called Gimme Some Sugar. Also, there were perhaps a few blueberries in the entirety of the scone. They weren't as prominent as I expected, and there wasn't a trace of the other berries. I'm not too enamored with the sugar crystals generously layered on the top of the scone, but I don't hate them either.Finally, I tasted two of their cookies ($1.75). The chocolate chip cookie had plenty of chocolate, but the texture is too mushy and there wasn't any rise to it. It is not a cookie that I would recommend. And frankly, neither is the monster cookie. It has a drier feel because of oats and peanut butter, and the generic M&M's (didn't see an imprint) were fine, but I wasn't thrilled.While Gimme Some Sugar certainly has their fans, some good sweet treats, and friendly customer service (samples and asking a phone caller to hold because I'd waited a while), I wasn't impressed with them overall. Maybe I'll try some of their pricey cold case items in the future (upwards of $7), but otherwise, I'd like Henderson to gimme a new place with better desserts.I had such a horrible experience here I would never, never recommend this bakery to anyone. It seems as though my unfortunate timing of requesting a gender reveal cake for my baby shower coincided with the bakery attending Life Is Beautiful to hock their confectioneries to concert goers. I emailed and was at first told there would be no issue making my cake, but then after multiple not returned emails and phone calls I started to get weary. However, someone there did get back to me and assured me my cake would be ready for Sunday pick up at 1 pm. Since I was already a week out from my baby shower I figured this was my only choice now since I wanted a custom cake, and most bakeries want at least a two week window to complete such a project.I sent them my invitation that I had sent out to all my guests. It was a lovely invite done by a friend, it was very cute and professional. I simply asked they recreate the theme of the invitation on the cake, and they could do so however they wanted. The main feature of the invite was a horse wearing a cowboy hat. No such creature even made it on to my cake. I told them I did not want any writing on the cake, and they achieved that much, but the cake was boring and sad, and did not represent my invitation at all.  (See pictures for comparison)Seems to me like they needed a lot of direction on how to make the cake, which is odd considering they're touted as such a great bakery. You would think they could recreate something given a visual representation. I'm not a baker, nor am I a cake artist, but it can't be that hard. *shrugs*On top of the fact that my cake was plain Jane and boring as hell, it didn't taste all that great either. The cake inside was crumbly and not moist. The filling inside meant to represent a GIRL was the lightest pink one could imagine -- really, some people at the party were like, uuhhh is it pink or white? when I cut into it to do the "reveal" of the gender.Bad cake, bad customer service, no artistic ability. Also, when I arrived with a friend to the store on Sunday a little before 1 PM, there was no one there. We rang the doorbell, knocked on the doors, and looked inside. I called the bakery only to have it ring and go to voicemail. I also emailed them (which they never returned the email, btw). I was at my wit's end. I had a baby shower to get to (MY OWN!), so my friend and I left, but in a last ditch moment of anxiety I returned to the bakery to see an SUV now parked out front. I went to the door and was able to open it and find someone there to give me my cake. It came to me in a brown UPS looking box, not a nice cake box one would expect when paying over $100 for a cake. I had half a mind to tell them I wasn't going to take it, but I had no time. I paid and left.This was just a really bad experience and has turned me off of the whole "custom cake" game. I can bake my own cakes for my special occasions from here on out.

Review Text :
This won't be much of a review because we didn't have much of a visit.  I went on a bustling Saturday night and got the last free table in the dining room.  There was no wait.  As my dinner party sat there, after a while the conversation at our table turned to how long it was appropriate to wait to be served.  5 minutes?  10 minutes?  There was a loud piano nearby so it was hard to talk about that, or anything, but we tried.The restaurant didn't appear understaffed.  In particular there was a busboy-looking guy who was practicing twirling his dishtowel in an elaborate way while walking back and forth between tables in the dining room.  He passed close by our table and several others.  Since he was dressed as a busboy we kept expecting him to do busboy-like things.  Maybe bring some water.  Put some silverware down on our empty table.  Refill some water at the tables near us with empty glasses.  Clear some of the dirty dishes that I could see sitting around?  But he never did.  Maybe he was a plant -- an agent of a competing restaurant trying to discredit this one?There were also waiters walking around.  The waiter who was in our section the most often seemed to be engaged in apologizing sincerely to many of the other tables near us.  We couldn't quite overhear him though (thanks to the piano).Again, how long is it appropriate to wait for someone to serve you?  10 minutes?  15 minutes?  Several attempts at meaningful eye contact had failed at this point, so I tried raising my hand.  No luck.  The dishtowel-twirler was in his own world, and the waiters were bustling, but not stopping.  We tried discussing the overly-eclectic menu for a while but grew tired of it.  Since we were hungry talking about food didn't seem like a good idea.  And that piano sure was loud.I read in the paper that the Picasso estate routinely files lawsuits trying to stop unauthorized use of the artist's name.  I wonder if this place has a license?  Yelp forbids reviewers from mentioning the names of other restaurants in reviews, so I'll refrain from mentioning the authorized restaurant with a similar name in Las Vegas.  (I've never been there anyway so I don't know how they would compare.)  I also won't mention the similarly-named restaurants in New York that were closed down by lawsuits from the Picasso estate.  Although I guess they don't count as restaurants since they don't exist anymore.After saying "excuse me" loudly to a passing waiter a few times produced no effect, I thought that maybe there was a kind of invisibility shield around our table.  At 25 minutes we gave up and left.

Service was OK.Underwhelming Gringo Mexican food.Chef specialties don't come with rice & beans...Cheese crisp was greasy even for a cheese crisp.I kept thinking I could have eaten here and had much better food for less:http://www.yelp.com/biz/el-ranchero-chandlerAfter falling for their amazing carnitas at Scottsdale Spice, I badly wanted to give their restaurant a try so tada!  Saturday Night with the boys commenced!  Walking in was a treat.  El Palacio was all decked out for some Halloween fun!  The donkeys wore dinosaur pet costumes and tacky-yet-adorable vinyls covered the windows.  They also were advertising heavily that they'll be at this weekend's AZ Taco Festival.  I was mesmerized and ecstatic.  After ordering a rich horchata and getting the complimentary two bowls of salsa and a delicious homemade bean dip with some chips, I checked-in on the Yelp app and discovered a "free appetizer with purchase of any entree" offer.  Yes!  This night keeps getting better and better!Our waitress had recommended us to get the Fiesta Sampler for the check-in offer since we're new patrons of the place and it was a great suggestion.  There were cheesy quesadillas, crunchy taquitos, tiny tacos with warm chorizo and potatoes, and dressed-up nachos all on this plate.  It was a lot of food and a part of me wishes they brought it out before our entrees because I was hungry and I was too busy stuffing my face with carnitas to pay too much attention to the appetizers.  Bah. I stuck with my Carnitas Rancheras, not straying to steal bites off anyone else's plate.  It came out piping hot and smelling of delicious meats!  Three warm tortillas stayed wrapped up in their foil and were waiting for me to get my green-painted nails on them.  I piled my little tortilla up with a helping of succulent slow-cooked pork, I spooned some onions and guacamole, added my pico de gallo [sorry El Palacio, I think my pico's better], and threw on some beans and rice just because.  It was an amazing first bite.  Minus their pico de gallo being a bit wimpy, I did find that the seasoning on their carnitas to be light-handed.  Where's the heat, man!?  Make me sweat!  The portions are very generous.  Three tortillas was not enough for all that juicy meat they give you.  The free cinnamon sugar apple-filled taquito-dessert thing with whipped cream they give you with the bill was delish.All in all, I had a great night out with good food and great company.  Service was a bit slow and the wait was pretty killer considering it wasn't even packed nor were there any big parties in the place but oh well.  Nothing great company can't cure.  I would come back for sure.  The Mole Poblano is calling my name.  Help me.

Archie's is great for cheap, quality wings. The place has bar seatings on one side and spacious tables for groups on the other side. Staffs are friendly and service efficient. There are TV's at every angle--360 degrees of visual stimulations. When I was there, I saw Archie himself. He is a very friendly and social guy. Okay more about the wings. From Monday-Thursday wings are 35 cents each, all day. However, you must purchase a drink with your wings order, minimum of 10 wings per order. Even with the drink purchase, the meal was still pretty cheap. I was able to try three flavors: spicy Thai sauce, Cajun rub and flaming hot. Spicy Thai was on the sweeter side and not spicy at all. Cajun rub had a spicy kick to it and flaming hot pretty much went up my nose and I was in tears. The wings were juicy and meaty with just the right amount of flavors. My favorite flavor so far is Cajun rub.  Overall, I highly recommend Archie's for those with a passion for wings. It was a very satisfying experience, and easy on the wallet.

Review Text :
Well my experience was different than previous Yelpers.  Maybe I went in with '"hole in the wall" expectations as soon as I had a look around, maybe Ocean Blue took a little time to get on it's feet.I went for lunch with some coworkers and everyone seemed more or less happy with the meal.  I had a jerk chicken appetizer (1.95) which was kind of a pocket filled with mildly spiced chicken.  It came with a side of jerk sauce which was complex and spicy.I followed that with one of the daily specials, 2 fish tacos.  It was flour tortillas with very tender and sweet tilapia, some cabbage and other leafy stuff and a sweet, slightly smoky sauce.  I added some of the jerk sauce to throw some heat on it.I also had an iced tea.  How much for the app, 2 fish tacos and iced tea?  $9.70.  Not bad at all.They also have a small lunch buffet which is refreshed often.  It had four dishes-a white rice with some veggies, broiled tilapia, potato salad and some kind of roasted chicken.  While we were there they changed the fish twice and switched to BBQ chicken.I'll be back to give them another shot, maybe try the all-you-can-eat buffet for 7.99.Always happy to find a new spot to try for lunch and saw a friend had bookmarked Ocean Blue and I asked her if she was up to giving them a try, said yes so made plans for lunch and off we went.Arrived around 11:45 and already knew I wanted to do the lunch buffet, they have a weekly buffet that changes daily for 7.99, and for that day  it was steamed white rice,  curry chicken, potato salad, and steamed fish.  I tried everything, and I have to say I was pretty excited to try the curry chicken , but sadly I was not able to eat it, it just was too salty to me, the potato salad was perfect and the steamed rice went well with the fish and let's talk about that fish, I did not come to try the fish, it was an afterthought but after I tried the fish, holy cow that was some great fish, also on the table was a unlabeled bottle, I asked what it was and found out it was a pineapple mango pepper sauce , so I put a little with the fish, and BAM! That added some great flavor & heat! If you cannot handle hot stuff, maybe you should stay away from the sauce, but for me it was amazing! Even put it on my rice, so good!I've only tried the buffet, so I can't attest for the rest of the menu, but I am happy to had found them and look forward to going back.

Restaurant name  Pusadee's Garden
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
In what used a be a shady corner in the dodgy end of Lawrenceville, now exists a miniature restaurant district, reminiscent of Bryant street in Highland Park.  On one side of the street you have Cure (my 2nd favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh) and Allegheny Wine Mixer (a really cool wine bar, one of the only ones in town).  Across the street is Pusadee's Garden, a Thai restaurant with a fantastic outdoor patio on the side completely hidden from the street.The garden is really the restaurant's big draw.  There's a small indoor seating area but the majority of the seats are outside.  The outside area is split into two halves, with one half having small tables with umbrellas and the other underneath an ivy-covered trellis.On a recent Saturday evening my wife and I were meeting another couple there for dinner and in typical Pittsburgh fashion, it was pouring down rain.  We called the restaurant to make certain our reservation was still OK and they said it was.  By an incredible stroke of luck, the sun came out right before we sat down.  Unfortunately, that meant that everything was covered with rainwater.  It also meant that during our entire dinner rain dripped on us, our food, and our wine.The menu is standard Thai fare: curries, noodle dishes, and a few "garden specialities."  We started off sharing crispy chicken spring rolls with plum sauce, chicken satay with peanut sauce and cucumber relish, and thai fried chicken with a sweet and spicy sriracha sauce.  It was all very tasty.  For entrees my wife had "street noodle #1", rice noodles with bean sprouts, bok choy, and more thai friend chicken.  I had a rice noodle dish with grilled duck breast, vegetables, and a spicy black soy sauce.  The duck was well done (not a way I normally like duck, but typical for an Asian restaurant) and the sauce had a nice spicy flavor.  Like many Thai restaurants, they ask you for a spice level of 1-10 for your dish.  I like spicy food so  I opted for a 6 and was glad that I did not venture higher.Pusadee's Garden is BYOB only and everyone around us had a varity of wines and beers.  Corkage was inexpensive, only $1 per glass. Overall cost of dinner was very reasonable and added up to about $40 for 2 people.Overall, we felt Pusadee's Garden was a good Thai restaurant.  The cuisine is standard Thai and honestly no better or worse than any other Thai restaurant that I've been to. There's nothing here that's going to push the envelope of Thai cuisine.  The BYOB option is nice and the garden is a very nice place to sit (when it's not raining).  Why only 3-stars?  Well, according to Yelp, 3-stars = A-OK which is how I feel about Pusadee's Garden.  It's a standard Thai restaurant with a nice outdoor seating area.  It's not someplace I would ever specifically seek out, but it's a good option if you're in the mood for Thai and there's nice weather outside.No one is lying when they say the outdoor area is incredible... because it is! If you entered through the back, you'd never know that busy Butler Street is right in front of you. But since you enter from the front... it tricks you into thinking you're in some sort of garden utopia because the trees and ivy are so thick. So if you boast such a wonderful garden in the summer... what do you do in the winter? You make awesome food so people come back! I'm one of those people that can sometimes end up going to ethnic restaurants and ordering the same thing over and over. I know, super lame. But I get scurred! Considering the couple we were with raved about the street noodles, I went out of my pad thai/curry comfort zone.I have to admit, I've only had street noodles once at Noodlehead in Shadyside and these were way more flavorful! I ordered up Street Noodles 2 with rice noodles and fried shrimp. I could tell right away it was way more filled with more zesty ingrediants. Competition's on the horizon Noodlehead! I like that it's BYOB, so you can bring your fave bottle with you. I will say, the dish isn't large, but just right. Let's just say, I was satisfied, but definitely ready for dessert later! But isn't that kinda the best of both worlds?

Restaurant name  Namaste Indian Cuisine
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
I'm usually stay far away from buffets, however I am very happy I decided to give this place a try.  My mom and I were both in the mood to try some place new and after driving around and checking out all of commerical center we decided a Indian food sounded pretty yummy.  After eating there, I decide this really is the only way to go out for Indian food with just 2 people because I always want to try just a little bit of everything.  At Namaste you can, and everything I tasted was fantastic!Eat here for lunch. $9 lunch buffet, really amazing food, good service. I can't wait to go back.This place was so hyped up that I was expecting something out of this world delicious. My favorite Indian restaurant in the entire world is Bombay Club in Harvard Square. Delicious, in my eyes, you can't beat it. So, I came in here with high hopes.This was the first Indian restaurant I've tried in Vegas, it's right next to Lotus of Siam, and right away that was a good sign for me. Anything that someone in my group of foodie friends recommends that is in a seedy strip mall HAS to be good.Started off with a kingfisher beer, papadom, and the requisite sauces. Friend of mine got the mulligatawny soup, I didn't try it, but he said it was good! For dinner, I got the chicken vindaloo and kheema naan (lamb stuffed bread). I asked them to make the vindaloo as hot as they could, and I didn't have a problem eating it. Wasn't as spicy as I thought it'd be. I mean, it was spicy, but it wasn't like -  OH MY GOD IM GOING TO DIE IF I DONT GET WATER RIGHT NOW AIGDJGSADJG kind of spicy, na'mean?Overall, though, high quality food for a very low price. I was impressed with the place and I'll definitely be going back again.THE BEST INDIAN FOOD IN VEGAS!My girlfriend and I were accidentally one of the first people to eat at Namaste. We were in the area and are very familiar with the great places in the tucked-away Commercial Center. As I recall we were considering going to Komol, one of our favorite Thai food restaurants and hangouts, when we saw that Namaste was finally open. We both love Indian food as she primarily eats vegetarian and Indian restaurants are easy targets for us.THE LUNCH BUFFET FOR $9 IS NOT TO BE MISSED! Indian buffets are hit-or-miss. Some will put out the standard dishes and only have one or two really yummy entrees set out. Not Namaste! They pull out all the stops and have many favorite dishes out at the same time. Mind you, the place is new, and many new places will start out this way and then go downhill, but I don't think this will be the case with Namaste. Chef and owner, Om Singh, has a reputation that precedes him in the culinary world and I suspect that the quality at Namaste will endure.We have eaten here many times since it has opened up and every meal has been outstanding. Most notably, the VEGETARIAN DINNER FOR TWO ($40) is perfect. From the first course to the last it is exceptionally yummy. The main courses are all super good and it was so plentiful we had a lot of left-overs for lunch the next day. And the dessert, especially the carrot one, is REALLY GOOD.The wait staff is very friendly and are constantly circling the floor. The atmosphere is decent and comfortable. I attend a discussion group every Sunday afternoon and we usually go out to dinner afterward. Komol is one of our regular haunts, but now it seems that Namaste will be our new default location.Was trying to go to Lotus of Siam next door, but line was too long, so we went here instead (which I assume is how they get most of their biz).  Food was good but nothing really stood out over other Indian joints.  My boyfriend and I shared the veggie dinner for 2, which was $40.  Service was good, restroom is very clean, place is nicely decorated.Indian lunch buffets were on my mind, especially have hearing Misti Y. praise their deliciousness.We pull into Commercial Center at 1:45 pm on a Sunday.  As we park the car, we notice there aren't too many other cars parked out front.  Hmmm...As we open the door, what a shock to see!  The place was packed full of Indians!  This was a great sign! I wasn't sure if there was a wait with all the people standing around of if there was a private party.  With no one to greet us at the front, the Husband goes in search of an empty table.  He finds one last table at the far back and after checking with a waiter, I get the affirmative wave.  I tell him to start first on the buffet line.  Meanwhile, I ask a waiter for some utensils.When the waiter brings over our water, he apologizes as a tour group had just arrived, which explains all the craziness.  Nonetheless, an Indian tour group stops at Namaste in Commercial Center, of all places, for their lunch en route is still a good sign!My turn at the buffet line!  Now, I'm no expert on Indian buffets as I've been to only a couple.  But I think the spread was pretty good for $8.99!My favorite was the Vegetable Korma "Vegetable cooked in creamy cashew nut gravy finished with almond and garnished with coriander and cream."  This was good on rice or the hot naan "unleavened white bread" they provided.  I also liked the sauce from the Chicken Tikka Masala "Tender pieces of chicken breast roasted in homemade creamy tomato," however, we both found the chicken pieces itself to be dry.  I also liked the Allo Jerra, which were ultimately potatoes.The Husband was loving the Saag Paneer "Spinach cooked with homemade cheese" and the Goat Curry.  Other items on the buffet line were Pakara, a fried veggie, Cholle Masala, a dish with chickpeas; and a Cabbage Masala.  Something that was both new to us was the Uttapam, a thick pancake with a sour-like taste that was topped with a bit of tomato and onion.  Traditionally it's made from rice that has been fermented, which explains it's tangy taste.Finishing off the meal was the Kheer, "Traditional Indian rice pudding with nuts, flavored with cardamon and rose."At one point, I helped myself to the water pitcher.  (I wasn't sure if this was self serve since there were about four water pitchers right next to where we were sitting and the place was so crowded.  They did end up refilling my glass the next 4-5 times though.)  The waiters were pretty friendly to us once the crowd got settled in more and started clearing out.  They were quick to clear out our dirty dishes and refill the water glasses.Namaste also has a simple, but pleasant decor with its mango painted walls, which I'm sure makes one crave a mango lassi.Overall, definitely not a bad choice for an Indian buffet.  I was so stuffed from that meal that I didn't eat again until 10 pm that night! I don't know if it's always this busy on Sundays though, so keep that in mind!

Review Text :
Last night I was lucky enough to try out Crudo for the first time. The crew was soft-launching their dinner menu and offered a VERY special $15 price for a 3-course meal. Chrissy and Dottsy joined me for the 6PM reservation, so the evening was off to a great start. We were seated outside which was still a little chilly, but a small heat lamp was brought out and arranged by our table without our requesting it. Their standard menu will offer 3, 4, and 5 course options, at $30, $40 and $50 or you can offer off the menu. Keep in mind that our dinner was a preview, and the menu is not finalized yet. As of now the menu is divided into Freddo and Caldo options and I made my meal of the Butterfish with a citrus glaze, the Hamachi with black garlic and truffle oil, and the Risotto, which had a massive mushroom seared on top and (kind of gross to think about but tasty nonetheless) cock's comb. Yes, the red dangly bits of a chicken. blerg. The risotto was great though, if you didn't know about the cock's comb you would have though it was sauteed mushroom, so that's what I pretended. The Butterfish was great, super buttery and the citrus sauce was just the right note to set it off. Hands down my favorite plate was the Hamachi though, the texture and density of the yellowtail was perfect and the apples, truffle oil and black garlic on it were to die for. The wine list we were presented with numbered 5 wines with no prices, and while I'm a Bisol Jeio Prosecco fan I wasn't crazy about the red and white options, but I'm sure they are working on that. Our server was Lisa G, and her presence instigated an odd sort of tourettes in both Dottsy and Chrissy: "balls! balls! we love your balls! put your balls on the menu!"The service, by Lisa and the rest of the Crudo staff and chefs was perfect, perfectly timed, very welcoming, open to questions. I would gladly spend another couple of hours at Crudo enjoying their menu, it was really inspired.

I sometimes eat here with my friends after hiking Dreamy Draw Hiking Trail.Yeah we ruin the burned calories by stuffing our faces with pastas and pizzas at Babbo afterwards.Is it good? Definitely!As you sit you are swarmed with servers laying down complimentary breads with olive oil, and balsamic dip.However, I cannot eat bread and pastas all the time, or I'll gain weight.I have to watch my svelte figure now that I'm getting older.They do have an interesting menu and the ones that I've had were extremely flavorful. I've had the Garlic Cheese Crostini, Bruschetta Romana, Roasted Asparagus, Mandarin Spinach, Mushroom Asparagus, and Pasta Rustico. The place is also very clean,  the ambiance is fabulous, and service is always great.Highly recommended with a great lunch menu too! :-)This is really one of my favorite places to go now.Lots of calories, but very good meal and for a very low price. On Monday and Tuesday they have the Spaghetti and Meatball Special for just $5.99.Best deal in town, I think.Bread is great, and I also really like the salad. They make it the Italian way. Really good! HeheeePizza here is really good as well. Nice crust with great cheese.Every time we come here,I always leave happy. {Parking is a bit tight) so be careful out there. Nice clean restrooms.Trying out Babbo for the very first time and was hoping that the trip was not a waste.  I did check Yelp reviews prior to going but you know how it is--sometimes they're right and sometimes they're wrong.  We were served sliced foccacia bread along with a dipping sauce made from an olive oil/balsamic vinegar mix.  I felt too much balsamic for the olive oil, but gave it a whirl.  But first I added black pepper, hot pepper flakes and a little salt.  Not bad, but I hate having to "cook" when I go out to dinner.  The foccacia and dipping sauce was quite nice.  But, but, but.... why is it that they never give you small plates so you can put your own bread on it and you don't drip olive oil from the table to your mouth??  So I asked Morgan, our server, if they have bread plates.  She says, "Sure" AND THEN she comes back with ONE plate (there are two of us ! Morgan).  Hubby's entree comes with a salad. He chose, "MISTA" or something like that.  Small salad but delicious.  Mixed greens with golden raisins, onion and PINE NUTS.... I love PINE NUTS.  It was topped with gorgonzola cheese and a sweet balsamic-type dressing.  Really good.  I stole some from hubby so I know.  Entrees arrive:  Spaghetii and meatballs for me and a "chalkboard" menu item which included chicken, marsala wine, mushrooms accompanied by veggies.  No pasta.  Pasta was $6 extra.  Really?On a $13 entree?  not even a teeny tiny bit of pasta on his plate!Now why,you ask, did I order spaghetti and meatballs.   BECAUSE IN AN ITALIAN RESTAURANT THIS DISH TELLS YOU EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW--that's why.   If you can't make a meatball you are DONE in an italian restaurant.  If you can't make a good SAUCE you are DONE as well.  So here it is:  the italian meatball was really, really, really good.  A little on the salty side but good enough for me because I like my food with a little saltiness.  That's just me.  The mix of spices in the meatball was great--sometimes restaurants put in too much oregano.  Not here.  It was a good mix of spices.  And now for the sauce... The question is whether this sauce could stand up to my own.  Yes, my dear readers, I make a killer sauce --the mother of all sauces; the "capo di tutti capo", the cat's meow; the slurpiest sauce around!  Let me put it to you this way, if I accidentally dropped my marinara sauce on my kitchen floor, hubby would say, "skip the mop... I'll lap it up".   No, really, it's that good.  With that, I am going to tell you that the sauce met my standards.  It was pretty good.  Better than mine.? No.  But remember this is a commercial establishment, they don't do the love thing that I do with the sauce. (Please do not let your imaginations wander).   So not to digress any further, the spaghetti and meatballs was a dish I would order again.  Hubby's dish, while he said it was good, was served on a smallish oval plate that made it look like a nothing portion.  PLUS, and this is important to the restaurant management:  The chicken along with the mushrooms looked like ALPO (the dog food) had been placed on the plate.  Now, keep in mind that he tasted it and liked it--the chicken, the mushrooms, the marsala wine and the sautéed veggies--He liked it all.  Do you think I was going to mention to him that it looked like an Alpo special??  Restaurants are supposed to make dishes ,at least, look a little pretty.  Even I do so at home.  There was no parsley garnish, nothing.  I make chicken fricassee at home and it doesn't look like mush.  Yes, mush.  That's the word I was looking for.  The mushrooms made it look like mush. Hubby said he would order it again so he liked it.  Management could you work on making this dish look more professional?  My spaghetti and meatballs was nice looking--a little parsley sprinkled atop of two beautiful Mount Vesuvious meatballs; beautiful red sauce.  Nice.  So after all is said and done I am giving this place 4 stars.  Morgan, you were a great server and very patient with us on ordering (it was our first time here) .  We forgive you for bringing just ONE bread plate.  Head on out to Babbo's.  You'll have a good meal for a good price in a family oriented setting.

Restaurant name  Impressionz
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
I had been wanting to try Impressionz for a long while, since it fits the profile of my favorite type of ethnic restaurant--a little-known hole in the wall with great food.  I finally received the opportunity to do so this Sat. evening, since I needed to make a Target run.  Since CM was shuttling me over and was hungry for dinner, I suggested it, and after parking in the garage, we headed a block or two over to check it out.Although I'd never had Jamaican cuisine before, I did some research on Wikipedia beforehand and learned that salt fish and ackee was a traditional dish.  Since I didn't know how spicy the jerk chicken would be, and I wanted to try a more unique dish, I had to order it when I saw it on the MTO section of the menu ($18).  CM, on the other hand, decided to stick to what he knows and went with the small jerk chicken ($10.50).  While we were waiting for our entrees, CM ordered a beef patty ($2.50), and I ordered a bottle of Ting grapefruit soda.  Although I don't eat beef, I decided to break my rule for a split second and ate a corner with a tiny bit of the filling.  The pastry was quite flaky, and the filling was well seasoned, which helped to mask the flavor of the beef.  CM assured me that the rest was quite tasty.Despite being told that MTO entrees take 20 min. to make, my entree seemed to come out faster than expected (in about 15 min., I believe, though I wasn't timing it), and CM's was brought out immediately afterward.  My entree was more savory than I would have guessed, and had just the right amount of fishiness.  The ratios of ingredients seemed well-balanced, and it was huge--so much so that the sides of rice, cabbage, and plantains came on an additional plate (see photo).  Though it came on a single plate with sides, CM's jerk chicken, which consisted of a quarter dark meat, was also portioned generously.  Between the large portion and the spiciness of the jerk sauce, he took half home for later enjoyment, along with some of the left over sides.As others have mentioned, the only part of our experience that bested the food was the service from Cecilia and her family.  Cecilia is very personable, and was very good about answering our questions about the menu.  Her daughters were there as well, and were adorable.  We could tell that Impressionz attracts regular customers, probably from the local neighborhood, by the rapport that they had with Cecilia.The quality and amount of food, as well as the caliber of service, at Impressionz lived up to the hype, and then some.  (CM agreed, saying it was better than a Jamaican restaurant he frequented in Ann Arbor.)  However, I'm not awarding a full 5 stars because (1) I felt the MTO dishes were a bit overpriced, esp. for a cash only place (even in light of the portion size) and (2) I think I would have enjoyed a different dish more (though this was my fault for choosing it...) The only other major downside was that the bathroom's currently out of service due to a flood that occurred in Mar. Nevertheless, I highly recommend checking out this neighborhood jewel! 4.5 stars.

Ok let me try this again. This is no longer the same Roberto's that was featured on Food Network. It is def under new management and/or ownership. If you go to robertosaz.com it only has the Anthem location listed and that actually explains everything to me. The staff here is not friendly and there is no one from the old crew here anymore its been like this for awhile now maybe almost a year. I kept coming back thinking that maybe with the changes eventually stuff would work itself out and get back to normal. That didnt happen here and I gave the place many many chances. It really makes me sad after going here for like a decade knowing it wasn't the same I still kept coming back here. You know what they say old habits die hard!?! They really do I was like a kid that kept going back to that mean dog and pulling its tail over and over again while ending up bit every damn time! This was the last straw for me last night. I always order the same thing here...again creature of habit. They have tried this before but they usually work with me this time the cashier tried to nickel and dime me where I ended up with a $10 burrito!! Are you fucking kidding me here!?!?! The cashier had no care what so ever on what I had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced. I'm looking for a new place now I learned my lesson and wont waste any more time on this place getting mediocre food!

Review Text :
Disclaimer and Qualifications:I'm a midwestern gringo, but I've been here 20+ years, so can take a little heat.  My wife is half Thai, and her Mom and Aunts used to sit around prepping, cooking REAL ACTUAL Thai food (and gossiping) all day long, so she knows the good stuff.  The first time we went, she loved it so much that the second time we went and got a TOGO order, we brought home over $75 worth of food for her, I, and a 12 yo girl.  This doesn't mean three $25 meals, either,  since each entree/appetizer ranges from a little under to a little over $10.  Yea, leftovers!Instructions:1.  Hire a group of thugs to tie you up, slip a sack over your mousse-head, toss you in the back of a cargo van, and dump your pretentious, elitist butt INSIDE the front doors of Siam.2.  Enjoy the tastiest, most authentically prepared and flavored Thai food you'll likely have this side of Bangok, served by friendly authentically prepared and flavored Thai folk, in a very clean and ornately decorated, authentically prepared and flavored environment.3. Go through moral, ethical, and spiritual crisis as you decide whether it is time to forgoe your judgemental, plastic-coated, dream world where everything is pristine and sanitized, so that you may indulge in the tastes of the real world, not the Real World tm.4. Decide that you simply cannot face the ugly Glendale strip mall you know is outside those doors; have thugs kidnap you back to East Valley and drop you off at Kierland Commons, so that you can wash away the filthy feeling with an overpriced gourmet coffee amongst the beautiful people.  Pretend you didn't just start down the dark path of heroin-like spicy Thai basil & peppers.  Pretend that you won't be slinking back to the other side of the tracks to cop another score sooner than you think.  Look around at all of the fronts -- on the stores, and especially the people -- they want you to believe that they are authentically prepared and flavored, but they aren't.3/14/10Liked the ambience!   Beautiful wooden screens lined the walls; Clothed glass tables and wooden chairs.  Nice to find a place that serves tasty food and, at the same time, invests in creating a lovely space to round out the whole dining-out experience!Had very tasty eggrolls to start, and they were some of the best I've ever had anywhere.  That is, besides my Mom's lumpia!  I believe Siam Thai's eggroll filling contain ground chicken, as well as eggs.  For my entree, I had the tofu green curry (as I use this dish to compare a new place to all of the other Thai restos I've tried thus far), and while I liked it, I found the dish too spicy (ordered medium spice) and found veggies there I had asked specifically to omit due to food allergies.  I normally send items back if they don't arrive the way I ordered, but I was hungry and I thought I'd just grin and bear through the allergy attacks as long as the dish was worthy of them.  (It's not.)  Mind you, it's tasty and spicy, but the cream sauce looked "broken" (I like mine silky-smooth and creamy!), and coupled with the veggies I didn't want, let's just say I'll speak up more the next time I go!For dessert, I had the fried bananas and coconut ice cream, and oh my!  I've wanted to go back just to have this again, but alas, all my bookmarks have kept me from going back to do so :(  Soon.  So very soon...Siam, located in a tiny strip mall, may lack luster from the outside but serves a pretty decent dish of Thai cuisine!  While not my favorite place to go for Thai food, this place offers a pretty delicious bowl of Tom Kha and Duck with Pineapple Curry  The Tom Kha is rich and creamy and full of delicious coconut milk but could use more lemongrass.  Whenever duck is an option on the menu, I naturally order that as my choice of protein.  While the pineapple curry doesn't have too much of a pineapple kick, the subtle hints of it gave it a nice after-taste.  Siam does seem to go light-handed on spice so if you're feeling bold, get it a level higher than what you normally order!The place is kept very clean and the servers are pretty friendly.  I wouldn't exactly drive out of my way to come here but hey:  the food is warm, filling, and flavorful!  It's worth a try!

Review Text :
I've driven by Daddy Macs several times, and wondered what it was about. Last night, it was late, I was hungry, and decided to stop in.I walked in the door, seated myself (there didn't seem to be any waitstaff around), and discovered that it was "Comedy" night - though I use the term "comedy" very loosely.  The "entertainers" consisted of young African-American men, yelling "Niggah" "Sh*t" and various other profanities as loud and as often as they could.Now, I'm no prude. I get *shock* comedy. But this was just loud and juvenile. The biggest laugh came when he screamed,"Hey ladies, if you've got a clean p**sy, lemme hear ya yell!"Nobody yelled, and that silence got a laugh.When the silence is funnier than the comic, you know you're in trouble.Meanwhile, nobody comes to take an order, and I notice that none of the other tables have food. I guess I could have gone up to the bar to see if they were serving food, [at a restaurant?!] but I was beginning to feel like I wasn't going to be there long enough to enjoy it anyway.After the requisite gay, ghetto, and prostitute jokes -  the third "entertainer" came on, and started in on a White couple in the front, with "Hey! You White folks.... you know all about the KKK, right?" I thought,"That's my cue. I'm outta here."All in all, I was probably there for a half-hour.I never saw a waiter. I never had a drink or food.The "entertainment" ranged from dull to offensive.Needless to say, I now know everything I need to know about Daddy Macs. I won't be back.

Where is everyone? Srsly Middleton! Show up. Represent! After an exhausting... er I mean underwhelming trip to World Market Tom, Ryan and I decided it was time to make the drive west worth it. Tom had been craving Korean for some time and because I don't make decisions I was game. The interior is pretty fancy pants for a small strip off the beaten path. Nice booths, tasteful artwork, cool color palate. But the paper napkins? That's like going to L'Etoile and eating dinner with a spork.Here's the thing though, I'd eat K Peppers with a spork, with a spatula or with my own bare hands, heck I'd eat K Peppers with YOUR bare hands... it's that good. We started with Topokki, Korean rice cake and a boiled egg cooked in a sweet and spicy sauce. We all thought 2 stars (spicy) was pretty darn spicy, but the sweetness balanced it out. From there, I moved on to Bulgogi which was unbulgogievable (wah wah). Tender meat, sweet soy, some veg for good measure... it was bomb, more than I could polish off after the app, but great for breakfast. A little bummed that we were the first table there at ten after six, and the only table dining for the hour-ish we stayed. But maybe people just don't know K Pepper's brilliance just yet. Get to know.

***This restaurant and its breakfast buffet do not feel fresh (kind of like this Marriott, which has a very outdated decor); the breakfast buffet featured a good variety of items--bacon, sausage, breakfast, potatoes, scrambled eggs, smoked salmon, cereal, pastries, oatmeal, and an omelet bar; the food was not horrible, but a lot of it was salty; the poor lighting in the lobby (this is an open lobby restaurant) probably made the food feel worse than it actually was; service was pleasant***This Marriott has its own free self parking lot.

Review Text :
Wings or prime rib?  Those are probably the two most common choices at this 24 hour restaurant located at the casino level of the Hooters Casino Hotel. The prime rib special is $9.95 all day and you can order 25 cents hot wings with a minimum order of ten from midnight until 6 AM.  The restaurant used to be Dan Marino's and quotes and images of the former NFL Miami Dolphins star quarterback are still a big part of the restaurant's décor.  Apparently, the recent name change to Mad Onion Fine Foods and Spirits occurred just before Thanksgiving 2009.  From a distance both specials looked decent, but I made a middle-of-the-night mistake by ordering their half pound Classic Mad Onion Burger.  The unique thing about the Mad Onion burger is having your choice of onions put on your burger.  I chose "carmalized" onions among the list which also included raw onions, sauteed onions, BBQ onions and chipotle onions.  The burger comes with fries also.At least the fries were hot in temperature because the burger was not.  The food took an excruciating amount of time to come out of the kitchen and when it finally did not only was the burger just warm but the carmalized onions were ice cold.  The half pound sirloin burger did not taste like fresh beef either.  It was a bit too ground up in texture and had a peculiar taste.  I think I made the right decision by tossing most of my food and making a run up to a 24 hour Wendy's at a nearby food court instead.The Mad Onion staff were nice though, but this place is avoidable.It's like my food was cooked then marinated in methane...Substandard.Destroy the Mad Onion! What happened to Dan Marino?! He ditched this place and turned it into a whack sack of chicken wings that shrunk! The best part about (the reason why it even has 2 stars) is that the wings are still 25 cents. They should charge 15 cents for how small the wings shrunk!Quick tip: Order the wings naked and ask for sauce on the side! They come out super soggy and oily beyond the BP accident out in the ocean!Another things that destroyed what made this an awesome late night spot is the ranch swap! What gives with that?! I mean, what restaurant even carries individual ranch dressing buckets and on top of that, CHARGES you for it! Ridiculous! Whoever kidnapped Mr. Marino and placed Mr. Onion in his restaurant needs to be found and punished for this heinous abomination! I mean, COME ON! You're in a Hooters hotel for God's sake. Represent the legendary wings chain!The only reason why I would EVER go back to the Mad Onion is when they bring Mr. Marino, the large wings, and ranch free of charge. Or if my friends forced me and played the "you're my friend and you have to support me in coming to the Mad Onion because I love this place" card.=========================================================UPDATE-- Correction! The wings are no longer 25 cents! They're $7.95 for 10 wings and fries.... Star removed!

This is the PERFECT location for me and my sister to meet inbetween. and we did before she left for Ethiopia. We gave it a try, and I was stoked because I love lunch at Caffe Boa in Tempe. I was hoping Boa Bistro would have the same spark. But sadly, it was all just hmm and we left a little confused. We split the mufaletta and this salad that SOUNDED amazing but when it was put on the table we both were like 'HUH?!'It was the chicken, almond something salad. something about california maybe? It was presented very oddly and didn't look anything like i pictured it from the description. the chicken was bland and the dressing was bland. it was unexpected in a 'i wish we ordered something else' way. the mufaletta was good, but maybe we were just so bummed about the salad. it wasn't gross or anything, it just didn't sound as good as the description. everything was fresh and clean. just soooo.......flavorless. our waiter told us it was all delicious, but he is obviously a liar. or hasn't tasted the entire menu.the patio was great. and so was the tea. maybe we'll give it another shot the next time we meet for lunch and try something else.

Review Text :
Shocker folks, I don't normally like hot dogs.  The only way you can hand me a hot dog I'll actually eat is if it's fresh off the grill.  With loads of ketchup...and I DO mean loads, like buckets full!  If I ever think of eating a hot dog without ketchup, the world may end.  The world kinda did tonight...a little.I ordered the New York Dog and the Sweetbread Dog, plus the duck fat fries to split with my friend.  I had to order the NYC Dog because I love me some sauerkraut.  I ordered the Sweetbread dog because it had the word "sweet" in it.  No lie.  Please don't judge, but I thought sweetbread was like cornbread (I see you rolling your eyes foodies!).  So I imagined this dog in between a roll that's actually corn bread...perhaps another creation Mr. Sousa?  Anyway, I digress... The sweetbread I actually found out is...I suggest you look it up (but a hint: it deals with hearts and throats of animals).  I'm willing to try anything so biting into the sweetbread it was almost a gel like consistency and very salty.  I'm not a salty food person (a weirdo, I know!), so this wasn't my favorite thing.  What was my favorite thing was the NYC Dog.  I know, traditional, but the dog itself was absolutely high grade meat.  It was not your typical microwaved wiener.  The sauerkraut was the right amount of tangy and crunch.  And I swear, I only put a dab of ketchup on!  Probably because I wanted to enjoy the taste of the grain mustard, which I have really become a fan of as of late.  Total winner!The duck fat fries were good, but I enjoy them a bit more crispy.  I dumped ketchup on them.  I should really just shut up about the ketchup....This really is a great, fast and fairly cheap option for the East End area.  When me and the hubby are heading over there to volunteer at the Animal Rescue League we need something fast, but something that will also taste good.  Surprisingly, there's not many options.  But now, we're saved!  Good thing we're not eating dogs and then going to see dogs, we only volunteer with the cats...phew!

A welcome addition to the N Phx "Black Hole" As many of you know there really are not too many unique places to eat up this way. That is changing little by little. Rinaldis is now open and serving the eager crowds. The line was out the door today and the food was flowing as fast as possible. The deli is a little small but has 12 or so 4 top tables. The problem is the chairs are a little big for the tables, therefore only comfortably allowing 2 to a table. The staff was excellent right on top of each order. No one came back with wrong togo orders or anything. The boss mentioned to the staff in a rare slow spot, "make sure the sandwiches don't look sloppy" That is cool to hear they care what goes out. it is your typical Boars Head cold cuts, with some great bread and some homemade dishes too. I had the chicken Parm sandwich. It was a full size hoagie loaded with chicken parm, sauce and cheese toasted. It was good, the bread was fresh, the chicken was good but it lacked a little flavor. The sauce needed a little more. Served with a pickle and chips. They had a whole beef brisket, just out of the oven, that looked amazing...

I wanted to try something different for dinner, so I headed on over to Pancheros to give them a try.I knew I wanted a burrito, and I dig the fact that the tortilla is made right then and there, that's pretty sweet.I went with the grilled steak, and I was going to toss some grilled veggies on there, but after looking into the pan and seeing dried up stuck to the side veggies I quickly changed my mind.  I went with the white rice, pinto beans, meat, cheese, salsa verde and sour cream, after everything was layered inside I thought they would wrap it up, but no they took a knife and mixed everything together, had I known they were going to do that I would have asked for the salsa & sour cream to be added later, I like the layering effect. Maybe I'm weird but I do.Over all, I prefer Chipotle, I wanted to like this place, but it just didn't stack up.  The ingredients didn't look fresh, the white rice was supposed to be cilantro & lime but I can tell you there were no hints of green in the rice, and I happen to think cilantro is the best ingredient in the world but it was missing from my rice. The grilled veggies like I said where dried out and stuck to the pan, the meat was tough and cold. I just wasn't impressed over all.I met some friends for a late lunch at Pancheros Mexican Grill.  The line was long however, they kept the line moving along nicely.  When we went to find a table, most of the tables were dirty, but cleaned one off ourselves. The food was good and I the atmosphere was causal.The menu is limited, but the entrees are good.  The tortillas are freshly pressed when you order your entrée  and you can select your preferences as you move along the quick-order line. I really enjoy the chicken quesadillas and the chicken tacos.  The meat is flavorful and moist.So if your looking for an inexpensive, quick, and filling meal, give Pancheros a try.

Owner is a greedy crook.Supreme pizza is $8.50, hawaiian is $6.50. Ordered half hawaiian/half supreme. When I picked up the pizza, the owner charged $13.50 for an 8 dollar pizza. What kind of scam is the owner trying to run?! The d-bag owner tried to give some BS excuse that he doesn't do half/half on pizzas & instead doubles the toppings on each half of a single pizza. WTF?! I didn't order double toppings, a-hole. Of course he doesn't tell you this when you order, he waits until you're picking up your pizza, charges you and hopes you don't notice the 70% mark-up on the price.He then tried to explain that his way is cheaper by telling me that two large pizzas would have been $15 and he's doing me a favor and saving me money. So what you just told me is that because of your little scam I just paid $13 for one pizza when I could have paid $15 for two pizzas?! You just made yourself look like an even more of an A-hole, dude.How anyone believes they can get away with trying to rip people off in the age of the internet is beyond me.P.S. I called 4 other Little Caesars franchises in the area and none of them charge 70% extra do a half/half pizza.Do you snub a place because they're cheap, and you equate cheap with inferior or sub par quality? Do you snub something because people never mention them, and they don't get reviewed, even once, on Yelp?Shame on you. SHAME ON YOU.I used to be that person. I'm guilty of all of the above, especially in regards to the pizza with the a toga-wearing guy who thinks he's funny. I know, I know, shame on me.I was "introduced" to this place when I first came to the states almost 20 years ago, I was young then and my cousin was even younger. Fast-forward almost 20 years, I found myself ordering stuff from this place while I was visiting the Phoenix metro area. He swore by this stuff. He told me how the pizza was NOT half-bad, and the price made it more appealing. 5 bucks a one topping pizza, how can anyone refuse? Additional toppings extra, and so are thin crusts and deep dish, but that's to be expected.Remember, they don't deliver. That's how the keep the prices dirt-cheap. The people there were very nice, and was not pushy about upselling anything. They also have dipping sauces, which I got the garlic butter one. They have chilled soft-drinks, and that's a good thing since it's hot here. They also have the infamous Crazy Bread. Gotta taste it to believe it.So, you ask, why did I give four stars to a place that I snubbed till this place changed my mind? Take notes, here's the formula:Cheap pizza + Ok pizza + convenient location + nice people and service + my attitude adjustment = 4 stars!Did you get that? The lesson you should learn:Don't knock it till you try it.

Review Text :
Has been a long time since my last visit. Had a lunch meeting at Scoglio.  The restaurant has not been updated since before it was Soglio's, over 20 years is my guess; it could use some updates.  It is a popular place, was crowded.  Our server was friendly and did the refills but seemed to be in a busy and not to friendly mood.Fresh bread came out immediately and was welcome by my stomach since I as famished. My salad was good with an assortment of greens, with tomato and cucumber.  My crab cake was just OK.

Nothing makes me happier than to visit a new establishment that over delivers on all points that matter to me.  I was a loyal fan of Lisa G. and was heartbroken to see her leave. However, I've made way for TMI to fill the void and as the song goes, My Heart Will Go On.The charming Sheridan bungalow takes on a new life with a new menu, new decor, new staff and a  great experience for you to enjoy.  The ambiance is perfect if you are, as I am, one for dim lit places that play old school/neo-soul/hip hop beats while chilling with a group of friends. The interior space is relaxed and the furniture very comfy. The Drink Menu has something for everyone. Wine, draft, maybe a cocktail. My choice, the Four Peaks Hefe and a sip of a friend's dirty martini.   The menu options are great and the prices even better. Although I only had the soup, I snuck a bite of Bacon's grilled cheese sandwich and Ayesha's mac & cheese. Both were amazing and I can't wait to go back for more. The staff was extremely friendly and timely even though the place was bustling. Our table had 11 people on separate checks but our server didn't even bat an eye. Cash out, easy breezy! Thanks TMI, I'm a fan.When I was in grade school, my best friend lived next door. We would do everything together but then one day my best friend moved away. A new family moved in with another kid my age. I effing hated that kid. He had a stupid name and a stupid face and he lived in my friend's house! How dare he?!Over time, once I gave him a chance it turned out the new kid wasn't so bad. We even became friends and he played a mean second base at kickball."The Main Ingredient? Seriously? That is a tragically terrible name." Is a direct quote from somewhere in the middle of a conversation I had with my good friend Julia T about the new establishment in the old Lisa G's location. Then after arriving: "Julia, they serve sandwiches and salads. Nothing here even has a goddamned main ingredient."But ya know what? The new kid aint so bad! My sandwich (the calvano) seriously good,like SERIOUSLY, and remember I didn't want to like it at all. I also had a bite of the tuna melt and it was awesome as well. One thing I will bring up is that the booze selection leaves a bit to be desired. Crown and JD are the only two whiskey's. Seriously, new friend, fix this or I am going to be forced to make fun of you with the other kids behind your back.Defining things in the negative is dangerous, but in this case, a little negative-definition is necessary: TMI isn't a fake dive bar frequented by white kids pretending to be poor; it isn't a fake (insert European nationality here) pub; it isn't trying to serve over-priced small plates; it doesn't have super sexy low lighting or uncomfortable chairs.It is a low-key house-turned bar that serves solid food executed extremely well, alongside beer and wine that has obviously been selected with care by fans of things that taste good.The sandwiches here are really a reminder about how good a sandwich can be, flirting with the platonic ideal in sandwich-ness.  The mac n' cheese is just like mom made it, baked and crusty and rich.  The salads are simple and delicious.Happy hour is really generous - $2.50 draught beers and $4 selected glasses of wine.  The tap beer selection is better than anywhere else in downtown Phoenix, excepting the Roosevelt, which is very un-hang-outable.  I've sipped three or four glasses of other people's wines, and the wine selection is really great as well.Best of all, kind of like Casey Moore's in Tempe, the bar is starting to act as a great place to see the diversity of folks who live in the Coronado and Roosevelt neighborhoods.In the former Lisa G. spot (RIP my love) TMI is now what you will find, and apparently I am the only person in the universe who isnt madly in love with it.I came here a few weeks ago for dinner/drinks with the boy since he had heard from a co-worker that their menu was pretty delicious, and more specifically that their mac n cheese was to die for.. Well let me tell you what, I had it, and it's not that great. At least on this particular night, I was definitely not impressed. It was loaded with peppers that completely overpowered any other flavor that may have been there. The boy had one of their *awesome* grilled cheeses, which again, wasn't something i would rave about, mostly because it was so unmemorable and basic, plus I kinda hate it when a place serves mainly lunch options for dinner. I like sandwiches as much as the next guy, but not for dinner. However, they do have a decent drink menu, lots of beers, wine & even liquor, so whatever your alcoholic heart desires, you will find it here..Our service was a mess, I think we had 3 different waiters asking us the same questions over and over, then forgetting and asking them again. I don't care if the place was packed, get it together dudes.The interior was classy & cute, but also a zoo.. So packed that I couldn't even get to the bathroom, people running into our table as they walked by and at one point I watched our waiter stand for 3 whole minutes, plates in hand, waiting for people to get the hell out of the way so he could drop them on our table. Maybe I am just impatient.. Anyway I realize this place is new, so there's definitely hype, but over all, I was just really disappointed in what I had hoped would be a close match to its previous occupant. I will give it another shot, but I'm in no rush.03/12/10Four stars for the food and atmosphere, but I deducted a star for the service.  I was to meet a couple of friends for happy hour here, but I arrived almost two hours before they did.  (He was waiting to get off work and had to swing by to pick up his wife, and I was getting hungry!  They knew this, so it wasn't an issue.)  (As you can see, it's been two months since our visit, so I forgot the name of the awesome server that was first assigned to me... silly me, I know, but I can say that it was a name of Hispanic origin.  HOWEVER, I do remember quite well the name of the server that took over our party, (a fave gemstone of mine), since my original server was assigned to work the patio.  We all considered leaving, but my friends had heard a few Yelpers and me talk TMI up a few days before at the Yelp In Bloom event and wanted to check out the ales and food.)OK, onto the food!!I came to check out the happy hour app menu, which I sadly found does not exist.  While there are beverages discounted during happy hour, the list isn't very long.  I understand that there's only one or two wines by the glass on it, as well as one or two draft ales.  I think he tried the Oak Creek Nut Brown (thumbs down) and two glasses of the White Rascal (thumbs up!).  (Another testimony to the subpar service showed us by that-who-goes-by-a-jewel's-moniker is that he was overcharged by not one, but TWO beer selections.  It's always a good idea to check your receipts!).So what did I eat??  I had the terrific RB & C, made w/ roast beef, muenster cheese, and horseradish sauce on a baguette.  If you haven't already done so, you must RUN at this very moment to TMI and order one!!  Everything about this sandwich, as well as the side salad that accompanied it, was faultless!  From the deliciously aromatic, crusty baguette; melty muenster; ample portion of roast beef- cooked to juicy perfection!; and the divine horseradish sauce, I was in "thunderbolt city" with every saporous bite!  It was a battle of willpower vs. a basal desire for full sensory gratification.  Willpower won, my Mom able to enjoy the other half-sandwich later that night, but only because I was going to order the Artichoke Heaven, a dip which consisted of atichoke hearts and a blend of three cheeses, to share with my friends (they had it w/ LT chips, and I had mine w/ crostini and house-fried potato chips).  This dish went over well!!  Definitely a must-order-again selection.  Friends' selections were the Griddled Cheese and house-made salsa and LT chips.  Both sandwich and salsa were very tasty!  FYI: my friend had a hard time trying to order a Tequila Sunrise.  First, our server wasn't familiar with the cocktail.  Second, we were told by our server that the barkeep did not know what it was either.  After a few minutes, and by then, I started asking if I could get a Sidecar (no), a bartender finally came up and said that they lacked the grenadine to make a TS.  (No on the Sidecar, bec. they didn't carry lemon juice.)  Thought I should mention this.p.s.  I just remembered... when I first arrived and sat in the main dining area of TMI, I was only one of maybe three people sitting there.  I found the music to be disconcertingly loud.  I can't recall if I put in a request for the level to be lowered...  By the time my friends arrived, it was busier out in the patio and in the main dining room; we'd moved to the community table next to the bar area, and we were practically shouting at each other as we tried to carry on a conversation.  Not ideal.  At least, not for me.FYI, I heard from Matt D., the owner, that eight draft beers, two wines by the glass, and all cocktails are discounted during happy hour.  I'll have to go back soon and see if they'll make a revised Sidecar for me using lime juice!True to Downtown Phoenix, The Main Ingredient Ale House and Cafe is in the most unassuming area and you have to have an eagle eye while driving to find it.Once I entered the house situated in the historic downtown neighborhood, I noticed the homey vibe of this converted house. The patio was lit with luminous lights and guests were enjoying a casual and cozy dining experience. While the patio was lively, the inside (although cozy), was pretty empty so we opted for the outdoor option -- especially since the weather was so nice that night.Besides the atmosphere, the food at Main Ingredient is comfort food with a twist. I ordered a warm turkey "jive" sandwich which was on crunchy sourdough bread, with freshly slices of warm turkey and topped with jalapeno cream cheese. The sandwich was large, in charge and accompanied by a hefty field green salad. It was too big for me to finish more than half, but if ordered, this could be a good leftover meal. I also tried the mac and cheese with a kick of green chilies. It's listed as an appetizer but so hearty it can absolutely suffice for a meal. The artichoke heaven as a starter was hearty as well and you could easily share that with three or four others due to how rich it is. The beers to wash down the meal were tasty and they had some unique options to choose from. So for a house-converted restaurant in Downtown Phoenix, it's worth trying out if you're in the area and once you leave the hustle of 7th street and sit at the Ale House, you'll forget that you are just off a busy city street.adjectives that come to mind when someone suggests TMI:charming. quaint. refurbished. amiable. TMI represents the burgeoning scene of cenpho well, and caters to the ethos that other hip local business owners in our city have come to adopt: namely- rennovate, restore, refurbish, resurrect.the four R'swith that in mind TMI has succeeded head over heels. They've taken something great and improved on it, and stuck to a method that is key for success.The surrounding environs of 7th st seem to hone in on something, something hard to define, but when i go to places like the coronado cafe, the main ingredient ale house, the roosevelt, carlys- they all say to me: "Phoenician Renaissance"For as long as your are around, and lets hope its generations, i will frequent you TMI, and i will bring along droves of friend/foodies to further sing your praises.delicious sandwiches, salads, and an amazing beer list. a great spot for calling off of work and enjoying a lazy day.I never made it to Lisa G's but my visit to The Main Ingredient made me forget that. Simple Menu, some apps, salads and sammies. I ordered Sophie's Salad, easily made vegan with no cheese and no onion,......field greens, local tomatoes, artichoke hearts, fresh mozzarella, red onion, toasted pine nuts & fresh basil tossed in balsamic vinaigrette. I don't often get excited about salads but I was pleasantly surprised at the generous portion. It was dressed better than me and LOADED with artichokes, tomatoes, toasted pine nuts and basil. There was no skimping on toppings or fishing through the greens for the goods, every bite was magic in my mouth. I will be craving that salad in the near future and they've got a Veggie sandwich that I'd like to try as well. Can't wait to go back!It's the middle of January and 75 degrees out.  While there's no shortage of things to do outside, there aren't many dog-friendly places for that where you can sit down and eat.Jacqui J and I took out doggies to the dog park.  They're bruthas, you see, and hadn't hung out in awhile.  We had MLK day off together and spend the afternoon together.  Trying to decide where to eat with the pooches, I thought of TMI because I had seen so many people recently check in on Yelp.  Their patio is pretty big and mostly shaded.  This wasn't a day to be too concerned about shade, since it wasn't hot out.  I read the reviews ahead of time and already knew what I wanted before I even got there.  I was happy to have to take home a doggie bag, too.  I got the olives, red goat salad and the mac and cheese.  I will eat anything that includes green chiles in it.  Anything.  A few varieties of olives were served wtih fresh herbs and a dash an oil & vinegar.  I love all olives and don't always buy them for home, so it was a real treat.  They came in a little bowl, but there were about 20 of them.  The red goat salad was perfect: tons of pistachios on it, big chunks of goat cheese and strawberries.And den...and den...the mac and cheese, generously stuffed with chopped green chiles, ooey-gooey melted cheese that was crusty on the edges, the way it's supposed to be.I'll be back with Dexter.  They gave him a treat.  Oh, and my meal was treat.  I'm burping up the leftovers as I type this.I went here for a large get together over the weekend. Our waitress was really great considering the large, drunk group. :) The only thing I didn't like was the lack of fountain diet coke. It came in a cute mexican glass bottle but i prefer my diet coke to come from a fountain. I'm crazy like that. Other than that, the glass did pour me 3 refills which was PLENTY so i didn't feel jipped......except by the lack of extra bubbles that comes from a fountain cola, but i digress.I had this amazing salad. it had artichoke hearts, pine nuts, onions, mozarella, and leafy greens. top notch. everyone elses food looked amazing too. especially that damn hotdog. i wish they had a few more menu options unrelated to sandwiches or salads, but i definitely recommend. super good.Came here on a Saturday afternoon..had some wine & beer..both were fabulous...my husband really enjoyed the amber ale infused with raspberry.We decided to share the mac & cheese, not a fan of this AT ALL. Maybe it's just my personal preference...I thought it was not creamy enough, the bottom was burnt to a crisp, there was way too much green chili in it, and the very very thick layer of cheddar on top was not tasting good at all. We could only take a few bites and had to stop. We shared some vanilla ice cream & it was perfect. The service was great all around. We did have quite a few different folks helping us, but they were all wonderful, and this didn't bother me at all. We sat on the patio and enjoyed the day while looking at all the cute doggies that were coming in. They are VERY dog friendly here, and I love that!I will return and would like to come in the evening and maybe try one of their sandwiches, they looked really good as they were passing by.Eeeehhhh.....a group of us came here on a Saturday to take advantage of the patio and our beautiful weather, and I'll admit, I was so, so disappointed. I'm completely shocked it has such killer reviews.One: they don't have high chairs. Big slap in the face as a parent, if I'm being honest. You DO know you lose a customer when you so blatantly tell them their children aren't welcome...you know that, right? Not all children are misbehaved nuisances, and if I want to bring my kids out with me for a nice afternoon lunch in which we all enjoy ourselves, then I will! And you will have a high chair! And you will not rudely tell me "we don't have those" when I ask for one! Because then I get on Yelp and do crazy things like use too many exclamation points! So take a risk and order the damn high chairs. (Also let me now point out that there were several DOGS on the patio. So, I can bring my DOG to slobber and shed and just be gross all over while I'm eating, but I can't bring my child of high-chair-sitting-age?)*Rant over.Ahem. Where was I? Two: the servers were rude, slow, and all around unpleasant. Not a good vibe when you're trying to relax. (Oh wait, I bet it was my crazy kids making everyone grumpy!) We had to wait a good 10 minutes after sitting down for someone to clean our table/bring us menus/even notice we were there. Turns out half of our group didn't want to dine here because of said awful service, but they didn't mention it until after we were there and seated. Three: the food is alright, but not great. The Coney is still good (though I'm not sure it's the Best, per the New Times), and the Mac and Cheese is just alright (I personally prefer Windsor's). The hus ordered The Veg and he said it was one of the worst vegetable sandwiches he's ever had. I'm not sure why offering a decent vegetable sandwich is so difficult for many restaurants in Phoenix. Four: ambience. There was none. No music was playing, the tables and chairs were flimsy with no place settings/decorations, there's no art or plants or really anything inside or out. I probably won't ever be back to TMI, because frankly, there are just so many other places that are way better. *I understand I went totally nuts, and that not offering high chairs doesn't mean they don't welcome children, but really? COME ON.Main ingredient, oh how your deliciousness overfloweth, and your food ain't bad either!After getting suckered into a lunch with the guys from work, we flipped a coin and ended up aimed from The Main Ingredient. Let me tell you, there are worse places to end up for lunch. I wasn't sure how, but the coin was flipped between, Main Ingredient, Cartel, AND Upper Crust. I didn't realize there were 3 sides to a coin before, but apparently there is. I was torn between the Mac & Cheese and the the Red Goat. After some convincing my buddies and the waitress helped me land on the Mac & Cheese. Although, you can't really compare apples to apples here, being that the Red Goat is a salad and the Mac & Cheese is; well, Mac & Cheese, I really was torn. Let me tell you now, this was the beginning of the end for me, and I haven't looked back since. After that first bite I made an executive decision; I would be taking a vacation from my normal diet. Don't worry diet, we'll get back together someday soon, just not today and likely not tomorrow either.The Mac & Cheese here was like a lasagne of good ol' hometown delicious cheesy goodness, expecting to see a piled scoop of cheesy noodles, I was pleasantly surprised! Cooked with loads of cheddar cheese and topped with green chile, this was pure Mac & Cheese bliss.In real downtown Phoenix fashion, Main Ingredient is tucked into a renovated home, redone to give that home / cafe feel. Many of their dishes are served with a crispy crusted soft and extremely tasty bread and on a side note, ask them for a side of olive oil for dipping it in. Better for you than butter and in my opinion better tasting, and it adds a little European charm. Here's hoping your next coin flip ends all you up at Main Ingredient. Happy Dining Yelpers!I loved the patio area and the lights!! Good food and friendly service!! I went with the ever yummy cash-money!!! Oh soo gooey delicious!!! Must try!! The vibe of the place was just right!!  Very soothing and hip!!Last Friday for lunch we decided to go to Main Ingredient.  OMG,  this place has the best BLT in town.  I'm not really sure what bacon they used, but it was awesome.  So the sandwich had chipotle mayonnaise,  lettuce, tomato and the perfect amount of bacon.  Normally when I get a BLT from somewhere it only has a couple of pieces of bacon on it.    Thanks, Main Ingredient for the best BLT ever.  :)Both times I've visited The Main Ingredient, it was Mainly a disappointment.This is based on two main things. Thing 1: Nothing on the food menu on either visit jumped out, making me feel, Oh I Have To Have That! I had the Jive Turkey on my first visit and the Cash Money on my second. Both were good sandwiches but again neither made me yearn to come back in a hurry...Thing 2: The service is average at best, in fact, on our second visit the service... errr... server was awful. I side stepped from saying all the service was bad because actually the bus staff were great. They were attentive, friendly, and kept asking if we wanted our waters refilled. Our server on the other hand, never put in our appetizer ordered and overall just seemed flighty and was inattentive. After a while, when she realized she hadn't put in the order she came over and apologized, but it was downhill from there. I don't know if she was embarrassed or what, but she then got even less attentive. They weren't busy either... It was just bad... As far as the vibe, I like the old house reused as a restaurant atmosphere. Although both times we've eaten here, we didn't sit inside, but instead chose the patio. Overall, an okay place. It's worth checking out once, but this second visit will more than likely be my last.DOWN TOWN GEM!! That's what this place is. The renovated 1920s bungalow turned restaurant is so perfect. We stepped inside this place, and as it was darling inside, it just turned into patio weather that day. And for me... That's the only option when you have a nice patio with patio seating still available. So we sat at a long kind of bar top outside to look out on the down town street corner. They have a place to give your dog a drink, a place to park your bike, and all kinds of down town goodies. They had a nice selection of craft beers. They were on Happy Hour. It seemed to me that they are always on happy hour. But I didn't find a happy hour menu. We were just please that when we got the bill they were much cheaper than what was posted on the drink menu. The food menu was filled with delicious, and different options. We decided to do one a little out of the ordinary, and one staple dish. The first meal was their Cash Money....house-made cashew butter, Red Pepper-Cabernet Jelly, & banana, on sourdough. It was a great spin on a traditional PB&J. Makes me want to experiment at home. I do think that next time I will ask for a little extra Red- Pepper-Cabernet Jelly though. The second dish we got  was The Acapulco Cheesesteak......juicy roast beef, Oaxacan cheese, griddled red pepper & red onion, cilantro, & house-made chipotle mayo, on baguette. This is THE BEST Cheesesteak I have EVER HAD. My husband agreed. And he is a Cheesesteak fanatic. That cheese, with those perfectly cooked red peppers, and that chipotle mayo... You CAN NOT go wrong. And after all that, the bill was not bad at all. We were pleasantly surprised. We cant wait to go back and try more.

Review Text :
A signed picture of a smiling LaToya Jackson greets you as you enter. The staff is friendly, the restaurant is spacious, and more than 80 items are offered, dessert included. But the food is far from memorable. A lot of the items were bland - even my favorite, fried chicken - and those which were not were sub par even for a buffet. And don't bother with the sushi; I've come to the conclusion that if you don't have a sushi chef preparing the sushi behind a sushi counter, it's probably not worth it. The establishment will probably survive, though. It looks like it's been there forever and seems to have a loyal customer base from Sun City. The perpetual bumper-to-bumper traffic on that part of Grand Avenue on the drive back to Phoenix was a fitting conclusion for this buffet excursion.

Restaurant name  Yagyu Yakiniku
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
Yagyu has been on the radar for a good while since many Vegas locals have spotted their "Yakiniku" sign.  Apparently, they opened up this week and Philip T. was so kind to remind us that it had finally opened.It's what I would call Korean barbecue meets the finer end of Japanese quality meat.  Yakiniku means "grilling meat" and it's hard to separate the two from just regular good ole fashion Korean BBQ.I was pretty excited when I walked in the restaurant - clean lines, large tables with exhaust chimneys for grilling, and a thermometer announcing the beer was 29 degrees.However, when I saw the menu, I was disappointed.  It was very simple and basic.  I was a bit turned off.  But since we were there already, I just had to try it.  The waitresses also gave us two dipping sauces - a Japanese soy sauce with mirin and another one I can't remember.* Pork Toro ($6.75) - Twelve pieces of fatty pork sprinkled with salt and pepper.  We threw them on the grill and yes, they were amazingly delicious and fatty.* Prime Beef Tongue ($9.25) - Seven pieces of fresh beef tongue and went quite nicely with the lemon juice and sesame oil/salt concoction.* Ribeye ($7.75) - Six or seven pieces of beef, along with three pieces of veggies.  Also, very tasty and fresh.Initially, the prices don't seem too bad.  But I knew we were hungry and if were going to stick around, the bill would have been costly.  I thought we would be able to enjoy a nice meaty dinner, but seeing the direction of the costs, it looked like it would be a pricey meat dinner.  I don't really like how everything is a la carte - kimchee, garlic, lettuce, rice, etc.  With all the Korean restaurants in town, you get used to getting all that other stuff included.And like john h.'s friend, our friend thought some of the waitresses were cute, but that's his fever.Service was good, a bit over efficient this first week of business.  We had at least three different girls ask if we were ready to order, and we were not.  I think they are just trying to be out there, but it can get suffocating.The exhaust doesn't work that great because tears were welling up from all the smoke coming from our grill. Overall, I think it would be good for a snack or light meal, but not for a hearty meal with friends.I really misjudged this place the first time I ate here, well cause for one. I didn't know what to order.  After eating here a second time, I feel like the place deserved its justice.  I do now have a better understanding of what to order, and how to order it.  I never understood why the prices were so high, untili the waitress came out and explained it to us.  The reason why it's $8.95 or higher a plate for a couple slices of meat, is because they're giving you high quality meat.  They can't do an all you can eat option, because it would cause them to go broke.  With those pieces of meat I can't complain, they were so tender and amazingly satisfying.  Don't be confused in mixing this with korean bbq, in fact there is nothing korean about it, except for the fact that they give kimchi and pickled cucumbers as sides.  My friends and I ordered 2 of the family specials at $39.95 a plate.  It came with 3 types of meat (we ordered prime), beef tongue, and chicken.  OMG, the kalbi is sooooo melt in your mouth delicious.  Try not to cook it all the way, and have the meat be a little pink.  Trust me, the juices will intensify your tongue with a booming blast of flavors! We then ordered another round of kalbi and some other type of meat.  I think this has been one of the best quality meats I've had at a Yakiniku restaurant, for a reasonable price.  The atmosphere of this place is good, the waiters/waitresses weren't rude and they sit you down immediately after walking in.  The food preparation is fast, and they're not bad with splitting the checks.  It was a good encounter in chinatown, where I'm always faced with bad service. All in all, I would return again. Maybe with a group, because all together the bill came out to $120.  But with the groupon, we ended up saving $100.00.  Thank you groupon!

Restaurant name  Grimaldi's Pizzeria
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
The name "New York Pizza" conjures up a predictable image in the heads of most people, and to those lucky enough, an intense and blissful memory.  This kind of pizza, large, floppy and often sold by the slice has been imitated in one way or another in every corner of the country to mixed results.  But there is another sort of New York pizza that predates the style most (New Yorkers included) are familiar with. It's the kind of pizza made in a small handful of ancient pizzerias in New York city like Lomardi's, Grimaldi's and Totono's. It's thin crusted with a sweet tomato sauce and a dusting of parmesan and/or romano, some dried oregano and fresh basil and a generous drizzle of olive oil. Mozzarella is used sparingly, about half as much as you'd expect. This is the style of the very first pizzas made in America by Neapolitan immigrants.  The distinguishing factor today is the once-common coal-fired brick oven running about 900 degrees that's capable of charring the crust before it browns the cheese.  The result is a striking palette of black, light brown, white, dark green and about five shades of red.I've never been to Grimaldi's in Brooklyn, but I have been to Totono's. And this style, the so-called New York Neapolitan, was one I thought I could only score in NYC.  Through the magic of Yelp, I found this improbable outpost while looking for a hassle-free, off the strip locale for a family dinner. Problem is, I talk too much and felt the need to find a real gem.  This couldn't have been easier.  I was shocked to see that NYC's favorite pizzeria had franchised, but this looks like a small chain run by a nephew of the original owner, with his blessings, assistance and recipes.  We were quickly seated through the help of a call-ahead quasi-reservation at the best table in the house, right next to the pizza prep station.  The pies were nearly flawless.  I went with extra basil and I sampled the pepperoni and sausage. There were six of us, all northeast natives, two of which have lived in Italy, and all of us ranked this as our favorite or near-favorite pizza ever.  Is it my favorite?  I'm not sure, but it's 2nd or third at worst.  It has to be the best in Vegas and it will be a mandatory stop every time I'm in town.They don't have a line out the door yet, so check it out before the word spreads.  Service is attentive and polite, which isn't very "East Coast" of them, but that's one part of back home that I don't miss. Five mother-f'n stars.DAMN!  Simply the best!  I got a coupon for a free pizza so my lady and I decided to come back on our way out of Vegas this past weekend. We got a small mediteranean salad and a large pepperoni and garlic pizza.  This is perfect pizza in every possible way.  Crispy crust, charred bottom, fresh mozz, savory pepperoni and great garlic.  Just flat out awesome!  Its definitely in the top 5 pizzas I have consumed in my life. If you have never been, please go!  Its by far the best pizza you can get anywhere outside of New York!small pizza was like a medium at other places. it was divided into 6 slices evenly. the pizza crust was delicious - thin and lightly burnt - just the way i like it!! got the pepperoni and mushroom toppings - i like the pepperoni, it was different and tasted really good. the pizza had the perfect amount of sauce, service was good. I like the atmosphere of there restaurant and that you can see two pizza guys tossing the pizza dough - that was amusing to watch.next time, i'll ask for extra basil!Still the best!  I came here straight from the airport and decided to try out a new combo.  I got a personal sausage and onion pie.  Great flavors!  Friendly staff and great pizza as always!  I need a teleportation device so I can go to the different Grimaldis across the US whenever I want.  If I am ever in a city that has one, it is a must do!I am not a huge fan of this place. I feel it is all hype. Seriously. The pies I have tried were average and taste and everything is above average in price. The restaurant itself is warm and inviting with brick walls and red and white checkered table clothes, but it feels like a scam when they bring out the pies and then the inflated bill. At least I was with good friends this night.The food is nothing to write home about at all. I've had the antipasto salad which was ordinary. The white pizza with garlic and sausage and onions as toppings. Please tell me I am not the only one who feels these pies are dry? I'm not an extra sauce kind of girl, but we have always had to ask for a side of sauce with the pizza. Sausage is tasty. I will give them kudos for that. I've also had pizza with red sauce and sausage. It still seemed sauce deficient. Bread basket? It might as well be Wonder Bread. It was lacking in freshness, flavor and flare. They get two stars for serving booze and for decent service. That's it. I'd rather microwave Totinos Pizza Rolls in the comfort of my own home than be seen at Grimaldi's again.As much as I mostly loathe Vegas after having been obligated to visit for so many conventions and trade shows over the years, the outer reaches are even worse. WTF is this, Irvine in the desert?If it wasn't for the divine blessings of Dave G and Steven N I would have circled back to the freeway after gazing upon this strip mall hell stretch. Once extracting myself from the Stang my initial impression of the  exterior was also a let down. Faak, I drove this far out of my way for this? But as soon as I entered and sat at the bar I was greeted in the most enthusiastic way by Alex. The wear of 2 nights of Vegas debauchery was quickly dashed by this consummate pro. This is the guy you will want to hire as your front of the house person if thinking about opening a restaurant. Hell,  I would hire him to watch over my daughters and secret cache of gold, well that is if I had either.First up was deciding on a glass of vino. I chose the Coppola Directors Cut Zin ($12 per glass). For my pizza Alex and I agreed that I should keep it simple since this was my first time kneeling at the alter of NY Pizza heaven. I went with shrooms, pepperoni, onions, and olives. Damn fine pizza indeed. Perfectly baked hand spun crust, very fresh high quality toppings, absolute perfection. Here is where you go for that elusive Vegas hangover cure.Contrary to the brilliantly funny review by Jaime (http://www.yelp.com/biz/grimaldis-pizzeria-las-vegas-2) I can think of another word besides the eff one.....Yum!One of the best pizza's in town (NY thin style pizza). The staff is always so attentive. The bartender, Anthony always goes out of his way to make sure we have a great time.  You must save room for the freshly made cheesecake.  I've never tasted anything as delicious.  I would also recommend the Caesar or Greek salad, both are an excellent addition.BaaaaaM!! Upping to 5 stars. Sure, some of the best NY style pizza to be had anywhere, including NY where the original Grimaldis was born. But the service here is unparalleled, especially for a pizza joint. This time we had the immense pleasure of being helped by Joelle. She is definitely on it like Blue Bonnet. Patient in explaining the menu and pizza sauce variations etc. Also very efficient and fun loving too. I brought several family members here for my off to the airport meal, and we all had a blast with Joelle as our enabler. And this was on a random Monday lunch when you expect most restaurants to have their B team. I have a feeling they don't have a B team here. Thanks again Grimaldis for another 5 star service experience.WHERE: Eastern & Richmar (inside the plaza, right by Cafe Rio)WHY: If you're craving legit New York style pizza, this is the place to be!WHAT: I never thought for once that I would be able to taste the difference between pizzas until I came here.  For years, I've always thought that pizza was just pizza! Little did I know, pizza here is beyond Little Caesar's!I am a part of a charity, and we actually held a charity event here a few months ago, and it was the first time I've ever stepped foot into this place. I mean, I've seen it around, but never got to trying it.  Let me tell you! The entire staff including the manager were all wonderful, accommodating, and super friendly!  They had plenty of recommendations (Everthing was basically recommended, and I'm going to have to agree!)Note: It is all thin-crust goodness! From the classic sauce, to the white sauce, all the way to the pesto sauce-- all G double O D = GOOD! There is also a list of toppings you may choose from (tomatoes, mushroom, SUN DRIED TOMATOES, anchovies, and the list goes on), and also different sizes of pizza. I'd recommend the biggest one (you know, so you can save the rest for later. You gotta strategize!!). So about the pizza, I'll leave it at that. Now it's your turn to try it!Now onto the desserts! I am not a huge fan of cheesecake, but I'll definitely eat a slice here! There is a variety to choose from as well (RECURRING THEME: so many to choose from, all so GOOD)! I have personally tried the oreo cheesecake (I highly recommend), original NY style, and the pumpkin cheesecake... which were all just perfection melting in my mouth! Yes, melt it does. The consistency of the cheesecake is just so perfect, probably why I'll only like cheesecake here at Grimaldi's!! Aside from the cheesecake, you must try the cannoli!!! JUST DO IT!FUN FACT: Grimaldi's has a unique water system, where their water comes directly from NY, to get that authentic NY style pizza. DID I GET YOU NOW??...I HOPE SO... GO NOW! THERE ARE SEVERAL LOCATIONS AROUND THE CITY =DSo we meet again. Me and Grimaldi's. I have to say I have seen the light. In the form of a white pizza.....I forgot I was a part of their Birthday Club and low and behold I get the email wishing me Happy Birthday in the form of a free pizza. It didn't end up being completely free, but I don't care. What I do care about is I tasted the glory in their white sauce pizza with sausage. It was garlicky, it was crispy and slightly chewy and just the right amount of every ingredient. I would have liked a little more fresh Basil, but that is the story of my life. The sausage was savory and spicy without overpowering the other ingredients.This pizza was just what I needed and I have even almost gone back. I know, it's insane.Downfalls. Because you know I gots sum;)1. Loud, loud, loud. I'm not sure if it's because of the flooring or brick walls, but I could not think it was so terribly loud and it gave me extreme anxiety. My hearing is better than most so imagine being able to hear twenty conversations at once. Yeah, bad news bears. Next time I return I will be wearing headphones.2. Bright lights. Pet peeve is bright lights in a restaurant in the evening. I don't need to see or hear the fifty kids fondling their raw dough, wasting the parm on the table and pretending to make their own za. I also don't need to see my date's pores. Ever.3. 4pm. Whatever you do 4pm is not the time to come to Grimaldi's. They do something to the oven at that time for about 20-30 minutes and you cannot get a pizza. Instead you have to eat a boring salad with a bitter dressing and stare at each other. You can't talk because you can't hear each other over the noise. I really think the chef might just be celebrating 4:20p everyday getting erie mon. Whatever he did my pie tasted like a million bucks so keep on keepin on Chef pizza dude. Will I return? Oh hellz yeah. Just for the Large White Sauce with Garlic and Sausage and extra Basil pie. Kudos Grimaldi's for redeeming yourself. I am feelin' you big time. Until we meet again my new white saucy friend.Decided to have dinner far away from the strip thinking it would be way better overall. I don't know if we were wrong or right but this place surely disappointed us. It started out first with the beer selection. Okay, not a big deal as food is more important but they're out of a beer we chose and they didn't even offer a suggestion. We ordered a large pizza and got two toppings (sausage and mushrooms). I could literally count all the sausage toppings and mushrooms were just as sparse. For a place that charges by the topping, we felt ripped off! Service wasn't that much better. The table nearby had more food and drinks and could tell they got better service the entire time because of it. Ridiculous for the party of two! By the time we are almost half the pizza, it became rubbery and impossible to cut with a fork and knife, bleh! We had one slice left over and decided to get it to go. When we tried eating it later that evening it was disgusting! Needless to say we won't be returning to this or any of the other Grimaldi's locations.A chain pizza place that can actually deliver, no pun intended. I have driven past this place a million times, but never ventured in because there are plenty of places to eat on Eastern Avenue without hitting up a cross country pizza chain. When in Henderson, on a Friday night, after eleven, the pickin's are slim and I was tired. I was "pizza chained" into submission. I came in, bellied up to the bar, and ordered a Goose Island and Caesar salad. While perusing the menu for pizza options my salad quickly came and it was good. I mean it's a Caesar salad, with fresh lettuce and solid dressing. You really have to try hard to mess up a Caesar salad. I ordered a personal pizza (12in) with ricotta, sausage, basil, black olives, with a pesto drizzle. This pizza was very good and also came out fast and fresh. The crust was crispy and the ricotta was the perfect addition to the marinara and pesto collaboration. This was plenty of pizza for one person and the perfect sharing size. I like the fact that I can build my own pie and the process was mostly painless. Good pizza, not amazing, but I would come back for the service and the beer selection. Grimaldi's had done its job, I had a full belly, light buzz, and was ready for bed!The Boyfriend and I indulged in a date night and of course we chose or favorite place, Grimaldis! I wanted to update my review because once again we had a perfect experience. Bf wanted to try the spinach salad (I have a hard time not ordering the Caesar because it is my favorite), but the spinach was quite good. I appreciate that they never scrimp on the toppings. Now to the good stuff... Pizza. This pizza is my absolute favorite. I have to hold myself from eating the whole pie! This time we ordered spicy chicken, sun dried tomatoes & spinach and I don't know if I'll ever ordered another variation. It was perfection! I also love the Layer Cake Malbec and we couldn't leave without an order of cheesecake for takeout. So yummy! The service was great. Kimberly was very attentive & friendly. She got a little busy towards the end of our meal, but she communicated and made sure we had everything we needed. I'm so glad this place has been able to stay consistently delicious. Thanks Grimaldis, I can't wait for my next slice!

Portions: HugeService: Top NotchAtmosphere: Awesome for loud groups and familiesThis place is a great basic restaurant for groups and families. It lies in the old Vine/McKenna's Tavern location, and while the decor isn't anything fancy, the service was fabulous and the food was really good and large portions. So some of their TVs are old school, who cares. They have great drink prices and daily specials as well as plenty of flat screens. They were really good accommodating all my food allergies and they serve cider, so I'm a happy camper. And, I love the fact that I can toss my peanuts on the floor and make a major mess with my 2 year old without anyone giving me the stink eye.

Restaurant name  Burrito Drive
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
As much as I've come to love their burritos, I'm giving up on Burrito Drive. I've tried over the summer to keep my enthusiasm but I'm not trying any more.The only good thing about this place is the food.  The bad things, listed here, have caused me to walk away: (1) slowness of service, (2) late deliver times, and (3) inaccuracy of the orders.(1) If I place an order over the phone to pick up at your location, don't tell me to be there in 10 minutes when, 10 minutes later, you haven't even started on my order.  Also, don't say, "No, it will be ready in 10 minutes" when I offer to be there in 15 or 20 minutes.(2) If you tell me that the order will be delivered in 30 to 50 minutes, don't show up in an hour.(3) If I order chips and salsa, bring me the damn salsa.Full disclosure: I have no fucking clue where this place is. What is a Brearly Street anyway?  So many questions. What I do know is that when I'm in Madison for a couple days I eventually have a pretty civilized conversation with my stomach. It goes like this:Stomach: Burrito?Me: We just had breakfast.S: Yeah, but burrito.Me: They don't open until 11.S:  Ok so burrito at 11?Me: Maybe.S. Don't you dare maybe me I will fucking end you.Girlfriend: Who are you talking to?Me: What? I'm not talking to anybody. Who would I be talking to? You're crazy. How do you feel about burritos for lunch?Girlfriend: Again? OK. (leaves room)S: That's right, bitches. Come to daddy, braised pork burrito.So roughly 30 minutes after I'm verbally abused by one of my own internal organs a guy magically shows up with a tasty treat for me. I like the braised pork burrito, the high roller burrito and the steak quesadilla. When I eat them my stomach stops saying mean things to me and I don't have to cry myself to sleep.

YIKES!!! I had no idea that they were in the middle of a political fight with food carts AND that they were closed down not too long ago by the health department. http://vegas.eater.com/archives/2012/04/10/mamitas-stays-closed-after-health-district-reinspection.phpThis was one of those -let's be spontaneous moments. Just makes me realize that I need to stay on top of my restaurant research and not just take a chance!Anyway I had their shrimp dish with garlic. She brings me pollo.. I have her take it back and she brings me the shrimp dish. The shrimp must have been in the sauce for 10 minutes - totally overcooked.. Yikes I say again!  We had stepped out from the yelp event to have a looksee in the funky neighborhood and the Mamitas/CUBAN neon sign drug me right over there.  When we got inside it reminded me of some of the mexican restaurant dives in Portland and that's a good thing. I should have realized that there were mostly only white faces eating their food and stepped back out though.

Restaurant name  Club Sandwich & Deli
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
I finally found a spot close to work that offers some pretty decent food at a considerable value.  I got take-out from Club Sandwich today.  I received a tip from another co-worker to "call ahead" to order or I would be waiting my whole lunch break for my lunch. So me and another co-worker decided to call and place our order for pickup.  When I got there our orders were mostly done.  They have weekly specials, todays was order any original sandwich and get a cup of soup for free.  They had other daily specials advertised in the restaurant but not on their website.  I opted to get an Original Sangwich Bavarian Style.  They offer your choice of grilled local steak or free-ranged chicken, and the Bavarian comes with onions, pickles, swiss cheese and black forest mustard on a ciabatta bread.  They advertise that they also have lettuce and tomato on them but there was none on mine.  I am not sure if I had to ask for this but seems as though they forgot.  They also ran out of their soup of the day, beef tortellini, so I went with the Texas Chicken Chili.  The meal was only $6.25 plus tax.  Not a bad deal for a home style lunch.  The sandwich was pretty tasty, just a little too much bread to steak ratio, but flavors were savory .  The soup strangely appeared to have no chicken.  In fact I proposed the opinion of my co-worker to identify the meat.  Indeed we agreed beef.  Good thing I like beef,  but not sure why they would call it chicken chili.  The chili had a lot of beans and tomatoes in it.  Not spicy, but a good flavor, yet a little oily.  All considered this is definitely a worthy choice for lunch.

Restaurant name  Wooden Vine Wine Bar & Bistro
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
I've been intrigued by Wooden Vine every time I walk by, but rarely had occasion to stop in. On a recent weekend evening I finally caved and decided to have a glass. My overall impression after one visit was "meh."Let's talk wine. They do have a pretty decently constructed wine list that represents most parts of the globe (though it did feel a little California heavy on my visit, not that there's anything wrong with Cali wines). I ordered a glass of a slightly obscure cabernet that I had not had before (since I like to try new things), and it was meh. The server really couldn't tell me anything about it before hand, but we'll get to the service in a minute.  First, let's talk about price.  Given that I work in the wine industry, I'm aware of the customary markups. But this list seemed a little on the pricey side, compared to what I'm used to. Could be that I'm a cheap date, or maybe it's the uptown atmosphere.Which leads me back to the service. Aside from no one in the room really being able to talk intelligently about the wines I was considering when I asked,other than offering scant more than what the menu stated, we were met with a coldness from the staff that honestly made me a little uncomfortable.  I felt my presence was an inconvenience to them. Maybe it's a byproduct of serving mostly Center City banker-types and they are giving their usual crowd what they expect, but at the least a smile never killed anyone.My opinion at this time, is that there are better options in the QC. I'll give it a couple months and try Wooden Vine again and see if my opinion is swayed.

Review Text :
Not only did I enjoy sitting outside for a lovely ladies business lunch at Frank & Albert's last week, but I enjoyed the best Cobb salad ever!  I'm picky about chicken and this was excellent quality and delicious rotisserie chicken they used.  The combo of the other ingredients (lettuce, tomato, egg, avocado, bacon, and black olives) along with the green goddess dressing was superb.  It was a beautiful presentation too!My dining companions' meals looked amazing as well.  I saw the Biltmore Bistro Burger, the Grilled Fish Tacos, and the B.A.L.T. (their Tuesday Blue Plate Special).  We devoured pretty much everything on the table too...The service was a tad on the slow side but it was also a packed restaurant.  I will have to return for breakfast, dinner, and/or happy hour too as all of their menus look outstanding.  The bar/drinks menu alone has something for everyone with economy friendly prices.  If you have not yet been to the Arizona Biltmore, this new restaurant is reason to go... and since this year marks the Biltmore's 80th Birthday, there is a ton of history in the resort as well.Located inside the Biltmore, this place is an awesome restaurant to meet clients or friends for lunch.  I ordered a Margherita Pizza and some Iced Tea.  The Margarita Pizza was superb!  Very good and just the right size too....not too large & not too small.  I left satisfied.  The Iced Tea was very good too....I think I drank 5 or 6 glasses!Of course, the service was outstanding as well.  It's no wonder why there were several tables and booths with people conducting business....it's a great place for that.Return Factor - 96%Immerse yourself in a setting inspired by Mr.Frank Lloyd Wright himself and savor some of the better Southwestern infused upscale comfort food this side of anything offered at Kai.  It truly captures the essence of its famous namesake.

Review Text :
Came here for National pancake day where you may donate dollars for the free short stack of plain buttermilk pancakes.  Added hash browns and an egg, but my server forgot to add the egg order.  I reminded him of the omission after a few minutes and told him I didn't want it anymore, but a manager brought one over, anyway.  Hash browns were OK, crisped the way I requested it, but the pancakes tasted very sweet, and I hadn't even added any of the syrup I'd brought, not like any other kind of pancake I've had at local breakfast places, such as Good Egg, Snooze, Soul Cafe, and even U.S. Egg.  I ate one at the restaurant, and took the leftovers home, but they turned rubbery the next day and was inedible.  I could taste the sugar left on my teeth when I tried to take a bite...I won't be back for the free pancakes, but perhaps, in a pinch*, I could have more of the crispy hash browns, bacon, and eggs.*Thanks to Jeffery A., who made me realize I didn't have to throw the baby out with the bath water!

Review Text :
It's hard to keep up with all of the new Pita Jungles in the Valley, but I'm doing my best to make it to each one.  Today was the day for me to finally try the Fashion Square Jungle location and it did not disappoint!Laura L and I were doing a tad bit of shopping and we worked up an appetite for lunch.  We would've likely gone to one of the sit-down restaurants in the mall but we were limited on time since she had a flight to catch.  It's nice to have a decent option in the food court as in the past I've gone to Paradise Bakery or Panda Express.Laura went with a gyro and I had a small greek salad with a falafel ball on the side.  I enjoyed my meal despite having to eat it in the middle of the crowded mall food court.  The extra bonus?  They even have Sriracha in little cups on the side!While I wouldn't seek out this PJ location, it comes in handy when you're at the mall... Keep up the good work Pita Jungle peeps.  Next stop? Downtown in the works I hear!i dont know why i didn't fall in love with pita jungle sooner. i work right next to the mall so the food court is super convenient for us. let me tell you a story of how i ate here everyday for lunch for a week. i ordered a standard gyro with no pickles (they put pickles on their gyros and i find that disgusting) my coworker, jen, ordered the pasta salad with chicken on top. mine was delicious and i tasted hers. hers was so good! i was like, that's what i'm ordering tomorrow.the next day we went again and i ordered the chicken pasta. while waiting for the food to come out someone in front of me picked up their order of a hummus trio with chicken on top and a side of pita.the next day jen asked where i wanted to go to lunch. i said pita jungle and i got my hummus trio. and the trend continued. their food is so good!!!! and its like $8!! and since i work nearby i get a discount! today i had a side of chicken breast with super fresh mushrooms. i watched them steam them, then put them in a pan with w tons of garlic, red wine, and seasoning. some of the best mushrooms i've ever had and it was a HUGE order of mushrooms.i love this place!06/16/112.5 stars.Was hungry and decided to try the new addition (a few months, anyway) to Scottsdale's Fashion Square's food court.  Decided to see if the hummus http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pita-jungle-scottsdale-2?select=AxUkQfJnvEHNTadsybTnsw#AxUkQfJnvEHNTadsybTnsw was just as tasty as the ones at the restaurants across the valley.  Decided to round the meal with a salad, as well.  The presentation of the food wasn't very appetizing...** The prices of what you pay for here are about the same you'd pay at the stand-alone restaurants, so i'd suggest just dining at the restaurants to get the added ambience, rather than sit at the food court using styrofoam plates and plastic boxes and utensils.***  Atmosphere would be more relaxed, as well.  However, if looking for healthier options at Scottsdale Fashion Square's courtyard, then Pita Jungle is one of the very few.**I tend not to return to places that use styrofoam cups and plates.  Sorry, but it's my way to help reduce the amounts of styrofoam that enter landfills.***Note to PJ: Please consider sourcing paper plates and biodegradeable utensils, instead.  Most people in your target demographic won't mind paying slightly higher prices for the switch!i've always been a fan of the pita jungle franchise. whether it's their Chandler location, and their fantastic servers, or the Tempe locale and their easy access along the lightrail corridor- pita jungle is usually a sure fire bet. I've been watching the progress of their dwn twn location for a good couple months now and anticipating the days when i could leisurely stroll down 3rd ave and grab myself some of their tasty treats.When they finally opened i was pleased. It wasnt until last night however that i actually stopped in for a bite.around 9 o'clock pm they have their reverse happy hour, a great time to drop in catch some drinks and wash them down with their tapas; an assortment of their appetizer items that you can order for anywhere from $1 - $3 per tiny plate, and generally due to my cheap and stingy nature anything under $5 i am a big fan of.sampling delicious appetizer items ranging from their spanish style "gambas al ajo", to the yummy hummus concoctions to potato infused garlic dip, dolmades, mozarella tomato and basil with balsamic, to their falafel you can really load up and get a feel to the swagger they portend. Our server was cute, friendly, and charmingly alt. if not a little unsure of the menu she was perky and willing to find all the answers to our various questions regarding the menu. after all was said and done my brother and i had shared several plates of tapas and left quite satisfied with a meagre bill of only $16. Pita Jungle is a great option to the late night foodie scene of downtown, a def. stop.I don't think it was that bad. I can't believe the low stars that some people are giving this place. I thought the new location was fabulous! I went there with my friend Sage and Billy last night and enjoyed a nice dinner. It was Billy's first time there and he got the mozzarella and tomato appetizer and some chicken entree. Sage got the shawarma and quesadilla. Sage said the shawarma tasted different, but good. Maybe it's because they have a different cook. We've been to the other locations several times and have always enjoyed them. I ordered a tomato basil soup and a vegetarian burger. The only thing that's strange was the burger. They used  two pieces of toast instead of a burger bun. That was weird. Why call it a burger when it looked more like a sandwich? However I still like this place. Definitely a great addition to the downtown location.Granted, the ambiance at this location is completely different than any of the other locations I've been to, I think this is such a pretty space! I was especially impressed that despite all the concrete and block, it wasn't as noisy as some other Valley restaurants that share design elements. As for the food and any menu recommendations, I like the: Red Pepper Hummus Gambas Con Ajo (5 shrimp, loads of garlic and tomato. Hint: the description says there's cilantro. I HATE cilantro and I like this dish.) Spicy Chicken Wrap (packed with chicken, beans and rice -- big enough to share!) Broiled Fish Sandwich (My fish was cooked perfectly here. There was way too much bread, though. I wound up eating most of the fish with a fork and leaving most of the bread) Fruit & Cheese Fantasia (A hit with my family. It's huge!) Wine List (they have great selections! I can always find something I like.) Perhaps my least favorite thing on the menu: One Thousand Beans because it has tempted me more than once and then proved to be beyond bland -- flavorless. Blech!I've always been a fan of Pita Jungle, but this location takes the cake for service!I call before I leave the office to get an order to go.  They tell me 15 minutes.  When I arrive 15 minutes later, my order is ready!  The service here is always friendly and they know my name.  The place is clean, too.The back patio is huge and they have free wifi.  There's even a small bar outside, looking in.  I've never seen it completely empty. So glad we finally have a Pita Jungle in CenPho!!!Generally speaking I am not the hugest fan of Pita Jungle, but I really enjoy this particular location. It is large, has a great atmosphere, friendly staff, and an awesome patio.My favorite thing about PJ is their INCREDIBLE happy hour. They do a huge selection of tapas for $1-2 each! You can get a few small plates and try multiple things and have your bill, with drink, come out under $10. Slammin! Tapas items: Hummus Trio, Garlic Dip, Sauteed Mushrooms, Tomato and Mozzarella, Olives, Taziki, Some Lemon Chicken Dish, Olive Oil and Pita, and Falaffel. I'm sure I missed a few others. They also do $1 of cocktails and beers, and have $5 draft margaritas. HH ends at 6pm. Generally I think the food is pretty bland, but I have also come to love the cilantro jalapeno hummus, the 1000 bean entree, and the Caribbean salad. I also enjoy their falaffel. I'm not really sure what would make PJ a 5-star for me other than all around improvement on the flavor of the food. Maybe I am just picky.First time eating food from Pita Jungle.  I've heard so much about this place, I couldn't wait.  I was at a client meeting in Downtown Phoenix and since the meeting went over the lunch hour, they asked if we wanted to grab something to eat and someone mentioned Pita Jungle....awesome.I ordered the Falafel Pita.  It was pretty good.  The Falafel was cooked just right with a hard outer shell and moist and tasty center.  The Pita and Veggies were good too.Overall, it was a very satisfying meal and we were able to power through our meeting.  I want to come back and try different menu items.Return Factor - 80%

You will need to call two hours in advance for beef ribs. Visa and Mastercard are accepted.I highly recommend this place!I have been on a quest to find 5 star worthy BBQ in the Burgh, and by golly, this is it!  My friend mentioned to me a couple of weeks ago that she'd been wanting to try Showcase, since she works nearby and a coworker often gets lunch there.  As thanks for helping me drop off a window air conditioner that'd stopped functioning and pick up a new one yesterday, I decided to treat her (and myself!) to dinner from Showcase, which happened to be nearby.  I'm so glad that I seized the opportunity to try Showcase's BBQ, since we both found it positively mouthwatering!When we went to place our order, we asked to see both the turkey and pork ribs.  The woman working asked us if we'd ever had turkey ribs before, and we said we hadn't, so she gave us a sample to try.  It was so moist and smoky, I had to order it, so we got the 6 bone dinner with them, as well as two sides of collard greens and candied yams ($16.05).  The dinner came with a generous amount of homemade sauce, which my friend applied sparingly, and I applied liberally.  While the ribs can totally stand on their own in terms of flavor, the sauce had such a complex and interesting flavor that I wanted to take advantage of it.  Please note that this sauce isn't your typical Sweet Baby Ray's or Kraft BBQ sauce--Tony D.'s review describes the flavor well, and it has just a slight kick of heat.As for the sides, they were both great!  The greens were cooked perfectly--they were tender without being soggy or mushy--and were delicious, with just the right amount of salt.  The candied yams were sweet yet smoky in flavor, and were also tender but not overly mushy, with a somewhat chunky consistency.  Even my friend, who isn't a big fan of yams, enjoyed them!  We were originally planning to order baked beans in place of the yams, but they were out at the time of our visit.  Needless to say, given my love of mac and cheese, I would have ordered that, but my friend subsists on a GF diet, which unfortunately ruled that out.Overall, we were very impressed with the quality of the BBQ at Showcase.  The prices are right on par with other nearby neighborhood BBQ spots, and the service was friendly.  While it's true that the neighborhood isn't the best, let's face it, sometimes the best food can be found in the unlikeliest of places--esp. when it comes to BBQ!  If you live in PGH and you enjoy BBQ, but you haven't checked out Showcase, you're missing out bigtime--so stop procrastinating and stop by ASAP for some quality 'Q!

Review Text :
I noticed months ago that construction crews were working on the structure formerly known as Bahama Breeze. Note: I didn't shed a tear when Bahama Breeze shut down, like, a year ago. I'm not generally a fan of chain restaurants (other than Jenny's), and the Breeze to me was nothing more than a glorified Applebee's with a pseudo-tropical theme. Whatev. So what was this new establishment going to be? A Walgreens? CVS? Fresh&Easy? A strip club? (Dear lord, PLEASE let it be a strip club. I'm begging you. It's a good 40-minute drive back home to Ahwatukee from most of the other fine establishments, and I've found that the longer the commute, the harder it is to get that stripper smell out of my car.)Much to my chagrin, the joint reopened last week - not as a gentlemen's club - but as the second coming of Bahama Breeze: Sandbar. That was my impression as I pulled into the parking lot ... that I had waited all this time and the place reopened as a smaller version of itself.But in fact, Sandbar is different. Than Applebee's, I mean. Turns out it's like a cross between Salty Senorita and Dos Gringos. (Sandbar also has locations in Peoria and Scottsdale, neither of which I've been to nor did I know exist.)The digs are pretty cool, actually. Mexican beach theme with several overhead doors that bring the outside in. In fact, the outside bar area is surrounded by sand. Actual sand. Hence the name. Sandbar. Even though I got sand in my Pumas, I decided it was a pretty cool touch. Ladies ... you might not want to wear high heels, however. Continuing with the theme, they have cabanas and a little beach/wading pool thing that I guarantee drunk people will end up in on many nights, even though it's supposed to be just for looks.I had the Famous Sandbar Chimichanga, (made famous, apparently, by the other two locations, as this one has only been open for eight days), and it was really good. I was pleasantly surprised. It seems to me that often times, restaurants that put so much effort into their theme have food that's just "eh." The chimi is all I had, so I've nothing else to report culinarily; just know that it was tasty.Thirty-some-odd flatscreens scattered about the place. Looks like it could be a good place to watch the game on Sundays.The service was just okay. I'll give Sandbar a mulligan on that, seeing as how it's their first week in operation and I imagine they're just trying to get their feet under them. But it better rock next time. It's been said - and it's entirely true - that the place doesn't make the place, the people make the place. So ultimately, that will decide whether or not I frequent Sandbar. Too soon to get a feel for the vibe here. There was a whole range of folks patronizing the place on this evening, probably trying to figure out for themselves what kinda' scene it's gonna be. From seemingly normal cool people, to the "Did we get lost? I thought we were on Mill Ave" crowd, to the "Does my Affliction shirt fit tight enough?" crowd, to the "They say 60 is the new 25, right?" crowd ... they were all here on this evening.  Eww. But again, a mulligan because the place is new. We'll see ...Still have sand in my Pumas. Three stars for now.There is no justification in the service I received. I went to meet a couple of friends the Friday before last. They happen to run into a friend of theirs. That gentlemen ordered some shots, drinks and dinner. I heard him tell the bartender it was on his boss's tab. A while later they tried to get him to pay his tab. He said "I told you it was on my boss's tab" Long story short, his boss had left and they never put it on his tab. Some time goes by, the manager walks over to myself and the gentleman I was sitting with. He asked if we knew this other man. The gentleman I was with says he knew him a little, I stated I've never met him before. The manager asked if we can get him to pay his tab. (I personally find this to be extremely tacky and unprofessional) We did not come here with this man, it is not our responsibility). I've bartended in Scottsdale and Vegas. It is the server/bartenders responsibility to get the credit card when starting a tab. After all, they did make sure to get mine. The manager stated it was just 1 drink ('what's the big deal'?) I clarified with him that it was just one drink? Again he stated yes. I didn't want to deal with trying to get some man I don't know to pay his tab and I didn't enjoy my evening being interrupted by this nonsense, so I said "If it's just one drink, put it on my tab" (which I shouldn't have to do). The manager shook my hand and said thank you.30 min later I closed out my tab. Keep in mind all I had was 2 drinks and bought my friend a drink. My tab was $62.00!!! The bartender ended up putting that mans entire tab on mine. I called her over and I told her I found that to be very sneaky and disrespectful. She stated I said I would pay for the whole thing. I stated that was incorrect, she continued to argue with me. Why are we arguing? This is not my friend nor my tab. There is NOTHING to argue about. She finally went to speak to the manager. After about 10 minutes, she comes back has me sign a voided sales receipt for the 62.00. She never apologizes and then runs my card for my drinks plus one of his. I understand I said I would pay for this mans drink, but being that he had an entire tab it seems desperate to have a complete stranger pay for 1 of his drinks just to minimize how much of his tab they'll have to eat. Every bar has a spill/comp tab. They shouldn't make anybody else responsible for this...On top of the unprofessionalism, arguing, lack of apology, and wait time to get this solved. As a person who runs a business myself, if my employees neglect to follow protocol (ie; neglect to obtain credit card in this case,)I eat the cost. I most certainly wouldn't have another paying customer cover it.To make matters worse, myself and a friend (who frequents this establishment) went in to talk to a manager about this incident. I gave the MOD my business card and have yet to hear back from anyone. It has been 10 days. I never yelp about a place without giving the manager an opportunity to fix it...so there you have it folks... They lack professionalism big time in this place.

Restaurant name  Herbs & Rye

Review Text :
In the location that once housed the famous Slanted Clam, Herbs & Rye touts a 20s speakeasy spirit that, while obviously faux, has been done so lovingly you can't help but respect it. Haven't tried the food, but sitting at the bar perusing the history lesson-cum-cocktail list, a tear almost came to my eye. If I were to open a bar, certainly this is the way I'd do it (oh wait, I did open a bar once, and we almost did it right--H&R do it better). From classic to creative, H&R mixes with finesse. I'm a fan, and how. Oh, and the drinks cost easily half what they'd be on the Strip.Misti Y had told me a lot of good things about Herbs and Rye before my trip to Vegas so I was pretty excited when she picked me up from the airport and we headed here immediately for happy hour.They have some pretty awesome classic cocktails here including Moscow mules served in the copper cups and French 75s. The bartenders have a lot of fun crafting these drinks and as a patron I had a lot of fun drinking them.Misti and I also shared a couple of snacks to offset the liquor including a big mixed green salad that had bacon croutons. Um, yum! The other food we had was a Mediterranean flatbread that came with a blended spinach spread instead of tomato sauce, feta cheese, black olives and artichoke hearts. I really like the unique flavors of food and drink at Herbs and Rye so I can see why Misti is such a fan. I'd definitely come back on my next visit to Vegas and try more of what they're offering here.Herbs and Rye offers an excellent happy hour twice a day: 5pm-8pm and 12am-3am.  Happy hour gets you 50% off certain food items, $5 wells and $3 drafts.  The other evening I enjoyed a 17 oz. bone-in ribeye and a side of jalapeno creamed corn...all for a delicious $13.00.  While it still makes for a good $26 entree (ordering this dish during non-happy hours gets you two sides instead of one), getting this for half price only sweetens the deal.  This is one of the better deals I've come across in a while.  Don't get dragged to a Station Casino looking for their late night steak and eggs;  this is the place to be!The bartenders are the other stars here at Herbs and Rye.  They have been able to make all drinks that my friends and I have ordered without giving us a blank stare and asking, "What is that?"  This is a refreshing thing to see as compared to other establishments.  My friends have been very impressed by the drinks crafted here; I think they make good drinks, but nothing on their menu has really made my palate scream for more.  I'm perfectly happy ordering an Old Fashioned here, though, which I can't say about 90% of the other bars out there!One nice thing that's happened recently is that all the video poker machines have been removed from the bar!  This makes for an even better place to grab a few drinks and a meal if your party is small enough to sit at the bar.  Nectaly has been a superb host, remembering customers and always asking customers how their experience has been.  Herbs and Rye is another repeat eat for me here in Las Vegas!WHO: If you love italian, you'll love this place for sures! The bartender & server were super sweethearts & also chatted it up with me!WHEN: The first time I hit this restaurant up, I missed Happy Hour by a minute! Literally! So, from my experience, you definitely need to check it out from 5-8pm, and 12-3am! Happy Hour consists of half off the entire menu! =D Also, if you are a yelper and you let them know, you are rewarded with a free cocktail with the order of an entree. Yayy for yelpp!!(I went there recently and there are cones directly in front of the restaurant due to construction! I automatically thought it was closed because there were no cars in the parking lot, but my friend and I took a chance. MISSION COMPLETE!)WHERE: Located on the corner of Sahara & Arville, look out for the red sign!WHAT: There were no cocktails for me this time, but I will look into it on my next visit! After a couple of hours of shopping, my friend and I decided we wanted to try this place out. (I really just wanted to see what the Truffle Mac&Cheese was all about, haha). My friend and I tried:-Italian Sausage Flatbread: I was seriously expecting something small, but the server came out with an 8-piece flatbread pizza! It was marvelous! The sausage gave it the taste it needed, and I LOVE FLATBREAD!-Truffle Mac&Cheese: Ahhh!! Thank heaven for mac&cheese!! I am a lover of macaroni & cheese and this has got to be one of the best I've ever had!! I am craving for some more just thinking about it! There is such a perfect amount of truffle in every single bite, and the perfect amount of cheese. It is just pure perfection!-Pork & Figs: One word that describes this dish... BOMB!! I've never tried figs (besides fig newtons, haha) but they were just dandy! I wish I would have taken a picture of the dish (as I usually do!) It was perfectly created, the pork on top of the gravy'd mashed potatoes, and the flavorful figs all around it. I highly recommend!! =DWHY: The food is a must & an A-plusplusplus, the service was incredible (newfound friends), and the atmosphere was just CHILL!*NOTE: REMEMBER TO GO DURING HAPPY HOUR!You don't know how much I love you,You don't know how much I care.This review is way old but since I'm sick and have nothing better to do than stare at my feet and feel like crap I thought I'd catch up on old reviews before they are erased from memory.Happy Hour is where its at son!1/2 off Steaks (and a gnocchi I just couldn't pass up)The vibe is straight up sexy, (I never use that word because I feel awkward saying it out loud) but its just dark, sultry and sleek and straight out of an old-school movie.  The specialty cocktails are divine, the bartenders take their time and they know wassup.  Quality drinks cost money, but oh what a way to burn.If I could give this a negative 5 stars I would.WORST DINING EXPERIENCE SO FAR IN LAS VEGAS! I went there last night with 2 friends and ordered a steak. I got the steak (which was IHOP quality) and it had 2 pieces of plastic cooked into it. They were not small pieces, they were the size of silver dollars! I showed the waiter and he said "that is from the plastic wrapping we cut the meat out of" (This WAS the same kind of steaks that Dennys and IHOP uses!) Well he asked me if I wanted a new steak and I jokingly said "yes, but no plastic please" and laughed. He then rudely replied "yeah, thats common sense, don't you think"! and walked away. My friends and I looked at each other and were shocked and asked if we had heard him correctly. I got up and went to ask the hostess if the manager was there and if I could speak to them about my waiter. The hostess informed me that my waiter WAS THE OWNER! The waiter/owner then came up behind the hostess and confronted me about me trying to make a complaint. I told him I didn't like how he talked to me at my table and that he then replied "Then get the (explative) out of my restaurant! I said get out, you and your friends too!" I stood there stunned and actually laughed in his face. That made him angry so he called over 2 "goons" from the dining room to try to muscle me out. One guy walks up and takes off his suit jacket like he is going to assault me. Not cool at all!  This being my first time in this restaurant will also be my last! The service was atrocious and the food was IHOP quality for strip prices. And then to add insult to injury, they still made us pay for our meal!Cocktail geeks rejoice - craft cocktails exist in Vegas. I'm not sure since when, but they're here in full effect at Herbs & Rye. The elixirs you'll find coming across this bar are seriously top notch and could stand their ground against any in my favorite coastal cities such as Portland, Seattle, SF and the like. I'm so glad  to have found this spot (thanks to all who recommended it and to Misti for taking me there) and it will definitely be on my itinerary for any return trip.This is the lest "Vegas" bar in Vegas,  and that's one of the big reasons I am drawn to it. No flashy BS, no gaming, no smoking, no crazy-extreme high prices on the drinks, and almost zero pretense. Nice guys making stellar drinks in a chill, subdued setting (at least when I was in there) that's free of all the glam and glitz that exists a few blocks away. Nothing against that stuff (my stop prior to this was for a delicious cocktail at the fancy Vesper Bar) but I sure do love me good cocktails minus the snoot. The cocktails on the list are all classics, organized by the decade that gave birth to them. The list is medium-length but very carefully curated, and I found no less than three of my favorite elixers jumping off the pages and into my glass. The two drinks I sampled were a Vieux Carre (a personal fave) and a Remember The Maine (also a fave). Both were impeccable - perfectly balanced with a nice depth of flavor. High quality ingredients and trained hands sure do make some fine drinks. The story behind the guy who owns the place is a cool one too. He started out at the bottom and made is way up to the top - self taught. I respect that. And his humility and charm is something often not seen amongst the highest level of mixologists. He's a true barman. The food menu is hearty and tasty. I only sampled the truffled mac side fior $7 (a hearty portion) and it fit the bill. For a respite from overpriced drinks and chaos of the strip, get thee to Herbs & Rye. You'll make up your $$ on cab fare after only a couple of drinks and you'll be so glad you did.I had wanted to sample the fare at Herbs & Rye for some time, based on the recommendations of Yelp Friends.  Finally, the moment came, and Diane and I passed through the darkened entrance.  We were there for the food--not the creative drinks--and looked forward to a sumptuous dinner.  First to be set before us by our friendly server Eddie A was delicious fresh-baked French bread and soft butter.  This was quickly followed by a lovely-looking Shrimp Cocktail featuring six medium-sized red-tailed and white-topped shrimps curled over the serving plate.  The cold crustaceans tasted very good after being dipped in the zesty traditional Cocktail Sauce that accompanied them.Next was a novel surprise: an Iceberg Wedge that, instead of being crafted in the shape of a wedge as expected, was about two-thirds of a head of Iceberg Lettuce that had been sliced straight through the top to resemble a high mesa somewhere in the Southwest.  Festooned on the flat leafy surface were slices of tomato, red onion, bacon, Bleu Cheese crumbles, croutons, and a rich and ample supply of Bleu Cheese Dressing.  This was an excellent, crunchy salad course. Produced after this were my 9 oz. Filet Mignon with Brandy Cream Sauce & Peppercorns, and Diane's 12 oz. Ribeye Steak.  My entree was largely medium-rare as ordered, but a few parts of it were slightly undercooked.  Diane's Ribeye, on the other hand, was overcooked--more medium-well than medium-rare as she prefers.  When asked if her steak was cooked as she had specified, she admitted that it was more done than desired, but said that it was okay and she would eat it.  "No," said our server.  "We'll prepare you another one, and take it off the bill.  We want you to come back."  My wife politely declined the gracious offer, and slowly picked at her steak and sides until not too long afterward when suddenly a steaming plate was placed before her, with a new, obviously medium-rare and glistening 12 oz. Ribeye mounted on it.  The kitchen had quietly prepared a new steak anyway.  She accepted the promising substitution, and her old steak was immediately removed.  This fresh and juicy steak she really enjoyed, accompanied by a luscious Macaroni & Cheese side with bacon added.  I sampled the Mac & Cheese, and the hot white cheesy sauce really was delectable, just as was the Brandy Cream Sauce that covered my Filet and provided a liquid base for it.We had other sides to indulge in as well.  Sauteed Button Mushrooms were hot and meaty, and I opted for the deluxe version of Sweet Potato Tots with Honey & Marshmallow Crust.  Large marshmallows were nicely melted over tater-tot-shaped knobs of sweet potato that had been sweetened further with honey.  While we were eating our meals, mob movies were playing without commercial breaks on a large flat-screen TV mounted behind the bar and facing our booth.  It was actually quite enjoyable to have that as a backdrop, and we became engaged in following the action.  The final delight of the night was the gigantic, warm, and freshly baked Chocolate Chip Cookie a la mode that was presented with long trails of Chocolate Sauce drizzled across the massive cookie and streaming down the two large scoops of Vanilla Ice Cream that rested on top and stood like silent sentinels.  It was a great dessert, and a sweet way to end our leisurely stay.P.S.  True to our server's word, when the bill arrived, besides a 50% price reduction off the cost of my Filet for dining during the extended Happy Hour, no Ribeye Steak appeared on the tab.  It was an unnecessary but generous and classy gesture.  So, I reciprocated by leaving a substantial tip.  And, I am sure that we will come back.I really feel this place warrants more like 3.5 stars. Dark, clubby, with a sort of hipster take on vintage Vegas...cool menu full of mixology "craft" cocktails...solid steaks and accouterments. A cool place to go for late-night food...and located in a SOLIDLY unpretentious part of town (bonus points!!!). I went during regular hours and had a filet with a side of mushrooms, and caesar salad. All were good, but a pit pricey for what they were. I'll have to go back and try the happy hour menu...I have a feeling my cheap ass will like that more!Overall, I endorse this spot.I've been going here for the past few years and yes, it's been consistently lovely. I've taken even a few visitors here for late night eats as it surely beats having graveyard specials at a janky diner. We get to sit in a cozy, dark booth and listen to a really thoughful soundtrack if you like stuff like downtempo.The main draw is every night from 5pm-8pm and 12am-close is HAPPY HOUR. No, it doesn't include the cocktails, but I believe well drinks and some beers are. The gem of it is the food. There is a limited half off food selection of various types of steaks, a few apps (currently spicy mussels and garlic butter clams), and a entree of linguine and clams. Get the steak! Its good quality for the price. I normally go with the 18oz ribeye (ends up like $20 at HH) or the Kansas City Bone In 12oz ( I believe $15 during HH) and it's been tender, cooked to the right temperature, and seasoned well that I don't put any steak sauce. It comes with one side and their sides are great here. I really like their truffle mac n cheese, sweet potato tots, or super garlicky spinach. No it isn't your dirt cheap steak special, but you get what you pay for and it's a great value considering the quality. We've brought even the BFs grandma and mom recently and both approved of the steak and would like us to bring them back.  We also get the spicy mussels often during HH. It's a rather large pot they give you for the $11 HH price and the marinara is garlicky, a bit spicy, and needs to be sopped up. Ask for more bread - theirs is delicious, hot out the oven. They serve some of my favorite consistent drinks. Drinks here don't rotate so much, but are all classic cocktails using a lot of small batch spirits so it speaks to my heart.  The BFs and my drink of choice is the Vieux Carr'e (Rye, Cognac, Benedictine, Sweet Vermouth, Peychauds Bitters, Angostura Bitters) since its just alcohol on top of more alcohol. I just find I like less sweet stuff over the years and just want something unfussy and you can taste the nuances of the alcohol. If I want something tart and refreshing for a change, I go for Blackthorn or Moscow Mules. I find both great for summer. I've also ordered mystery drinks here and have been pleased, whatever I was given. I think at this point they can peg my tastes pretty well. I shockingly haven't drank the entire menu yet (but close) and will report back once I do with a running list of what each drink is like.I think this place will always have a special little spot in my heart. It was actually the place I met all my Yelp friends, for the first time so it holds special memories. And throughout the years the steaks and the drinks have never disappointed.Herbs & Rye was one of those late dinners with Terri R that was on a whim.  Herbs & Rye looks like a pub on the outside, even has that feel when you walk in. All I know is that it was a very long day, I was starving, and anything that was food would have hit the spot.  In other words, I didn't expect much coming in. Maybe a good thing that I didn't expect much because I was actually surprised by the menu.  I expected nothing but fried dishes or meals with zero sustenance. What I found was a menu ranging from apps to steaks.  Prices are not pub prices though.  Price here is what you are to expect at a steakhouse.  A ton of really tempting items on this menu like Filet Mignon and Lobster, Burgers, and other steak options.  With all the recent talk about White Castle here in Vegas for the last couple of days (compliments of the Foodie Fest), I decided on their sliders.  The presentation of these sliders is probably the best I've seen in awhile.  It at least kicks White Castle's butt.  I thought that the sliders were pretty good, but just a little rich.  We also got their fully loaded calamari.  To me, I thought it was one big workout killing mess.  It had a ton of what appears to be mayo, bacon, and some other add ons.  Both Terri and I, scraped off this mess and ate some calamari the way it should be eaten.  As for the ambiance, you can say that you get two types.  When you walk in, you have the bar to the right where all the action is.  It's louder, brighter, and this is where everyone else is eating.  Then you got the quiet side where it's dimmer, quiet, and barely where anyone is dining.  Normally, I'm good with either side. But on this night, the dining was a little too tight on the bar side. So, we ate where it was quieter and darker.  Since it was also late, keeping ourselves from falling asleep was a challenge in itself.  My other concern is that we would be forgotten and our orders never taken.  This wasn't an issue at Herbs & Rye.  Regardless which side you choose to eat, service seems to be right on. Overall, Herbs & Rye is a decent place to meet with friends, grab a drink, and some dinner.  I'm not a huge fan of pubs in general, but I still have my favorites.  Herbs and Rye can easily be one of them.  PS:  I don't drink, but there's a some great Happy Hour specials here.  For all you HH dudes and gals, give this place a try.

I've only gone a couple times so far, but the perfect storm of quality food, excellent customer service and happy hour half priced steaks has won me over immensely. Each time I have come here I have been treated awesomely right from stepping in the door and being greeted by the friendly hostess. And the waitresses Donna and Debbie are fantastic as well. They are friendly and they go above and beyond to take care of you. I have opted for the 18 oz. Rib-Eye both times and have been very pleased with it. Rib-Eye is my go to steak in most any circumstance. I did try a bite of the New York Strip and that was pretty fantastic too. The sides are incredible. My favorite is the truffle mac and cheese, but I have also been a fan of the garlic mashed potatoes and the truffle parmesan french fries. The steaks come with one side order and during happy hour, they are an absolute deal. They also have $5 well drinks and I think a $3 amber ale, if I remember correct. If you want Jack, they charge you $8. That's my one knock against this place, but I'll live. The bread also isn't bad and definitely hits the spot while you wait. Nothing really to write home about, but better than nothing while you wait. The ambiance of the place is pretty classy. It's dim and the walls are lined with a nice velvet looking wall paper that looks pretty elegant. It's the kind of place you would probably want to dress up a little for. Overall, Herbs is most likely going to be a regular spot of mine when I need my steak fix. If you haven't checked it out, do yourself a favor and head over there. Best time would be during one of their happy hours. The first one is from 5 to 8 and I think the second one starts at 11. Oh and they're currently in the process of changing out their beer and wine menu along with adding a few food items including a Porterhouse. More reasons to check back.I attended Herbs & Rye's grand opening four years ago and it was an interesting experience. The night started and almost ended as one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had (primarily the service). Fortunately, they took care of us and we ended up relocating to the bar and having the complete opposite experience. The food was delicious and the cocktails were wonderful. I didn't intentionally not return, but I never ended up going back until a couple months ago.Teresa S., my fiance, and I were in the area and very hungry, so we headed over with a reservation via Open Table. We were very excited that we were in time for their Happy Hour (5pm-8pm), which meant 50% off select steaks and other items! What sounds better than a 9 oz. filet mignon? A $17 9 oz. filet mignon! I also ordered sides of Asparagus, Garlic Mash, and Roasted Brussel Sprouts (I can't remember what it was called, but it also had panchetta). My fiance ordered the Italian Sausage flatbread.The sides were all very delicious. The highlight was definitely the brussel sprouts. Ridiculously good flavor! The asparagus were slightly overcooked, but still good. The mashed potatoes were so flavorful and creamy. My steak made me sad. It was dry and NOT medium rare. As you can see in the photo, there wasn't even a touch of red in the center. Le sigh. I lose all respect for a restaurant that can't properly prepare a medium rare steak (or burger). It's the worst offense and totally ruins my whole meal. Which made me more sad since I enjoyed everything else so much.Service was spotty as well. Everyone seemed more fixated on the big group in the center of the dining room. I guess they were more important. Anyway, although most of the food was really great, it's not enough to bring me back.So I've been hearing about this place for a while for fellow Yelpers and been wanting to try. When I finally got the chance, we ended up having plans to go twice in the same week! If my rating was based solely on service they would've got a 1.5, based on drinks 4.5, based on food 3.My first time there we were with a very large group ( 30+ people) on a Tuesday night at 8pm. It's not like they didn't know we were coming, but they seemed overwhelmed. They couldn't keep up with our drink orders, it took way too long to get the orders in let alone get the drink (even if it was just bourbon on the rocks). It took a long time to get our food as well, some people in our group were done and leaving when we didn't even get our food yet. They ran out of sides. Brought out sides way before our entree so the side was cold. Steaks were overdone. My lobster tail was over cooked. The food was just  "meh". We were all happy with the drink selection and drinks...when we got them.I was turned off with that first try, but I gave them a pass since it was such a large group. And went back with some friends on Friday night around 7:30. Again, service was horrible. It took forever to get our drink orders, and it was nearly impossible to get the waiters attention if you wanted anything else. Once we ordered food, the food also took forever. I got the Calamari this time and the first time and it was good both times. I also got a Prosciutto and Asparagus Flatbread, it was good, nothing exciting, but good. My husbands steak was much better this time and his side, Broccoli and Cheese was yummy. A friend at our table never got his food when we were all done eating, so he cancelled his order. My drinks were perfect (order 2 drinks at a time because they take so long to get!) Brown Derby and Blinker, both good in their own way. It was our friends birthday so we all split some Donuts....they were awesome.I like the decor and old fashioned vibe. I've been to this locale before it was Herbs And Rye...boy has it changed! The service alone would keep me from going back, not sure if I will go back. Only time will tell. Good thing they have some loyal Yelpers as patrons because they turned off a room full of people.I finally got to try their steaks at happy hour!  I was going to get my favorite filet mignon but our server informed us that they have a filet wrapped in bacon. So, I got that and truffle fries. I also tried the truffle mac & cheese and the Herbs & Rye House Brew (HH price: $3). The sides aren't included in happy hour. We got beignets to end a great meal.Bacon-wrapped Filet Mignon:It had two thick slices of bacon on top and not wrapped around the filet. For a piece of steak that would normally be at least $50, getting this at half the price definitely changes everything. It was perfectly medium-rare, tender and juicy. 4.5/5Truffle Fries:Thin-cut fries with truffles and parmesan cheese. You can taste and see truffles, yay! The fries were crispy. I enjoy truffle fries but what makes this even better is that it's less than $10! 5/5Truffle Mac & Cheese:After eating great truffle fries, I was disappointed with this mac & cheese. I couldn't taste truffles. It was like regular, plain mac & cheese. 2/5Beignets:These aren't similar to the famous beignets from New Orleans. These are like mini doughnuts covered in granulated sugar. Normally comes with 2 dipping sauces: white chocolate and caramel but since I don't like white chocolate, our server threw in chocolate sauce. 4/5The Kool Kids ordered Jack & Coke but it wasn't like Jack & Coke - our server later on said it's not really Jack & Coke, it was something else. That and my not-so-bacon-wrapped bacon-wrapped filet made me think we were getting punked by our server.This is probably one of my greatest finds on Yelp. Half off steak during happy hour??! How can it not be?Here's the run down :+ Happy hour from 5-8PM and then midnight to close (3AM). + During happy hour, you get half off steaks and a few other options. Each steak order (unless otherwise noted) comes with one side. I usually go for the mushrooms and creamed corn.+ If you split/share.. there's an additional charge. Note : Don't bring people who aren't eating their own meal. + free bread is good+ Don't be scared by the grungy exterior look. This place is worth it.They really do close right at 3AM, so better to come earlier rather than later!Ok so here is your deal of the day in FABULOUS LAS VEGAS, come here, for an early happy hour or after midnight. The steaks are all on the 50% fire sale... seriously BLUE LIGHT SPECIAL AT Herbs & Rye! and its super tasty to boot! So drag your bootay over here off the strip for a split second or ten and descend into decadent gluttony for a bit.I arrived with a group of folks around 12:30 or so and most of us had had a few drinks already and had been gambling for a few hours. We hadn't had dinner yet as we were planning on coming here and had heard about it from one of my buddies who is a local. It was described as a great steak joint with cheap high end fare. It did not disappoint on that perspective whatsoever.Pro Tip: Parking early can be tough, so be forwarned, perhaps taxi it over =DI got the 18oz boneless ribeye for $29 Dee LISH  Ushhhhhh. Normally it is $58! Well I want another one right now... and the bacon haphazardly tossed on top was awesome as well. I had the bacon topper which was two thick cuts of my favorite veggie crossed on top of the steak. WOW, just WOW.Pro Tip #2: Do NOT ask for steak sauce unless you are an uncouth Neanderthal with no understanding of good steak. Some jackwagon in my group asked for it and a few of us had our eyes just about pop out of our heads!You get a side with it and I kinda messed up trying something experimental but *shrugs* the steak and bacon were AWESOME.  But for my side I got the asparagus with the broccoli cheese sauce and it didn't turnout as well as I had hoped it would. Pro Tip #3: Drink up before you get here. Their drinks are a bit pricy and kitchee IMHO. Unless you want to drink specialty drinks at $8-$15/ea...The bread was fresh and super toasty tasty and just what you would need or expect for a meal like this. Ahhh the memories of this meal are still so fresh in my head I can taste that steak and the bacon strips! Since I have been here, I have had several friends hit this place up and no one has a bad thing to say about the steaks. I definitely plan on hitting this joint up again on another vegas run and I think you should too!Upon arriving here we were taken back by the rough exterior. But as I read with previous Yelpers reviews, I knew what to expect. But once you walk inside... Wow the decor and ambiance was pretty cool. I loved the feel of the place. Walking in was like a completely different place than the outside.Me & the beau seated at the bar to wait for our friends. I ordered a Moscow Mule & he got a Pisco Sour. My Moscow Mule was so good, I just didn't like how it was filled with ice so I basically paid for a cup full of ice, I woulda liked more drink for my buck. Pisco sour had egg white in it so it basically just tasted like foam, honestly. I then ordered a Pimms Cup. Oh how I loved that drink! & had cucumber chunks in it! So delicious! My recommendation for a drink if you go here. Our friends started to come so we got a table. We were waiting for the clock to strike 12am so we can take advantage of their infamous happy hour! I ordered a Kansas Bone In w/ that extra spicy rub with Truffle Mac n Cheese as my side! OMG to die for! That rub on the steak had little flavor fairies dancing in my mouth! My friend ordered the Penne Pasta. That was also extremely good, not part of their happy hour though. The beau ordered chicken wings and everyone thought they were so good, but I think they tasted like chicken wings! Lol. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ What really stood out to me was our waiter, Christian. He was extremely delightful, making suggestions for which cocktails we would like. One of my friends got what he has suggested & didn't like it and Christian brought him another drink for free! Also towards the end he brought us out some bomb sugar donuts with 2 mouth watering dipping sauces, also on the house! How sweet of him. Overall I loved this place.. I'll probably be returning very soon!I give it to our waiter, Christian and the steaks!The outside is a bit "ghetto".. But soon as you come in, it's almost like a renaissance, back in the old days, touch of vampire feel.Similar to the Artisan Hotel on Sahara.We sat at the bar first while waiting for the infamous happy hour at midnight! I only did like one cocktail that night and it happened to be my friend's, the Pimms Cup - which had ginger ale, cucumber and lime. I usually don't like cucumber drinks, but this is the drink to try there! The other cocktails I had just had a weird after taste to me and so just wasn't a fan.Midnight hits, we're seated at the table and so we ordered our steaks and other desired items. I ordered the 18oz Ribeye Steak with side of the Garlicky Spinach. Grilled to perfection, tender, juicy and oh SOO delicious! You can def taste the quality in the steak! My side on the other hand was, as you expected, garlicky. I had asked for it to be a little less garlicky, but nonetheless still a good side.The group ordered Penne, Chicken Wings, New York Steak, Kansas Bone In, sides and more drinks!Christian definitely accommodated our every need and was very knowledgeable of the items/ drinks on the menu! He even topped off our night with a complimentary dessert, which I couldn't, unfortunately have.Nothing beats great service and food!After two consecutive incidents with the same server, Debra, I'm forced to write this review. First happened February 14th, 2014. My girlfriend and I came in for dinner. She took our order wrong, food came out wrong, runner went back into kitchen, couple minutes later food came out right so no big deal. Debra however pretended it didn't happen and didn't even apologize. Again, no big deal. Left her a 18% tip and totaled it to 90$ on my card. On my credit card statement I was charged 100$. I Talked to the manager, Alennry, on the phone and said he was busy at the moment so he gave me his email to explain the situation. Emailed him twice over the course of two weeks and no reply. I ended up letting it go, convincing myself it could have been an honest mistake. April 12th, 2014 rolls around and I decide their happy hour sounds good, which it is. Don't get me wrong it's a great happy hour. Again were sat in Debra's section. Funny right? This time I total my card to 33$ and I was charged 38$, same thing with my girlfriends card. Now I'm at the point where I'm very upset because it's clear Debra is forging credit card tips. Being a server in the Vegas industry myself I know this is the biggest no no. Now I go in and talk to Nectaly himself about the situation. He seemed very sorry and genuine about the situation and said he would get the money refunded. At the end of the day, the extra 5$ charged on not only one but both our cards is not a big deal, it's the principle that counts. Nectaly emails me saying he's getting statements from his merchant. Takes about a week but he finally gets them. Then he doesn't email back for a couple days and then I finally get an email saying he's in New York and will refund them as soon as he's back. I say that's awesome and couple days go by and no email or refund. I email again and now there's absolutely no response for a week.And now I'm writing this review. It's upsetting because like I said, their happy hour and food quality is awesome. But this is not the way you do business. The first time could have been an honest mistake but twice from the same server is no coincidence. You don't steal from customers, that's not the way you do business. Please take warning. The managers and owners seem to be more than okay with doing shady business.One of my girlfriends who moved to Vegas about a year ago wanted to take me out on a dinner date. Rather than perusing through Yelp, I opted for her to call the shots on where to take me. Now that's a rare occasion since more often than not, I do the cuisine-suggesting. The change was definitely nice and made for a few pleasant surprises.She picked me up from MGM and took the backroads, clearly well off the strip to a local hang out called Herbs & Rye. Upon entering, you definitely are taken aback by how dark it is in there. Seriously, your eyes don't quite fully adjust until you are seated. We got there in the early evening and it was starting to get packed. Fortunately, my girl made reservations and we were situated in one of their awesome booths facing the bar. You don't have pages and pages of menu to peruse through. Their offerings are simple and to the point, no frills here. Don't get me wrong, just because the menu isn't laced with words you can't pronounce or ingredients you've never seen, doesn't mean quality has been sacrificed. On the contrary, the seem to use products of utmost quality with particular attention to the entree's final outcome.We had  a wonderful server, I'd like to say his name was Richard though I'm no longer sure. He was warm without being overbearing, made us laugh a little and suggested deliciously buttery chardonnay for me. BTW happy hour is awesome here, but many of their dishes, yes even the steaks at 50% off!We ordered:Carpaccio - i have never had carpaccio before and this was just amazing. I would order this again in a heartbeatNew York Strip - We added bacon and oh my was that a thick cut piece of pork! They prepared it medium rare and seasoned just rightTruffle Mac n Cheese - Although not too truffle-y, this mac n cheese was still a hitSweet Potato Tots - We got this with the marshmallow crust. heaven in your mouth. geez.Mind you they have a very impressive selection of cocktails as well.We skipped dessert this particular time since we were going somewhere else for our sweet treats. Regardless, our meal was fantastic and kudos to the folks at Herbs & Rye for the stellar experience.I've heard a lot about their cocktails and have been meaning to make a visit for the longest time but for some reason only remembered on Sundays which is when they're closed. I finally was able to visit last night around midnight ! It looks like just a bar on the outside, so driving by if you've never heard about this place, you wouldn't think it was anything special. But people, enough about it's "in the ghetto". North-town, Twain/Maryland Parkway, Boulder Highway, MLK/Charleston, THAT'S ghetto. Sahara/Valley View? Not the best but come on, not ghetto. Let's not get crazy.Soo anyways, the inside, kind of vampirey and a little dark, it takes your eyes some time to adjust but they have mini flashlights you can request. Oh and bring your glasses, goodness I felt like an old lady trying to read the super small lettering on the menu lol. There was lots of seating and at the time we came, not busy even though happy hour was going on (12-3). Happy hour was half off some steaks included with a side. Sounds like a great deal but my boyfriend and I didn't want something too heavy so we'll try it next time especially since everyone around us was taking advantage of that great deal and it looked delicious!Onto the drinks! Oh my goodness, soo good, AMAZING. After my first drink, Weekend at the Walfdorf, which is a fruity rum based drink, I made part of my life's goal to try all the drinks on their menu Lol. Next I had the infamous Moscow Mule that I've heard soo much about. The best I've had. Perfect amount of fizzyness and Ginger. Yummy!! I'll take a liter for home please Lol. My boyfriend had the Ramos Gin Fizz and it was another amazing drink especially if you love Gin. It had a lemon tang to it and frothed egg whites. If you're from San Fran, my boyfriend said the quality of drinks were very similar to Burritt Room & Tavern in Union Square.Next, the food. Carpaccio was flavorful and I always like when restaurants serve an argula salad on top, so really good. I wish there was a little more capers though. Very comparable to carpaccios I've had on the strip. The Pork & Figs we shared was large and really delicious as well. I loved the sauce and figs, and the mashed potatoes. The pork was not as tender as I liked it to be but the Gorgonzola on top made up for that. I could definitely see myself craving this dish. Now let's talk about their amazing donuts. Wow. First of all, I think there's like a dozen mini donuts & holes sugar coated and was served super soft and warm. Definitely enough for four people! But since they're soo addicting, two people could easily demolish these even with a full belly. It came with two sauces, I forgot the names but it seemed like a white chocolate and caramel. Lick your fingers good Lol. I just really wish that this place had a higher quality feel to match the great quality and pricing of the food and drinks they serve! You can still look prohibitiony and sleek at the same time! Lol The service was good and friendly, drinks took a little long but they are hand crafted cocktails! The poor bartenders even had to froth up egg whites for one of our drinks! Lmao I will definitely be back for their happy hour steak special and their drinks!! :)Items Selected:Clover Club - Gin, Lemon, Raspberry Syrup, Egg WhiteThe Farmer Flatbread - Double Thick Bacon, Spinach, Cracked Egg, Crème FraicheTruffled Mac n' CheesePork and Figs - Gorgonzola, Garlic Mash, Fig GlazeSweet Potato Tots with Marshmallow and Honey CrustOld Granddad Bread Pudding with Vanilla Ice Cream Heavily praised for an extensive era-specific list of craft cocktails with a menu full of sustainable organic meats and plates far more interesting than the average bar or lounge Herbs & Rye had long been a place of interest and with recent reports suggesting the kitchen to be firing on all cylinders I finally decided to stop by, a Saturday feast for one in the dimly-lit dining area my reward for eschewing alternative plans on Las Vegas Boulevard South.  Designed in a style somewhere between "Old time Vegas" and stripped-down speakeasy with a less-than-ideal location on West Sahara it was with eyes still adjusting from the 6pm sun that I entered the small tavern and greeted at a small podium by the woman later to be my waitress I was quickly led to my choice of tables, a menu soon in hand presenting tough decisions with a resultant four item order divided into two courses accompanied by one of nearly a dozen gin based cocktails I'd have liked to try were my liver's capacity on par with that of my gut.  Obviously a space prone to becoming lively as the night wears on but only perhaps half-full during the course of my meal it was after perhaps a ten minute wait that my cocktail arrived and featuring a lovely balance of fruit juxtaposing juniper notes beneath a cloudy of foam the Clover Club was a hit, the flavor profile particularly refreshing when matched to a rich opening duo of tender macaroni unfortunately overwhelmed with truffle oil and a crisp, lightly charred flatbread that fared far better with briny bacon finding its foil in the tang of crème fraiche.   At this point debating an Aviation versus the Bee's Knees it was a bit to my surprise that my second round arrived immediately on the heels of my first and forgetting the second cocktail as it was likely to arrive far too late to be enjoyed with the food I instead dug straight in, the 12oz bone-in piece of pork seared perfectly and coated with bleu over hand-smashed potatoes amidst a jus of pork and poached figs, the later laying split alongside the protein and still intensely sweet...though certainly not as much so as a bowl of tender tots bathed in a pool of honey beneath snowcaps of toasted marshmallow that ranks amongst the best "sides" I've had this year.  At this point sated but happy to go another round it was to an oral explanation of the restaurant's desserts that I was finally treated and although large sharing portions of sugared doughnuts and a skillet cookie were hard to resist it was instead in the day's special that I partook, the piping hot chunk of booze-soaked baguette crowned by a ball of vanilla ice cream proving very 'special' indeed with butter and cinnamon bubbling at its base as if the kitchen had known I was coming and prepared it just for me.Stumbled upon this place while I was driving around for a place to eat dinner. I noticed the parking lot was full so decided to pull in and find a parking spot which took a while BC the lot was full. I made it in just before HH ended so I took advantage of the discounted beverages. I sat in the dinning room which dark but I noticed this place is definitely a locals joint. I Started off with a wedge salad that didn't disappoint followed by the 12 oz bone in Kansas City steak and side of truffle mac & cheese. The steak was tender, juicy and the mac & cheese was solid. Overall a good dinner with cordial service from my waitress at a reasonable price.Was here last night with a large group for a birthday party. It was my second time here and at first I was excited to be back based on my experience the first time around. I was shocked to find customer service and quality control so horrendous this second time around! Long story short, this place has totally gone downhill and I likely won't be back. I wouldn't recommend anyone waste their time coming here either unless you want your food to come out an hour late and then take a half hour at the end to pay your group's tab!Rachel and I got here about 40 min before our party's reservation so we decided to sit at the bar for some drinks and salad as an appetizer. After being greeted by the bartender we didn't see him again for another 15 min and sat around waiting for our order to be taken. What bartender doesn't ask for a drink order right away?After everyone placed their orders we proceeded to wait about 45-50 min before any of food even came out. I was wondering if it was even going to come out at all! When our food arrived they brought everyone's except Roger's with no explanation of any kind...it was almost like the forgot that he had ordered anything. When this was brought to the server's attention she checked on it and came back to inform us that they had just "fired it up" and that it would "be out shortly" with no further explanation of what happened to the original order, nor an apology. About 10-15 min passes before the server returns to inform us that Roger's steak would be out soon and that they had overcooked the original one. Funny how they would wait to tell us this instead of being up front about it...I call bs!When Roger's steak finally came it was overcooked and not cooked medium rare like ordered. How hard is it for a steak restaurant to not overcook 2 steaks in a row?! After this debacle they still wanted to charge us for his steak at first and then decided not to in the end...I'm sure they heard that we were all Yelpers lol! But seriously this place is ridiculous. No updates on your food and no service whatsoever. It's almost like they don't care if their customers are happy or not, and we definitely were not.At the end of the night we attempted to settle our table's tab. We had asked the server at the beginning of the meal to split our tabs, however, at the end of the meal she told us that this wasn't possible. WTF! Why didn't you just tell us that in the first place? The manager came out to explain that it was against store policy to split checks of groups with 6 or more people...Ok, so it's possible...you're just not going to do it? Who says that? Especially after the crap service we just endured? It was a debacle trying to figure out the tab due to this and they had to run about a dozen cards separately. I almost wanted our group just to leave because the servers didn't know what was going on, except that they couldn't split the tab. If it wasn't for the manager coming out to handle the situation I'm pretty sure it would've taken longer than 30 min to figure this out and I would've just left. I don't have the patience or time to deal with crap like this. Get your shit together or don't run business! We were also pissed to see a 20% auto gratuity which is bs because they deserve nothingSave your time and your money and avoid this place. There are so many other steak places here in Vegas and there's really nothing special about this one. Steaks after overpriced just so they can do a "happy hour" 50% deal and even then the appetizers are $15, sides are $7 and sauces are $3.50 for such a crap place that's not even fancy at all.Who doesn't love happy hour?Its no secret, Herbs & Rye is a popular spot for steak lovers. Offering nice cuts of quality meat at half the price. Their happy hour menu is not limited to steaks but also sides and by the glass wines. Being a popular spot, if you go with a big group expect a wait. Midnight hits and this place is packed. Who would of thought so many carnivores craved meats this late. I ordered my favorite cut, Ribeye medium rare closer to rare. I like it juicer than most. It was cooked a little more medium but still very tasty. I also ordered two sides: asparagus and their truffle mashed potatoes. The asparagus were perfect, steamed with still a bite to it. The truffle oil mash was a little too buttery for my taste. It was very wet and mushy. Overall, this place is great for late night eats. For a fine dining establishment. I really hope their food is better during normal hours.Holy moly! I've been here a few times, but tonight was my first time for dinner. Let's start with pre-dinner drinks. This place really knows how to craft a cocktail. So far I haven't had a bad cocktail yet, but I'm mostly a vodka or wine girl. The happy hour red is not too shabby. I wish there were more choices, but considering the awesome HH food choices, I think we can agree to let that one go. Our friends told us about the happy hour until 8pm and we were shocked that it includes half off steaks! What a great deal. We started with the mussels appetizer. I loved the sauce. Mussels tasted great, but that red sauce had a real nice kick to it. Quite a few of the mussels would not open, but the waiter had no issue bringing us another batch. For dinner, I ordered the Bone - in Kansas city. It was very flavorful and tender. I'm seriously laying in bed still thinking about it. We also ordered the garlic smashed, garlic spinach, and sweet potato tots. Best way I've ever had sweet potato.  The spinach and smashed came out with a piece of garlic clove on top. Nice touch. I liked all of our sides, but the favorite at the table was the truffle Mac n cheese. Ronnie was an excellent server. Very knowledgeable, friendly and attentive. If you have any questions on the menu, ask him! I'm not one for adding anything to an already amazing steak, but my friend really loved the chimichurri add on. My other friend cautioned that the ribeye was quite fatty, but the bf ordered it and was very happy. It was huge! They also ordered the homemade doughnuts and ice cream cookie. I can't comment on taste, because I was good and abstained, but it smelled delicious. Either would have easily been enough for the whole table! I will def be back, I just don't know if I'll be able to try any of the other steak choices, as I'm still dreaming of the Kansas. Yum!Cool spot with some killer cocktails!I love it when bartenders take their craft seriously and drinking becomes an experience. This place doesn't fail and when we walked in around 8pm on a Friday night the bar was packed and the restaurant had a 30 min wait; deservingly so.The bartenders are great and it has a very cool vibe with friendly locals who are happy it's finally Friday! Two couples moved around to fit my man and I immediately as we walked in and that was a really nice gesture. We had several cocktails and definitely began feeling tipsy on drink two. Pretty pathetic but these suckers were strong! After a short time we were called for our table and we were starving! Everything tastes better when you're tipsy! Well almost everything! So let's get to the food. Started with a margarita flat bread which was good (still on my search for amazing margarita pizza) and then the filet sliders. These were by far the highlight of the experience. The meat was so tender with caramelized onions, horse radish sauce on a very soft potato bun (AMAZING)! Then we wanted something decadent and decided on the penne. It was so salty we couldn't take more then a few bites. It tasted like eating spoons full of salt. As tipsy as I was I couldn't do it. We told our waitress and she was kind enough to ask if we wanted it remade but we decided to skip as we wanted to save ourselves for something sweet. That dish was straight up nasty. We ordered the hot donuts and they made up for the pasta! Overall good food but that penne really screwed us up. The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars was over that.The service was great. Strong cocktails to get a nice buzz going and maybe we just got unlucky with the pasta. Everything else was good.The decor is cool with a very back in the day feel when the cool kids were bootlegging in dark places. I would definitely try this place again.1920s style speakeasy atmosphere? Check.Massive menu of obscure and classic drinks? Check.2 daily HHs with half-price steaks? Check again.Server was great about suggesting and recommending drinks to help us, as the menu is a bit overwhelming- the Blackthorne, Pegu, and Diablo were all tasty and strong without being too sweet. I do wish they offered better wines, and found it odd they don't have any beers on tap.The littleneck clams app has a delicious lemon-herb sauce, but the half-price flat iron was the star: cooked to perfection, juicy, and well-seasoned. I'll have to come back hungrier to try a better cut. Sides of sprouts and truffle mac were both enjoyable, if a touch salty. Wish the HH menu featured more apps, like the flatbreads.In addition to dinner and drinks, they make killer desserts. Our party couldn't decide, so we got both their seasonal apple bread pudding and their fresh-baked cookies. Both were massive and really hit the spot for the sweet tooth folks. I'll be back for more drinks and eventually the rib eye. Maybe next time I'll actually sit in the bar area, but the volume of the music was blasting even sitting in the quieter dining room area. Great retro-Vegas, blast from the past experience.I feel like I came in on an off night. This was my night cap selection after an evening out with the lady. I love a good cocktail to end the night and relax, but this place was packed, loud and not an available seat in the house. I figured it be might more chill on Thursday night at 12:30am, but nope. We finally were able to sit down and were greeted by a server who had excellent knowledge of the drink menu. I chose from the "Years of Reform" menu, specifically the "Lion's Tail". This is a Rye Whiskey based drink with bitters, lime, bar syrup, and Allspice Dram. It was a very good cocktail with great flavors and nothing too overpowering. I could have had another, but the first drink took so long I didn't want to wait for another.We also ordered some fried calamari to snack-on while we hung out. This was a pretty basic plate of fried calamari, but you get almost an entire ocean's worth of fried salty morsels. This is a great option for sharing with friends, but the no mind blowing flavors here. I do love the prohibition look of this place and the dimly lit secret agent vibe, but I was wanting more. The bartender's seemed to be behind with a large party taking up most of the restaurant's service. I believe in second chances. Herbs and Rye I'll see you again soon!

High end Mexican Restaurant?  Is there such a thing?  Sure there is!  La Hacienda is a perfect example of that.  Located inside the Fairmont Princess Resort, this gem offers a high end Mexican dining experience.  We've been here for happy hour and they have great Margaritas and we've come for dinner.  The dinner is spectacular.  Here's what we ordered:Guacamole, $14 (prepared tableside)http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-hacienda-by-richard-sandoval-scottsdale?select=2JkVDRonRyvi3jZx4_qUuw#2JkVDRonRyvi3jZx4_qUuwhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-hacienda-by-richard-sandoval-scottsdale?select=SROog3ZPUjd0R0GZ2r8HPg#SROog3ZPUjd0R0GZ2r8HPgQueso Fundido, $14http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-hacienda-by-richard-sandoval-scottsdale?select=fQNZkQPkLvIckEZDr9vdVg#fQNZkQPkLvIckEZDr9vdVgTampiquena, $30http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-hacienda-by-richard-sandoval-scottsdale?select=X-viGoMAkqDhmK28EWS9qg#X-viGoMAkqDhmK28EWS9qgChicken Mole Poblano, $24http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-hacienda-by-richard-sandoval-scottsdale?select=BURdzfDTQHaCEKxlrd2OXw#BURdzfDTQHaCEKxlrd2OXwBarbacoa de Res Taquitos, $14http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-hacienda-by-richard-sandoval-scottsdale?select=VjETCzzdeXy2X2xDAuDAUA#VjETCzzdeXy2X2xDAuDAUACapirotada, $9http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-hacienda-by-richard-sandoval-scottsdale?select=aGiE3CUwG1_n1NyO_d1BVg#aGiE3CUwG1_n1NyO_d1BVgTrio de Helados Fritos, $9http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-hacienda-by-richard-sandoval-scottsdale?select=4fhS2VZDUj07JKdJ_e6IsA#4fhS2VZDUj07JKdJ_e6IsAhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-hacienda-by-richard-sandoval-scottsdale?select=t5RYGd6HJBlje0-2aAKOwA#t5RYGd6HJBlje0-2aAKOwAFor appetizers, the tableside Guacamole is phenomenal....smooth and creamy.  They don't add too many Onions & Tomatoes, which is a mortal sin for Guac and most restaurants do that.  The Queso Fundido is excellent and comes with fresh, homemade Tortillas....definitely not store bought.For the entree, I had the Tampiquena, which is a Steak cut thin and served with an Enchilada, Corn Mash, and Guacamole.....another excellent dish!  The Enchilada is covered in Mole Sauce, which offers a smooth, chocolatey taste to compliment the Steak.  Amazing.Kiddo and The Wife had the Chicken Mole Poblano and the Barbacoa Taquitos.  They loved their dishes and finished their plate.Dessert was the Capirotada and the Trio de Helados Fritos.  All I can say is yum!  I could only muster a bite of each because I was stuffed.  The family finished the rest.Service was spectacular throughout dinner.  I highly recommend this place to anyone visiting Scottsdale.Return Factor - 95%

Review Text :
5/27/10After reading a couple of reviews on Hillside Spot, I decided to check it out myself.  Besides noticing that the line was still long, despite it being around 1030-1045 on a Thursday morning, I also noticed that this place gets NOISY!  I didn't care if it was full-on sun outdoors and already hot, I could not, and would not, bear the noise indoors :(, and apparently a few customers had the same idea, bec. the only available tables out there were lacking umbrellas.  [I'd give 4 or more stars if it wasn't so loud!!]  Don't fret, though, as I found one of the staff was willing to set up a table w/ an umbrella- all you have to do is ask!I already checked the menu online for ideas, so I already knew what I might want to try.  Bec. of the crowd and the noise that greeted me on this first visit, which jarred me and had me scrambling for some space, I wasn't able to check out the display cases and counterspace w/ their array of pastries- cupcakes, apple pie by-the-slice, cookies, tarts, muffins, and scones, which vary daily.  Do check them out!  (The apple pie is so so good!)  The daily special sounded good, but I decided I'd try the Croque Madame (a Croque monsieur topped w/ a fried egg) and the Pancakes w/ Apple Compote.  Ordering is at the counter where you pay and take a card to mark your table w/.  It takes awhile for your food to be prepared, so keep this in mind when you do decide to visit.  I'd say this would be a good time to check out the pastries, but depending on how busy HS gets, you may want to place all of your order selections in the beginning and get it over w/.The croque madame is simply outstanding!  Well, except for the burnt bits.  The French bread (from MJ Bread, I believe) was just perfect, topped w/ a fantastic bechamel sauce, sliced ham, melty gruyere cheese, and a fried egg!  This is definitely an item I would order again and again!The pancakes were good (loved the batter mix!), but "apple compote," this wasn't!  OK, I admit, the compotes I've had thus far were fruit reductions that were thick and sweetened from the natural juices, as well as added sugar, so perhaps Hillside Spot's "apple compote" technically qualifies as a compote (as defined by dictionary.com- "fruit stewed or cooked in a syrup"), but I found the topping as neither sweet nor stewed enough (the chopped apples still had a lot of crunch in them!).  Thankfully, I had my bottle of pure maple syrup in my purse to sweeten the pancakes!  :)7/24/10I visited HS for a second time in early June and tried the berry pancakes w/ homemade whipped cream.  These were delightful!  I almost ate the whole thing, and had I not tried the apple pie, I definitely would've polished them off.  The added bananas (perfectly ripened) took this dish over-the-top!Just went there for breakfast. It was a complete disaster. We waited in line for 5 minutes for the hostess to take our name and then waited 15 minutes after that to be seated. This was a little frustrating since we could see there were open tables. Once we were sat on the patio, the waitress took our drink order and didn't come back to take our food order for about 15 minutes. She seemed annoyed and indifferent.We waited FOREVER for our food. People around us were clearly as displeased as we were. The waitress never came over to refill our drinks or offer any explanation for the wait. It was almost as if she was avoiding us. We just sat and waited, getting more annoyed every minute. We watched as tables of customers sat with no food and the staff milled around, no pep in their step, no sense of urgency. They all seemed like they really could not care less about their jobs and their tips. When we finally got our food it was nothing impressive. We basically got an $8 slice of bread with some ham and cheese on it. Nothing anyone couldn't make at home. Never got a refill on our drinks. Food was edible but I wouldn't call it "good". The waitress explained, after I asked why it took so long that 3 people in the kitchen had walked out so that's why she was frustrated. SHE WAS FRUSTRATED? I couldn't believe she had the nerve to say that when she wasn't doing anything to make up for it. I would respect them if they looked like they were trying but they really weren't. There was no sign of a manager or owner. It looked like a bunch of sloppy, apathetic kids with no guidance working there. If your kitchen staff walked out that's a clear indication of a problem. It's too bad because the ambiance is cute and hip, and this area could really use a privately owned spot for breakfast, but all in all, I would say DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY on this poorly managed joint. We won't be back.There are two main reasons why I frequent  Hillside Spot in Ahwatukee.  One, because it is close to home.  And two, because is the closest location to my house that regularly carries a fairly decent choice of craft beers in my neighborhood.I've enjoyed bringing my family here, meeting friends here for craft beer nights, even conducting a few casual business meetings here.  The atmosphere is nice, the food is pretty good, but the reason I am revising my review has nothing to do with the food or the atmosphere, but more to do with the service and management.A couple weeks ago we stopped in for dinner after and evening event.  On the way out, I stopped to look at the cooler and found a couple of bombers that I thought I would take home.  One of the things I would always tell people about this place was the excellent deals offered on carry out beers.  For $8.95 you can build your own 6-pack of 12oz cans/bottles, or you can choose two bombers for the same  price, as long as you are carrying it out of the restaurant.  So, I take to two bombers to the register and a few minutes later some snarky little wannabe hipster comes to ring me up.  The first words from his mouth was that he could not sell me this one particular bomber for that price because it was a more expensive brew than the others.   I asked why they would have that beer in the same cooler with the other $8.95 bottles...but was pretty much blown off.  I mentioned that it's not really appropriate to advertise one price on the shelf and then charge another at the register....again, just a rude, non-response.So this past Friday night we stopped in again for dinner.  Again, I stopped at the cooler on the way out and found two beers to take home, thinking they must have surely fixed the issue from last time.  To my disappointment, the same snarky, hipster wannabe comes out and rudely proceeds with his spew.  I asked if he was the beer buyer for the establishment he affirmed adding that he was also an assistant manager for the place, but he was not there in that capacity on that night. Again, I asked him as a manager, if he thought it was ok to have beers being advertised for one price in the cooler, but then telling customers, 'not that one' when they bring up their choices.  Again, I got a rude non-answer.Today I would like to retract my previous reviews.  I would also like to warn any of my craft beer friends from the area who may stop by this place based on my previous recommendation.  After the rudeness I experienced here on Friday night, we will find another close-by local spot with good beers.  Perhaps Tukee's.So badly, do I want to give these guys five stars. And each time I visit I am hopeful for a better experience.  Unfortunately, this place has consistently poor service.  Long waits for food, incorrectly taken orders and generally inattentive servers are just a few of the problems.  What continues to frustrate me more than anything is the beer cooler in the front of the store, and the borderline dishonest pricing advertised.   Above the cooler on a chalk board they advertise two of the bombers to go for $8.99*.  Select bottles do not apply.  But they don't label the prices!  You don't find out that both bombers you chose were exempt from the deal until you are making the purchase.  I've mentioned this frustration  to the staff in the past, only to be rudely spoken down to by someone claiming to be an assistant manager and one of the beer buyers.If this place wasn't just a couple blocks from my home I would have never returned after my initial bad experience.  But they are close and convenient, and at certain times they are the only alternative to fast food in the immediate area.  Their food has been pretty good for the most part....I just wish they could get their service and their craft beer issues solved so I can start recommending this place to friends again.Interesting place. Expansive menu. They apparently take pride in the ingredients in their food, which is a good thing.Just don't tell them that you're under any sort of time constraint, as they really don't seem to care, despite the fact that it was mentioned *several* times. I wouldn't recommend it for lunch during the week on your lunch hour, even if "lunch" happens to be 2:00 PM. On a Tuesday. I'm guessing that the slow service is because they take the time to let your food die from natural causes, painlessly, in its sleep, before cooking it up and serving it to you. Honestly, I'm kind of disappointed, especially after the rave reviews that friends had given it.When I checked in, the Yelp app asked me if Hillside Spot was "hipster"; I guess that sums it up. They're not worried about "the man's" bourgeois constructs like "time" and "work".In short- food... Good. Service... Good. Attention to time constraints... Needs work.

Review Text :
As a Filipino in Phoenix it's hard to find Filipino restaurants in Phoenix especially Tagalog Filipino cooking. Most Filipinos in Phoenix are illocano or Visayan and there really isn't alot of Filipino restaurants to try so when my mom and I saw a banner outside of Mekong Plaza of a Filipino grill that just opened, I made sure that the next time I found myself at Mekong I'd stop and try it out. Anywho, Wholly Grill is owned by a Cebuana, and they specialize in grilling hence the name. There are usually two things I'll try out at a Filipino restaurant and that is their barbeque and the house special. In this case it was the pork barbeque and the Liempo (grilled pork belly). Chona the owner was pulling out all the stops to get people to try out her place hence the 4 stars coz she was giving out samples. The barbeque was not sweet which was good and not too saucy! I think that's what people are not big fans of and that's sugar sweet filipino food. The Liempo was not fatty nor salty and with the 2 scoops of rice and the macaroni salad (pinoy style with the raisins) along with two pork bbq sticks for around $10 it wasn't a bad deal. I just wish she had sago or Halo-Halo. But it's not bad, and if I need a Filipino fix I'll stop by at Wholly Grill! you should too!4/7/10Wanted to try this place back in March when Mom and I spotted an ad mentioning Filipino food in the plaza, but we'd already eaten pho, so had to wait until the next shopping opportunity brought us to this area again.  Met the very warm and friendly owners-- we really do wish them great success!Since it was almost closing time, the food items in the buffet, and there weren't many to choose from, didn't look interesting, so we decided to try the pork skewers (the recipe of which the husband and wife team were very proud of), as well as the liempo (pork belly) serving that called out to Mom.  A combo plate of these two items also came with rice and achara (pickled papaya and carrots).  I also ordered one piece of saba at langka [saba bananas (or in this case, plantains) and jackfruit, wrapped in lumpia wrapper and deep-fried].The wait for our food took longer than I expected, but it wasn't too much of an issue since Mom took awhile to do the groceries.  The wait, however, was worth it!  I really enjoyed the pork barbecue skewers- the flavors really took me back to my childhood in the Philippines, when street food, already a daily ritual for us then (and just now gaining popularity stateside) had us sampling BBQ, fried fishballs (and the many different sauces to dip them in!), steamed rolled rice and tuber pancakes, ripe and sour mangoes (the latter eaten with bagoong (very tiny salted shrimp) or vinegar and garlic, and "dirty" ice cream, to name a few from food carts that were to be seen all over Metro Manila and around colleges (grammar schools) and universities ("colleges" here).  Writing about those pork skewers actually make me want to stop at Mekong Plaza now, instead of going for Italian or French food I was considering earlier!  The liempo, on the other hand, I could've gone without; I remember thinking that we should've just ordered a double of the BBQ!  The skewers were just more flavorful than the pork belly pieces.  While Mom enjoyed the liempo, she did agree that the BBQ was were the money was at, and the owners really did have something to be proud of!Let's not forget the dessert!  On second thought, maybe we should.  First, I didn't care for the presentation.  Take a gander at the photos, and you'll see what I mean.  Second, it wasn't very sweet.  Not even sweet enough.  See that pool of caramel sauce the turon rested on?  I did not leave a single drop on the plate!  Not because it was so delicious, but because the roll really needed the added punch.  Mom already knew it wasn't going to be anything to write home about, just by looking at the offering, but did wait till I took a couple of bites before saying "I should've just bought the ingredients at Mekong and made you those at home!"  My sentiments exactly, Mommy dearest!Oh, but the pork BBQ!  Run and try some now!I have one word for you, son.Porkbellies.Specifically, GRILLED Porkbellies.With a side of rice, a side of pickled eggplant, a side of macaroni salad, and a side of cucumbers.It doesn't get much better than this.  (crunch, crunch, crunch)

I knew better than to stop by here, but I was hungry and I no longer resist the temptation to try some of those "fresh made" Breaded Chicken Tenders.  I ordered a 3 Piece Chicken Tender, Bean Burrito, and Western Bacon Cheeseburger.  It took a while for the food to come out....I guess they really do make them by hand.  The first item I had was the Western Bacon Cheeseburger.....once upon a time, this was my favorite Burger.  Now, it's just awful.  The Bacon doesn't even taste like Bacon.....it's that paper-thin, pre-cooked, microwave Bacon, blech!  And the Onion Rings inside the Burger were very poor quality....I took one bite and the entire Onion came out of the Ring because it was so tough.Next up was the Bean Burrito....it was just ok.  I'd rather have a Bean Burrito from Taco Bell or Del Taco.  Don't know why I ordered it.Last up was the Hand Breaded Chicken Tenders.....I saved them for last because if they were fresh, they'd be piping hot and I don't want to burn my mouth.  I bit into the first piece and yuck!!!  It was rubbery.....just awful.  I didn't finish the rest of them.....what a waste of time, money, and calories. Damn.They get 2 Stars instead of 1 Star because the employees were very nice and friendly and the place was clean.  You can have your Happy Star!Return Factor - 0.001%

It is dark in here. Like really REALLY dark! Like you could make out in the corner and no one would really notice dark. Let's not be silly though, I didn't make up in there, I come to eat! I really do enjoy this place, even if I have to feel around for the taco's on my plate because I can't see them. But this just makes me sound old. So on to the good part, the food! So good! I had the mahi mahi taco's and the pork taco's and they are exceptional! I love when they put cabbage in a taco, I know that sounds weird, but it's just so tasty with the marinade they use! I know that Chi Chi's (RIP) trained me to expect free chips and salsa, so it's always nice to have them free. Sorry to burst the bubble, but they're four bucks a pop....BUT it is an endless basket. Which is good because it usually disappears in about 5.5 seconds. I'm also a big judge of salsa, and this salsa definitely passes the test, with just the right amount of kick! I do LOVE the outside area! There's tons of seating and benches and it's just so great to sit out there on a nice warm summer night with a tall glass of Dos Equis! And I am SO into tequila...badly into it. So watch out, because that bill can get high when that's in the mix! You can also trip down the steps in the dark as night dining room after too many....I don't understand the appeal of this place.  Unless you have a seat at the bar or are lucky enough to be trapped there and can get the bartender's attention, the service is abysmal at best, non-existant at worst.Note to everyone - if you plan on having dinner, you will be there all night.  Cancel all other plans.  If you're lucky, you will get your dinner around last call.The one time I was actually served food at Round Corner, the food was pretty good..  It was also empty, so that is why I was able to actually order.  So maybe the long wait is a bit of hyperbole, but we arrived at Round Corner around 7.  We were seated quick enough, however the waiting game had just started.  We weren't greeted by our waitress for about 10 minutes who said she would be right with us and disappeared for another 10.  At least she returned with water for all.  She took our drink order and left without our food order.  This is when I realized we were in trouble. At 7:45, she returned with our drinks and promptly walked away again.  Yes, if you're doing the math, it took 25 minutes to get a round of 4 drinks.  All beer.She returned around 8pm, by then we had been there an hour and we asked first for another round (to get a head start on that) and ordered our dinner.  That was the last we saw of her.  After another 15 minutes or so, my friend went to the bar to find the status of our missing waitress. Our best guess was that she had been kidnapped and held for ransom unknown reason.  My friend returned in just under 5 minutes with a new round for us and said that they were free due to the circumstances.By 8:45 we had finished all of our drinks and still had not even seen our waitress in the dining room.  At 8:46 we left money on the table for the beer and a note that the money was for her ransom and left on our way to Tamari never to return.Holy expensive tacos Batman I will not be back.  I ordered a total of 4 tacos and a beer grand total $25.00 dollars.  My hubby had two chorizo and papas tacos and I had a two tacos that had a shrimp and cheese filling the name escapes me.  The menu boasts of house made chorizo but we could barely taste any chorizo in the tacos. There seemed to be only one shrimp cut up into 3 pieces in each of my tacos. I watched the cook walk back and forth between the kitchen and the dining room 8 times touching everything in the dining room and sitting down with a waitress to eat chips and salsa.  Granted the NBA Dunk Contest was on the bigscreen so it's possible that he didn't want to miss out on the action.  I would expect more professionalism from a place that charged $8 for two tacos.I visited Round Corner Cantina with my cousin last Sat.  We were looking for a place to have dinner, so I looked through my pack of City Dining Cards.  Based on the options available, my cousin and I both decided on Round Corner, so we headed over to Lawrenceville to check it out.At the time of our visit, it had just finished raining, so almost all of the tables on the patio were empty.  We decided to hedge our bets by sitting at the outdoor bar, which had partly covered seats.  Fortunately, it didn't rain any more, and the rest of the tables on the patio filled up during the time of our visit.  To get to the patio, when you walk in the front door, proceed to the doorway at the far end of the bar and you'll see another doorway leading to it right after that (this wasn't clear to us upon first entering!).  I highly recommend sitting on the patio if possible, since it's quite nice, whereas the indoor rooms are dark and stuffy.Once seated, we started off by ordering chips and guacamole ($7), which came out in about 5 min.  The chips were underseasoned and had a bit of a waxy texture, and the dip was fresh (containing avocado chunks) but wasn't super flavorful.  Nevertheless, they served their purpose as an appetizer by giving us something to munch on while awaiting the rest of our order.  This was a good thing, since the rest of our order took 30 min. to come out, which the bartender said was due to the printer in the kitchen breaking.For our entrees, my cousin ordered the pescado (fish) tacos ($9), and I ordered the carnitas (pork) tacos ($9).  We each exchanged a taco with one another so that we could both try both different types of tacos.  I found the tacos mediocre in flavor and composition, esp. for the price.  The fish was the better of the two--the shell of the pork taco fell apart while I ate it due to grease, and the meat was a bit chewy.  We also ordered the elote (Mexican street corn; $5) as a side item. This was by far the best part of the meal--the cotija cheese topping was quite delicious.  Even so, the corn was a bit mushy, which detracted from the overall effect.Overall, I was less than impressed with the quality of the food at Round Corner, esp. for the price (fortunately, we didn't pay full price thanks to the City Dining Card).  And, needless to say, I wasn't exactly pleased with having to wait so long for the main order, esp. after the initial order was fulfilled so quickly.  However, the patio provides a nice environment, and our service from the bartender was good, notwithstanding the kitchen delay.  If you're looking for great traditional tacos, I suggest Las Palmas in Oakland or Edgar's in the Strip, and if you're looking for delicious upscale tacos, I recommend Tako downtown.  In general, I'd suggest sticking to drinks and apps at Round Corner, and giving most of the food a pass.  2.5 stars.

This is some goooood pizza.... and the customer service is just as good :) i got there early waiting for my friend... so i sat down and right away the little blonde girl came over from behind the counter and asked me if i wanted anything ... (water with lemon lol) from what i saw you order from the counter.. pay.. sit down and they then bring you your food... i thought it to be a nice gesture :) especially since she didn't have to :) my friend finally showed up... it was grub time !! i had the Hawaiian and pepperoni and a side salad with ranch... first off the salad was amazing! red onions chopped up in it and carrots and other stuff too not like a normal side salad with iceberg lettuce and some croutons.... i was happy :) the pizza slices were huge.. and they were generous with the toppings :) the pineapples tasted awesome and my favorite part of the pizza was the crust.. :) (and that goes for any pizza.. i love bread! Italian for sure ) and their menu is huge... lots of choices and i like that... especially since i change my mind alot lol they had a bunch of flat screen TVs on the walls... with different channels on each one... i like that... who wants to watch the same game on every TV you see..!! i really liked the food and the atmosphere and especially the employees... they were friendly, helpful and very prompt with out food :) i will be back for lunch again in the future :)

I first tried Maui Wowi when I checked in on FourSquare to get a 15% discount.  A 15% discount on a cup of coffee doesn't amount to much, I know.  For that matter, neither does FourSquare, as far as I can tell after being on it for a couple months.  I feel like a dog going around marking my turf. Maybe they'll build to something, we'll see. If they keep getting money thrown at them they should eventually be able to produce something, right?Wait, was I reviewing FourSquare or Maui Wowi?  It was Maui Wowi wasn't it?So the iced mocha I had (with half chocolate per my request) was delicious.  I mean really delicious.So I came back another time to try the hot mocha (1/2 chocolate again - I like to taste COFFEE with a little chocolate, not CHOCOLATE SYRUP with a little coffee like some coffee houses make). It was quite good as well.The folks are very friendly and accommodating.I also started chatting with a guy named Phil who moved here from Foxboro, MA.  I moved here from Mansfield, MA. Neighboring 'burbs of Boston.

Review Text :
My buddy was craving a burger for dinner and I remember driving by this place earlier in the day so we hit this place up. The host asked us if we wanted to sit at a table or at the bar. I wanted a pint, so I opted for the bar. I asked the bartender what they had on tap. His reply was, "nothing." Ok...fine no tap...so I ask for a Stella. Bartender says, "we don't have that...we only have cans." Wtf?!! What bar only serves beer in cans? I settled for an Amstel Light. Later I noticed on the bill that each can of Amstel Light was $5. I had 2 cans. A can of Amstel Light should not be $5. I should've just had a milkshake.What I ordered:-Premium Fresh Ground Chuck, Hand Pressed $9.00-Regular Bun-Pepper Jack Cheese $0.75-Toppings (2 included) $0.75 each:  Lettuce  Tomatoes   Marinated Mushrooms-Sauce (2 included) $0.75 each:  Roasted Garlic MayoI asked the bartender if I could pick 3 toppings since I only wanted 1 sauce. He replied in a rude tone, "that's not how it works!" I don't understand why he couldn't give me the 3rd topping for free. I only picked 1 sauce and extra toppings are the same price as extra sauces. The burger tasted ok for a $10.50 burger. The bill for the 2 of us was $46.48. If I'm spending this much at a burger place...I should at least be getting my beer in a bottle.Next time I'm going back to Burger Bar!Stopped by on the way to the airport with Mom to have lunch.  I've had this place on my "To Do" list for a while.....it was time to give it a try.  The decor is very nice and modern and I like how they are connected to a full service bar and separated by glass.....so the smokers in the bar won't bother the diners.  We were given menus and seated.  We were told that the menu doubles as an order sheet.....in other words, it's a custom Burger joint where you select each item for your Burger.....cool.After browsing the menu for a few minutes, I decided to go with:Juicy Lucy Burger w/Regular Bun, BBQ Sauce, Jalapenos, Marinated Onions, American Cheese, Cheddar Cheese $9.50+Bacon $1.50http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/UcgCSTCtPv1GeW5bKsEdag?select=r_g9twzpNXEvAjfXwIG20QTall and Thin Fries - $4http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/UcgCSTCtPv1GeW5bKsEdag?select=8hrzsZ1yfIxHC-3pxww4bAMom went with a Turkey Burger w/Lettuce, Tomatoes, Onions, and Jalapenos, $8.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/UcgCSTCtPv1GeW5bKsEdag?select=OvID1zfcEgO1ZvMXtMhyggThe Juicy Lucy is two Burger patties cooked together with the Cheese in the middle between the patties.  I've seen Burgers like this on the Food Network and was anxious to give this a try.After a few minutes our food was ready and I bit into the Juicy Lucy.....the Cheese oozed out of the center of the Burger.....you have to be really careful because it's HOT!http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/UcgCSTCtPv1GeW5bKsEdag?select=-IseHtIgiZZxOT1A8n4KpAThe Burger was good, but not great....I thought the toppings and Bun were the highlight of the Burger....the Meat was OK, but wasn't great.....I don't know, it was missing "something".  The BBQ Sauce was excellent and added some much needed flavor to the Burger.  I liked the Marinated Onions....would like to know how they are prepared.The Fries were very good and it's enough to serve 2 people.Mom enjoyed her Turkey Burger, but said she's not sure it was worth $8.  I would agree with her....for the price of our Burgers, I was hoping they would be mind-blowing.....they were good, but not great.  I will probably come back and give it another shot.....maybe I picked the wrong combo of toppings.Return Factor - 75%Finally have had a chance to try a burger here since my boyfriend has been telling me about it for the longest time. We just happen to have a coupon for a buy one get one free burger from the 2013 Entertainment book so here we went for dinner! I have no idea how the College kids can afford to eat here with these prices.They give you a product requisition form (menu) and you check off what you would like such as the size patty and the toppings you want. This is creative, cute and perhaps fun however it just really delayed the time in getting our order in. Myself being a Grind Burger virgin it just seemed to take forever to go over the complete menu, mark off what I wanted just to have the Server repeat it back to us. Save the paper and printing fees and just create a more reasonable menu.Every item is Ala carte which is fine however when it is like that I expect the side items, such as fries to be really good not just ordinary. I was disappointed with the fries they were lacking flavor and the portion for what they charge was very little. We ordered the short & thick fries which are potato wedge style and nothing special.I decided on a 4oz burger 7.49 with cheddar .75 additional and free toppings of lettuce, tomato, onion and garlic mayo. How is it free, who wants a plain burger seriously and those are standard cheeseburger toppings to specify them as free is absurd. Anyhow, my boyfriend got the infamous "Juicy Lucy" a patty with cheese on the inside 10.99 he opted for Pepper Jack. He truly enjoyed his burger that he had consumed in less than 4 bites, yikes and that is an 8oz patty!I was joking with my boyfriend that this is not a place that I would come on a first date,  as it was so damn messy! The burgers taste good and are really juicy as my meat juice and toppings were just oozing all over the place! I had a damn hamburger salad left on my plate after I finished my burger. The hamburger buns are the star player as they were so fresh and tasty almost a hint of sweetness like Hawaiian sweet bread.The Service was good, maybe too attentive. We went on a Sunday night and asked to sit in the bar so that we could watch the football game while eating. Unfortunately we were the only ones there dining at the time which I usually like when we eat out rather than huge crowds! The bartender gal had nothing to do but focus on us. She was nice but way too in our mix, we just want to relax and eat and if you are coming over every second or talking to us from across the room every moment it is rather annoying! I know who complains about an attentive staff however this was beyond ridiculous and avoiding eye contact was not working either. When I am busy stuffing my face with a big fat juicy burger the last thing i want to do is have to respond to a conversation I never wanted to join in the first place!  This is one of those burger joints I only need to try once, I am one and done. Next!I posted pictures of our meals as well, enjoy :)Entertainment book 2013 savings this meal $8.24Go big or go home! That's what I thought when I hesitantly ordered the Juicy Lucy. The waitress ,husband , and my brother emphasized it was big. I couldn't ignore the reviews though because I read everyone was really happy with the Juicy Lucy.. I wanted it and got it with no regrets! It was stuffed with Provolone cheese. I had it topped with lettuce, tomato, onion, jalapenos,mustard and garlic mayo. When I bit into it the waitress said to be careful just in case the hot cheese squirts in my eye or something . It oozed out of the burger it tasted heavenly. This has now made it to the top of my burger list! It was so good I had to share with my hubby who almost ate it all! I wouldn't waste my money on the fries because they tasted mediocre. We ended the meal with a chocolate sundae. It was ice cold deliciousness! I would definitely want to come back for that burger even though it's a bit out of my way!Awkward. Everything about our dinner here was awkward. We were not drinking so we decided to sit in the restaurant area... We were the only people seated there at the time. The table we were put at at was awkward, with a pole in the middle of it that seemed to make it difficult for staff to serve and clear plates. The chairs were uncomfortable. Ordering was awkward. The menu is a sheet of paper you mark your order on. Our waitress thought my husband only wanted an appetizer,  despite the fact that his standardized-test type ordering form was clearly completed to indicate he wanted a burger with specific toppings. Prices were high too, over $10 for a burger that didn't come with fries ($4 if you want to add a side of fries)... $10 for 3 smaller-than-typical sliders. Speaking of our waitress, not only was she rather poor at reading the ordering form but she also lacked in the personality department. Her entire vibe was a buzz kill. Most of this would be forgiven if the food was good... We started with fried mozzarella, served with the blandest marinara ever.  My husband had the Juicy Lucy which comes stuffed with cheese. I had the sliders which came with cheese and a side of thousand island dressing (pickles would have been nice). I found the meat under seasoned and overcooked. My husband didn't complain about his burger but he did have a ton of toppings added... Even the bathroom was awkward... There is no separation between the toilet and sink and a rather gross, messy floor. It took ages to get our check, we had to ask the busser to find our waitress to finally get the hell out of there...  There are a lot of places to overpay for a burger and fries on the Strip, which means there is no reason for me to ever come back here.

This was another recommendation by our B&B hosts.  We made 7:00 reservations and walked over.  We were greeted warmly but w/ the concern that we knew we were to bring our own wine, a concern that was echoed by our server.  We explained that we did, but only one of us drank wine, so it wasn't practical for us to bring a bottle.  Had we known before dinner at Steak Frîtes a couple of nights ago about bringing our own wine the bottle would likely have lasted me three dinners.We were brought the English menu and our server explained which dishes were no longer available and what had replaced them.  We decided to share an appetizer of pumpkin and walnut ravioli and grilled calamari.  Alan ordered the fish special (a white fish, the type I can't remember) and I ordered the rack of lamb.  We were brought a sliced baguette in a graceful Nambé-like elongated bowl accompanied by a small ramekin of butter.  Unexpectedly we were both brought bowls of a squash-cabbage soup.  It was thick and beautifully seasoned.  Completely delicious.The appetizer arrived and we were very sorry we hadn't brought the camera because the presentation was so beautiful.  The calamari was atop the ravioli and artfully arranged atop the calamari were delicate sprigs of herbs.  Under and around the ravioli were finely chopped tomatoes and tentacles.  Alan took the calamari and cut it in half while I took the ravioli (I should say raviolo because there was a single one) and cut it in half.  We exchanged halves and sprinkled some tomato and tentacles on top.  It was very tasty and we enjoyed it but would have appreciated a bit more generous portion for the price, like two ravioli.  We used the last of the bread to sop up the delicious sauce in the bottom of the bowl.  We were offered a lemon-vodka sorbet as a palate cleanser between courses but Alan declined and I didn't have any either.When our mains arrived they were again beautifully presented and accompanied by an interesting assortment of vegetables.  My lamb had a couple of small potatoes that had an appealing smokey flavor, a couple of barely cooked baby carrots and a mixture of shredded red and white cabbage.  It was a wonderful mélange.  The lamb was cooked medium rare and it was very tender.   Alan's fish was accompanied by thin slices of kumquat and a variety of vegetables.  He loved it and the bite I had was excellent.  After all that we had no room for dessert.  We had a lovely conversation w/ the people at the adjacent table, Swedish parents visiting their college age son here.  It's the kind of conversation you sometimes fall into while traveling.  Service was seamless, personable and smooth.  The noise level was a bit high because the ceilings are high and the walls are brick.  We enjoyed our evening here.  4.51 rounded up.Mon nouveau restaurant préféré a Montréal. O'Thym a été d'un professionalisme exemplaire lors de la soirée d'anniversaire que nous avons donné en l'honneur de mon copain. Nous avions réservé pour 13 personnes, un mardi. Le service fut d'une qualité exceptionnelle : honnête, chaleureux et discret. Le menu présenté sur une ardoise semblait déjà alléchant mais quand notre serveur nous en a fait la description détaillée nous avions tous véritablement l'eau à la bouche !Le service fut rapide, tous les plats sont arrivés en même temps. Tous les mets ont eu un franc succès. A la table, les gens s'échangeait des bouchées et commentaient favorablement la qualité des plats.Le concept apportez votre vin nous a permis de vraiment se laisser aller dans la nourriture sans compromettre la qualité du vin ($). Définitivement, nous y retournerons pour une prochaine occasion.

The name of this restaurant is actually "The Dive N".  I ate here for the first time today and was pleasantly surprised.  They only serve breakfast and lunch and they have daily specials for each.  The theme is that of a 50's style diner.With some reservations I decided to try to the BBQ plate.  Once I ordered I thought for sure I had made a mistake because I know what good Q tastes like and I just ordered it from a 50's style diner.  That's usually a big no no!  As you can see from the pic of the plate it's a nice portion of food.  I was acutally impressed by the pulled BBQ!  It was very tasty and I was a fan of the vinegar based sauce that accompanied it.  The slaw was great, finely chopped just the way I like it.  Also the drinks they serve come with that really crushed ice which is a favorite of mine.  I don't know why more restaurants don't have that?!?!  The BBQ plate was $7.25 plus $1.25 for the drink.The staff was very friendly and the restaurant area was very clean which is always a plus.  I will definitely be back here again to try some of their other menu items, but for first impressions I give them 4 stars!

Review Text :
It was pretty exciting to try Pink's for the very first time. But my sis said this location is $3-$4 more per item compared to the LA location. Not only that, but the menu is shorter and the specials are not the same. The good thing is, there's no crazy hour wait like in LA. Had the Vegas Strip Hot Dog. Two hot dogs, served with chili, mustard, guacamole and jalapenos. Very tasty, but a bit on the heavy side. Especially in 100+ degree weather since there's only outdoor seating. Sis had the Bacon Chili Cheese Dog, which was pretty good too. Gotta love chili! Had a bite of the Pastrami Burrito. Now that was just weird. Hot dog, pastrimi, chili, cheese and onions. Odd combo and taste. Pass. Lastly, their fries were very good. Seasoned and crispy, just the way I like it. After combo-ing my hot dog, it came out to like $12! Wow. That's some expensive hot dog that I couldn't even finish. Not because it was big, but it was just too difficult to eat in that hot weather.Pink's is one of those over-hyped places and since this location is in Vegas, also super over-priced! It was located right outside the Planet Hollywood hotel and wasn't hard to find with its bright, pink name etched on the glass. At least there was no line at all when we got there. Only outdoor seating so refrain from getting anything too spicy in the humid weather.It was $6.75 for my bacon chili cheese dog...not really worth it especially when the ones at the original Pink's in LA cost almost half that. It was topped with bacon, tomato, cheese, and mustard since I didn't want onions on mine. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/uQB9kS7LzEsGhLTMUUnmEA?select=3FCsHb9yQxmpuyvnn8fyxA) The bacon was nice and crispy but the hot dog was TINY and wasn't anything special. The ones from Costco are way bigger! My bun was also flimsy and broke in half after 2 bites. It could have used much more chili and the cheese wasn't melted enough. It was still a tasty meal overall but totally not worth the price tag.The Pink's in Southern California is another one of my bookmarked businesses. And again the franchise opened another location in Las Vegas. Located right on the busy Las Vegas Blvd strip and in the Planet Hollywood resort, there are no indoor seating, but plenty of outdoor seating. A great view of the strip and the Bellagio Hotel located across the street. I had one of their unique hot-dogs-"Three Dog Night". For $8.25, I get three skinny hot dogs wrapped with bacon and chlli, cheese and chopped red onions in a flour tortilla. This gourmet hot dog is featured on Triple-D in So-Cal and Guy Fieri considered this hot dog, "MONEY". But my hot dog is nowhere as good as his, where my slices of bacon was "undercooked" and not crispy. I still prefer the Bacon Dog Cart on Mission St in San Francisco any given day. The only positive thing about the small hot dog place is that I get to see the fountain show at the Bellagio while eating my subpar snack. I'll still go to the Pink's in Southern California and check out other items though.Three Dog night: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/T0Uw6vwwfO3el29wBoDamQ?select=ZPkgzbo64jO7u91BF6eXsADude, it's Pink's...in Vegas. My two favorite things in the world. OK, I really don't feel that way. But if I was a surfer dude from Redondo Beach out with my buds for a Vegas weekend, this would certainly be my dining destination of choice. Since I'm not, I guess I can be a little more discriminating. But dude, it's Pink's. Well not quite Pink's. Just a reasonable facsimile in an apt setting, Planet Hollywood. Jamie W. and I really wanted some dogs after strolling through the sterile City Center complex which has none of the kitsch that really is Vegas. Luckily, Pink's has kitsch to spare in its patio setting outside the hotel entrance. The menu looked familiar. We decided to each get a $4.75 Giant 12-inch Jalapeno Dog with nacho cheese and chili, and share a $6.50 "Planet Hollywood" Dog, which consisted of a Polish sausage, grilled onions, grilled mushrooms, bacon and cheese (see photos). Oh did I mention the fries, too? Nice and tasty they were. Indigestion thy name is Pink's. The Jalapeno Dog has that snap to the wiener that I don't care for much. I prefer a meatier dog to the tooth, and the mustard was way overwhelming, but chili, cheese and diced onions are bulletproof on a dog as far as I'm concerned. The "Planet Hollywood" Dog has quite a pile of toppings to maneuver in your mouth starting with the bacon strips lording over the sausage already drowning in melted cheese. The mushrooms seemed almost incidental to the creation, but they were good. Hell, it was all good in a bad, bad way. FOOD - 3 stars....quite an abundance of toppings on those dogs but not quite the Pink's I remember in LA AMBIANCE - 2 stars...hell, it's just a patio...in pink SERVICE - 2.5 stars...just keep moving the line and the dogs will eventually be there TOTAL - 3 stars...a middling experience based on a distant memory of the Pink's in LAAfter checking in and settling down in our Planet Hollywood room, Anchalee was starving for something simple. We hadn't eaten anything since our breakfast at Firewood Grill inside SFO at about 10 am, and now it was around 3:30 pm. The first eatery that caught her eye was Pink's Hot Dogs located outside Planet Hollywood but still around the premises because she was thinking of Top Dog in Berkeley. You really couldn't miss it with it's big pink sign. There was a super extensive menu of dogs, burgers, burritos, soda and alcoholic beverages, sides, and desserts. We chose only one hot dog to share, a Naked Polish, since we weren't looking for all the fix-ins. Can you really justify a $6 Polish dog? And that's before tax too. Maybe it was possibly for the polish dog size and since we were in a tourist attraction city, but I wouldn't want to pay this price on a daily basis. If it included a drink as a meal, then maybe that's a deal. Yes, the Polish was spicy, juicy, and hot. But there wasn't anything special about the bun. After consuming this expensive snack, I thought to myself I can't wait to get back to the Bay Area so I can really be spoiled and eat a good hot dog from Top Dog for $3.25 each. Family owned since 1939, it's always worth a try for something new with a little flair!Pink's was one of the cheapest meals we had in Vegas! $26 for three people was a nice change of pace from spending triple & quadruple that at other eateries. This was my first time eating at this Vegas location but I'd been to the original So Cal one a few times. I ordered my usual: a veggie hot dog covered in chili cheese & onions. Completely messy & totally heavy in the stomach; exactly what junk food should be. My companions ordered polish dogs. Even though I don't eat meat hot dogs, I like that I don't have to be excluded from dining at Pink's with people who do because they serve veggie dogs. Brownie points for that. Pink's food is kind of 'eh' but it's fun to eat outside, under heating lamps & surrounded by lights on The Strip.Pink's is a humongo staple in LA...and every time I'm outside the place I swear off poppin my Pink's cherry because of that ridonculous line. But you can't get away from the buzz...you hear about them online, from friends, and it's practically a celebrity hotspot. Well being the sceptic that I need to be to thrive, I figured it may be a lot of empty hype. I mean a hot dog's a hot dog, I thought. And I couldn't have been wronger. (yeah. it's a word now ;)Sure, I can't tell a lie...there were only 2-3 people ahead and yet we waited in line for probly 25 minutes. And yeah, for 2 simple styled hot dogs and an onion ring after all was said & done (including tax & a small tip), it was almost 20 dollars. And the cashier was very knowlegeable, but moved at the speed of a dmv employee..they all did.But I quickly found out that their food is the REAL DEAL HOLYFIELD. No empty hype. SO damn good. No, I think they put crack in there.After eating at Pink's LA twice on a trip a few months ago, I was ecstatic to eat at their Vegas location.  Hey who am I kidding, I was beyond ecstatic, excited more like it truth be told.LOCATION:  Pink's Las Vegas is one of the numerous eateries at the Miracle Mile Shops at the Planet Hollywood Hotel and Casino.  Please note that Pink's is NOT located within the Miracle Mile Shops.  The entrance and entire eatery can be accessed only externally from the shops themselves.  If you know where Earl of Sandwich is located, walk directly to the nearest doors that exit to Las Vegas blvd and there you will find hot dog mecca.I noticed that 2 things were exactly the same at this location:  The menu, of course, and the line!  The wait time was nowhere near that of the LA location, but I really didn't expect that many people to be waiting to be quite honest.FOOD:  My friend and I both decided to order a chili cheese dog each and shared a side of fries with nacho cheese.  PRICE:  Price$ are slightly higher than LA......this is Vega$ after all.SEATING:  All available seating, like the LA location, is first come first serve and is all outdoors.  Some tables have a covering provided while others do not.AWESOME: One of the best things about this location is that.....credit cards, namely Visa, MC, and AMEX are accepted!!  Bottom Line:  I'll absolutely be back on a future trip to Vegas!For the longest time, two places have sat at the top fo my Vegas To Try list - CraftSteak...and Pink's.  Yep, I know.  Quite possibly the only time those two will ever be #1 and #2 on the same list.  For anything.  Ever.Unlike Earl of Sandwich, which had its usual, ridiculous line going on, nary a person could be found at the at counter at Pink's.  Perfect for us since we just wanted a quick lunch before our flight...and because we probably took 10 minutes to figure out what to get from their giant menu board (it took me so long, I swear they all started to sound the same...).  Although it wasn't one of the sexier options, I ordered the POLISH PASTRAMI SWISS CHEESE DOG ($8.49), and tried some for the CHILI CHEESE FRIES ($6.79) that my friend had ordered for our group to share.  Topped with Pastrami, Swiss Cheese, and Mustard (forgot to add on the Sour Kraut), the polish wasn't bad but hardly exciting (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pinks-hot-dogs-las-vegas-2?select=ii0a_yyiuQlFKWpttNFiMA#2Cd3mM114U75Fre4_Z9ong).  While the Polish sausage itself was fine (who knew it went so well with Swiss cheese?), the shreds of pastrami were really dry and a bit salty.  The Chili Cheese Fries were guiltfully tasty though (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pinks-hot-dogs-las-vegas-2?select=ii0a_yyiuQlFKWpttNFiMA#ZCy7uTuIMph17rZSk5TtgA).  Not so much for the cheese sauce (because it's, you know, cheese sauce), but because their chili is surprisingly decent!  Plus...who doesn't love some good chili fries?All in all, I'd come back if I needed something relatively quick and simple, as well as to try some of the more unique and "exotic" combinations (stomach ache on a plane?  Ummm...no).  Pink's is probably one of the better bets around based on convenience alone, but at about $8 a pop, they do an even better job of making me appreciate Costco's $1.50 Polish and a drink that much more.Do get their Showgirl dog, which showcases all the ingredients you can load up on for a hot dog to scream supreme!This hot dog spot is conveniently located near Walgreens, semi-corner of Planet Hollywood - on the outside.  The staff brings the dogs out when ready.Their French fries were fried and textured delightfully. If you are craving for some hot dogs, this spot is the place to be!Wow, has it really been 5 years since my last review at Pink's??  Well, other than satisfy my craving for a hot dog, nothing's really changed from my last experience here except for the prices which have increased since then.Chicago Polish Dog -- http://bit.ly/1FsSnTOmustard, relish, lettuce & tomatoesThe hot dog was good but it was basically a salad on a hot dog.  Because it's on their Classic Dog side of the menu, the price wasn't too bad but still pricey though for what I got.  I guess I probably should've ordered the Planet Hollywood Dog (http://bit.ly/1JiKJjI) again because at least it has more of a 'wow' factor.For convenience on being right on the strip, I like Pink's.  But I think I'd rather get my gourmet hot dog fix off the strip at Buldogis or even at Gordon Ramsay BurGR.

OK, another up market hot dog joint...good enough hot dogs...rows of beautiful, state of the art condiment dispensers... lovely tables and décor...and I am just not getting it.I like hot dogs as much as the next red blooded, all American boy...maybe more...but I do not understand how these places can make it on dogs...in fact, I don't think they can.It seems that these new upscale kind of hot dog joints have a menu that stops just of short of being a Fox Restaurant Conniption...everything from yam fries to prime rib dip on the menu!But, I came in for a hot a dog and a hot dog is what I got...for $2.65 US Dollars.It was a particularly necessary and poignant retox for me...not only did I get in a nice run this morning, but I had to go to the Arizona MVD to finally complete the process of getting new tags for my car...a process that took over 4 months and more than 25 hours of my time on the phone and waiting at the MVD...which is another review about the adequacy (or lack thereof) of the data processing systems, processes and employees of the State of Arizona Motor Vehicle Division.I celebrated finally emerging from the gantlet, bloodied and scarred, but unbowed...with a hot dog!The hot dogs themselves are reasonably priced, pretty well prepared, served on little "loaves" that have been toasted and buttered (I think you know that in my world, butter=goodness).I looked around, and they don't seem to tout any particular type of sausages or wiener manufacturer (you know...like Schreiners or Schuylers or imported from Buffalo, NY, or specially made from baby seal scrotums or something)...but the wieners were certainly serviceable.The service was also "serviceable" but was more like a standard "hot dog stand"...not the most personable group behind the counter...and if you are trying to upsell to justify the rent and the build out of the space in a mall like this...you just might need a little personality...as well as the ability to do more than ask "ja want fry wit' dat?"Finally, as I ate my wiener (go ahead...snicker...I'll wait...done?...OK) I noticed another slightly "off" element to the HDS...the music playing sounded like Greek ballads (which may be the case, since I thought the accents behind the counter sounded Greek) and they were playing rather loudly...although the obligatory flat screen was tuned to ESPN and was also turned up...committing 1st degree cacophony.One set of sounds or the other...not both...and by the way, since when is the background music tuned to what the staff or owner wants to listen to, as opposed to what the customers want to hear?I'll tell you when...at good old divey, cruddy, greasy hot dog only hot dog joints, where the radio is playing what the cook wants and nobody had better mess with the settings.But that's not what HDS is trying for...they may need to rethink a couple of things if they want rise above the rest.2.5 stars for an average hot dog, mediocre service and the odd ambiance...and I just don't round up...esp. after a trip to the MVD...sadly.

Review Text :
You don't usually think "high tea" when you think of Vegas. You think of showgirls, slot machines & douchbags (at least I do), but since experiencing Mandarin Oriental's Tea Lounge on the 23rd floor of the hotel, Vegas to me now means an afternoon of finger sandwiches & pots of tea. $40 per person buys you a comfy couch with a to-die-for view of The Strip, four finger sandwiches, your own pot of tea, two scones, five mini desserts & this strawberry-chocolate preserve that I could have drank like water. Portions are deceptively petite; you will leave stuffed (especially if you take advantage of their "want seconds? have it!" policy.)Service was phenomenal; so polite & refined & demure. Sidenotes:1) Comedian Louie Anderson was having high tea there. If it's good enough for him, surely it's good enough for you.2) I ordered a lychee green tea, which was light & refreshing but my companion's "Nutcracker" tea (black with hazelnut & vanilla flavors) was so bold, sweet & delicious--I highly recommend it if you like sweet instead of floral.3) Everything was delicious. It wasn't just about presentation here (unlike other high tea joints); the tiny bites were exceptionally tasty.I can drink tea anytime of the day and feel there aren't enough places that have quality tea let alone have a setting to sit and enjoy tea.I didn't notice til later that the pots are Teavana, but I thought in my head that a few sounds like some I have had from there. They probably are special blends for Mandarin since looking the names up popped up empty. The pu-erh is decent, but it's an earth based tea that isn't for everyone. The service was friendly and unobtrusive in passing by to pour tea.I try French macarons at every venue possible and excited to find that they are served here. Ggreen tea macaron ,I must! Though it was a well made macaron (a sad rarity of LV), I don't think it's worth going up there to get $2 smallish ones when the craving hits. If I'm here for tea, yes, but I rather take home palm sized Bouchon ones. Still, I'm happy to find one other place with decent macarons.  This isn't perfect a venue, but I get that this isn't a tea town. Stowing it into a lobbys excess space makes sense though it could use a little bit more partition. The decor felt upscale enough, but could use a bit more comfort in the padding. Tea is meant for relaxation, but it definitely was a bit library so don't come here to do private talk since you'll probably be heard. After a night of partying, a busy relay at the buffets or just tired feet needing a break somewhere, this is a good place to take in a view and sip peace of mind.This is a review of the afternoon tea service - this time with only 2 people instead of 6 the last time.The Skinny: Although a beautiful view, the uncomfortable seating, misses with the food and tea made this place a (3) Service: a little on the slow side, the service was only so-so (3), Value: now only 1 refill of the petit fours, scones and sammys... boo! (3)After a lazy Sunday morning, I decided to treat the hubby to a relaxing afternoon tea at 3 pm. When you're making reservations for 2 people, it's relatively a breeze with Opentable.com compared to my large group experience.There are very few places that serve afternoon tea on the Strip. The Mandarin Oriental gets bonus points because it may be the only one on the Strip that offers spectacular views, operates every day of the week AND won't leave you smelling like you've been cavorting around the casino all day (ie, not smokey!).For our little tete-a-tete, we both ordered the classic afternoon tea set ($40 per person, choice of loose leaf tea, 1 refill each of scones, sandwiches, and petit fours). After being spoiled by the Pennisula in Chicago, their tea service is okay in my books. Pet peeve - I didn't like the fact that their loose leaf tea was served without tea leaves in the teapot. And while my jasmine white pearl tea was quite nice, the matcha tea was overly mild and lacked flavour.There were some issues with the food. The sandwiches had quite nice fillings especially the curried chicken sandwiches (admittedly the ham sammys were a little on the unoriginal side). Unfortunately, the bread was a little too dry which detracted from the overall experience. Scones, served appropriately warm, were a little too mushy on the inside while the devonshire cream lacked that buttery, custardy aroma. The homemade preserves of blueberry and mixed berry were ho-hum and didn't offer something exciting (the fig jam at the previous event was much more intriguing and delicious!).Finally, the petit fours tray. The only dessert I wouldn't have minded a second taste was the almond/marzipan macaroon. Slightly chewy, the almond paste really knocked that cookie out of the park for me. The opera cake chocolate ganache tart and matcha financier were texturally a little dry. The chocolate/caramel tart was overly sweet.The service, considering how much you are paying for an afternoon tea here, was okay but not spectacular. Our server took a long time to bring out our tea and didn't refill our glasses of water. She also forgot to bring out refills of our condiments.Overall, despite it's shortcomings, it was a pleasant afternoon experience and deserves a 3-starred review.During my recent trip to Vegas over the Christmas holiday, my best friend and I decided to visit the Mandarin Oriental Tea Lounge for a relaxing late afternoon away from the fanny packs and liquor slushies. I'll start with the good...The hotel itself is very chic as is the Tea Lounge. Beautiful Asian decor with a view of the strip you could find on a postcard in a hotel gift shop. A clean and upscale environment but without a pretentious air that frequent accompanies "high tea".  The hostesses were elegantly dressed and had us seated almost instantly.In terms of food, I was impressed with the spread. The scones were delicious especially when accompanied by strawberry rhubarb compote and clotted cream. The selection of tea was lovely. My favorite being the matcha. Now, the bad...The sandwich selection they offer includes a curried chicken salad, which contains nuts. However, nowhere on the menu did it specify the use of nuts in any of the offerings. The waitress also gave an extremely detailed run down of the types of sandwiches, scone toppings, and desserts yet failed to mention nuts being in any of the food aside from a pistachio cake. For the record, I am deathly allergic to peanuts and cashews to the point that I carry around multiple Epi pens in my purse everywhere I go. When I bit into the sandwich, I started to feel sick and I took a closer look, only to see a small piece of nut that I couldn't identify off the bat. When I flagged down a waitress to ask about what kind of nuts were in the items, she panicked and left to ask the chef. When she returned, she kept firmly insisting that I was fine because it was "just walnuts" but ANYONE who knows ANYTHING about nuts knows that almost all tree nuts are processed in the same facilities. When I tried to ask about nuts being in any of the other desserts, she acted annoyed to be bothered by me again. I was appalled by how it was handled and I felt ill for the remainder of the day because of that ONE bite of sandwich. I was almost offended to see that they automatically included 18% gratuity to the bill because I would have left $0 if given the opportunity.I admit it was irresponsible on my part not to ask but the waitress had given such a precise account of ingredients used in other items (ie: eggnog truffles, bubblegum flavored French macarons, black forest ham sandwiches etc.) that I thought I was in the clear. I suppose it was my error to expect such a highly regarded establishment would care about their customer's dietary restrictions. I REALLY REALLY REALLY don't enjoy writing bad reviews (as you can tell from my profile) but it's necessary in this case to warn other people with severe nut allergies! I'm lucky that all I left with was a bad stomach ache. I really hope in the future the Mandarin Tea Lounge is more consequent of their patrons' needs.With the exception of a check-in snafu caused by the very "green" & inexperieced hostess, I'd have to say I had a pretty good experience at the tea lounge at the Mandarin Oriental.  I just have one point of advice, check your reservation with the hostess at least three times. By then, it may sink in for her.Ok, let's carry on shall we?Located adjacent to registration above the 23rd floor, you'd think the Tea Lounge was part of the lobby. But make no mistake, these premium seats come at a lofty price tag and a reservation to boot.  Luckily, we were seated by the panoramic window as I requested and service, albeit a bit slow, was paced nicely and lent to the whole relaxing afternoon tea experience.  With that in mind, the tea selection was fairly limited but adequate for my needs. There were a host of green teas and herbal teas to accommodate most individual preferences and tastes IMO. Since I just arrived from a massage session, I went with the introspective herbal relaxation tea. The tea service runs from 2-5 pm daily and reservations are highly recommended as there are only a few tables in the lounge.  The views can be quite spectacular if you're seated by the window. We had a perfect view of the strip and City Center and the natural lighting was equally relaxing and calming.  The food selections included a selection of finger sandwiches inspired by English afternoon "high tea" traditions, but where was the cucumber cream cheese?In any case, the selections included a savory smoked salmon cucumber and watercress spread sandwich (my favorite of the bunch) egg salad & chives on brioche, curried chicken salad, and black forest ham. The tea service also included the best scones I've ever had in my life! These were buttery, light, flaky and irresistibly good. They came out nice and warm, served with some fresh berry jam, marmalade and an imported Devonshire clotted cream (extremely smooth and very addictive.) So addictive, in fact,  I found myself wanting to spread it on practically everything!  Lastly, our afternoon tea service was completed with a selection of small bite sized desserts and pastries, which included macarons, tarts and chocolates.By the end of the meal, I felt nicely sated and totally relaxed. I would definitely return on my next trip to Vegas but im going to have to put that hostess on check!Happy Eats!WHO: Bring your boyfriends, girlfriends, nieces, and mamas for an amazing Tea Time!WHERE: Located at the top of the Mandarin Oriental in the City Center. WHEN: They are open from 10am-10pm, but Tea Service is from 2-5pm daily.WHAT: In all of my 24 years of being alive, I have never gotten the pleasure of having a TEA PARTY. So apparently my friend loves having tea parties, and decided to make reservations for my first tea party EVER! As we walked towards the Mandarin Oriental, went inside and sat in the elevator rising up towards the Tea Lounge, my heart skipped 10 beats due to excitement. I was definitely an excited girl that day!We were seated by the window overlooking the strip (that day they had part of the strip closed off for a while because the Nascar were doing a pre-show... Randomly we got to see the Nascar drift and all that jazz! Lol). Mary Anne was our server, and she actually recognized my friend since he comes here so much, Lol. He is definitely popular! Hahaha! She was such a sweetheart and explained the new temporary additions to the menu for winter. We ended up getting the Classic English Afternoon Tea set up, which came with several wonderful snacks and the choice of any tea in the menu.I chose the Lychee Organic Green Tea, and my friend chose the Peach Tea, which were both very calm and soothing! Mary Anne brought us honey and milk for our tea, along with our small little treats!About the treats, they were all really amazing, but I never knew how much the scones at starbucks and any other coffee shop were INCOMPARABLE to their scones here! They were fresh out of the over, and tasted absolutely WONDERFUL with the jellies they brought out!! I NEED MORE SCONES!!TREATS:Smoked salmon & cucumber with watercress spread- YES!Creamy deviled egg in a shell with Paleta Iberico & lavashTartlet of mango with foie gras mousse & spice bread crisp- YES!Black forest ham sandwich- YES!Signature scones with imported Devonshire clotted cream and Chef Philippe's house made marmalades and jams- YES!Random assortment of Tea pastries- YES!The rest of the goodies were on point! I ordered an extra Passion Fruit Macaron... BEST I'VE EVER HAD! They change some of the treats every 2 weeks to a month, so I will definitely come back next month! YES!!RANDOM NOTE: Make reservations just incase! =)I wish and hope you all have the experience of your first Tea Party! PINKY'S UP!The fanciest Afternoon Tea i've had so far!Awesome view-= can see the strip from the 23rd floor of the Mandarin Oriental hotel near the Aria and Vdara Hotels. We came to our reservation a bit early and luckily being the first ones there, we got the best seat in the house, on a couch right in front of the windows! The lounge is not very big and it's right next to the check in desk lobby, so it's not a ideal place to come with a big group. Three of us got the Classic English Afternoon tea set at $36.00. Tea service is daily 2-5pm. You get a choice of tea, 4 tea sandwiches (smoked salmon, egg salad, curried chicken salad sandwich, and black forest ham), 2 small scones served with a very thick cream cheese like Devonshire Cream, pineapple marmalade and strawberry jam, and a selection of petit desserts. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mandarin-oriental-tea-lounge-las-vegas?select=7s7p5TgVV9CTlWjWQMcgtQ#7s7p5TgVV9CTlWjWQMcgtQPresentation was superb. Although everything was petit, i thought it was very filling. The sandwiches were yummy. (They are flexible with the sandwiches if you have food restrictions). I didn't love the salmon one, as it had a strong herby flavor. The teas were my least favorite. From the last 4-5 afternoon tea experiences, I have loved my tropical black tea choices. When i saw mandarin orange black tea, i was excited. However, when i drank it, it has a strong chinese herbal flavor to it, which i wasn't expecting and kind of clashed with the sweet desserts and sandwiches in my taste... We tried the monkey picked oolong and white tea, and none of them really had us craving to have more. Despite not loving the tea flavors, the experience was great and we enjoyed the view. The lounge itself is pretty gorgeous with all the colors. Check it: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mandarin-oriental-tea-lounge-las-vegas?select=65joKJBgDCMDFsAg-wahcA#65joKJBgDCMDFsAg-wahcADisappointed. Ordered the preset package. The tea is served in a clear pot. Was cheap looking and not even half full.  It wasn't hot enough either.   The rum cake was absolutely awful in smell taste and texture.  Only 3 items were decent, the scone, deviled egg and the hazelnut tart.  I like the pineapple jam and clotted cream. It was a good thing we only ordered one set for the both of us.  We would have ordered another pot of tea but we were so turned of by the food items.  I've had better afternoon tea elsewhere for cheaper even.I've always been a sucker for finger sandwiches. Perfectly cut and how aesthetically appealing to the eye, it really pleases my OCD :) I have been to High Tea at Petrossian as well as Four Seasons, and had been looking forward to trying MO version, since only passing by the area, the view alone was worth a trip back. Served daily from 1p-5p, we had made a reservation not knowing how busy they get, upon arriving, there were a few open tables, but ours was right up against the window and offered amazing views from the 23rd floor. Looking over the tea menu, I chose the Organic Lychee Green and my friend chose the Mandarin Orange Blend. Neither one of these teas were anything special, I've had better tea at Starbucks, and I think Paymon's Mediterranean Cafe has a WAY better tea selection. The tower of food followed, and after a brief explanation from our waitress, we dove in. Starting with the creamy deviled egg (in a shell) with Paleta Iberico & lavash. This was the best deviled egg I've ever had, and I love how it as served in the shell. Up next was the smoked salmon & cucumber with watercress spread. This was my second favorite. Black Forest ham sandwich and the goat cheese tartlet with apricot jelly rounded out our savory portion, but the last two didn't impress me. The dessert plate was made of a selection of the assorted pastries, and the only one I really liked was the Yuzu shortbread. The others were way too sweet, a lemon chocolate cake pop, a rum cake cannelle  a blueberry creme puff.The scones were probably one of the best I've had, but I love clotted cream, so smother any kind of biscuit with clotted cream and jam and you can't go wrong. For $90 for two people (they do auto-grat), I just can't recommend this. It was okay, but nothing spectacular.Compared to Clipper Lounge in MO Hong Kong and Mo Bar in Landmark MO Hong Kong, Tea Lounge in MO Las Vegas had room in improvement. Why did I give Tea Lounge three stars? 1) The view was spectacular - My friend and I were able to see Aria and Cosmopolitan from the lounge.2) The service was good for Vegas standard  - Since I am allergic to melons, I requested to only have berries in my fruit platter. The waiter quickly fulfilled my request.3) The food was decent - Both my apple juice and my fruit platter were fresh.What could Tea Lounge do to get my other two stars?1) Easy access to reservation - Since I was not able to make a reservation via Opentable, I called MO and was transferred four times before I was able to make my reservation. 2) Increase the quality of the service - The waiter forgot my request for hot water. I had to remind her for it. It also took her a long time to stop by our table for the check. 3) Improve the quality of the food - My matcha latte with soy milk barely had any green tea flavor. At the same time, my friend's Danish was relatively bland. The pastries do not seem to be on par with those in MO HK and Landmark MO HK. Despite of these minor flaws, Mandarin Oriental Tea Lounge is my favorite place for high tea in Vegas due to its tranquil atmosphere. I hope that the quality of the food and the service would meet the five star standard during my next visit.Quick Takeaway:Enjoy an upscale tea party with pastries and finger sandwiches. You'll get to sip your tea and munch on  treats on the 23rd floor of the Mandarin. Relax, unwind and soak in sweeping views of the fabulous Las Vegas strip. Reservations?Yes. Go ahead and make reservations and request a window seat for your party. I didn't and wish I would've asked for this when I placed my reservations. Worth it? Yes. Come here to chill out, sip some tea and enjoy treats while overlooking the strip with their floor to ceiling windows. My guests and I arrived a bit early and were able to be seated immediately. Their tea selection is ample and we all truly enjoyed ourselves. I would recommend this for those seeking solitude from the Vegas chaos. It would also be nice for a group of friends looking for a unique and relaxing environment to catch up. Where:Make your way to the elevator and head up to the 23rd floor of the Mandarin Oriental Hotel. Service: This was the only misstep of our visit. I would expect more for the venue. Overall, it was a bit slow and we had to flag down our waitress for various items on multiple occasions. She was friendly and pleasant during our interactions. They automatically bill gratuity and I felt they didn't have enough servers for the room. I would rate service 3 out of 5 stars. Overall:This was my first time experiencing an afternoon tea and it was treat to enjoy it here. The lounge itself was smaller than I anticipated but we still enjoyed ourselves. My 2 guests and I enjoyed the "Classic English Afternoon Tea" for $38 per person (note- gratuity that will be automatically added on). The view and atmosphere alone will justify your visit. This "Classic English Afternoon Tea" option included our choice of tea with finger food sandwiches, pastries and scones.  We arrived on empty stomachs and were able to order extra plates of their 'sandwiches' to satisfy our appetites.Made a quick stop at this tea lounge before our brunch at MOzen upstairs, we didn't have a reservation but the friendly host gentleman still seated us, just not the window view seatings. We weren't staying long so it was OK. Very nice tea menu, many flavors to choose from, some cocktails too, tea martini or teatini looked good to me. Ordered lychee green tea and teatini. Huge pot of green tea, I love green tea with honey not sugar, it was a little bitter and very strong. Teatini was very sweet cause it was made with agave, the flavors of the cocktail and green tea were perfectly balanced. Loved it! Our waitress was very attentive and friendly, as all the staffs at Mandarin Oriental, they just provide the best services on earth! After my teatini, we got really hungry and headed out to our brunch. It was a short but pleassant tea time, I liked it a lot. Not sure I will ever do high tea cause I rarely eat carbs, maybe just some green tea or teatini again sometime!Remember when you were a little girl and you'd pretend to have tea parties with your friends, dolls, and stuffed animals?  Well I never did that, but if you did, your adult selves can do a real tea party here!  My expectation at first was a sit down lounge or restaurant, but the area feels like a lobby overlooking the strip.  Not that it's bad.  This area sits between the concierge and the bar on the 23rd floor of the Mandarin Hotel.  Very nice view of the strip. We ordered the Classic English Afternoon Tea, which consists of small decadent and intricate bites and desserts for $38.  I couldn't even tell you what they all were because they were so exquisite.  All were delicious...all of them!  If you're not that hungry, this is shareable between two (2) people, but I'd recommend ordering your own.  They were very good.  Included with the Classic English Afternoon Tea is a pot of loose leaf tea.  I believe we got the orange one.  I'd come back for the views and for friends and family who are feeling adventurous and want to do something different on the strip.  Great experience!After dropping your car off with valet, hop on the elevator to get here. Be wowed by the great view of the Strip. Fine tea set on your table.On the menu: Classic English Afternoon Tea, Children's Afternoon Tea (for kids 12 and under), champagne selections, and tea selections.Classic English Afternoon Tea:Smoked salmon and cucumber with watercress spread.Curry chicken, sesame cone and lemon grass Asian pear.Goat cheese tartlet with apricot jelly, dried fruits and spice bread crisp.Black Forest ham sandwich.Scones with clotted cream, mango and raspberry jams.Assorted pastries.Everything was dainty and delicious. The most memorable ones for me were the Smoked salmon, goat cheese tartlet, scones especially with the clotted cream and mango marmalade, and the chocolate hazelnut pastry. For my tea, I chose Jasmine Green Oolong. It was floral and lightly fragrant.If you want Gong Fu Cha service, you have to give them a 24-hour notice and you have to have a minimum of 3 people.This was a nice way to enjoy an afternoon at leisure.What a great experience! Came in here on Sunday afternoon and enjoyed the Afternoon Tea special. For $45.00 you receive 3 plates of assorted scones, finger sandwiches and desserts plus a large pot of tea of your choice. We chose the Winter Blend, it tasted like chocolate mint. We added a touch of honey and it was simply perfection. As you can see from the numerous photos they gave breath taking views and decor I'd die for. We were lucky enough to be seated relatively close to the window on a very comfortable couch. The scones were by far our favorite item food wise, specifically the lemon cranberry. I have a severe nut allergy and they were extremely accomidating. Our service was impeccable as well. We will be coming in far more often, the only thing I'm upset about is not coming in sooner!

Review Text :
Shula's tries to combine upscale steakhouse with football to disastrous (though frequently hilarious) results.They take you on a "tour" before seating you, showing you a replica Lombardi trophy and telling you all about the '72 Dolphins undefeated season. I found it especially hysterical the hostess took extra care to point out this trophy is a replica. You mean the real Lombardi trophy isn't kept at a steakhouse inside a shitty Indian casino in Chandler, AZ???? Shocking. Equally entertaining was how the hostess kept droning on about the '72 Dolphins long after we made it clear we didn't care. Um lady? It's just me and 2 female coworkers. We're all hungry and none of us give a shit about the '72 Dolphins. Apparently we were also supposed to be impressed by the black-and-white pictures of the '72 Dolphins on the walls. Oooh, black-and-white pictures, how artsy. Someone took a couple photography classes at community college.After concluding that fascinating "tour" we were finally taken to our table. We were all exchanging "that was weird" looks when the waitress handed us our drink menus and explained the steak menu was painted on the football she was carrying. I know what you're thinking, and the answer is yes, it was a regulation sized football and yes, it was hand painted. She made sure to mention this last fact twice. I mean, what kind of upscale steakhouse would it be if its steak menu was painted on a football by a... MACHINE??? Pish posh.Anyway, that's when things went from amusing to "I will never set foot in this restaurant again." The hostess puts the football on a tee and sets it down RIGHT ON MY COWORKER'S PLATE. Gross. I wish I had taken a picture cuz the look on her face was PRICELESS. The waitress seemed shocked and somewhat offended she asked for another plate. The nerve!!!And this, my friends, was the straw that broke the proverbial '72 Dolphins back. I can handle being bored to death by an over-enthusiastic hostess. I can handle my menus hand painted on footballs. But if you have the nerve to charge $50-60 for a steak as this supposedly "upscale" steakhouse does, I will not tolerate a dirty football on my plate nor being treated like asking for a clean plate is an outrageous request.We left without even drinking our waters

Restaurant name  Beso Steakhouse

Review Text :
Beso Off  is the best way to put it. A restaurant that needs to be shuttered - and in a city where there are many other choices, most likely will not continue to survive as the place does not seem to really care about the issues with the restaurant.And cheap food  - as in quality, not price. Or, the head chef is just way too enamored with salt, which is usually used to hide the cheap flavoring of sub-par steaks, especially the way that they slather it on everything.So, this is a cluster beyond clusters. We came here for a business dinner because the Los Angeles location has good reviews. Big mistake.The wait, etc was not bad. We made a reservations, they sat us when we had more than 50 percent of our party there. The wait staff - Craig and Angie - were super nice, very charming and had more common sense than the assistant manager on duty, Chad Jahn. Yep, totally using the full name.So, let's start with the cluster:A) Fire in the kitchen (grease fire) that made the whole place smoky. The grill is right there, so you can "see" them cooking steaks. Big whoop, sorta cool, but OBVIOUSLY too small for a restaurant of the size. And, apparently, the back kitchen is just as bad.B) Our salads/soups come out fine - nothing spectacular, but not terrible - and then we wait for the steaks. And wait. And wait. Oh, by the way, it's only 8.30 when we sit down but they're already out of the bone-in filet which the waiter talked up. How do you run out of a steak by 8.30 PM? Kitchen incompetence??C) We're still waiting for our steaks. It's a good 45 minutes post-finishing our salads and appetizers. We're still waiting. And still waiting.D) Angie and Craig are proactive, and good wait staff; they come up to us and apologize about the wait. It's not their fault - the kitchen is run by incompetents, but they do their job and do it well. E) The steaks come out ... medium rare. Not the medium that was ordered but the medium rare. We send them back, and one comes back ... charred on the outside, but still rare/medium rare. He's too nice to send it back, and the issue is that the kitchen is backed up so just sending out steaks. Good way to settle a problem with an incompetent kitchen staff: send out undercooked meat and hope they don't send it back to cause more setback in the kitchen. Idiots.F) I ask for the manager - the man with no freakin' sense to come to our table. This would be Chad Jahn, who looks like a former bouncer that has been elevated to restaurant manger. Demote him back to bouncer, that's what he seems he'd be good at. We talk to him, tell him the issues ... and he never checks up on us again. Good management skills, asshat!! Oh, and he doesn't acknowledge our issues when we leave. He did take care of the bill, but I think he had to be told to do that (I told him we're getting free desserts). G) I got churros. I like churros. The churros at Costco are better than Beso. Um, useless kitchen staff, churros are served hot. H) So, while walking outside with the colleague for her to smoke, we pass by former colleagues and they ask how it went. We told them it sucked, to leave. There was this long-haired guy listening to us. I'd noticed him for a bit walking around, so I said "are you one of the owners" and he said, no, he's just waiting for a friend. Um, found out he is one of the owners. If, as an owner, you cannot take responsibility for your poor service and food, the restaurant as a whole are doomed. Nice sidestepping and not taking ownership, long-haired 80's rocker looking dude!! His (or Chad's) solution to the fire and the wait was to offer free Sangria. Thanks, and those that don't drink thank you also. Idiots.I) Like I noted, the food was salty. The steaks had a salt layer that should not be necessary if they are really Harris Ranch. The string beans, mushrooms and other vegetables were slathered with salt as well. Salt is a lazy additive for poor quality and tasting food. Draw your own conclusions here. We got out of there 3 1/2 hours later, when it should have been 1 1/2 hour dinner. It's not because we were socializing, but because it was just waiting and waiting and waiting and then sending back food and waiting. The place is a train wreck rapped up in hipster clothing (well, like most things hipster) and the management (and owner) seem unable to manage or take ownership of the problems and issues. Good riddance for when it shuts down (the chef should not be a head chef), but our wait staff rocked and should be at a better place.Eva Longoria Parker should be ashamed her name is associated with this place. But, it might not be that long before others force it out. I heard Mastro's is opening in Vegas...Update: Yay!  A fake review posted by an employee or PR person for the restaurant!! Thanks Megan!We were staying at Aria and we decided to have dinner at Beso.  I love Eva Longoria's restaurant in Cali and so I had high expectations for Beso.  The booths are nice and comfy but the service leaves a lot to be desired.  My filet steak was just average and the prices are very high,  cocktails started at $14 and up.  We had an app of guac and chips and that was below average.  As I mentioned I love Eva's restaurant in Cal but I was disappointed in Beso at City Center.I went to Beso for my friend's bachelorette party with a group of ladies and we were told that dinner was complimentary and all we had to do is to leave tips for the server, which was $10/person.  I thought it was really nice of them to comp our dinner, especially with 9 ladies all together.It all began with champagne.  When the first server (very nice) started to serve champagne to us, she had run out of it after 3 glasses.  She then opened another bottle and continued pouring.  Another female server rushed over and asked: why did you open another bottle for them and then whispered something to the first server.5 minutes later, another server came to us and told us that our dinner included appetizer, tossed salad, steak, and a bed of mashed potatoes, which sounded amazing, right? Not even close.We got  2 tiny servings of guacamole with a very light portion of tortilla chips, and I think the chef forgot to season it with, you know, salt, onion, and whatever recipe it calls for.  0 star.The steak was a joke.  It had no flavor, overcooked, and lukewarm.  There were literally 8 pre-cut pieces of steak for 9 people, with a bed of mashed potatoes.  The mashed potatoes was the best part of the meal, but then again, all of us shared a one person meal.  I would have been fine to pay the $10 tips if the service was good, but we had to call 4 different servers to get some iced water, after we had already waited 10 minutes.  So we paid $90 for this crappy meal.  Was it worth it?  I'd rather give a homeless guy my $10 then spending it at Beso.This place has gone off the deep end.  It used to be my favorite steakhouse in all of LV, but it has gone so far downhill i'll never eat here again.It was our servers first day, and I'm more than willing to cut a new server some slack, but what happened was ridiculous.For entree I ordered the filet which was cooked well but tastes nowhere near what their steaks tasted like 2 years ago when I frequently ate there.  I asked the waiter to add a lobster TAIL to the steak.When the food came out, the waiter brought our steaks, and a WHOLE lobster.  I asked another server to get ours because we ordered a tail and not the whole lobster.About 5 minutes later our server came over and tried to tell me that what was on the table WAS a lobster tail. Funny - i've never seen a lobster tail with claws, legs, and a body before.My friend and I were already into our steaks when he took the whole lobster away and said he would look into it.15 mins later he comes back - still no lobster tail, and I was almost done with my steak and we were in a rush so I told him to just forget the tail if it was gonna take longer.Then he disappears for another 15 mins.  I asked another server to please grab him and he came out and I asked for the check.Another 10 minutes goes by and so we walked in to see if the check was ready and what was taking so long. (we ate outside)The manager was adjusting the bill - and this is what REALLY pissed me off.The manager says "since you ordered the whole lobster and then cancelled it and then ordered the tail and then cancelled it Im charging you for the tail.I said - "No - I ordered just a tail to begin with"  He says "No you didn't my server told me you ordered the whole lobster.  I trust my server"And wanted to stand there and argue with me about it telling me I was lying about ordering just the lobster tail.I told him I was almost done with my meal and the tail still wasn't there which was why I cancelled it.He didn't want to hear any of it, and got a really smug attitude with me.At no other nice restaurant on the Vegas  strip will you see this sort of treatment of a customer.  He stood there blatantly calling me a liar right to my face, when both my friend and I tried to tell him the server was the one who fucked up.  Not me.This place went from penthouse to outhouse.  From the management, to the wait staff, to the food. I'll never eat here again.

Cheap, yes. But nasty. Dull flavors, beyond cheap ingredients. There's veg fare to be gotten here, but so much better on almost every other corner in this part of town.Kind of amazing to me that even tho they're smack dab in the middle of Burrito Way that they continue to do business - hit Maria's around lunchtime and you'll find the explanation: mostly gringos, slurping up the watered down salsa, ordering the 5 dollar lunch special and leaving 1 dollar tips. No, gracias.

Walking by the restaurant, we peeked at the menu and the unique items on there caught our interest, so we popped in for a bite.  There's a lot of interesting combinations of Asian, Mexican, American, Italian style food on the menu.  After a few minutes, we decided to order:Edamame, $4.99http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tAEKCC7h9h9A79SfYx0Prg?select=dQv6EXMRrGXzekKHPrWCBQ#dQv6EXMRrGXzekKHPrWCBQPotstickers, $7.99http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tAEKCC7h9h9A79SfYx0Prg?select=IujYeFio8lXyFxtXlS7aZQ#IujYeFio8lXyFxtXlS7aZQFirecracker Chicken with Broccoli, $11.99 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tAEKCC7h9h9A79SfYx0Prg?select=TNdXgXqP1vHHewqCcS5CDQ#TNdXgXqP1vHHewqCcS5CDQMeatloaf Sliders, $11.99http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tAEKCC7h9h9A79SfYx0Prg?select=Nnk3lac4Z-WL2PadKfHXlQ#Nnk3lac4Z-WL2PadKfHXlQGarlic Parmesan Fries (Came with the Sliders)http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tAEKCC7h9h9A79SfYx0Prg?select=5L5xBaNpKxIVuF7iv3g4rw#5L5xBaNpKxIVuF7iv3g4rwThe food came out pretty fast.  The Edamame was very good, The Potstickers were delish.  The Meatloaf Sliders was the one that I was most interested in, but it came up short.  The Meatloaf was a little bland, lacked a full flavor that I was expecting.  The Garlic Parmesan Fries were very good and full of flavor.  The best item though was the Firecracker Chicken w/Broccoli....nice Spicy flavor and the Sauce that the Chicken was cooked in complimented the dish well.Overall, it was a decent experience.  There are many more items on the menu I'd like to try.Return Factor - 87%

"Pinay ako!" That's the Filipino/Tagalog phrase for "I'm a Filipina." When I saw this place had Hello Kitty stickers with "Pinay ako" on their wall, I had a feeling this was a good place. (Hehe, I tend to like places with Hello Kitty...who would have thought ;). Anyways my first instinct was right because Kusina ni Loraine is great! They have a buffet filled with lots of Filipino food! If you've never ever had Filipino food ever, this would be the place to try it out! They have traditional favorites like Filipino pork bbq, beef steak, kare kare (Filipino peanut butter stew), sisig (sour fried pork) and pancit (noodles). . They also have items you don't see often at a Filipino buffet like fried chicken skin, chicken curry, picadillo (ground beef with potatoes) and molo soup (dumpling soup with noodles).  It's a great selection of savory eats and tasty treats! I really liked that I got a little taste of all of my favorite Filipino food here! There's nothing like eating a fulfilling meal of white rice topped with kare kare sauce and pairing it with pork bbq sticks! Yum!Aside from the savory offerings, Kusina ni Lorraine also has some desserts. They have a fruit bar with grapes, cantaloupes and honey dew. The day I went they also offered a yummy Filipino dessert via ginataang totong (coconut dessert with mung beans). The ginataang totong was sweet and very good. It is like eating rice pudding.The buffet here is $7.99. You can pay another $1.50 for the soda.They also offer other treats here for an extra price like turon (banana eggroll), 3 for $2 and Filipino ice cream popsicles and ice cream drumsticks, $1.50-$1.99 each. They also sell a variety of different chichirya or Filipino snacks via chips, crackers and other goodies! (Oh and  they sell non food items like the  cool Filipino stickers with the Hello Kitty I mentioned earlier ;) and Filipino clothing)Kusina ni Lorraine is a great place to try different Filipino food! Whether you are looking to eat a traditional meal or a light snack, you can find it here! I have found my new place for Filipino food in Vegas! Pinay ako and I love good Filipino food!

Review Text :
This is a fun family owned restaurant to go check out and the food is pretty tasty as well. Reminds me of going to the swap meet or one of those local food markets and getting some fry bread for a treat.Always used to get the standard fry bread with powdered sugar and just recently realized they make them with all sorts of goodies sprinkled on top or stuffed inside. Not sure how healthy these puppies are but who cares when you are craving one or two and just can't resist.Ordered the Chili Beef Combo Taco on my first visit and was not disappointed. Came back later in the week and tried both the Red & Green Chili Stew. Used a side of Fry Bread to sop it up all the gravy. The flavors are very nice and there is some spicy heat to make your mouth wanting more.Next my wife goes out of town and I was feeling lazy. No kidding. Stopped in and picked up two containers of both Red Chili and Green Chile Taco meat - To Go. Just warmed up some tortillas and applied some meat and ate like a champ for the next couple nights.Service is counter style and there is plenty of room inside for larger groups. Looking forward to trying out some of their fancy sweet choices on my next visit. As Arnold says in his movies ... I'LL BE BACK!4.25 STARSFor me it's the simple things.  The simple things done very well.  And employees who actually, genuinely seem happy to see customers.  Imagine that.  (Take note Sprouts employees...you grouchy fockers).  I was the only person in the joint today around 11:30 and got myself a ground beef taco, a Coke, and a cinnamon and sugar fry bread for dessert.  I LOVED that the young man working the register asked me if I'd like to get the cinn & sug fry bread a little later.  Why yes I would!  For 2 reasons.  If you give it to me with my taco, I will eat all of it first and the taco will get cold.  Second, I made myself eat about a third of the taco, enjoying every bite, and saving room for my dessert, which was warm and cinnamoney and sugary and delicious!  Delicious is the word of the day for this place.  I enjoyed every aspect of my meal, and I was glad to see the place start to fill up as I was leaving.  I will try to be more adventurous next time and get something with stronger flavors, but I LOVE simple beef tacos.  For me they are comfort food, and this was a great one.  Go check them out if you haven't!

Love this location.....there is a small group of friends who meet for lunch at this location a few times a year.  We enjoy it because it's close the Strip, where most of the group works.  We also like how it's less busy than the Summerlin Location....at least during lunch hour mid-week.During my most recent visit, I had a 1/3 Burger with Cheese and Fries & Drink ($9.99).  It takes a few minutes for your Burger to be prepared, but it's worth the wait and not nearly as long as Fatburger.  The Burger was made to my specifications (medium).  I loaded it with Jalapenos, Onions, and melted Jalapeno Cheese....yum!The employees are always friendly and greet everyone as they walk up to place an order.  Overall, a solid place to grab a quick bite to eat.Return Factor - 95%

Review Text :
Hit up Modern Burger with Jason W. and Deb S. yesterday. I totally think this needs a separate designation from Modern Steak as it's quite different and for what it is, it's good...It's basically a window in the side of Sam Fox's new place, Modern Steak. I think they do a couple of salads but I really didn't pay too much attention. We were there for the sliders. They are....uh, basically....awesome! Two sliders of fresh ground beef, a house made bun (crazy foccacia looking one), American cheese, grilled onions, 1000 island & iceberg lettuce.  I'm hot & cold on Fox spots but I'm in love with Modern Burger's sliders. The beef was awesome. Super moist, juicy & flavorful. Cooked in butter??? The rest of the compliments were great. I was particularly impressed with the bun. First of all for some crazy reason, I'm strongly anti-foccacia. This bun looks like foccacia bread (cut square & about the same thickness) but it definitely wasn't. Soft & tasty, it was great sopping up the burger juices & dressing.I also had the yukon gold fries which were good. While they don't jump to the top of my fry list, they're definitely respectable. MB has a few soft drink choices, a bunch of bottled water (sparkling & still) & I saw a bunch of bottles of wine so I'm guessing wines by the glass. (I was pretty much there for the sliders.)  The guys at the window were also quite cool & happy to do soda refills.There were also some interesting looking ice cream sandwiches on the board.While I thought everything was good, the major highlight for me was the sliders. I'd say they're even destination worthy. In addition to stopping over while in the mall, I will even fight the mall parking & crowds for more of those sliders.It's in Fashion Square but is separate from the Modern Steak. Couldn't add the spot with the same address. Kept kicking it out.Scottsdale Fashion Square7014 E. Camelback Rd.Scottsdale AZ 85251P: 480.423.7000My first visit to Modern Burger was yesterday, after treating Mom and myself to happy hour at Marcella's next door.  Before we had apps at Marcella's, we checked out MB's menu, and after spying their list of ice cream sandwiches, I knew what I wanted for dessert!Out of the three ice cream sandwich options (Oatmeal & raisin/Granny Smith ice cream, Peanut butter/Chocolate ice cream, and Chocolate chip/Tahitian vanilla bean), I chose Granny Smith.  I was able to have the MB rep procure a fresher one "from the bin" in the restaurant (for all I know, he just paused for a moment and turned around!).  Whatever.  All I know is that the 2nd ice cream sandwich didn't look as old and compacted as the one he initially offered to me.  The sandwich was so tasty!  Not too sweet, and it was certainly refreshing on a warm, Phoenix spring day!  I liked it so much, I stopped by tonight, two minutes past 6p (MB's closing time), to get another.  (Truthfully, I'd wanted to try their sliders, as well, but it was too late to order those, but ice cream sandwiches she could sell me, the rep said.)  And so I bought.Modern Burger is weird. It's attached to an expensive steakhouse located in a ritzy mall, yet it's seems like it's trying to emulate an in-n-out burger type of experience albiet with slightly higher prices. It's basically a little window you order from, and outside the order window is a couple of hightop counters with benches. It's set up perfectly for eating while people-watching...which let's be honest, is the best thing about going to Scottsdale Fashion Square. It takes a few minutes on average, and you're presented with a couple of sliders. They aren't very big, but unless you've got a raging appetite, they should do the trick...especially if you get an order of fries with them. Each time we've went, the burgers have been cooked to perfection...they're really juicy and flavorful. Nothing fancy...just a straight up burger with all the regular toppings that'll melt in your mouth. There's something to be said about a nicely cooked burger. When you use fresh meat and cook it right...you don't need to get fancy and have exotic toppings. There's just something about these burgers that melts in your mouth...whatever it is...it's got me craving them every couple months if we happen to be at the mall. I wouldn't go out of my way to get one of these burgers, but if you're already at the mall, you're not gonna do any better than Modern Burger for a nice little Mall lunch. It easily beats out all the other Mall food offerings. Worth a try. 3.75/5.10/07/102 stars for the food...Popped over to Modern Steak to have their HH (happy hour) $2 sliders, and instead found that the prices have increased (2 for $6, I believe).  I'd wanted to try their truffle fries, but thought I'd try the fries at Modern Burger first to have something to compare the truffle fries to the next time I visit.  The sliders ($5.75 for two, but I might be wrong) tasted like they did in the past and were the same size as those I had during happy hour.  So why the increase at Modern Steak?  The fries were soggy, and therefore were horrible (to me!), and I wonder if the truffle fries are even worth coming back for, now?  Service was friendly and accomodating, so I'm adding an extra star!

I walked up to the counter and said, "I'll have an Italian Beef, Hot, with provolone and hot Giardiniera, Full Dip"!Lobby (I don't know if that's his name, but he's the owner and the place is called "Lobby's", so...) looked at me, puzzled and said "what part of Chicago are you from"?I know...ending a sentence with a preposition...so authentically Chicago!He was puzzled because my accent ain't exactly South Side...but I've spent a lot of time in Chicago over the years and one of the things that I developed there is a taste for Italian Beef Sandwiches, made just the way they make them at Lobby's...WOW is that good!I was extra fortunate today, because he had just taken 50 lb's. of roast beef out of the oven, to  slice up for my sandwich (well, OK, and other peoples sandwiches, too)...and I got to stand there and snorkel in the aroma as they unwrapped the top of the roasting pans, right on the counter in front of me!The aroma of roast beef, oregano, pepper, onion, garlic...in other words, exactly what you want your roast beef to take a bath in!Lobby makes his own marinade and roasts the beef wet, low and slow in a method that I like to call "nearly perfect"...he is proud of his place and of his food, and it really shows!For me, it always starts and ends with the food itself.Oh sure, I like to be pampered with spectacular service and surroundings as much as the next over-fed, self-absorbed, slightly insecure Brahmin, and the service was good and the place is clean and bright...but it really is about the food.And the food here is remarkable...a simple menu of Beef, Hamburgers and Hot Dogs...done the way that Lobby grew up loving in his hometown of Chicago and done with loving care...the result is a Chicago style food experience that almost can't be matched here in the desert!I do like my sandwiches and I did, would and will go out of my way to drop by Lobby's for their signature item (BTW, notice the name...it isn't Lobby's Burgers and Dog's...make no mistake, the Italian Beef is the big deal here).While there are couple of places around here that make an Italian Beef that comes close to Lobby's, none of them have invited me to smell the wonderful aroma of the beef just as it comes out of the oven and that made Lobby's a 5 star experience today!And for those of you concerned about where my nose has been, well, I keep my nose clean...at least that's what I tell my parole officer.Lobby, Lobby, Lobby you spoiled me.  Your burgers are so good.  I walked in and was instantly warmly greeted at the counter.  The young man took my order with a smile and sense of humor.  I love that!  I ordered a bacon chesse burger with provolone.  When I unwrapped it I knew I had found near perfection.  The burger was on a fresh sesame bun, the bacon was nice and crisp but not over done and the cheese.....oh the cheese.....it was melted over the burger.  9 times out of 10 when you get a cheese burger it looks like they just slapped the cheese on right before they put the rest of the toppings on so it's not melted.  In my mind the cheese should be melted down the sides of the burger, not an afterthought to be slapped on at the last minute.  I took a bite and the burger was juicy and cooked perfectly, just a tiny bit pink inside.  Ahhhh!!  I also got crinkle cut fries and they were perfectly cooked as well and not greasy at all.  Lobby's has a secret sauce....you must get a side of the secret sauce to dip your fries in....YUM!!!  The soda cups are a generous size and free refills are included.  The whole place was clean and well lit.  You can see them cooking too.  Lobby, yes that is his real name, was there running the show and making sure his customers were happy.  I hear the Italian Beef sandwich is to die for so I will try that next.  I'm gonna have to psych myself into it though cause that burger was so darn good!  Thank you Lobby!!!  I'll be back soon!!I read their reviews and the 4.5 star average immediately intrigued me. It takes a lot to earn a 4.5/5 star average on yelp and it made me wonder, it made me ponder and it made me eager to visit immediately to see what all this burger hype was about. While planning an office hours at Lobby's, I spoke to Lobby several times and listened to him explain the attention he gives to his burgers. The incredibly lean meat, the personal attention to each patty, Lobby's commitment to making the patty's from scratch...it sounded like this was a business that was definitely handled with some tender loving care. So the day arrived for me to finally visit Lobby's. The directions indicated that it was in a strip mall. For those of you who might get a little turned around like I do...go towards the grocery store and when you're facing it look to the left and behind you and poof, there's Lobby's! So I walked in and received a friendly welcome from the staff the second my foot entered the store. As I sat there for several hours, I noticed that Lobby and staff treat every customer the same way and each customer gets a personal welcome upon arrival. I also like how they welcome but they don't banter the potential customers to try the food. They let the customer decide for themselves. The decor was retro and cool and I could see the burger and fries being made right in front of me. I glanced at the menu even though I knew that only a burger this visit would do, and I was pleased with the price. Inexpensive. Moving on to the grand finale, the food. I ordered the cheeseburger and upon the staffer's recommendation, I got it with provolone and kept everything on it, especially Lobby's special sauce. The staffer suggested I take some special sauce on the side for my fries and swore by it so I didn't question the man and said OK! The burger and fries arrived and I immediately knew I was in trouble... the gluttony kind. Nestled on a fresh sesame bun and topped with thick and juicy pickles, lettuce, tomato and the special sauce, the patty was cooked to perfection and just the right size. I took one bite and was in cheeseburger paradise and I didn't even have to go to Hawaii! The burger was juicy, full of taste and the meat was lean. The special sauce. Oh my the special sauce. It's not your typical special burger sauce. There was an ingredient in there that made it just the right amount of sweet and perfect for dipping fries. I guess the lesson here is trust the Lobby's staffer! I tried to guess what the ingredients in the special sauce were but Lobby said that nobody has ever been able to guess. So that's a challenge yelpers. Figure out what's in the special sauce and let me know! The fries were crunchy and delicious, but there were a lot of them so if you go with a friend, you might want to share the fries since the burger will fill you up. I can't wait to visit Lobby's again and try the Italian Beef sandwich Donald S was raving about. If it's anything like the burger, I know I'll be in heaven. But in the meantime, I'll just have burgerlicious dreams about the tastiness I experienced with Lobby's Burgers. And now I see why they have such a high rating on yelp. Bravo Lobby!ALERT!  ALERT!  5 STAR BURGER JOINT! GREAT PRICES! FRIENDLY SERVICE!AM I SHOUTING?!  Oh, sorry. I tend to hit "caps lock" when I have headphones on.I had lunch here with my wonderful wife, my youngest daughter and my friend Donald S (not to be confused with Don S...it has happened).Let me just say I was impressed with my burger and fries.  Cheesy fries.  With bacon. Tender and juicy burger.  Done just right.Donald's Italian beef sandwich looked so good I'll be having that the next time I go to Lobby's, which will be soon.  Maybe dinner today.We did chat with the owner, Lobby.  Nice guy, great local business.  Go here.Upon my second visit to Lobby's I tried the Italian Beef Sandwich.  WOW!  Go hungry if you're gonna get this one cause it is HUGE!  And it's really more of a knife and fork sandwich.  Oh sure, you can try to eat it like a sandwich but you're probably going to be picking up a lot of the filling with your fork so just cut it up and get every bite the first time.  The beef is so tender and tasty!  YUM!.  Let me speak about customer service for a moment.  I love being treated like a valued customer.  If I'm going to spend my hard earned cash somewhere I want a smile, willingness to help if I have questions, and getting my order correct. If they do that right then they are tops in my book. The last two weeks I have gone to two establishments that not only did all these things but they remembered me by name!  When I walked into Lobby's for lunch last week I was greated warmly by Lobby himself and he remembered me!  It's been a while since I was last in and I know he sees people all day long and I'm not what I would call particularly memorable.....I mean I don't have tats or pink hair, I'm just your average woman but Lobby goes that extra mile.  He really cares about his business and it shows.  There were some gentleman just finishing off their lunches and he took the time to ask them how it was and listened to their critique of the food.  He did it graciously and asked some questions genuinely wanted to know the answers.  Lobby cares.  His place is still spotless, again, a big plus for me.  When I crave a burger, this is what I crave.  A real beef patty with fresh ingrediants, cheese, and sometimes bacon.  This is by far my favorite burger joint.  Support your locan businesses!!  Especially the ones that go that extra mile and really care!!!No question -- my FAVORITE burger in the valley!I first got turned on to Lobbys at a Yelp Office Hours -- http://www.yelp.com/biz/september-office-hours-at-lobbys-tempe#hrid:kQOElzgklMRbAyWS8LhVFw - - and by my check-ins, you can see i've frequented there since. I've tried a lot of other "great" burgers -- 5 Guys, Smashburger, etc - but IMHO, none of them stack up to the food and the experience at Lobbys. The burgers at Lobbys are so good that I crave them --I want to drive across town or plan out my day so that I'm in the area to get one! I just feel that there's more quality ingredients with a Lobbys burger -- the bun, the taste, the way the cheese melts over the whole patty, the special sauce, and the burger itself. And just as Lynn W says the service is truly superior here and " He (Lobby) really cares about his business and it shows". I've recommended many friends to check out Lobbys and have brought a few friends here -- everyone has loved it! Especially my Chicago friends that live in the valley. Lobbys burgers is that raised bar that I measure all other burger joints to.I think a burger should be grilled on an open flame...none of this flat fried grilling. BUTIf your going to do that start with a nice round ball of meat, squish it down and cook it to order, just like Lobbys does. It was one of the best fried burgers I have had. I would say maybe a tad better then 5 guys. I would get another if ever in the area!Keep up the good work guys!I think it's funny that places like this are creating such a splash in the local food scene. Lobby's excels at being an average burger joint by using high quality, fresh ingredients. It's the kind of place that once was common, but was replaced in the last 20 years by novel and trendy restaurant concepts of other sorts. Or, for a more modern reference, imagine if Fudrucker's got rid of its ambiance and added a Chicago twist with its Italian beef, Polish sausage, and Chicago dogs.Lobby's is very proud of its caramelized onions (apparently, they have a magical way of making a crispy white onion brown and soft). When I asked about getting sauerkraut on a Polish sausage, the owner insisted that he too loves sauerkraut, but the onions are sooooooo much better: "Just look! We grill them right here," he says, pointing at the grill. In other words, they do not offer sauerkraut. And then there's the secret sauce. It's pink! And when offered as a dipping sauce for the otherwise mediocre school-cafeteria-style fries, it's made a little bit spicy with chili powder or something of the sort. Again, total magic!Just so that I don't sound too let down, I will say that the buns make the burgers above average at Lobby's. Good idea not to skimp on the buns. As you walk in, you get the sense that this place should have a drive thru and charge $2-3 per burger, but the burgers are more comparable to pub fare. And apparently people love Lobby's. My three stars are below average, and the owner drives a Mercedes when he's not happily engaging in chit chat with his customers -- they're apparently doing well enough and I would frequent this place if it were in my neighborhood.So if you're ever craving a burger and fries in Tempe, I would say skip the In-N-Out and go here instead. But for hot dogs? Granted, I'll never understand the whole Chicago dog craze, but this place is right near Ted's.... The only way I'm ordering a dog other than Ted's in the area is if it's wrapped in bacon and prepared Sonoran style. Sorry, Lobby's. Also, your onions are pretty much the same as anyone else's caramelized onions. I still want sauerkraut on my Polish sausage.Haven't written a review in a while.  Now's the time.I saw Lobby's from the road for a while as we were going from here to there.  I saw the sign and thought, "Hmmm, burgers,"  The GeoQpons coupon from my iPhone was my incentive to take my family over for lunch.  Cool ambiance here.  The first thing that I caught my eye about Lobby's is the service.  Everybody was friendly and attentive, and we even got a big mound of extra crinkle fries with our burgers--I'm not kidding, the guy just scooped a whole bunch of extra fries on our tray.There ain't nuthin' fancy about these burgers, and that's what makes 'em special.  Simple, fresh, grilled meat, topped any way you like (and believe me, these things can get topped REALLY high).  Fries were simple and tasty.  We left full and happy.  Next time, I might try me a dog or an Italian sandwich--we'll see.  This place rocks.This is the very first time I have ever been here. I had never even heard of it before.  Nestled in a little shopping center that is half empty is Lobby's.I Ordered a regular Cheese burger with fries, Mario got a double.Less than $20.00 for both of us including the tip.What amazed me at first as we waited for our food, was how very sparkling clean the place was, Here they are cooking grease all day and the stainless steel was shiny like The Top of the Chrysler Building!Which means they fully scrub it down every night. When we did get our food it was amazing!!! Yes it was hot, fresh, and oh so good. You could see the meat had no fillers ,the tomato's were a bit unripe but other than that, it was fantastic. I wanted to save a little for the dog (to take home). But, I ate it all.Fries were also really good.  While we were there they had their meat delivery , and guess what ! It is fresh meat that will do home delivery from grain feed cattle. This place is the bomb of the Burger World. It is just as you made it at home. The staff was super good as well, very friendly and always busy.I have been here many times over the years. We came here 2 weeks ago, but It was time for another visit.  Stopped in to pick up an early dinner to go around 3:30pm.Double cheese burger with Provolone and french fries. This is a grat place for a healthy Burger. They meat here is delivered fresh everyday.High price for the burgers but, well worth it, because, the food is great!This is better than what you can make at home.Nice and clean inside, smells good, and looks nice.We will come here again many times. My girlfriend does not even like Burgers, but she loves these.Whenever I bite into a burger I want it to taste exactly like the burgers at Lobbys.   Nuff said.Was dyingggggg for a burger during work one day and I found this place on Yelp. This place is literally down the street from my work so I had to try it out, especially with such good ratings. I ordered the Bacon burger with a side of fries. It wasn't the best burger I ever had but it was pretty good. They have their own special sauce on it as well which is also served with their fries. It actually reminded me of In & Out's sauce. That thousand Island shizz... lol. Their fries are good too. Not too salty or soggy but just right. My co worker ordered the chili cheese fries which I got to try. Holy crap, their portion for this was huge! It was a like a 2 person meal maybe. lol. The pricing wasn't that bad and the staff was really friendly. Plus I got my meal quick! The only thing was I felt like I needed to hit the gym after scarfing everything down. lol. I'll definitely come back when I'm feenin for a burger since it's so close to my work. =)I'll have to agree with Sue C. (ROTD) and other fellow Yelpers when it comes to rating this locally owned Chicago style restaurant. What more can you ask for other than friendly service and a tasty menu of quality food cooked with TLC.It is also nice to have a place that opens earlier than the usually lunch time competition. I start work early and can get hungry rather quickly. This place opens at 10 and is always clean and ready to go. The owner told me this is the Chicago way of doing things. Nice!Love the fact that they use Grass-fed Beef from Iowa in their Burgers. Reminds me of what beef used to taste like back in the days. The Chicago Style Vienna All-Beef Hot Dogs are also very tasty and you can get them with Chili and Cheese when you are in the mood. The Dipped Italian Beef with both types of peppers and some Provolone Cheese is one of my favorites as well.Yes there are cheaper places in town that start with Jimbo or the letter P. You can get more food there for the dollar but the quality can sometimes suffer a great deal. What I like here is that everything taste fresh and they go out of there way to keep it that way. No chili in a can at this restaurant.Located in a strip mall off the road with plenty of place to park. I'll pay extra to get the better quality and special attention. Chicago attitude comes free and is always a treat. Did I mention how big the Chili Cheese Fries were the other day? SHAZAM!4.75 STARSTempe, your secret is out. Lobby's Burgers is de-lic-ious! Dropped in here with my Dude two months back for a quick, definitely not good for you dinner. Tip: It's behind Gold Bar Espresso. Just drive around the building, and BOOM! Lobby's appears.Immaculately clean inside. In fact, it seemed that someone was constantly cleaning the place while we were there. Just one gal working the counter, another cooking, and she was very patient with us as we ordered. I had a Bacon Cheeseburger, lettuce wrapped, and Dude had the Chili Burger. We also tried some of the fries. Pst, split them with a friend, the serving is more than enough!Lobby uses grass-fed beef, and you can certainly taste the difference. The burger had thick slices of pickles, tomatoes, onions, and fresh lettuce with sliced cheddar, bacon, and Lobby's secret sauce.By the way, that sauce makes an awesome dip for the fries. Mmm mmm mmm! This was the best "fast food" burger I've had in ages, and for a great price. Dude wasn't a fan of the chili, but I'm a nice lady friend and shared. I don't know how you could think the mouthful of grease that's In-N-Out is still the "God of the Burger Industry" after eating at Lobby's Burgers. Can't wait to come back and try the rest of the menu!After driving around for ten minutes on the wrong side of the parking lot, the girl and I finally found this hidden gem in Tempe. But I am glad we did.I've been here twice so far and both times the burgers have been great. first time I got the chili burger and the second time I got a bacon burger with mushrooms. Both burgers were great. Good flavor and very fresh toppings. Admittedly I was a little underwhelmed with the chili but it may have been an off night so will give i another try. The fries are great especially with the Lobby's sauce. Both times I've been in the customer service has been excellent and very friendly. I've heard they make really good dogs and sandwiches as well so will definitely have to give them a shot sometime.Thanks to Preston's UYE at Lobbys, I now know the spot for a great burger in Tempe!One of the things I love about Lobby's, its locally owned, and the owner takes pride in his shop!After studying the menu for a minute I went with a cheeseburger & fries and was told to get some of that Lobby Sauce, I also heard that the Italian beef is the bombdiggity, I'll have to try that next time for sure. My burger was perfectly cooked! And it was messy too, but in a good way, everything on the burger tasted fresh too! Great flavor! The fries were delish too! Dip them in the Lobby Sauce and its game over! So good!Glad to have tried Lobby Burger and plan on coming back soon!

Good times with good people. Ryan C Norm R Rand H Mike C We came, we ate, we reviewed. There should be some nice reviews from my fellow Yelper's. We each have our favorites and our dislikes. We all agree, this place was good. I will allow Rand to expand on the # of trays and the various types of food. I had a little bit of everything, except the sushi and some of the exotic seafood. I stuck to the fish and the shrimp. Hot and sour soup was good,but not too hot Dumplings were good Fried Rice was good Spicy Chicken Coconut shrimp Spare ribs Green beans Orange chicken Honey chicken Thin noodles (reminded me of ponciet) Fried fish Fried shrimp Beef and broccoli and some others All the food was good, fresh and had nice variety. They serve real Thrifty Ice cream, which is a nice treat.Had an interesting breakfast today, since my Shanghai Boofay lunch was so early.  MikeC, NormR, RandH, DarenC, and I met up at the place which has recently opened in the carcass of the former original location of China Star Boofay, in the carcass of a former Red Lobster, near 43rd Ave and Bell Rd in North Phoenix.So since there will soon be several thorough reviews from notable Yelpilluminati, I will stick to those areas that are uniquely mine:Greasy~Crispy Spectrum:.-. 4 stars .-.  nothing was too soggy at all, and there was a crispy outside on very many dishes.  Bonus that the terryaki chicken appeared not to have been deep fried but perhaps baked.Discard Pile:.-. 4 stars .-.  i had very little to cut off or spit out (thinking even of the short ribs) and most dishes actually had absolutely zero Discard Pile.  Notable were both the honey and orange chicken, and a nice crisped-up outside on the wontons.McKenna Novelty Factor:.-. 5 stars .-. (here's another category, newly named, for how i judge a boofay, whether it's got the 'same old same old' or it has unique items that you can't get just anywhere)  Shanghai had several items that were pretty novel.  Scoop-it-yer-damn-self Thrifty ice cream in about 8 different flavors.  Sushi bar that included seaweed salad and other acoutrements.  Also of note was what Norm said was called a Dessert Soup, which had a yellowish syrupy looking liquid with a small amount of blanched peanuts and red grapes floating in it, along with what at first apeared to be bits of tripe, like in menudo! Norm later figured out that it was ceylon agar (just think of it as vegan gelatin - it's from seaweed!), and with the server's help, that the small round fruits that looked like small apricots or orange lychee, were in fact a chinese fruit called loquat, we supposed related to the cumquat, every gradeschool boy's favorite thing to call someone as a name, since it's a real fuit and how can you get in trouble for that?RyanC-isms:.-. 3 stars .-.  A few personal favorites were missing, such as bean sprouts and a General tsao-type chicken (the spicy chicken they had wasn't spicy at all, and was mostly jalapeno flavored).  I also wish I could have put some chocolate syrup on my ice cream.  The lone bowl of rainbow sprinkles made me wish for more of a sundae bar, although MikeC seemed to be doing very nicely with the cone(s)!  $7-something for lunch is just allright since it doesn't include the drink.   The decor is comfortable and clean.  The service was excellent, with plates cleared quickly, and friendliness all around.   The nice ladies found answers to our questions and even took our picture, too!The food here, plus the company of the other yelp buffet aficionados (Rand H., Ryan C., Daren C., Mike C.)  made for a really great time. There are quite a number of things I find unusual here for a buffet restaurant. Who wouldn't love a buffet with a selection of *decent*  sushi, made fresh in its own section of the restaurant. To go with that, in the main buffet area they serve  vegetable tempura - again, something not frequently served in Chinese buffets. Baby octopus, seaweed salad, Korean kalbi, crayfish - more items uncommon in buffets. They also have the practice of putting smaller amounts of food on the serving trays, so that none of the food stays on the tray for an extended period and replenishment is more frequent. The dishes are mostly good, and the attentive and friendly staff makes the dining experience quite pleasant.  There's not much here in terms of misses; the only thing I didn't like was their shu mai, which was large but quite dry and had an off taste. They also have a good selection of desserts, including the usual baked goods, pudding, gelatin, fruits (fresh and in syrup), but here again they add an unusual touch: several tubs of real ice cream (not soft serve), and tong sui (Chinese dessert soup). Yay for Shanghai Super Buffet! I wish them success; definitely an addition to my list of buffets for repeat visits.Yup  I did it , I took the family to the Boofay and it didn't make us sick ! I am not usually a huge buffet kinda gal  but I was interested in trying this place and with the Recommendations of the S.C.A.B. Y . ( Superior Crew of Boofays of Yelp)  also known as Ryan , Daren, Rand, Norm and Iain. I was sure I couldn't go wrong . Taking in consideration of the genre of this establishment this was a pretty good operation. While a pungent sour smell hit you upon walking in  you quickly dismissed it upon the viewing of food.  The food was strongly  decent . My favorite was a chicken they named BBQ chicken , ironic because it was a light teriayki , but whatever, it's their restaurant and they can name it whatever they like. But it wasn't BBQ.They also had  ---wait for it ---Crab legs.. cool !!  The other items were good and looked good: Veggies on the line still looked fresh and not overcooked. They had some interesting fish concoctions with shrimp and octopus  that caught my interest. The sushi line looked once again, decent but of course tasted only okay.  Orange Chicken and Beef Rib  tasted good .There was also big assortment of shrimp dishes , for a minute I went all Bubba Gump .. Fried Shrimp , Salt and Pepper Shrimp, Shrimp Tempura, Cold Shrimp, Coconut Shrimp then I remembered its 2010  and I snapped out of it.  They also had a few desserts which we didn't try and Ice Cream which the kids fully appreciated. For the price of 10.00 a person it was reasonable if you take into consideration its a  Chinese Buffet. We decided this a good place to go if you are craving Panda express or Teriakyi  Chicken .  Service was good and we got in and out of there relatively easily.My first review is a year old now, and I'm still eating at Shanghai Buffett 3-4 times a month for lunch.  I'm a big fan.Norm R's right, they deserve the 5th star.  (not that they're a ritzy place, but to judge each establishment against only it's own category, this is really the best of the large chinese buffets in north phoenix)Michael K makes a great point about the friendliness of the service.  90% of the staff is very smiley and friendly, and also extremely Service-Oriented.  This is a rare quality, in this rushed world where so many clerks and servers seem to be simply 'phoning it in'.  Your dirty plates will disappear and your drinks will seem to refill themselves.Variety and freshness are simply what I've come to expect from Shanghai.

if you want to fit in san tan valley here is a step by step guide.1. be really proud of yourself for buying a super cheap house in the middle of nowhere. but don't tell anyone the location bc the moment you do people are less impressed.... and more turned off. 2. bc of #1, you can afford rims on your car. be sure to buy the ugliest  ones possible. people here prefer black rims with chrome outline.3. roll down your windows4. tune your radio to rap music 5. blast it really loud6. drive with your left arm only, straight out, and lean back. be sure you wear your wrist watch on this arm so that others can see it out your window. bonus points if you wiggle your wrist pretending to adjust the watch, but really you just want it to sparkle under the light.im not exaggerating, we saw about 10 different cars like this while eating our china chef. (i just checked out someone's profile who lives in san tan valley. first person i clicked on listed interest: purple drank. what are the chances? i rest my case.)this whole review is an embarrassment, but it must be said. don't ask why i was in this part of town last night, but i was. and we were waiting for a long time in this shopping center and hadn't had dinner. china chef of burger king? china chef it is! the food wasn't disgusting, actually it was just meh but edible and better than BK (on 2nd thought, maybe if i find myself in that horrible town/shopping center i will do BK). the space was clean and blah blah blah.  that's not the problem. the problem is that the meal doesn't come with a gas mask for later. and my body wasn't the only one having issues with this food. for the record, i've eaten my fair share of questionable food and i have never had a reaction like this. shhuuuuuuuuu-weeeeeeeee.

What a cute little place!  It's uber tiny, but you get the feeling it will pack a big punch.  I opted to try out the lunch first because I was very intrigued by the grilled cheese and tomato soup I had read about in other reviews.  Sure enough, both were mighty fab!  There wasn't a thing I would change about the grilled cheese.  The bread (wheat or grain) was awesome and it was toasted perfectly.  Tomatoes inside were an added bonus.  But the real winner of was the cheese.  Oh Cheddar, oh cheddar, how I love thee!  It was sharp as could be and absolute melty goodness.  I was in cheesy heaven!The soup was definitely good, but not great.  I think it could have done with a little more pepper and a tad more cream to add to the bisque name.  It tasted just a tad too runny for bisque.  If I'm going to calorie overload on my bisque, you better commit with my heavy cream!  Service left a little bit to be desired.  She just seemed very unenthusiastic about everything.  I really enjoy asking the server about different menu items, to get their take on what they enjoy.  Maybe I'm too trusting, but I assume they've tried mostly everything and have opinions about them.  I mean, I wouldn't work in a place I hated their food (that's maybe why I stuffed myself with one too many EnP Superburgers back in my day).  She didn't really offer much....oh well, you can't always have a peppy server (Lord knows I wasn't all the time!).  I can't wait to go back and try the dinner.  Everything on the lunch menu sounded awesome, and I'm sure dinner would be just the same.  I'll be back with my bottle of red for BYOB BABY!***Avenue B's kitchen turns fresh and high quality ingredients into light dishes that are also flavorful, vibrant and filling; their reasonable lunch prices also make Avenue B a great option for an upscale lunch in Pittsburgh***Avenue B sits in a neighborhood that kind of reminded me of Silver Lake, Los Feliz or Atwater Village.  The restaurant has a simple café-like décor, but there are great touches.  I liked the use of purple as well as the hanging light fixtures--rustic but also trendy.  The restaurant has a great neighborhood restaurant feel to it.Their lunch menu is reasonably priced and it features dishes inspired from many different cuisines.  There is a Cobb salad and a potpie as well as a Thai-like dish and a banh mi.  I went for one of their modern Asian entrees, which was black sesame crusted salmon served with a salad of seaweed, cucumber, surimi, and mushrooms.  It also came with a sauce of sweet soy and a garnish of carrot and daikon.The salmon entrée seemed like something you would find at a run-of-the-mill Asian fusion restaurant, but it was so much better than that.  The salmon was very fresh and they got a nice crispy crust on it.  The salmon was served medium rare and it was very moist, but it still flaked very easily.  I also liked the great flavor of the black sesame as well as the sweet soy sauce.The garnish of carrot and daikon was fresh with a light crunch while the seaweed salad was cool, refreshing and flavorful.  I liked the mix of the warm salmon with the cool salad.  It was a very light dish, but it was also a very flavorful and filling dish.If I were going to nitpick, I would say that the entrée seemed very close (maybe too close) to the Asian ingredients and flavors that influenced it.  But when the ingredients are high quality like this (especially the salmon) and they are handled so well, it is hard to complain (5 stars).I also tried their flatbread, which was topped with cheese, grilled artichokes, prosciutto, and arugula.  This flatbread had a great crust, which is where a lot of flatbreads can go wrong.  It had a great flavor with the right amount of char; it was thin and crispy but also with a little bit of a chew.The arugula was great--leafy, peppery and nicely dressed in a light vinaigrette (you often get dry arugula on flatbread).  The generous portion of the arugula kind of overwhelmed the small portion of prosciutto, but the prosciutto was good (not dry, meaty and with the right amount of saltiness).The cheese was good too.  In terms of other toppings, they used the woody part of the artichoke, which wouldn't be my first choice, but it was actually a good contrast to the leafy arugula and it made the artichokes stand out in a good way (4 stars).For dessert, I went with their blondie, which was filled with pretzel buttercream and garnished with bruleed green apple.  The bruleed green apple was great.  It was reminiscent of a candy apple but with the use of a tart green apple versus the more sweet red apple (the more traditional apple used in a candy apple).  I think the tart apple combined with the sweet crust was great.That candy apple-like taste made from a technique you often see with crème brulee was kind of eye opening.  And when it was mixed with the sweet and chewy caramel, it became a dessert that felt very nostalgic but also sophisticated at the same time.The pretzel buttercream was good.  You do get a little bit of a pretzel flavor with the addition of coarsely chopped pretzels though the buttercream did not have a prominent pretzel flavor.  What I liked about the buttercream though was how it was sweet and creamy without being overly sugary like a lot of buttercreams (4 stars).I also tried their housemade brown butter ice cream and it was great--great flavor, smooth, creamy, dense, and firm (without being hard) - 4 stars.Service by Lauren was great.  She was personable, nice, knowledgeable about the menu, and very attentive.  The food also came out at a good pace.Prices for lunch were reasonable.  Most of the entrees were in the $12-$15 range and several of the starters were $8 and below.Avenue B is a very impressive restaurant that showcases fresh ingredients in satisfying flavor combinations.  There is also a lot of talent in the kitchen as the flatbread and salmon were both perfectly to near perfectly prepared.  All these great things plus Avenue B's reasonable lunch prices make it a great choice for a delicious upscale lunch in Pittsburgh.Parking is available on the street by meter.  It is not that difficult finding a space during lunchtime.

Look no further for the best Indian food on the strip!  Not like there was fierce competition.  It's pretty interesting that it popped up at the food court of the Riviera of all places.  I'm still trying to figure out why it's here.  Do guests of the Riviera have a strong fever that can only be satiated with tremendous curry flavors?  All I see are old people playing slots!  It doesn't matter though.  I'm just glad it's here and it's tremendous.Not only do they have every curry you could want but they serve a lot of south Indian dishes most places don't.  I only wished I was hungrier when I came to try more things.  We ended up ordering the tandoori combo which included 4 different meats and the saag paneer accompanied by 2 orders of naan.  Everything was delicious and I can't wait to go back and try more menu items.The two reasons for no 5 star rating are the location (hate the parking garage) and the price which is a couple extra dollars more than other places.  There are too many Indian options off the strip for lunch at better price points and they're all you can eat.  Still, it doesn't take away from how good their food is.I can't believe I actually have a reason to go to the Riviera now!Let me start off by saying, I only went to this place because of the reviews I read on Yelp.Definitely not disappointed. I truly would have never found this place if it were not for Yelp. And probably even if I did, I would have been reluctant to try it since it is in a food court.If you are going to India Masala it is for nothing else but good food. I mean who says I am going to the food court to eat dinner? Other than maybe high school kids. Prices were a bit pricey for a food court but it is in a hotel on the strip. However, to my surprise I had more than enough food and could hardly finish my meal. I paid about $15.00 for a butter chicken (spicy) meal with rice, naan and soda. I definitely was not disappointed. You wait a little longer for your food than we would be accustomed to in a food court setting but my food was fresh and oh so good. I am literally salivating now just thinking about it. My only set back was I had one little piece of lemon grass that was too big so when I bit into it it was not fun for me.Good sign for me is when I see native people eating their own food. There is nothing worse than going to an ethnic place to eat and you do not see any people of their own kind there.Best Naan in town, hands down.This is definate must try for any Indian Food Lovers. You can not be disappointed. It is definate return and new fave for me.Awesome!  And LATE LATE LATE!SITREPHot Dam!  What a find when wandering along Las Vegas Blvd at 2am!  MENULV Yelper Paolo had recommended the Butter Chicken, Naan, Rice, ALL GOOD, and this particular dish tends to be my "litmus test" for different places from Seattle to Sacramento to L.A. and now Vegas, and I have to say it was De-LISH.PRICE YIKES!But the combo was about $14 after tax and tip, with this and something that I would consider to be very pricey if at home or work.  However, this was my Vegas trip and in most situations while traveling, I won't spare the expense for the experience.THE LOWDOWNA great find in Vegas for Indian fare!

One of those roving-eye-hungry lunch stops (seriously, it could have been TGIFri or Hardees, we were so starved) that turned into super-happy-belly-land. Tiny, as has been said. Darkly lit, too. If you're a bit of a wide load, you're going to have trouble squeezing past chairs and tables. Buffet is cramped but packed - all the classics present and kept refreshed. Mostly veg, with some chicken and other meats at the left end. Malai kofta, paneer masala, daal, sambar, iddly, vada, hamburger buns (wtf), biryanis, chutneys and such, along with some sweets, on the cold bar. Veg lo mein . Free paper dosas brought to the table as you sit.10 bucks is a little high, but worth the variety of flavor and freshness of grub. Had a sip of a mango lassi - and smiled - pureed cardamom pods made my tongue sit up in surprise. Sweeeeet.

This review is based on my breakfast I had here one morning and the few glasses of wine I was able to enjoy here at the bar the night before.I really wish I could have spent some more time at this place. I absolutely love the hip bluesy, laid back, loungy atmosphere and could imagine it must be a fun place to kick back on an evening before hitting the rest of the town.Sunday morning and limited to the selection of breakfast choices to go to and not craving to go back to the not so delectable Cravings buffet option we chose before, this seemed to be our last, but decent resort.I was seated promptly and given my much needed coffee immediately. I ordered an omelet with Swiss cheese, bell peppers, onions and sausage.It arrived within a timely manner appearing fluffy and deliciously appealing. I then noticed it was ham instead of sausage in the omelet( I don't like to be too picky but I really don't like ham) so I told the waitress, she apologized politely and had another one remade.Come to find out it was sausage just a different kind and the chef actually came out (no, not to strangle me) but to show me a display of different sausages how they are and what I would like to use. She was extremely professional and extremely polite.She gladly remade it and brought it out to me. The omelet was seriously a fluffy, flavorful goodness. Savory flavor in each delectable bite and cooked to perfection. Yeah I know, that rave over an omelet, I just have to give praise to those who can make simple things outstanding.My experience the night before was nice; wine was nothing special though, the service we received from the bar tender was sincere, friendly and prompt.Definitely will make a trip back to this place again:)We all know the saying "What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas." Well, I offer another one, "Keep the wife happy when in Vegas or your vacation is going to be a battle that will come home with you." Not sure when I learned that, but I'm sure glad I did. So, when my wife said she wants to go to the Mirage Hotel to BB Kings Blues Club, I said, "Sure, let's go tonight." Whew... a bullet dodged and I probably didn't even know it at the time.See, Oliva loves Jazz and hates Gambling. I like Gambling and love Music. So, before I can gamble (and she gets uber-bored/pissed), I need to make sure she's knocked a few "to do" items off her list. Does it make me a bad husband? I don't know, but it sure made for a smoother trip because she loved BB King's Blues Club. We came about 5 minutes before a live set started, paid the cover fee $5/person, told the hostess we were there for the music, and got seated dead center in the front row. Nice.We ordered a couple draft beers and some Sweet Potato Tots with Caramel Sauce (meh) to snack on while Jazz heated up the place. The first part of the set was magical with some great improvisations and jazz joints. The crowd was into it, but not really hitting the dance floor. About half-way through the set, a new lead singer came out and the mood/tone of the music became love songs. The dance floor did eventually fill up, but the jazz vibe was muted. I definitely loved the first part of the set more than the second. Overall, Olivia gave BB King's 5-star gold. For me, it was a-ok 3 stars, but a happy wife makes for a happy life, so I'm officially a 4-star fan of BB King's Blues Club.

Uhh this place is totally cool. $5.49 you get all you can eat pizza, salad, pasta, and speciality types of food. Today was Fried Chicken, Enchiladas, rice, beans and spicy chicken noodle. Desserts too $4.99 you get all you can eat pizza, salad and pasta. Desserts too. There were #11  14 inch semi-thin crust pizzas to choose from. I asked what her favorite was and she said Chicken Alfredo, and proceeded to yell to a cook to make on asap. I was feeling really good knowing they make pizza just for me. Apparently you can have them make whatever you want, so I am not that special. I had, chicken Alfredo, BBQ chicken, pep and sausage, white pizza, the works, and pepperoni. They were all good but not the best you ever had. DUH I also had salad, pasta, soup, and dessert. The place is large and clean, there is a video game area but it looked closed. Maybe they only use it on Mondays or Tuesdays, when it is kids eat free. Monday = KEFTuesday = KEFWednesday = TacoThursday = EnchiladasFridays = They have fried fish all you can eat too. Check it out!The special item today (Friday) was fish, and and since I love fried fish I came here to give the place a try. The restaurant is spacious and clean and was not too busy when I came in, probably because it was around 1:30 and the lunch crowd was gone. There was a decent array of different pizzas, nothing exotic: white, pepperoni, veggie, ham & pineapple, etc. But beyond the pizza trays were the other dishes: yellow rice, beans, pasta, marinara sauce, corn, mashed 'taters, fried chicken, fried fish (the dish of the day, Friday), spicy chicken stew, desserts, and a small salad bar. I tried the veggie pizza and it was OK, and then went on to sample the other dishes. The rice was good, as were the pasta and marinara; the beans were a tad watery, though. In spite of that fact that it was that post-lunch time of early afternoon, these items were still fresh; they were replacing and replenishing the dishes frequently enough to avoid having dried-out food. The chicken stew was hearty and - thank goodness the server warned me beforehand - significantly spicy. The offerings of the salad bar were nice and fresh, though limited. But then you don't come here mainly for the salad, which is meant to be truly just a side for the main starches and proteins. And speaking of the proteins - for me, those were the best part! The fried chicken was juicy and the skin nice and crispy. I wish they had ketchup (I love that condiment), but actually the chicken was tasty and fresh enough to stand on its own. The mashed potatoes were an excellent creamy accompaniment to the chicken. And the fish -- yummm! It was perfect! It was deep-fried so of course some greasiness was unavoidable, but the batter was crispy with a light mouth feel -- unusual for deep-fried fish fillets -- and the fish itself was moist and tender. The desserts were freshly baked goods, such as brownies and cinnamon rolls; surprisingly I had room for the latter, even though I had already eaten a lot.Certainly worth coming back to; you get your money's worth, and more. After all, the complete name of the establishment is The Pizza Buffet and Much Much More (for real ... see the pic).

Review Text :
Driving down Rainbow all the time and we always pass by Nagoya 2.  But leave it to an advertisement selling their newest addition to the menu "AYCE Korean BBQ" to have us coming through their doors.Once you get passed the boring facade, you walk into a large restaurant establishment with a bar to the right, sushi bar in the middle, tables to the left, and bbq tables on the further leftThe Husband wanted AYCE Korean BBQ, and there's only one way he can get it - if I order it with him.  (It's offered to parties of two or more doing AYCE only.)Adult prices: $19.95Kid prices: 8 years old and younger: $12.95A little banchan starts your Korean meal - Korean pancake, broccoli, pickled cucumbers, and potato. Not much here.As the waitress was getting our table set up, I asked her if I'm supposed to go ahead and tell her what I want.  She mentioned something about them usually bringing everything out, unless I have a preference.  We definitely did have a preference because we didn't quite want it all!There are about seven different appetizers to choose from, we went with:* Garlic Edamame "Soy bean with spicy garlic sauce)* Gyoza (Deep fried dumpling)* Chicken Wing (Spicy marinated)The kitchen list has about six items, and we got:* Tonkatsu (Deep fried breaded pork)* Vegetable Tempura (Assorted vegetable deep fried)* Kake Udon (Thick noodles soup with fried tofu, fish cake, seaweed)* Fried Rice (Vegetable)From the Korean BBQ list of four items:* Galbi (Angus marinated BBQ beef ribs)* Samgyubsal (Pork belly)(Our waitress did all the cooking for us here, so that was nice.)From the Classic Rolls list of seven items:* Salmon Skin Roll (grilled salmon skin)* Spicy Tuna Roll (spicy tuna, cucumber)For dessert, you get only one scoop of vanilla or green tea ice cream.The staff really didn't want our fellow diners to not do AYCE with us, but we told them otherwise.  The MIL and her companion chose to order off their regular Japanese menu.  They both had the Combination Dinner Special which includes salad, rice, miso soup, gyoza, and two items from their list for $13.50.  (It's $15.50 if you want three items.)  She went for the tonkatsu and miso saba, while he went for the shrimp tempura and calamari tempura.  However, we think he got the short end of the stick because there were only two pieces of shrimp and the rest were veggies.  (In retrospect, he would have done the Shrimp Tempura Entree dinner for $12.90 and gotten 6 pieces of shrimp instead.)  What a bummer!  They also got what looked like a half order of a CA roll with their meal.Service was good for the latter part.  Our initial waitress was a bit spacey, until we moved into the bbq section and then that waitress was better and a lot more friendlier.  It was only a Tuesday night, but they had a steady stream of customers - some sitting at the tables, another sitting at the AYCE bbq section, and more sitting at the sushi bar.  They have a pretty extensive menu, and the sushi menu is pretty long.Overall, it wasn't bad for AYCE.  Sure, we've had a better selection for a fraction of the price, but it'll have to do for the southwest area for now.  But for more bang for your buck, you're better off over on Spring Mountain.

Perfect! Happy hour mon-sat 3pm-6pm3.5 stars All we wanted to do was to grab something to eat after a long drive from California to Arizona and we found this on rurual road, in Tempe. The exterior may look plain but hey, there's a bar and happy hour happening so why turn around?What does happy hour have? Well, well , well... 1/2 off appetizers, $2 blue moons and drafts that they carry. And there's specials on selected food.Got the..+ fresh rolls ($3) chicken - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7N3q70C_mwEYQ2QcGfjvgA?select=N1mhk603JkCFuPZJ58Cxew#mYLsvj4kSTgz7tqwKX07NQ You get to choose either chicken, beef or tofu. We got the chicken and it was pretty good. The sweet and sour sauce was a bit different from the Thai places I've been to. Usually there's garlic in it, but at Thai Basil, they put chopped up peanuts instead. So if you're allergic with peanuts, best ask for the sauce without the nuts!+ Papaya Salad ($6.25) mildTasted great! Only sad thing is that we only had one shrimp :(+ red snapper with mixed veggies and bamboo (mild) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7N3q70C_mwEYQ2QcGfjvgA?select=vhgbwyKOgx0caLeacQ1zQQ#pD9KU2uHEGRBQS4H02AJEQOh so yummy! Tasted garlic-y and having it over rice is delicious.+ Bluemoons ($2 each)  - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7N3q70C_mwEYQ2QcGfjvgA?select=vhgbwyKOgx0caLeacQ1zQQ#A2vWUeFM6vWyQXZeJJvwEw Service - Was great. The ladies who works there are very helpful when we asked what in what and they will let you know what's their special of the day. And yes, there is a bar here. Eat while you drink in front of a big screen t.v. Overall, not a bad place. I just wished they gave more than one darn shrimp!

Review Text :
Bold.  In your face.  High octane.  The flavors of Mozen.  Unexpected in the reserved, contemporary elegance of the Mandarin Oriental but oh so good!Note:  This updated review is based on multiple visit for dinner service only.The menu is broken into two parts, a build your own bento box (select from regional Asian dishes) or larger portions of mains split between south east Asian dishes or classic western dishes.  The bento ($48 for six selections) is the best way to enjoy and sample Mozen.  Simply put, it's an exaggerated, fun, foodie tour of Asia.Flavors are very bold and over the top.  Do not expect subtle flavors, hints of this, a wafting aroma of that.  Surprisingly, it all works especially when combining so many strong classic cuisines of Asia.  Some standouts:  Hae-Mul Pa-Jeon (Korean pancake filled with shrimp and lump crab); what's not to love.Beef Carpaccio with a mixed mushroom "chutney" drizzled with a soy ginger vinaigrette; sweet beefy goodness explodes against the earthy foil.Steamed grouper topped with cilantro and scallions; moist and delicious.Singapore Chili crab made with a soft shell crab; sweet and spicy.Galouti Kebab (smoked, minced lamb with classic Indian spices and a mint chutney); deep earthy richness with a bright herbaceous finish.Very well chosen wine list.  Vegas resort prices.Service is excellentGreat concept.  Highly recommended.Spring Restaurant Week 2013I absolutely adore this place. I wish I had more reasons to visit the Mandarin Oriental just so I can eat here more often. When my girlfriends suggested we try lunch here for Restaurant Week, I was excited. Mozen definitely lived up to all its great reviews!For this week, our lunch was served very elegantly in these bento boxes:Murgh MakhaniGarlic NaanSalmon CrudoMiso Mustard New York AngusCalifornia RollMatcha TiramisuWe also ordered ala carte off their regular menu:Wasabi PrawnsThai Green CurryThe Salmon Crudo was served like a tartar and it was amazing. It melted in your mouth. My girlfriends ate the steak and said it was deliciously tender. We all devoured the wasabi prawns and green curry. Those were the highlights, but everything was tasty and yummlicious!The service is what you'd expect from a place like Mozen. Our server was very friendly and helpful, even when we took a while selecting our ala carte dishes. The staff came by regularly to refill and pour our green tea. At the end of our meal, they brought out a small complimentary dessert, Raspberry Coulis, which was very nice. I can't wait to try more items on their menu. If you're looking to have a great elegant lunch with amazing Asian-influenced food, plus sit in a nice cafe with a nice view, this is your place.FYI: They also provide a great gluten-free, vegan, and lightfare menu.Jazz brunch, complete with a guitarist and bass player. Served 12-2:30pm Sundays only. We made a reservation, not knowing how busy they would be, when we showed up, we were surprised to see not as many people as we anticipated being there. First thing when I was seated in the booth, I immediately noticed a cluster of white hairs and old dried skin flakes right next to me. I wanted to vomit. Grandma had not only left behind the free newspaper they offer, but she also left behind her DNA. The server was apologetic and cleaned it up, then offered me a black napkin in exchange for the white one on the table (bonus point, I had a black dress on). This is a non-traditional style brunch. Going over the menu selection, you can either choose between doing just the AYCE serve yourself brunch for $45, or you can do the AYCE, in addition to entrees (Hong Kong Style Grouper, Belgium Waffle with caramel pecan cream, some of the offerings) for $58. They have a ramen station, along with what they were calling dim sum, there were only two available, pork bun and shrimp shiu mai. A salad station with different offerings like, caprese, waldorf, mediterranean, pasta, etc. A small charcuterie and cheese board (my cheese was hard at the ends) as well as crab claws and what they were calling Kumamoto oysters (I don't think they were Kumamoto) and chilled shrimp, as well as some sushi rolls that were about grocery store quality. My favorite station happened to be the fruits. They had lambootan, dragonfruit and my favorite, passion fruit. Dessert station had mostly parfait type offerings, with some cake pops and one truffle and different creme puffs. In addition, they offer "free flowing" Veuve Clicquot for another $35 or mimosas for $19 (this is in addition to the cost of brunch).Service was less than stellar. I had to continually ask for refills on my coffee and water, she didn't come around often. I left disappointed. I've had way better brunches in town and at this price point, you can do better.The constant changing menu of MOzen continues to amaze me. In particular, I enjoyed eating the Mason Jar, which had smooth potato foam, creamy spinach and flavorful mushroom. The chef's flexibility of removing ham and bacon to meet my dietary restriction was appreciated. My friend also loved the fact that MOzen uniquely used baguette to create crunchy French toasts. Although the service is slightly slow, the great food and the tranquil environment make MOzen the perfect place for brunch in Vegas.I have just found the best Asian fusion brunch in Vegas! We wanted a nice brunch but didn't want to go far, Mandarin Oriental is walking distance from Aria, so MOzen it is! We got seated at a window seat with beautiful views of partial Aria hotel and Crystals. We chose Perrier Jouet brut flowing champagne for $35 per person over mimosa for $20 per person, figured a couple glasses of that would worth a bottle already, so why not. Brunch is buffet style with a choice of entree, there are quite a few good entree items on the menu. The buffet:Appetizers: sushi, salads, cold soup, ceviche, fresh Fanny bay and Kumamoto oysters, king crab claws, fresh shrimps, smoked salmon, assorted cheese and grilled vegetables. Live station: dim sum, strip loin, noodle soup and roasted vegetables. Dessert station: fruits, mini cakes, cup cakes, mousses, creme brûlée, macaroons and many more. We didn't try most of them, both hubby and I are not big fan of sweets. But it was really dessert heaven for dessert lovers! Also many kinds of sauces such as cocktail sauce, Chinese red vinegar and XO sauce, even chimichurri sauce! I ordered Makhani as entree, asked for tofu instead of chicken, garlic naan was so yummy, the curry was bomb! I never like curry, especially Indian curry, but that was so good, very light with amazing flavors! Hubby had scallops with pork dumplings in tomato broth. He loved the tender and flavorful scallops as well.The noodle station was exceptionally good! The fish broth was light with amazing flavors, many freshest ingredients to choose, I just added rice noodles and veggies, regardless how simple that noodle soup was, it was definitely the best noodle soup I have ever had! Hubby liked the chicken broth a lot too. The strip loin was so juicy and tender, perfect rare plus just the way hubby liked it, The brunch food was FANTASTIC with too many good things, hard to believe it's buffet food! The service was top notch, our waitress was extremely attentive and friendly, kept our champagne glasses full the entire time. This was no doubt the best brunch I have ever had in a very long time! It doesn't get any better than this, so relaxing and pleasant! I think for $64 per person, if you don't want champagne, that's a pretty good deal for what you get! MOzen is now our go to brunch spot whenever we are in Vegas!Simplicity at its finest.Walking in I thought to myself where is everything? No art? No decor? It seemed so bare. Everything is the same color and blends into each other.Once the experience began and the service was extraordinary with multiple staff members making us feel like the most important people in the room. After a long day at work and traffic on the strip this really made us all just feel so damn good. It was also genuine and not pretentious. It felt as if they appreciated us choosing to dine with them and I have to point this out because it really made the entire experience that much more special.So the food was perfection. Not only did it look appealing to the eye but it tasted just as good as it looked! Every little detail was thoughtful and I couldn't believe that everything I tried I wanted more of. I began with the sushi combo which was presented like art. I also had the tandoori chicken which was perfect (climax moment). And all of this was followed by a very simple mango tapioca which once again hit the spot (back to back climaxes). I don't even love mangos and I would have licked this up if it wasn't completely inappropriate! Sweet, tart, creamy and crispy little nuggets for an amazing texture experience! I also tasted my friends Beijing duck salad that was so simple but packed with flavor and the skirt steak which was cooked to tender perfection with some of the juiciest & sweetest tomatoes. Everything was so flavorful yet so simple with beautiful presentations. I was also so relaxed and just enjoying myself. My brain went back to why this place was bare. Its designed to put people at ease and you forget about the chaos in your everyday life. Simple, sleek and elegant is what this place is all about. I loved it. I need to make an effort to simplify my world and have less shit in it just like this design.

Review Text :
This place just opened recently, so we decided to give it a shot. I've eaten at several of these over the years, while traveling, and they've always been at least okay.For what it is, this one is awesome! No, it's not a gourmet restaurant, it's a steakhouse with a buffet. They serve cafeteria style. It's aimed at families with a lot of mouths to feed.  The parking lot was well lit, and FULL on a Friday night. They had a cordial rent-a-cop outside directing traffic and greeting people in the cold. We expected a wait, but there was none. We got in line, got our drinks, and went through the check out, in about two minutes. The four of us ate dinner tonight for about $36... two adults, two 11-year-olds. Right away, our server led us to our table.  We immediately visited the salad bar. Everything I saw was fresh, and well-refreshed, too. The presentation was the best I've seen in one of these places. There is a big variety of fresh veggies, fruits, cheeses, meats and dressings. I usually fill up on salad at these places, so I don't overdo it on the other stuff, but... I did, on all counts. That's the only problem with places like this --- WAY too many temptations! For entrees, they had many good choices of grilled meats, fish, Asian style dishes, pizza, home-style cooked vegetables... something for everyone. Some things were better than others, but nothing was bad. I tried the barbecue (pulled pork) and found it a little smokey sweet, but tasty. The applewood bacon-wrapped pork loin was a little dry, but delicious. Applewood bacon-wrapped scallops were better. My wife had a small bacon-wrapped filet she really liked. Oh, don't forget to try the yeast rolls. You can smell them baking while driving down North Tryon street!The kids found plenty of things to eat, and my son who had wanted to go to the Taco Bell down the street (!) decided he was more than happy with Golden Corral instead. The server came by attentively, refreshing soft drinks and water and bringing us coffee, since it was cold beside the window (27 degrees outside!).What can I say? It is what it is... a great place for a family to strap on the feed bag. Healthy? Meh. It can be. You just have to make the right choices. There are enough. As for us, we made the mistake of hitting the extensive dessert bar... Sampling peanut butter cookie coated with chocolate and whipped cream, chocolate layer cake, peanut encrusted fudge, ice cream, and other goodies had us waddling out of there knowing we would be back, but sparingly.I'd give them five stars for people moving, four and a half stars for table service, two stars for climate control, three stars for seating arrangements, and three and a half stars for the food. They get four stars for variety, and overall, four stars for experience with reference to the "Platonic Form" of this concept of a restaurant. Well above average execution!

Was having a hankering for comforting, fast food and I was exhausted after working for 12 hours so what better way than Popeyes!I've visited this location via drive-thru and inside, found service to be actually good for a fast food place. In terms of the people working they have been pleasant and quick. I've been all about the $5 box which comes with either two pieces of chicken or three tenders and two sides of your choice and a biscuit. I got the Spicy Tenders with Mash, Mac & Cheese and Cajun Fries before. The Tenders are so juicy, tender and with a crispy, crunchy exterior. The mash is always my favorite, the mac tastes premade (noodles are mush) and the Cajun Fries tasted way too stale for my liking. The biscuits are so good and I was lucky enough to grab some fresh ones that were just slathered with butter. The Sweet Tea is pretty good too, though not as good as Raising Cane's or Lolo's.The chicken here is spot on and great for the price. Definitely easy on the wallet if you're a college student like myself!

Review Text :
4 stars means I'm a fan, and yes Id agree with that. However what is putting them from a solid 3 to a 4 is the value and service. Seriously, a chopped or caesar salad for 3.95? 5-7pm Happy Hour that includes half off starters, pizzas, and glasses of wine, wow, for real! So with that being said we had a great time at Marcella's, yes folks a chain, but a decent chain with only a few locations in Ohio. The straight forward menu makes for easy navigation and the helpful suggestive service was more than enough to make decisions easy. Okay, we kinda freaked out when  we heard the half off starts and pizzas.. we ordered way to much but was so worth it. Started with the meaty Sicilian pizza, topped with Capacola, Salami, Meatballs, Asiago Cheese, Red Onion, which was probably my favorite. The crust was thin and crunchy and all of the flavors of the meats and cheese really were balanced so I could taste each with one bite after the next.Beef Carpaccio was a close runner up with its thinly shaved rare beef, toasted capers and wild arugula. The flavors were bright thanks in part to the lemon aioli.The Braised Veal Meatball was so light and tender I wanted to order another as my entree rather than the Gnocchi con Bolognese . The problem with the gnocchi was the gnocchi themselves. Kind of like eating raw biscuit dough, but the lamb bolognese was simple and delicious. The Chicken Parmesan was served how I like to eat with both alfredo & tomato sauce. My only wish is that it had just a bit more sauce so I could use the house ciabatta to sop up the extra. Desserts are kept simple like the rest of the menu so we shared with Cherry Crustada. The crust was light and flaky, the cherries filling slightly tart and the ice cream rich and creamy, *pant pant* yum!This was certainly a pleasant experience with a welcoming laid back feel, generous portions and affordable pricing. Oh yes, they also use Opentable.com for free online reservations, so yes, I'm definitely a fan!!!Had another excellent meal here and was able to try many different item. The Melted Pecorino Cheese ($9.50) was wonderful. Melty cheese, fresh sliced granny smith apples, crostini and honey made for many different tastes and contrasts with each bite. For my entree I tried the Fettuccine & Meatball ($13.95) which was a different take on the classic. Their alfredo sauce tasted fresh and bold, plus the fist sized meatball was so tender it barely held its shape. Fantastically delicious!They also get their house bread from Arizona Bread Company, which was light, soft and had just the right amount of chewy crustiness. I dig this place, haven't had a bad time yet! Though the service was a bit off this last time. We seemed to be blown off once another table was sat next to us, we still had a great time.BTW.. if you're having trouble finding parking, there is a garage just west of the restaurant to an underground parking facility.12/11/09First visit was with fellow Yelper Violeta H.  I arrived earlier, so I waited for her at one of the tables out at the heated patio.  Nice space, though I didn't like the fact that my view of the cozy bar area was blocked from the table that I was first taken to, so I requested to be moved closer.  No problem.  I also found that some areas in the patio can be private (as in you're hidden from street view), so if that's what's important to you, be sure to canvas the area so that you may request your spot!As V. already pointed out, we did have a problem w/ the dirty appetizer plate.  I had to use the women's restroom while we waited for the food to arrive, and when I came back, Violeta was already snacking on complimentary bread and butter on a very attractive blue and yellow print saucer plate.  There were many varied styles stacked beneath a pizza stand, so I rifled through a few before finding one that matched hers.  Wouldn't you know it that the one I chose was one of two that had grime on?  V's plate seemed clean enough, but the third from the top, as well as mine (which was second from the bottom of about 7 or 8 stacked) had oily smudges on them- mine looked like a schmear of butter.  :(  Needless to say, I didn't even try the bread, and Violeta dropped her piece when I showed her my plate...And yes, the wine was served in a whiskey glass (looking at whiskey glass varieties on nextag.com for comparison as I'm typing this).  Call me old-fashioned, but I like my Cab served in a Cab wine glass!Now let's get to the pizza!  The happy hour menu features a few wines by the glass at discounted prices, most of the pizzas half-off, as well as some of the appetizers at lower prices.  Today, she ordered the roasted chicken (HH $6.25) and I the four cheese (HH $4.95).  Both pizzas were very good!  So good, that despite the dirty plates' incident, I came back the ff. Tuesday for another HH jaunt- stay tuned for an update soon!  (The roasted chicken pizza came w/ parmesan onions, gorgonzola, and apricots, while the four cheese came w/ mozz, asiago, gorgonzola, and provolone.)   Before I forget, V and I ended our meal w/ a Cherry Crostada (w/ almond crumble and Ciao Bella honey-vanilla gelato.  We thought it charming that our server split our dessert into two plates!!  BTW, as it was the Christmas season, Marcella's was selling gift cards that came w/ bonus gift cards.  $100' worth or more netted you an extra $25.  The original gift card could be used any time and for any food and alcohol purchase, while the $25 bonus had to be used at a later date and could not be used for the purchase of alcoholic beverages. Women's restroom was spacious!  There's a table w/ hairspray, a couple of lotions, and maybe even some mouthwash to help yourself to.  The dispenser held powdered soap, which I happily perceived as something akin to a sugar scrub (it was dark in there, and my hands were already wet before the soap landed on them, so I just felt the "beads"), but another customer said, in what sounded like a disapproving voice, that it was powdered soap, "just like what I used to use back in grade school."  Just goes to show you that "one man's treasure is another's man's trash..."04/15/103.5 stars.Weather was beautiful, so we asked for patio seating.  Took advantage of the happy hour menu to try Mom's all-time favorite appetizer, calamari (!), which we haven't tried here, yet.  We also ordered an apple salad.  Service was quick and friendly.The apple salad was fantastic!  Chockful of mixed greens, crunchy Granny Smith apple slices, and candied walnuts and topped w/ gorgonzola and sherry vinaigrette, it was large enough for two!  We were almost too full to try the calamari.  One look at the app, and we knew it would be a winner.  The calamari was very good-- lightly battered and nicely crisped.  Not too greasy.  We also enjoyed the fried zucchini and LEMON slices that came w/ the calamari!Four stars for the entire experience had the calamari been a little less salty.11/02/10Had an amazing happy hour, complete w/ dessert, here today!  Started off w/ red wine, an Apple salad, and Tuscan cheese board, and ended w/ a chocolate almond cake!  Service was quick and efficient, although it could've been a bit friendlier...  Don't know why they keep it so dark indoors-- 4:30p and it felt and looked like it was two hours later!I've had the Apple salad a few times before, so it's a fave when I dine here.  It's the first time I've had the cheese board, though, and I loved it!  On the dinner menu for $9.95, it only cost me $6 during happy hour and was comprised of an aged goat, a pecorino, and a gorgonzola dolce, a garnish of apricot jam, some apple slices, red grapes, and bread rounds.  The gorgonzola was the creamiest of the three, and the most pungent-- LOVED it!  The aged goat was semi-soft, was easily spreadable on bread rounds, and paired well w/ the apricot jam the best.  The pecorino was the hardest of the three cheeses, the saltiest, and paired well w/ the granny smith apple slices and red grapes.  A well-rounded platter that satisfied all of the basic tastes (salty, sweet, sour. and bitter), minus the umami element.  The topper of this most excellent meal was the chocolate almond cake!  Alternating layers of almond-scented and chocolate cake, w/ layers of chocolate ganache between each cake layer, and then topped w/ more chocolate ganache, plus warm ganache on the plate, and sprinkled w/ toasted almonds!!  The almond cake layers were my favorite, as they definitely had the essence of almond throughout-- the chocolate layers didn't have any almond flavor at all.  I checked.  And checked again.  Nope-- the wonderful almond-goodness I enjoyed was in the light cake layers!  The warmed chocolate ganache and crunchy toasted almonds just sent me over the moon!  I'm so giddy now just thinking about it!The photos included don't do this meal great justice.  BTW, I loved the cake so much, I ate that much AT THE TABLE.  I polished the rest off on the ride home!  :Dno to the foodno to the service no to the pricesno to the way.

Review Text :
Ready to pack my bags and start my new life as a fly on the wall in this fantastic establishment I stumbled upon completely by accident. It all started when 2 non-yelpers (the nerve!) and I were a touch under the weather (re: hungover) and driving around aimlessly looking for a place to have a boozy brunch up in North Phoenix. It was literally by the grace of God that we were brought to Gino's. According to my GPS, we had arrived at Ollie's Omlette House. After our retarded asses drove around an empty complex for god knows how long, we finally all agreed upon the fact that Ollie's Omlette house was no more and Gino's had taken it's place. No longer willing to drive another foot, we decided to walk in to Gino's and give it a shot.How freakin pumped were we that we did?!? I'm actually going against my better judgment even telling you about the goldmine that is Gino's, because at first I was tempted to keep this treasure trove all to my greedy little self. However, in the spirit of Yelp, I've decided to share.Upon first glance of Gino's, it looks like a little beat up diner with a bunch of New York paraphernalia scattered all over the walls in the most depressingly dead shopping complex I have ever seen. I'm talking closed store after closed store after closed store. Thankfully, the depressing exterior dissipates the second you walk in. The entire staff is laughing, joking around, coming over to the tables and sharing their war stories from the night before, friendly as all hell and straight up hilarity.The prices were retarded cheap. My entire breakfast, which consisted of eggs, bacon, hash browns and toast was $3.99. Three freakin dollars and 99 cents!! Cheaper than Denny's/IHOP and other look alikes...oh, and I could order a big fat cocktail with it. Not beer, not wine, liquor baby. WIN!!!Upon further examination, I saw that they had insane specials like my breakfast going on every single day/night of the week. Like Thursday night Ladies Night which consists of $1 you call-its for the ladies. Be honest, how long has it been since you've heard of a bar doing dollar you call-its?? A long ass time, that's for sure. But that's not where it ends. I want to say Monday night was some crazy thing like $3.99 all you can eat pasta and Wednesday nights were $7.99 half rack of ribs night or something ludicrous like that.The best part of this all, even better than the rock bottom food and drink prices, was that the food was actually pretty darn tasty and the drinks were poured STRONG! The owner Gino came over and hung out and shot the shit with us for a while during our brunch, telling us about a couple parties he's hosted there, including NYE where he provided transportation to and from the bar for every single patron, regardless of where they live and completely free of charge. How's that for some old-fashioned hospitality? I am calling it now. This is my new Cheers. This bar/restaurant embodies everything I feel like most places I frequent lack. Good people, good food, good drinks all at a price I can actually afford?? I always thought places like this were just rumor and too good to be true, but Gino's, you've made a believer out of me.The owner greeted me at my car door with a giant umbrella to escort me inside the restaurant while it was raining...ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! Georgie S. wasn't kidding when she said this place is a fantastic establishment. Its totally in a shitty strip mall and from the outside looks like an old greasy diner, but let me tell you friends, looks can certainly be deceiving, and in this instance, they totally 100% completely are. I visited last Sunday on the rainiest day in the universe. The first thing I saw when I walked in was a bowl of Jelly Bellys, and if you know anything about me, you know I love me some jelly beans. Spoon full for me, Handful for you. We asked for a booth, so they quickly got one ready and seated us, all the while shooting the shit and laughing with us about something or other. They have this whole New York theme going which made me happy reminiscing on my days living in the city. Sports memorabilia, license plates, photos and everything else you can think of that represents The Empire State were hanging or scattered around. The menu is out of this world. $3 mimosa's & BM's.. full bar, everything from Hot Dogs to Breakfast Burritos to Turkey Subs to Philly cheese steaks and so on and so on.. a little piece of everything you'd find from a street vendor in NYC.. and that by no means is a shot at their food. New York City vendors sell some of the most delicious culinary creations in the universe. Our waiter was super attentive and of course, I asked him what his favorite thing was. Bam. The Philly Cheese Steak, so I order one. This bitch of a sandwich was HUGE. It was like a Philly Cheese mountain, and holy cheesy steaky mushroomy oniony Batman it was delicious. Georgie S. was clearly being a fat kid that day and proceeded to order 4 things. Chicken fingers, mozzarella sticks, a hot dog and, dammit, I don't remember the last thing. The Canadian went with the most boring thing on menu and got bacon and eggs.. But what does he know? Canada is useful only to provide me with furs and I don't even wear that shit anyway, so I guess that means its really good for nothing. (just kidding. (not really)). Everything was tasty and perfect for the hangovers we were all battling. This place is nothing fancy and is certainly not crap. I loved everything about it from start to finish, including the bill, which was about $40 for 3 people including 2 drinks each. Not bad Gino's. Not bad at all. See you soon, rain or shine!

I decided to try them out for lunch because they got a lot of recommendations for their salad. However, looking at their menu, I could not resist a burger. Being that I am on a very low carb diet, I decided to go with a lettuce wrapped Bacon Cheeseburger with a Small Salad on the side. It was hard though, because I REALLY wanted Texas Toast! It looks yummy in other pictures. Walking in to pick up my order, being my 1st time, I didn't know where to go. But standing there at the podium, waitresses would look at me and keep doing whatever they were doing. It wasn't a lot of people in the place at the time & so this annoyed me. I just decided to go to the bar since that's where most restaurants serve pickup orders. They were indeed able to help me there.I'd never done a lettuce wrapped burger before so I was really nervous on how this would turn out. However, I did not regret my decision! It was delicious! I was most nervous about the lettuce being soggy resulting in a messy burger, but they give you fresh crispy lettuce. It held together fine, even when I added my sauces. Those burger pattys have so much flavor. Normally, I don't eat a lot of bacon on my food. Actually I don't eat a lot of bacon period. When I do I'd rather have it alone with grits and eggs. But that was seriously the best bacon i'd ever tasted. It was sliced to the best thickness and fried perfectly. It had a hint of sweetness and you could taste the apple smokiness in it. I took it off my burger and ate it separately after I finished. Saved the best for last. Don't judge me. I mean what are ya'll doing to that bacon? Can I order a supply? I could eat that bacon all.... ok I went on a bit of a bacon rant. Let me snap out of it. So out of curiosity I tried the Garlic Mayo, BBQ Sauce & the Bad Daddys Sauces. Then they were all so good I couldn't decide which to put on my burger. So I stared at my burger for 5 minutes evaluating my taste buds. I ended up going with the Garlic Mayo & BBQ. But I took the Bad Daddys Sauce home to eat with my chicken breast I cooked for dinner. Can't let good sauce go to waste. On to the salad which was also delicious. I've definitely found my new salad spot. You can choose up to 7 toppings free and after staring at the list for 5 minutes, I finally used all 7. I felt like if I didn't, I was wasting food. I mean some people want 8 toppings and here I am struggling to choose 7. The nerve of me! I would not let my people down. I loved the Broccoli in it. It's like they blanched it with a little flavor because it wasn't completely raw and was tasty! That little salad gave me everything I needed! It was so fresh & that balsamic was one of the best i've ever tasted! Bad Daddy's definitely has a new regular customer!

Holy delicious buffet batman! I was in the area saturday night with a plan to eat at either pacific seafood buffet or this brand spanking new zen buffet.I have horrible self made luck in that my free meal is always in the evenings. Sadly most Chinese buffets fall apart quality wise for dinner. This is horrible considering they are almost always twice as expensive. I had previously scoped out pacific seafood buffet and knew that it looked good for dinner. I stopped here and had a list of things that I absolutely wanted to be happy that evening.This place was PACKED and that means fresh food when it comes to buffet land. The selection of items here is huge. They have 6 or 7 hot tables, plus a table for grilled goods, and a table for Mongolian BBQ fixings. The trays were also on the smaller side so they were replenished more often.Everything I tried here was good. That's not to say the best I've tried but to try 15+ different items and enjoy them all is saying a lot. Especially for my food snobby self.Trays of food were being replaced constantly. Everything was hot and fresh and not swimming in grease. They ran out of BBQ pork ribs which made me sad but was quickly remedied when a brand new scalding hot pile showed up within 10 minutes.The only disappointing factor of this buffet was the dessert selection. Both gourmet honk kong buffet and pacific have better dessert selections. Honk Kong has higher end pastries and cakes. Pacific has the tubs of the real ice cream. These guys had the standards:Something with coconut (sadly not macaroons or I would have had a tear of joy)Lemon/Chocolate Cake(Costco Style)Puffy PastryCubed Espresso CakeSelf Serve Frozen Yogurt MachineThey did have a nice selection of fresh cut fruit.I believe it is safe to say out of the higher end Chinese buffets in town this is #1 or a close tie for #1/#2.Sorry for the lack of pictures but the drive took so long I was starving and pictures lost priority over a grumbling stomach.

Word is they shop for fresh ingredients locally three times a week to hand make quality waffles daily.  It sure tasted like it!  I had the pumpkin waffle with Nutella topping.  Light crunch on the outside and fluffy inside.  I also enjoyed the original waffle with whipped cream, powdered sugar, and topped with caramel sauce.  My waffle was part of a breakfast special which came with eggs, bacon, and unlimited coffee....Perfect way to start the day!  It felt a little stuffy in this small cafe, but I got used to it.  Staff was very polite and helpful, especially with the free wi-fi.  I've got my eye on the waffle sandwiches or the waffle pizza for my next visit.For the 3 years that I've lived and worked in this area - I finally decided to come here for my birthday breakfast. I have no idea why I haven't come here before. I remember someone telling me that it was "ok" and it's "just waffles". No sir, this is not just waffles. These are delightful, crispy, amazing waffles. I love them so much, so so so much. I got the organic waffle with -StrawberriesPeanut ButterChocolate ChipsBananasAlmonds - I used the sugar free syrup, and to my surprise, it was amazing. They do have real maple syrup if you're looking for a sugar high. I really could not get over how good these were. Probably because I'm on pretty strict clean diet and I don't have too many amazing cheat meals like this. But good god...It was worth it. The service was awesome - the only thing is they forgot my kiwi's...but I don't even care. I really don't. If you drive by this place and you're wondering if you should try it out, yes. You should. Especially if you're a waffle lover, like myself.I'm pretty sure this concept came from the, "high-dea" jar. I mean savory waffle sandwiches? Excuse me Cheech, your order is ready. The decor in here definitely needs updating and some style, it sort of feels like you're eating in the teacher's lounge of an elementary school. Nothing here really makes you want to stay and hang out, just finish your meal and bounce. Good thing decor doesn't diminish my appetite or I would be about 30lbs lighter, seriously Vegas you need a major overhaul when it comes to restaurant style and atmosphere. The waffles here are good, lightly sweetened which went well with the salty breakfast options. I ordered the Waffle Breakfast Sandwich; sausage, ham, eggs and cheese. This was definitely a meal, the portion was huge and filling, but doesn't leave you wanting more. It's like watching an "OK" movie; you've already forgotten the main character's name ten minutes after it's over. One more thing about this meal, it's served with a side of Ruffles potato chips, huh? How about side of syrup or a sweet jam for dipping? The service is very good and fast, but I'm assuming that's because they cooked my meal with a microwave. I mean when you can hear the beeps and clicks of the radiation machine in back and your food comes out piping hot within five minutes of it being ordered... ugh.The food was good, the service was good, and nothing was remotely close to great. I feel like there's a real lack effort with Waffles Cafe, they're doing the bare minimum and giving the bare minimum. A new coat of paint, waffles made to order and maybe a few special touches to the menu and this place could easily have a higher rating and possibly become more of a hangout spot. Waffles Cafe you're so close.

Review Text :
I came across this event while browsing Yelp for stuff to do. I was somewhat disbelieving when I finished reading the advert for this food festival and they tagged on to the end, almost as an afterthought, that there would be a bit of live music...including Ed Sheeran! The line up changed a few times (originally Alanis Morisette was appearing) and I was waiting for Sheeran's name to disappear too. I checked again before leaving for the event, his name was still there, due to play towards the end of the 11-9 day.Having parked for free, in the quickly filling field across the road, I walked into the Desert Breeze Park for a minimal fee of $15. This was obviously well advertised, most of the area in front of the stage was already a patchwork of blankets. The smell of food immediately made me hungry. Every 20 yards brought a new aromatic assault; barbeque, asian, burgers. Each stall had to have dishes for $5 or less...many were $3. These were all tasters from local restaurants, stall holders talked about their restaurant and gave out tickets for 20% off when you next eat there.After eating my body weight in garlic chicken and rice I went to find a position at the front of the growing crowd by the stage (using my freshly garlicked breath to my advantage). It seemed everyone there was waiting for Sheeran to take to the stage, the organisers obviously knew this and put on the less popular bands first. It was becoming a battle of wills...who would give up their spot in the blazing sun to bathe their heads, for a moment, in the relative coolness of the shade? I gave up...two more acts to go...I found a large truck to sit under and guzzle water, but on hearing the crowd roar I was able to squeeze into, maybe, the third row back. Ed Sheeran is AMAZING! He was just on stage for 25 minutes (10minutes more than I banked on) but it was totally worth it.This event was real treat. The food was great, the guys on the stalls weren't pushy, the music was awesome. If there was a downside to the day, it was not being able to get out of the sun. Although fans were being handed out for free and you could buy water, I would suggest next year that hats and sun umbrellas be on sale and the limit, of bringing only one bottle of water with you, be lifted. The crowd thinned out a lot after Sheeran and I know, for me, if it had been cooler or more shady, I'd have stuck around for more garlic chicken and rice :)Bite of Las Vegas this year has redeemed Las Vegas food festivals for me. We were blessed with AMAZING weather all day that cooled off in the evening...sooo unlike typical Las Vegas weather. The crew was very well organized and helpful as they really had their stuff together. The parking was relatively painless and traffic entering/leaving moved along without a hitch. Most of the food vendors are local restaurants like Hash House a GoGo, Culinary Dropout, Rainforest Cafe, The Great American Pub etc., but the great part is that they are not food trucks that are slow to deliver, these vendors were very well prepared to handle the crowd and keep the line to a minimum.... something that food truck festivals fail miserable at.Let's start with the ticket prices, which we bought prior to the event for under $20. That gave us the viewing pleasure of 8 artists on stage and access to about 40 food vendors that were priced about $5 per item. What a great deal!Food:Now having experienced some other "food fest", I was a bit soured and didn't expect much from the BLV vendors. I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised, not overwhelmed though, but pleasantly surprised by the food selection and value. We started with Texas de Brazil that offered 3 choices of meats with a roll for $5...garlic sirloin which was melt-in-your-mouth good, sausage was very tasty, the bacon wrapped chicken was actually not bad at all. The roll was a bit dry but a nice addition. All the food was about $5 and portions were decent for a food festival. The Culinary Dropout offered Pretzel bites with cheese fondue with a "happy hour 2 for 1 special"...2 orders of pretzel bites or 1 order with a salmon bruschetta. The pretzel bites were fun and tasty to eat. My daughter tried the salmon bruschetta and liked it. We also had the Hawaiian shaved iced that was perfect to enjoy under the mild Vegas sun. 3 flavors for $5. They had it down to a system where you got your ice pretty quick with generous amount of syrup. Hash House A GoGo is one I would never go eat at again because I think their food is terrible, but they did know how to make a refreshing 3 color Watermelon Kiwi Lemonade that had everyone gawking. H & H BBQ had rib tip fries that were off the hook delicious. Generous amounts of tender BBQ rib tips atop natural cut fries...I would have loved seconds on this. The Great American Pub had lobster mac & cheese and crab fries. I don't usually like anyone else's mac & cheese other than my own but GAP had a pretty good version that we all enjoyed. Creamy cheese sauce, not overly cheesy with bright hints of green onion and crispy bread crumb topping...and it had actual pieces of lobster. I think I would go to GAP to get this again. The crab fries were ok. I don't know where they came up with crab since the white sauce didn't have any crab in it, but still a nice outdoor fest treat.The entertainment was awesome. There were some moments when the bass was a bit too much and caused some of us to loose a filling, but the lineup was great. Lindsey Stirling was our favorite and she delivered a great show. I don't know how one dances around like her and maintains playing the violin. She's one talented gal. OAR was good too. My brother is a Daughtry fan but he wasn't on until 7:30 and the weather was getting cold so we packed up. He said he has the album on iTunes :)All in all, this was a great event that we will look forward to again next year. Just some tips that made our experience that much better was that we came prepared with comfortable cushy folding seats ($19 at Walmart), a large frozen Smart Water bottle for each of us was plenty of hydration to last the day, a collapsible picnic shade tent (at Sears) was perfect to cool off in and the envy of everyone that walked by us. They don't allow outside coolers, but in the event you have special medication for your kids that need refrigeration, they do allow a lunchbox sized cooler to carry it in. I hope next year's weather will be as beautiful as it was that day, but also bring a light hoodie in case it gets cool.Great job Bite of Las Vegas! This was the best Food Festival experience for us.Bite was amazing as always. When I found out they were selling tickets I bought mine and my friends. $15 presale and $25 at the door. PRESALE BABY! We ended up coming around 1pm and just started walking around and eyeing the park and everything that was around. We started out by the Race Now tables and worked our way around. After our first go around our other friends showed up and we started to get into the food. Food Pineapple park- My first stop on the bite road. I wanted the dole whip and I got it! I order the pineapple upside down cake and it was amazing, it reminded me of a shot i order when I first turned 21, not sure why I haven't ordered it since. Texas Twister- First drink stop, We though lemonade and you can refill, why not? And we were a little disappointed. It didn't taste sweet. It was more of a bland lemonade. Only plus was the fruit in the cup, my friends ate it all. Papa Johns- One of the last stops of the night. When you only have $3 left and you need something hot and homey, when papa was the way to go and it was close. Haha, super glad they handed out the garlic sauce. Culinary dropout- Not my first experience with Culinary drop out. They had the sames cheese and bread at the B&W party and it was still as delicious as ever. Panda Express and friends- When over because I saw sushi and was interested. My friends told me it was a bad idea but they were wrong. Probably my favorite meal of the day. They had spam musubi and some cream cheese wontons. They said for a dollar more I could get two egg rolls, so I told them to throw it in the bag. My friends of course stole some but that's why I got them. Rainforest Cafe- Our favorite place to sit and eat. We happen to grab a small table after grabbing some food we needed to st down to eat. They kept the tables clean and they were fill. Claim Jumper- Two of my friends went here and order some sliders and chips, as well as a salad. I of course ate all their chips and a lot of the salad. It was a Cesar salad and it was pretty good. We dipped the chips in the cheese fondue form culinary and it was bomb.com. They also had a guy yelling about double chocolate cookie that were as big as his head.. Very tempting sir. VendorsAfter stuffing ourselves with food we started walking the tents of free things and sign ups. The first stop was State Farm, who I already have insurance for but sign up to win a $250 ft card, I was down. Also they gave out shades, awesome. Next was Toyota. They had iPad to sign  up for stuff and they you spun a wheel for prizes. They had black shades, awesome. Also they had chap stick and hats. Next was KB homes. We literally just went there to get the free cotton candy. It almost blew away when the wind started but i saved it with my mouth. We walked our way the the Metro PCS booth and threw a phone in water to get more shade, purple, awesome. Then checked out the idea image booth. Orange shades, awesome. Then went over the the hospital booth, the had heart clip magnets, sunscreen, stress ball brains, and many different colored shade including pink, awesome. I got a lot of shades now, just saying. MusicMy real reason for going, because lets be honest a $15 is a steal. The line up included Daughtry, Colbie Caillat, O.A.R., American Authors, Lindsey Stirling and The Script. We really were just listening to the first couple bands and didn't actually sit and watch til Colbie. She was wearing shade which I though was funny but I love her song Try. During her set is when I had to get up and try and find a sweater. Her crew had shirt and some long sleeves but no hoodies or anything so we went on a mission to find something to warm me up. We failed. The military hoodies sold out and the race shop said they would get more in a hour. We ended up telling security we were grabbing a jacket and sat in the car til The Script came on. I thought they were so high energy and fun. At one point the lead singer asked for someone to call and ex boyfriend and he took the phone and sang and talked and kept calling back when he hung up. He also wanted to make a moment and ask for everyone to put down the camera and just turn on lighters or lights. I really liked that. He also came into the crowd which was really cool. RandomThe Vegas area was really nice and chill we ended up there multiple times to sit and relax. The best part was right before The Scrip came on they were giving away Tshirts, hats, cards, and dice for your car. The lady was really cool and was trying to make it fun by throwing it over her shoulder. The red couches were comfy and right my grass so you could take your shoes off. Other random was the bathrooms, i mean porta potty. When i went in the early day i grab some TP assume they would run out. I came back later and the potties still seem pretty clean and stock. Also love that they have the sinks to wash hands.It was our first time & definitely not our last!Parking is on gravel & was definitely crowded but no complaints there because the ushers were so helpful! Parking our car & leaving the event was a breeze because it was definitely organized. Loved the food choices!  We were able to try Pineapple Park, Stripburger, Hash House, Sauced, Amore & much more. Our favorite would have to be the single slice Amore pizza that came with water since water was sold separately with other dishes & the fact that we didn't have to buy a whole Amore pizza for $20+. We also loved the Kiwi Watermelonade (?) from Hash House; so refreshing on a sunny day!The weather was definitely perfect on this day! It did get a bit cooler at night & I was not prepared at all. Haha. For $17, I was able to see American Authors & a little of Colbie Caillat! Music was great but we were definitely more fatties & ate continuously throughout. We were unable to stay any longer cause it got too cold for me but I will be prepared next year.Honestly, you don't need VIP treatment (overrated!). We enjoyed walking around, eating vendor foods, standing for the concerts, relaxing on the grass (many spots with shade) and people watching. I would not want to be stuck under a tent for what, $100 or something like that? Pfffft! As my Hawaiian boyfriend always says, "No need brah! No need!" Get in for cheap & enjoy the event. Can't wait for next year! :)I tried more of the food this year (scroll halfway down for more info), but I still mainly went for the music. Bite of Las Vegas delivered on both counts.The weather was ridiculous to start the day, but unlike last year, they managed to keep the bands going pretty much on schedule. I skipped Nick Fradiani and the two local acts, whoever they may have been, but I arrived just in the nick of time for Andy Grammer's start time at 3:10pm. Some of you may be familiar with his popular singles from radio stations such as MIX 94.1. Anyway, he and his band were energetic, and he played a lot of songs that were easy to enjoy in his ~30-minute set, including his current catchy tune "Honey, I'm Good." I also loved his incorporation of loop pedals on one of his tracks, as well as the talk box on his cover of the current Jack U single.A quick reflection on how easy it was to redeem the Groupon (which I got for $10.40 after stacking discounts vs. $16 early pre-purchase). The signs were clear on where to go as long as you read them, and they just waved you through once they scanned your barcode. Interestingly, they didn't bother to check my stuff, so that sealed gallon of bottled water could easily have been an open gallon of vodka, or something even better. Maybe next year...Most of the music was great after that point. Needtobreathe brought a Southern rock sound that I just wasn't feeling, other than their current single "Shelter." Lifehouse killed it though, with energetic playing and spot-on vocals for their first live performance in three months. They played most of their hits, to the delight of fans. Matt Nathanson was also awesome with a cover-filled set and charismatic audience engagement. Finally, Third Eye Blind rocked the headliner spot with old hits and new songs - perhaps a few too many of the latter for some listeners, judging from how I was able to inch closer to the stage every few minutes.I was actually quite surprised after last year at how I was able to get relatively close to the stage with minimal effort if I wanted to. I'm not sure if it was just the broader appeal of last year's acts that led to a massive turnout, the scorching temperatures of this year (what a relief when cloud cover arrived at around 4:45), or if people had other things to do today, but it felt that attendance was down - which is a good thing for the people who did end up showing, including yours truly.I know a lot of you wanna hear about the food, and I finally did get into it. Several chains were present, but I focused on interesting bites from local restaurants, all of which happened to cost $5. Props to everyone for keeping most of the items affordable and allowing for a lot of sampling - I see the point of this event now, despite the lack of high-end restaurants.My first order was a small steak plate from Via Brasil, which was cooked to medium but was tender enough for a plastic knife to do its job. It was seasoned and wasn't too bad aside from the lack of a starch.I also had a sample of Aloha Kitchen's chicken. They were really pushing samples, and the chicken with its extreme tenderness and light sweetness could definitely have been a pick if I'd had fewer other options.Next dish was a ceviche from El Ceviche, a shop that is aiming to open on S. Eastern Avenue in about two weeks. It was actually a nice portion with good chunks of fish, Peruvian corn that wasn't too mushy, red onion, a thick potato slice, and lettuce. I liked it and enjoyed their complementary (yes, the one with an "e") passion fruit juice for $3, which came in a pretty large cup and provided the sweetness to counter the acidity of the ceviche. I think they'll be worth a visit once they've launched their business.I made a final round at around 7pm, at which time the lines had predictably grown. I had found an interesting chicken tikka masala with rice and naan at Mint Indian Bistro's tent, and their line was quite short either due to being overlooked or because they were able to plate quickly. The rice may have been a little bland and dry, but the chicken was excellent and the naan wasn't too bad. I'm interested now in trying their actual restaurant, which probably means that they've succeeded.My final bite was the pumpkin cheesecake ($4) from Lazy Dog Restaurant & Bar, which I realize now is a chain, and yet I really couldn't care less. They had won best dessert of Bite of Las Vegas 2015 earlier, and I can't really argue with the judges on this decision. It was rich and had nice pumpkin flavor, and I had to restrain myself from eating it so that I could share a taste with my friends.Overall, it was a very fun day for at least four of the five senses (not entirely sure about touch). There is good food to be found, and while the music lineup was a step down from last year, the big-name artists generally delivered. Go to Bite of Las Vegas when you can, and hopefully obtain a cheap ticket.Great music and great food! The Bite of Las Vegas has been around for 19 years.  Since I am still fairly new to the area, I have only been twice.  For how affordable it is for tickets, it's hard to pass up.  Located in Desert Breeze Park, it's a nice open area with plenty of room for all of the food vendors.  You can bring in your own chairs, blankets and water.   For less than $20, they put together great musical lineups.  This year(2015) was Lifehouse, Third Eye Blind and Matt Nathanson just to name a few.  My first visit was 2012 with Matchbox twenty and Ed Sheeran.   There are usually about 5-6 acts which makes for a great show.  Various restaurants have booths set up with small plate menus.  Braddah's, Culinary Dropout, Mint Indian Bistro and Shake Shack are just a few of the over 30 vendors.  It's great to try many places for usually about $5 at each place.  I really enjoy this event and would recommend to anyone.  Enjoy the show and definitely enjoy the food!

Review Text :
Who knew that in downtown historic Glendale, there lived the most adorable little locally owned ice cream parlor called Papa Ed's?I didn't... until today!I made the thirty minute drive to Glendale from Old Town this afternoon for a meeting and was lucky enough to get a tour of some of the cutest businesses around town.  Papa Ed's was one of them... My friend Danica walked me inside and introduced me Linda, the owner.  For those that aren't lucky enough to have their private tour guide like I was, Papa Ed's is tucked behind the Country Maiden house turned retail store (which happens to be yet another adorable Glendale business that I will review in due time as well).Papa Ed's carries both Shamrock Farms and Dreyer's ice cream... it reminds me of a smaller, more local "Ben and Jerry's" kind of place.  It's bright, colorful and welcoming...While I passed on getting an ice cream today, I did take advantage of their outdoor seating; you see, I had a conference call smack dab in the middle of the afternoon.  It was fun to see people go in and out with their ice cream treats.  There's also plenty of beautiful landscaping right outside their door.Next visit to the area, I'll have to go for an ice cream from Papa Ed's... if you make it there before me, let me know what you think?!

A friend said she found this place on google under "dance clubs." Four of us showed up on a Friday night at 11:00 p.m. I'd say there were 30 people in there. They had a DJ playing meh music, smoking patio, darts, pool table, dead dance floor. The bathrooms were clean. I was acting as the designated driver for the night and they do not offer free soda for the DD's, bummer. The crowd was mainly males, really good looking ones, I remember thinking "there are some serious hotties on the West side." The bartender was attentive and nice. It's not a dance club at all, just me and another friend were the only ones that danced the entire night. I played erotic photo hunt on the touch screen at the bar. "Moanz" is top 4 scores.

Haven't been to Lemont in many a year!  Always liked the food and service was impeccable!   Well it hasn't changed!The maitre'd showed our small group to a great table in the corner.  Yes!, what a great view!  Had reservations for a friends birthday...special occasion.  Fun to watch boats on the river, the incline and planes flying over the Northside..oh excuse me, it is now the North Shore.  We did go mid-week so it was not crowded.We had a few kids, ages 11 to 14, and the maitre'd and server were so good at making sure they could order just about anything they wanted.  They had a long list of ideas not on the menu, since everything is made to order.  Fantastic!  Server went way above and beyond, like you would expect at a top notch restaurant.The tables were so sweet!  Shiny table ware and glasses.  Fancy plates and linens, it is nice to dine out.  We ordered some Champagne to start off and waiter made sure to ask about the type we preferred, Brut, Asti or semi???  Great job!Server also suggested we not over order apps, and extras and told us about the roasted tomato that came with our meal.  Started with a couple of apps, escargot alio was so nice with garlic, not seen much anymore but fun to see the kids try!  The crepes fontinia were delicious.Had a classic, the Lemont salad, nice fresh greens served with the Lemont vinaigrete, really enjoyable.  The meal came with assorted fresh bread and was refilled when needed.Had the Veal loin rib chop for two that was cooked perfectly, tender and sweet.  Others had the salmon, New York Strip steak and a special kids spaghetti. Everyone loved their meals and how they were cooked. Managed to get a bite of the spaghetti when the young one next to me keep saying this is better than grandmom's.  It was very good indeed.When you go you have to try the deserts.  We decided to get a couple of the old tried and true cooked tableside so the kids, big kids too, could watch and try deserts they have never seen.  The Baked Alaska and Bananas Foster were sweet and very good, as was the coconut cake.  Deserts were passed around and the Bananas were the fav.Lemont can be a little pricey if you order extras, but not to bad if you stick to the basics, but  you get really good food and service.  This is a top notch place during the week.  What a great experience!I had really wanted to read past the reviews and like this place, but beyond the view, it did not live up to the owner's dream.  Putting their staff in tuxedos was as uncomfortable for me to see as for them to wear.  There was no pedigree in their training, beyond being polite, but polite is not what a tuxedo wears.  "What can I get you guys..."  and the minute a plate was near empty, a tuxedo would reach over you and yank it away.  You had to time your eating.I had an appetizer of escargot, and although generous in the portion, they were tasteless.  It needed seasoning, garlic, oil, butter, and white wine.For dinner, I ordered Cavatappi Shrimp Natural.  Again, generous on the shrimp but tasteless.  It was pasta with shrimp. My wife ordered a glass of house chardonnay and could not get past the first sip.  I tasted it and it was , honestly, undrinkable and I love finding cheap French wines. We had to get a $85 dollar William Hill Chardonnay to get through dinner.  Seriously ridiculous (400% markup)  My wife ordered their Hearts of iceberg appetizer with the hot bacon vinaigrette but it was so vinegary it was hard to eat and she could not finish it.  For diner she had the Coq au vin, but again--lack of seasoning.All in all, it was so overpriced and under-delivered.  I felt really bad for the young couple at the adjoining table, hopefully they were overwhelmed with the view to make up for the lack of delight in dinner.  If this place wants to survive, ditch the tuxedos, lower the prices dramatically and season the food.  The chef needs a pallet for seasoning, or is being held back by the owner.The place was not very crowded.I love the Holidays. What I don't love is spending hours cooking and cleaning for Thanksgiving dinner. Not to mention every time I do try and cook I can't get my turkey to be anything but dry. This year I chose this lovely restaurant for my families celebration.Pulling up there was a bit of a line outside but it went fairly quickly. We were seated quickly and our waiter was at our table within seconds.  The restaurant is very beautiful with crystal chandeliers a wonderful view of the city and the holiday decorations just added to it. The Thanksgiving setup here is buffet style and it's separated into 3 areas. First there are sides with some note worthy ones being the pumpkin bisque, cheese tortellini and asparagus. The stuffing was good but the mashed potatoes weren't that great at all. Then there is the carving station with turkey ham and roasted fillet.  All were tender and juicy. Finally there is the dessert area. There were so many options. Tarts, cakes, pies, fruits and more. I tried the cheese cake, pumpkin roll and creme brûlée . They were all great. I wish I could have tried more. I also must mention the service. Our waiter was always present but not over bearing. Never once was I without a drink and empty plates were never on the table for more then a min. He was also great with my son and so were the rest of the staff he interacted with. This might just become a yearly tradition. It was great over all.

Review Text :
So-so, even for the El Cortez. I was expecting something super-old-school, slightly dumpy-yet-ironically-cool. What I got was the Cleveland Holiday Inn!Atmosphere is SEVERELY lacking here. There are TVs scattered throughout, I guess so you can watch the game while eating...but they end up lending a very coffee-shop keno vibe. Decor is pretty much nil. Overall a pretty depressing miasma of middle-of-the-roadness smothers any sort of excitement or romance you may be trying to celebrate here.Service was fine, food was meh. I had roasted chicken with mushrooms, which was pretty good, but my friend had the trout almondine which was very dry and lacking any sort of aesthetic presentation whatsoever. We also shared a Caesar salad, which was average.The prices are OK....but not really, considering the grim atmo and complete lack of fun here. You would be much better off going to Binion's Steakhouse down the street, which is a MILLION times cooler, in terms of ambiance.

Review Text :
Why am I giving four stars to a place with veggie burritos worthy of only three? Well.... EVERYTHING ABOUT REVO MADE ME HAPPY.- Free chips and salsa galore. With free refills. Did I mention the word "free?"- Friendly, spunky staff. I was indecisive about choosing a salsa, so they gave me two of both kinds.- Hooks for purses and coats under the tables - innovative, classy and functional.- 100% vegan, filling veggie burritos for seven bucks.- Funkyfresh decor that's reminiscent of... well, nothing really. It's all over the place. In a nice way.- Bathrooms with life-sized images of scantily-clad beach babes and guys on the walls. - Without my asking, waiter took my reusable water bottle and filled it for me before I left. That, my comrades, coworkers, and esteemed colleagues, is how you earn an extra star.

It's a good thing when places like this open their doors.  You've got to take your hat off, or in other words support, local purveyors who introduce our communities to pure artisan craft.  The pasta is great, the owners skilled and authentic, and they are yet another poster child for the growing "think/buy local" movement.No more store bought Barilla for me...and hopefully you too.I came across this place because I would pass it everyday...finally I had to stop and try it...they only offer certain sauces and raviolis everyday and gnocchi...but everything is great...it's all made from scratch and the owner is very sweet...it is very authentic and delicious...you can bring pasta and sauce home too,,,they have odd hours and sometimes have very limited selection but it's awesome...the owner lived in Italy for years and really knows her stuff!

Restaurant name  Mijana
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Text :
To put it succinctly, the service at Mijana bordered on the comically absurd.  Before weaving this narrative, I will disclaim that it blows my mind that after years of being in business (and countless reviews attesting to the sub-par service) that there has been little to no improvement in that department.Our party arrived for "International Night" at 7p on a Sunday night.  (The second Sunday of each month this restaurant hosts a few performers/acts from varying parts of the world.  Tonight we got to enjoy Brazilian Samba, Egyptian Bellydance, and Spanish Flamenco.  The entertainment was wonderful!Upon our arrival, the restaurant was less than half empty.  I noticed three servers and the manager/owner in attendance.  As we were seated we immediately asked for a high chair for our toddler.  That high chair arrived about an hour and a half later.   It probably took 15 minutes before we received menus.  No drink orders were taken, no waters brought to the table  (They arrived about a half hour later).We had been seated for about twenty minutes before I flagged down a server and asked if we could order.  Her reply was, "she has not come, yet?" and took off to find our server.  When our gal arrived, there were no apologies or explanations.  We pre-empted our order with the disclaimer that we were all very hungry and wanted to order right away.  So our orders were finally placed after we had been at the restaurant for nearly thirty minutes.  The beer I ordered never arrived, but I had to get up and let the server know once my third appetizer plate came to the table.  No apologies.I ordered seven hot appetizers.  The first three arrived about thirty minutes after they were ordered.  The Quail, Fatayer, and Foul Moudamas.Quail (sautéed over hummus): Perfect portion for one person, absolutely flavorful and delicious.  Crisp and spicy/sweet on the outside, juicy and flavorful on the inside.Fatayer (four spinach pies with onions, sumac, and line nuts): Nothing to rave  about, basically a lackluster version of Spanakopita without the feta.Foul Moudamas (fava beans cooked with garlic and lemon juice, topped fresh diced tomatoes, cilantro with drizzle of olive oil): Loved this, fresh and packed with flavor.I had to get up and get more bread for our dips, as server was nowhere to be seen.  I had to constantly clear the table of plates as no one came to the table to do so.  At one point, about an hour and fifteen minutes after we arrived, the owner came to the table to ask how the food was  (the music was so loud I was virtually screaming at him and I barely heard him).  I handed him a stack of plates that I was just clearing from the table and mentioned how the food tasted great, but we were all still hungry...hint hint.The server never came to follow up on our food, to ask if we wanted refills, or just to see how everyone was doing.  Around 8:30p, one hour after our orders were placed, I had to once again get up and find the server to ask about the remaining dishes I ordered.  At that time she informed me that they were out of two of the appetizers I ordered.  No Sambusek, no Makanek.  No apologies.  Fine, but the appropriate thing to do would have been to come to the table and inform us about this, and offer something else instead.  Long story short, she mentioned that my Chicken Shawarma Hummus was on its way, more than an hour after I ordered it.  The final appetizer I ordered, would arrive an hour and fifteen minutes after order was placed.Hummus Shawarma (chicken over hummus with pine nuts) My favorite dish of the night, tasted exactly like Pita Jungle's version  (Just costs more).  The chicken was outstanding.  Soft, succulent, and savory.  Garlic shrimp (sautéed shrimp in garlic cilantro)  Second favorite dish.  Generous portion of gorgeously plump prawns, well seasoned and very flavorsome.We snickered collectively when the hostess of the evening announced that the entertainment was coming to a close, and that there would be Samba lessons.  I quote, "I hope that your food has settled so you can enjoy some dancing lessons."  Everyone's entrees literally arrived an hour after we had come to the restaurant, right when the hostess opened up the dance floor for some lessons.The music was so loud that I had to stuff mine and baby's ears with tissue - we were literally yelling in each other's ears so we could hear one another.  Our sweet baby had an amazing time, though!  She loved the music and the dancers and was captivated the entire time.  We were so lucky to have the entertainment to keep our minds off our growling (roaring) bellies.Our bill arrived close to 9p, after I once again made the journey to find our server and request the bill.  No thank you's,  no smiles, no apologies from her.  However, I would love to return for future International nights.  I will likely sit at the bar with no expectations of food or service - maybe a cocktail and some shisha.

Review Text :
Hey Mister, have you got a dime?  OK, so the coolest thing on the table at Cyros is the soy sauce mister, or actually Julia S (victorian nerd) corrected us and said it was atomizer. We atomized our sushi bites, much better, you get the flavor without the sushi falling apart from dunking and I am sure the salt intake for your meal has to be a million times healthier.  The staff is very genuine and our server Meghan was off the charts enthusiastic and knowledgeable. I am also a big sake fan, I love to try different sakes.  If you have only had warm sake in the tiny white cups, you are in for a treat with all the fancy smancy sakes around town. Cyros has an extensive sake menu and offers half bottles, they seem expensive, but these are small batches, hand crafted rice wines.  The cloudy, unfiltered, served cold are my favorite and most high end sakes are also glutten free. For all the people who still want a buzz but have food allergies.

Review Text :
Absolutely unacceptable service.It has been a very long time since i have actually gotten up and left a restaurant because of bad service, but let me tell you, it was the best thing that I did this evening.My family decided to take a trip to TGI Fridays because it has been a while since we have visited this location and we were craving the fried green beans with wasabi ranch.Our visit was on Saturday evening. We arrived around 8:40, actually got a front parking spot in front of the door, and had less than a five minute wait. So far so good, then we were seated and promptly entered the "twilight zone".  Our server came over after about 7 minutes, took our drink order and we took the opportunity to  order the fried green beans with wasabi ranch.  Now, after 8 minutes our fried green beans and wasabi ranch arrived, but we still have yet to receive our drinks. We had two waters and a sweet tea.  We were told that it would be a few minutes before the sweet tea was ready.  By now,  two tables have been seated a two top right behind us and a four top across from us. They were promptly greeted  by our server and they began their dining experience.We ordered a Jack Daniel's cheeseburger, the sizzling chicken and shrimp and a Friday's® House Salad (Romaine, red cabbage, grape tomato, cucumber, mixed cheese and focaccia croutons with choice of dressing and a hot garlic bread stick.) I have added the description as shown on the website and menu. Ours did not come with the bread stick.  When we asked the server, he stated that it did not come with one, we stated that the menu said it did.  After my wife finished the salad he obliged with 2 hot garlic bread sticks, but what was the point, the salad was already finished.So thirty minutes passed and each of the tables received their salads, and meals that came in after us, we felt we had been neglected enough.This is where I approached the front hostess stand, requested the manager, and let her know how this was just unacceptable.  The manager stated that it was just a few more minutes, and I let her know that my family had already left and was in the car.  As a courtesy, I let her know that I was willing to pay for the tea, salad and fried green beans, but we were not going to hang around any longer.  She insisted that we wait and have it boxed to go, but I declined, as it should have been presented as ordered in a timely manner at our table, not in a to go box.  (Just remember the food was still not even ready).  The manager said it was not necessary to pay, but this is just not acceptable at a dining establishment.I am getting really frustrated at the level of incompetence in businesses, and the lack of willingness to provide an effort to do very basic skills. Please take a moment and train the employees of the importance of serving others by understanding the menu and by taking care of the needs in a timely manner.  If one cannot handle more than 4 tables, then one may need a new job.I am pretty sure that by the other yelp reviews, I am not the only one who is NOT thinking TGI Friday!Just on a side note: Had I not stopped by the hostess stand and ask for the manager, the server would have never noticed we were gone?  Now that's sad!

I've had Einstein Bros on numerous occasions, bu I've never had anything aside from basic bagels and shmear. I was craving bagel and lox so I met my OG Ryan B for some lunch. The service was standard, but I got exactly what I was looking for in a bagel and lox with the works. A little on the expensive side, but I was extremely satisfied with my meal and the atmosphere was nice to sit and chat in a quiet location. Free Wi-Fi and free refills makes this a nice quiet place to get some work done as well.

2013 HALO-HALO CHALLENGE - Contender #2Jollibee got the honors for our next Halo-Halo Challenge.  They say pictures are worth a 1000 words. Well, when we walked into Jollibee, Bam! In our face was a beautiful sight...a poster of a perfectly made cup of Halo-Halo. For about $5, I was hoping we got exactly what the picture demonstrated...ube ice cream, flan, sweetened condensed milk, red beans, green jelly, and coconut packed in shave ice.  I think a little ube syrup was even added just for show (see pictures).  Our Halo-Halo tasted as good as expected. And with the Vegas heat that evening, our dessert only tasted that much better. Our Halo-Halo was sweet, cool, and had enough of the minimum ingredients to keep me satisfied until our next challenge.  So far, I'm a fan of Jollibee's Halo Squared.  My only issue...I wish there was more flan and some legit ube (not ice cream).PS: For an appetizer before our Halo-Halo Challenge, I tried their Beef Tenders (Tapa).  This was basically seasoned and caramelized beef steak, eggs, and rice.  So good and a perfect quick meal before any Halo-Halo Challenge.Halo-Halo:  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jollibee-las-vegas-2?userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ#Cot3wGtkvTNtq_OTutVyzA2013 HALO-HALO CHALLENGE:Contender #1 (Elena's):  http://www.yelp.com/biz/elenas-restaurant-las-vegas-2#hrid:66pT_yQvZudRThxlGl74QwContender #2 (Jollibee):  http://www.yelp.com/biz/jollibee-las-vegas-2#hrid:ZSJzziWEVLyOF3DHfn1MaA/src:selfContender #3 (Cafe Cebu):  http://www.yelp.com/biz/caf%C3%A9-de-cebu-las-vegas#hrid:5iu3U4zoZWQISOSO7BMsGQContender #4 (Salo-Salo):  http://www.yelp.com/biz/salo-salo-grill-las-vegas#hrid:Wgtkj97v8-l9MnNuyj-QxQ/src:selfContender #5 (Thelma's):  http://www.yelp.com/biz/thelmas-filipino-restaurant-henderson#hrid:wzGAlZyBNi1UtDRM0t0oXwContender #6 (Andrea's):  http://www.yelp.com/biz/andreas-las-vegas#hrid:idKe5bOeuIwnyzcamgeUDgContender #7 (Chow King):  http://www.yelp.com/biz/chow-king-las-vegas-2#hrid:3FzhPzAaF7_OE6i0Nau5WAContender #8 (Fiesta Filipina):  http://www.yelp.com/biz/fiesta-filipina-cuisine-henderson#hrid:VLvYgY6ROsMh9q70tmkoHwI have heard about Jollibee for quite some time and finally got the chance to try it out today.  A friend had told me that it was like the Filipino version of McDs and KFC combined with some traditional Filipino staples thrown in the mix.  And yep, that is what I thought when I saw the menu.We had the fried chicken and the spaghetti today.  The fried chicken was tasty and I really liked the gravy to dip it in.  Yum.  The spaghetti was really different since it had cheese on top, a sweet tomato sauce, and some hot dog pieces all mixed together.  I know it sounds super weird, but it was actually good, in a strange way.  It was a cheap meal too. For 2 adult meals and a kid's meal the total was only $16.  Not too shabby for lunch.  I wish I was more hungry because there were a lot of fun looking desserts to try.  Maybe next time...And there will be a next time!In the area for an appointment, we were trying to find something quick to eat at 10:30 in the morning and didn't want IHOP, so we decided to give Jollibee a shot. I've been to Jollibee in So Cal before, but never to one here in town. I've never been a huge fan, but figured I'd give them another shot.I got the spam breakfast and it was ok. The best thing about this place is that everything is so cheap, even for fast food. Nothing amazing but it satiated our craving for a quick and cheap meal while we were in the area. Good for what it is, cheap fast food.There has to be a good reason my parents would never let me eat at Jollibee when I was little.  They always told me the burgers are made of worms. Somebody gave me a burger from Jollibee and I would not touch it.This is a Filipino fast-food joint. It's like the Filipino Mickey D's. It's not fusion or anything. Filipino, Filipino, Filipino! Pinoy! From the food to the old ladies that cut in line in front of you. And no, this is definitely not the best burger anywhere. Whoever says that it is is a liar...just because you saw Jollibee in Bourdain's show, doesn't mean you have to believe it. I would not recommend a Jollibee burger to anyone.I've had their Chicken Joy and that's alright.  I'm not a fan of Filipino spaghetti with the sweet sauce and red hotdogs (also made with worms according to my folks). The only thing I like from this place is Peach Mango Pie.Years later...parentless and living in Vegas...feeling like a rebel, I finally got the urge to try their burger. It's one of those "The Prodigal Son" moments where I was like "I should've listened to my parents". Pack this!

Review Text :
The theme of today's Yelp is: Know Thyself.Know thyself, filibertos.  Here's what you aren't: Houston's.  I don't need an open kitchen and I certainly don't need to wait for thirty minutes to get my burrito.Know thyself: you aren't so busy that you need to give out numbers and then call out the orders by their numbers only.  Hey, lady: no one wants the receipt.  We throw it away once you hand it to us.  We earnestly wish you never gave it to us in the first place.  So no, we don't remember the number.  We don't understand why you're so annoyed that no one is responding to you when you call out some number.  I ordered a sausage burrito, not a 1473, so I don't know why you're yelling out numbers and looking huffy.Furthermore, give us some visual cue: for example, if you ask me if I want it for here or to go, and I choose "for here," I won't think that a burrito in a paper bag is mine, no matter what number you're calling.Know thyself: at every other Filibertos, the food *is* the entertainment.  We go there to drown in a bliss that can only be made up of butter/greasy butter substitute and delightfulness.  Not for the TVs.  And when you have two TVs next to each other, you don't need the volume on for both.  Because this creates, at best, an Echo Effect.  This effect makes whoever is talking sound like God in some deus ex machina stage presentation.  Which is terrifying when it's the voice of Bill Austin on Beth and Bill.  I can only assume I have kicked one too many innocent dogs (I never kick dogs) and I am roasting in hell.  I would now like to trade in the eternity of Beth and Bill for an eternity of sixth degree burns, please.Here is the quintessential failure of this Filibertos: the food is shit.  The green sauce has the consistency of applesauce--a fact which makes me want to puke.  The burrito was filled with what can only be fake eggs, and tons of them.  Not much in the way of sausage and I'm pretty sure it was made of something that used to be someone's pet.  And the river of cheese on the side had coagulated.  Worst of all, the nefarious garlic monster has once again shat in my mouth and I now see plants wilting in my wake.Don't ever go to this place.  Use your mighty dollar vote and go elsewhere.  Because all the good that Filibertos has done in this world is under threat by this fucking impostor.--------My wife read the review, and by "read" I mean listened while I read it to her, and she fears I might be giving all Filibertos a bad name.  No.  Only this one sucks.  She says you should go to the one on McQueen and Pecos, and she is, as usual, right.

07/14/10 and 10/14/10!  (What a coincidence!  I did not plan the 3-month interval...)My first visit to T'GF was for Bastille Day, when Jeff K. and his food truck had a "taste-off" against Torched Goodness.  I found them both to be equally good that day, although Jeff was a little more generous w/ his frozen dessert sample compared to TG's thimble sample (TG was out of the two flavors I wanted to try)!  Since I couldn't decide which was better of the two, I didn't vote... Sorry, Jeff K.!I decided to try the Bastille Day dessert crepe, expecting I'd get a traditional crepe w/ vanilla ice cream.  Instead, I received a cup filled w/ ice cream and garnished w/ a sliver of a cookie and, I'd like to say, a raspberry coulis.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/truckin-good-food-phoenix?select=fOquGJdYwCwC7S489g_E9g#fOquGJdYwCwC7S489g_E9g  Delicious, but a bit too sweet!  (Yes, yes, Jeff K. did describe to me what I was going to receive before preparing my order, but I'd just had a sample of flan, which contains egg, of which I'm allergic to, that has many side effects, one of which is a lack of concentration!  Come to think of it, the ice cream probably consisted of eggyolks, as well.)My second visit to T'GF left me being a happier camper!  I had already checked out the website's menu and had two items in mind, but was sidetracked into ordering frites (potato fries cooked in duck fat).  I placed my order of a Brittany crepe, as well as one beignet, no powdered sugar.  After a few minutes, I'd remembered it was the panisse frites (chickpea fries) that I'd wanted to try, so I asked Jeff if it was too late to change my mind.  No, it wasn't too late!  Since there was a line of people before me waiting for their crepes to be prepared (I think they can only make two crepes at a time back there), I opted to pop inside Downtown PHX Public Market and have a go at the menu, as well.Stop the presses!  The Brittany crepe was tres magnifique!  It consisted of a buckwheat crepe filled w/ local Buckeye, AZ Crow's Dairy chevre, as well as a little buckwheat honey.  Food orgasm!  I'm definitely going to order this one again on my next visit!  The panisse frites were OK, albeit very, very mild-tasting.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/truckin-good-food-phoenix?select=svrAe4tRWFasRDLOHa6RIw#svrAe4tRWFasRDLOHa6RIw  While deep-fried, they weren't greasy at all.  They reminded me a bit of falafel, though definitely not as dense (far from it!) nor as flavorful as falafel.  I didn't find the light-as-air lemon-herb froth that accompanied the fries punchy enough to pair well w/ the crispy fries :(  Perhaps a creamier dip would suffice?  The curry mayo (which came w/ a fellow Yelper's frites) was a better match.  As for the beignet-- it looked delicious, but I couldn't try it since Jeff's assistant forgot to hold the powdered sugar.  Boo!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/truckin-good-food-phoenix?select=GCdX9u-msiqKqim1A2B4-A#GCdX9u-msiqKqim1A2B4-ASorry for not having a photo of the Brittany crepe-- once I'd had a taste of it, I didn't want to pause to turn on my camera phone.  (I figured I could always take one the next time I visit!  Hahaha!)  I bumped into Yelpers Dolores, Robyn, and Lynn, who later accepted my invitation to sit at my table and so was able to sample Robyn's frites w/ curry dip (the same dip I'd picked out initially before changing my mind!)  They're pretty good!  Thanks, Robyn!  BTW, thanks for the feedback on the beignet and its "super-yummy" caramel sauce!

Review Text :
My fiancee and I Decided to try this place out last night around 5:30-6ish. We were pleased to find we made it for happy hour. One bartender said hello to us and walked away. The other bartender didn't even acknowledge us for about 10 minutes. Keep in mind there were 6 people at the bar including the 2 of us and the bar is not big. We ordered beers and he handed us menus. We looked over the happy hour menu and were thinking of ordering something. While looking over the menu's the bartender was dropping F bombs and extrememly rude to another patron. Don't get me wrong, I drop F bombs quite frequently but never while i'm working, it's just bad taste....I dont care what kind of job you have.  Our beers were dry for a long time before the rude bartender even asked if we wanted another OR order food. My fiancee used the restroom and decieded eating here would be a bad idea as they were dirtier than dirty. Meanwhile a cook came out of the kitchen with food at sat at the bar to eat it. The rude bartender yells across the bar to the cook "COOKS CANT SIT AT THE BAR, NATES RULE".  Poor guy got up and sat at an empty table away from the bar. Again bad taste. At this point we decided we had enough of this place and would not be returning. EVER. I am thankful we didn't try the food. There are plenty of other dive bars in Chandler with good service and clean restrooms.

Review Text :
Aaaahh, Tempe, my old college stomping grounds.  Pizza.  Awesome.Thank you Eddie's pizza and lounge for pissing in the face of my college memories.For the better part of three weeks finding a vast array of coupons from this place all over my truck, typically five or six in the door handle and the all famous stack of them in the now bent windshield wiper of my truck, I decide to give this place a try.  I will take this regret to my grave.Five bucks for a large pizza and a drink, shit that is an awesome deal!  At least I thought it was.  I would have been better off giving my money to a bum and having him punch me in the nuts.  After calling the number on the coupon that littered my truck and parking lot, I decide to place an order for their special.  I ask if their coupon special includes delivery.  The girl answering the phone said "Really, well you are going to be waiting for a long time, it isn't that big of an order.  We don't like to deliver for the coupon special."  I assume that is the business equivalent of "Fuck no" so I tell her I'll just come pick it up.  I am told my order will be ready from 20 minutes to an hour.  Somewhat of a vast window, but I live close so I decide to request a dance from the devil.  The devil won.I show up about 30 minutes later (seemed reasonable) and was told I need to wait and was offered to rent a hookah while I waited.  Are you fucking serious?   Not wanting anyone to spit in my food, I politely tell her no and sit down on the couch to watch the game on T.V.  She then turns the channel to something else.Leaving 20 minutes later when my pizza is done, the cook comes out after handing it over to her, runs out, asks me what I ordered.  I tell him and he opens up the box again, looks at it, and says I am good to go.  I don't know what the hell that is about until I get home.Of course, they fucked up my order.  I'm not surprised or amused.  At least I got my can of soda.I take the pizza home.  Not what I ordered.  In retrospect, I should have put a Totinos in the oven.  This pizza tasted like a generic undercooked store brand pizza.  Not only was my order wrong, it was very undercooked.  I had to put it in my own oven when I got home, missing even more of the game.  I ate 3 slices and threw the rest away.  I didn't even want to give the leftovers to the dogs, they would probably bite me for feeding them that shit.  Seriously, how do you ruin pizza?  It is like toast.The food was shit, the service was even worse.  But that can of Mountain dew I got was nice and chilly.  At least they have that going for them.  You earned one star.  The coupons from this place no longer blow around the parking lot of where I live like tumbleweeds on a holy war of declaring jihad against tastebuds around the greater Tempe area, but the scars of eating here will remain forever.

DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE AT NIGHT!!! My wife and I came here because their sign outside said open till 10pm and we happened to be out for a late dinner, so we decided to stop here. We ordered our food at 9:15pm and got the food ten minutes later, and when we got it, it was packaged like a to-go order. I didn't make a big deal out of it so I took it to our table and started to open the styrofoam trays. When the cashier seen us about to eat, she says to us "You can't eat here, were about to close". So i informed her that their sign said closed at 10pm. She pretty much argued with me saying no, it says 9:30(even after I literally went outside and pointed to it)I have never been forced to leave a restaurant like that! Usually a restaurant will just lock the doors preventing further customers to come in. The employees were rude about it, and when my wife called the next day to talk to the owner, he showed no concern. Great way to lose business!!It pretty much ruined our dinner which was cold and soggy by the time we got home. Just beware...

Restaurant name  Ichiban Korean BBQ & Sushi

Review Text :
Ichiban has quickly become one of my favorite places for great food.  My work-mates and I go there at least twice a week for lunch.  Although the name implies Japanese, the owners are local Korean folk who are extremely friendly.  The food is made by them fresh, so you know it's authentic.  So what if their English is broken and hard to understand.  When it comes to the other International language, the language of food, it's easy to understand, and what they're dishin' out translates to "deliciousness" in my stomach!  I haven't tried their sushi but their traditional Korean fare is excellent- banchan (side dishes) with home made kimchi, kalbi (beef ribs), yoo ka jang spicy soup, seafood soon du bu (seafood spicy soup) are all at the top of my list.  The prices are reasonable and the service is very friendly.  I haven't been there in the evening but my friend Suejin highly recommends it as she's spent many an evening there, happily drinking soju and sake while tabletop-grilling kalbi.  And if you know Sue like I know Sue, you know she's one tough Korean cookie to please, and Sue is always pleased when she's at Ichiban.

I was looking forward to trying this place since I read about it in the 89148 Magazine back in February.  I love tapas and the menu looked so promising...carpaccio with truffle oil, grilled octopus with a red wine reduction, and chorizo clams in a white wine broth.  My mouth waters just thinking about these dishes and many more on Barcelona's menu, but I'm sad to report that this was one of the most disappointing restaurants I've ever been to!It just so happens that I recently acquired a coupon to this restaurant and went to it last Friday.  I just want to make it clear that I would have happily tried this place at full price, and the dish I was looking most forward to trying was the carpaccio (you just can't go wrong with raw beef and truffle oil...I'd hope).  My boyfriend and I were seated and greeted promptly.  When the server came over to take our drink order, he looked down at my coupon, took it and went straight to the kitchen.  Being a server for a long time, I could tell he was not happy that we brought this coupon, but I tried to remedy the situation by being extremely nice.  We ordered the carpaccio, pan fried dates, steamed clams, diabla shrimp, grilled octopus, sautéed tilapia, albondigas, and merguez.  After a short while the tapas started coming out, and after delivering the first wave, our server said, "I'm sorry, but the carpaccio is very popular and we are running out of it tonight."  I smiled and said disappointed, "oh really?" and he responded, "yes."  Both my boyfriend and I picked up on his wording, but we did not confront him about it.  It is my strong belief that they had enough carpaccio for AT LEAST another order, but they didn't want to waste it on a table with a coupon!  As the night progressed our server grew increasingly more impatient and annoyed with our presence.  When we got our check he had manually written in an 18% tip...on a table for 2, and I always automatically tip 20% (even when the service is bad)!  With a coupon or something comped, I usually tip much more because that's what fellow service industry workers do...(can you tell how livid I am?)  Unfortunately, I wish I could say that only the service was sub par, but the food ranged from ok to not even edible.Pan Fried Dates- This was the best dish we had from Barcelona.  The bacon was cooked well, all of the textures were spot on, and they had a nice savory sweet taste.  However, the red wine reduction was way too thin, the blue cheese crumbles were on the stingy side, and Firefly's are much better.Steamed Clams- The clams were cooked well, but the chorizo was very dry.  The broth also needed more seasoning (this is a common theme).Diabla Shrimp- I liked this, but again, it was not as good as Firefly's.  A nice spicy sweet sauce with shrimp, but the sauce was a little too thin.Grilled Octopus- This just lacked seasoning.  The octopus was a pretty good texture, not too chewy, but the flavor was bland.  For good grilled octopus, try Olives in the Bellagio.Sauteed Tilapia- Completely inedible!  I'm not sure if the kitchen just didn't care or if they genuinely made a mistake, but the outside of the fish was mushy and the inside was raw.  I've never seen fish this texture before, and I honestly can't think of how it happened.Albondigas- Meatballs in marinara with melted mozzarella on top.  These were so dry we drenched each bite in the marinara.Merguez- A spicy lamb sausage served over roasted red pepper couscous.  The sausage was dry and not very spicy.  The couscous was a little wet, but it had a good flavor.The one good thing about our experience was that the man refilling our drinks was extremely friendly!  He never let a drink go empty and explained they have live music some nights.  I really wish the food had been better so I could give this place a second chance.Returning from Spain only five months ago, we were craving tapas.  There aren't that many options for tapas in Las Vegas beyond the two Firefly locations.Barcelona Tapas and Bar gives us one other place to consider when you're craving small bites.Located in a busy strip mall where locals frequent, this restaurant had a few customers by the bar and dining when we walked in on a weekday night.I had a few things in mind immediately based on previous yelpers, so we got to ordering.  We munched on complimentary bread and spreads while we waited for our orders to arrive.* Beef Carpaccio "Thin sliced of tender tails drizzle with balsamic vinaigrette, truffle oil, tapenade, and fried onions" ($8) - I love beef carpaccio...when it's done right.  Yelpers raved about their version and sadly, we couldn't quite see why.  It's more like cured beef than raw beef, which is what we were expecting.  Not quite like beef jerky, but not delicate like what we're familiar with.  It was also covered with large shavings of cheese, which was not mentioned.   Not sure if this was to cover up the beef or enhance the taste.* Pastelillos de pollo (Chicken Cakes) "Chopped chicken, green and red onions, red pepper, chopped cilantro, black bean and corn salsa molded together and grilled served with gribiche." ($5.50) - Something a bit unusual that you don't see on every menu.  It's a bit misleading in its description since we were expecting all the ingredients to be 'molded together' to create a corn cake.  In actuality, the black bean and corn salsa are on the side of the corn cake.  Nonetheless, it was quite tasty with the accompanying egg sauce.  And it is only one corn cake.* Merguez Lamb Sausage "Served with couscous, and roasted pepper tomato sauce and a Merlot wine reduction sauce." ($7.50) - There was a distinctive lamb taste to it, and what I'm sure was some liver blended into the mixture.  The Husband isn't a fan of most livers so he was very aware of the funny taste to it.  Comes two in an order.* Pan Fried Dates "Pitted dates stuffed with almonds wrapped in bacon with merlot reduction and sprinkled with blue cheese crumbles." ($5.50) - Anything wrapped in bacon usually can't go wrong, and dates mix perfectly with bacon in this case too.  Comes five in an order.* Boquerones (White Anchovies) "Toasted French bread with a spicy aioli topped with sweet white anchovies and balsamic reduction sauce." ($5.50) - Anchovies were something we enjoyed everyday when we were in Spain, but we didn't know what took so long for this one order to come out.  The bread could have been toasted just a bit longer.  * Lomo a la parrilla (Petite Filet) "Mashed potato, mushroom and Merlot sauce." ($8.50) - Our final order, which we put in at the last minute.  It took a bit too long, and the waiter did come by to say it was coming out soon.  (It still took longer after that.  I can only assume that our order got stuck behind the larger parties that had come in after us.)  Another one of those dishes I ordered based on raving reviews, and sadly, it did disappoint.  We ordered it rare and although the center was pink, the outside was grilled a bit too long and thus hard.  We were impressed by how busy it got for a weekday night - and Barcelona Tapas & Bar does cater to families with plenty of large tables, high chairs, and a diaper changing station in the restroom.  Right now they are offering an introductory and temporary offer where kids eat free on Sundays through Tuesdays from 4 pm to 8 pm, for those 10 and under only and with a purchase of an adult entree.Service was okay - we asked our waitress for another set of silverware and she completely forgot about it.  (Immediately after we asked her, she went to sit a  party that arrived and never came back.)  We also had to ask for our beverages to be refilled.  The man who sat us did ask us how we had heard about them.  We also noticed the chef come by our table four different times to look at what we were eating, but never actually said anything to us.  Specials include:Mondays: Half off bottles of wine.Tuesdays: Half off their homemade Sangria.Wednesdays: Half off Martinis.Thursdays: Half off Mojitos.Fridays: Half off all their tapas from 4 pm to 6 pmSaturdays: Ladies Night with Half off all House drinks, wines and beer from 10 pm to 12 am.  Live music.Karaoke everyday (except Fridays and Saturdays) and tapas are half off after 10 pm.According to their website, they are open for lunch now - but their opening hours are still posted as opening at 4 pm.There are coupons everywhere for them - restaurant.com, local newspaper, and online.

Have to agree with other folks here. It's a hint towards great NY pizza, or perhaps another style of NY Pizza that I've yet to experience. Regardless, I'm a fan. It was pouring, bitter cold, I had been sick all day, and I wanted some effing pizza for dinner. These guys were awesome. Can't comment on dining at their home base on South Blvd, but the delivery, as was the product, was fan-freaking-tastic. Simple ordering. They deliver in a 5-mile radius from the shop. We're just in at 4.7mi. Score! We were quoted about an hour due to the weather and every other soul in Crown Town ordering pizza at that exact moment. However, our delivery guy showed up in about 40 minutes. Bless his heart, man. He was a trooper. Super nice guy, too.Went with the 18" (more like 18') white pizza -- add spinach AND tomatoes. You apparently get either/or. Also scored a slice of their stuffed pizza. First, the stuffed slice. Stuff is awesome. Manageable to pick up and eat like a normal slice, but fork and knife made it easier for dunking into the marinara. The marinara was a little watery for my liking, but not a deal-breaker. I inhaled it. Not just because it was the only thing I had eaten all day, either. The white pizza. Goodness gracious, it didn't even fit in the box! It was massive. Each of us ate one slice and called it quits. Had we some friends over it would have been gone, no doubt. Good luck tackling this monster with just two. The flavors were great. A little overzealous with the ricotta, but the garlic flavor was nice. I'd order it again, but not in the 18" variety. I'm a fan. I'd definitely count on these guys for trusty delivery yet again, but look forward to dining in house with a nice, foldable slice of cheese or pepperoni!

Review Text :
When you think of Soul Food, Catfish comes to mind. No, not the stupid reality show on tv but the real actual fish. Here they do have it with your choice of it fried or grilled. They also have Chicken n Waffles. I took my 12 year old son with me to check this place out. We did ended up getting the Catfish and the Chicken n Waffles.The Chicken n Waffles were pretty good. You get 3 nice sized chicken wings, a waffle, and eggs any style you want. The chicken was crispy and slight breading to it. The waffle was just ok. I was expecting to be at least a little more crispy than it appeared. The eggs we got scrambled. Nothing special to note there.The Grilled Cajun Catfish was good as well. Came with your choice of 3 sides. I picked Mashed Potatoes with Beef Gravy, Mac n Cheese, and Mixed Veggies. This is where I got really disappointed. The Catfish was decent but all the sides tasted a bit bland and was lukewarm. The veggies were definitely not fresh because it was partially soggy, it looked lifeless, and was chewy when I took a bite. The Mac n Cheese tasted like what I make my kids at home with the instant microwave stuff. It's not fancy but it is good enough for them. Here at a restaurant that is unacceptable. Last but not least, the Mashed Potatoes were a bit dry. Maybe they didn't put enough water or milk in the mix before putting it in the microwave?As for service, they are a bit slow here. We came in at 6:45 pm on a Tuesday night. There were only two other tables occupied at the time. We got our food I would say about 15 minutes later. After about 5 minutes both our drinks were empty. Another 5 minutes later I had to ask for a refill on both our drinks. Rule of thumb, if you have to ask for refills after so much time has passed, that is not good service. In closing, I would stick to ordering the Chicken n Waffles and Catfish. Stay away from the sides, well at least what I ordered. To be fair I cant assume everything was nuked. I also would like to try other items so I can give them the benefit of the doubt especially if it warrants updating this review. Until then, its 2 stars for me.Tradition. That is what this cute soul food cafe is steeped in. The menu is a tribute to a lovely NOLA influenced granny, RIP, who lived to the ripe old age of 97 1/2 and who apparently was a gifted cook.  These are her recipes. Consider yourself honored to meet her through her granddaughter's perseverence to share her food.Located on the north end of town, near Nellis AFB, this is a very attractive, clean, spacious eating establishment that should be taken seriously by locals and travellers as well. It is desireable not only for the food but for its location far from the craziness that is downtown and on the Strip. This is in the land of copius parking and chill attitude.The Catfish has a lovely cornmeal crunch, not at all greasy. It comes with great tasting tartar sauce and your choice of 3 sides.  The servings were so big I felt I was looking at them thru a magnifying glass.The braised oxtail came with 3 pcs as big as a fist and a choice of two sides. The meat was fall off the bone tender, and the pan gravy was plate lickable.Even the cornbread muffin was unique with an interesting crusty muffin top. Served with REAL butter.My mac n cheese side (oh my goodness wonderful) was made exactly as I crave, with lots of the right kind of cheddar cheese.The collard greens were tender and hammy and tangy. Oh so good.Then there was the fried cabbage with bacon.  I could eat that all day long.And yep, Mr B indulged in tasty Black Eyed Peas.I didn't, but if you want to see what all the hype is over chitterlings, you don't have to go down South. They have them here.They offer excellent service and a delightfully cheerful vibe.You have no idea what authentic soul food is about until you come here.  I have tried many places, but this ranks #1 for me.  I would definitely go out of my way to eat here again.Items Selected:Cornbread MuffinsFried Chicken, Chicken Gravy, Fried Okra, Mac n' Cheese, Candied YamsSweet Potato PieRed Velvet CakeTucked away in a strip mall on West Craig Road in North Las Vegas, but frequented by locals and those within the proper city limits for what some consider to be the best Soulfood in The Valley, it was just after 5pm that I entered the stripped down confines of  EllaEm's for a bite before dinner and although several take-out orders unfortunately caused a rather lengthy delay from the kitchen one would be hard-pressed to name another place offering a more authentic experience, particularly at such a price.Not at all billed to be the upscale experience of Yardbird and far less often discussed than either location of underwhelming M&M Soul Food Cafe found further South, it was at a four-top surrounded by a crowd of all ages and ethnicities that I was seated mere moments after entry and perusing the menu it a young Hispanic hostess offered smiling greetings before filling water and presenting the first of two rounds of complimentary cornbread muffins, each bite tinged with sweetness amidst a delicate yet toothsome base.Offering a la carte options, but generally a far better deal when ordered as a combo or traditional "Meat + 3," it was in rejecting temptation offered by fried pork chops as well as several other entrees that my original target of EllaEm's signature fried chicken was selected and although attempts to add-on a waffle were thwarted by poor kitchen timing the nearly thirty minute wait was rewarded by two legs and a thigh of crisply breaded brined bird, the spice profile well represented straight through the skin and into the flesh while sides of yams and fried okra were reference standard in execution, the man & cheese largely forgettable with overcooked noodles plus a soupy thin sauce.Apologies offered by the young server for the missing waffle and delays that were in no way her fault, there was little doubt that a meal at any Southern eatery was likely to end without a sampling of dessert, and although the lack of banana pudding would seem to be a serious menu oversight both the small slice of warm red velvet cake and one of Sweet Potato pie were far better than one may have expected, the former far sweeter than other cocoa-laden iterations while the latter atop a crisp and flaky crust impressed by taking the traditional savory route.****No doubt one of "Hidden Gems" of North Las Vegas, an area oft lamented for a dearth of quality places to dine, EllaEm's offers not only a relative bargain for the dollar but also some of the city's very best fried chicken and Red Velvet Cake, no small praise considering the omnipresence of each on menus throughout town.

Restaurant name  Touch of Thai

Review Text :
So before I start my review, I'd like let Yelp know that I don't appreciate my Thai Lahna review disappearing. Where is it Yelp? I just went to the Thai Lahna business page and I know FOR A FACT I left them one review AND one review update and a CTRL+F for "Georgeann" isn't highlighting anything on either page of reviews. I needed that review as reference for this review, as I don't want to hold Touch of Thai and Thai Lahna to different standards. HOW FAIR AND BALANCED OF ME. But I digress.So I originally was going to give Touch of Thai one less star than Thai Lahna. To me, the sauces just weren't as flavorful and the Thom Yom Gai wasn't as orgasmic. That's not to say it wasn't good. You know that saying "Sex is like pizza, even when it's bad it's still pretty good". Well, I've had some doughy, tasteless excuses for pizza and they were pretty damn awful, so I hereby propose to replace "pizza" with "Tom Yum Gai". I really feel like that could catch on.  Anyway, so with that in mind I was going to give this place three stars because I was PRETTY sure I gave Thai Lahna four (however, I have no way of knowing for sure because Yelp is censoring my shit like a god damn fascist). Upon further thought, I remembered that the main reason I gave Thai Lahna a star detriment was because of their kinda crappy service. Food takes a pretty long time and, while not rude, I wouldn't really call them "friendly" either. Plus, they only serve coke in a can. I've been in to Touch of Thai  for both eat-in and take-out and both times the service was fast and friendly, definitely nothing that would warrant a star deduction. So they go up to four stars, because that's pretty much what I'd give their food and with no service adjustments either way, I'd say that's fair.  To recapThai Lahna - One Star for Food + One Star for lack of service/fountain soda problems = Touch of ThaiI'd definitely go back. The great (albeit hidden) location right in Old Town, cute interior, and friendly service makes up for the minor taste issues. Besides, you know what they say about sex and Tom Yum Gai...

Restaurant name  Tokyo Sushi House

Review Text :
Like I suspected, the low ratings of this place was due to how typical and bitter the locals in this particular area are. I refer to this area of NW Vegas as the "Cheyenne Strip".  The "Cheyenne Strip" starts at the intersection of Cheyenne and Durango, and ends at the 215. The yelpers who live in this area are the harshest in the world.  If they liked a restaurant-the food was good,-but it wasn't their favorite, they will go ahead and give the restaurant a 1-star. If they really liked the restaurant and it's their top 10 favorite restaurant in Vegas, they will give it about 2 stars. They have no real structure on giving out 5-star ratings and will just randomly give out a rare 5-star if they are in a really good mood. That's why when you click on their yelp profiles, they have like 20-30 1-star ratings and like one or three 5-Star ratings. Also, check the reviews for every business located on the "Cheyenne Strip". Every business on this part of Cheyenne has an average of a 2 star overall rating. Are these ratings justified? Absolutely not! The residents in this area are those certain types of customers that are very difficult and impossible to satisfy. The Sushi here is not bad at all. And the prices are the best in town. Where else in Las Vegas can you get a $15.00 AYCE sushi deal? For some reason, TOKYO SUSHI HOUSE reminded me of one of these places but without the conveyer belt.  There are two Sushi houses in this area. The first being "Sushi Bomb" and the 2nd being TOKYO SUSHI HOUSE. A lot of people in the NW area compare this place to "Sushi bomb" and I think that's why many reviews are too critical. I actually decided to come here because "Sushi Bomb" gets extremely crowded during dinner hours, and like a lot of yelpers complain about, the wait time to get seated over there gets extremely long some nights. Sure, this place isn't a popular hangout for young people and pro-poker players like "Sushi Bomb" is, but at least it's half the price, you get seated immediately, and you get good tasting fish. Today, I was not in the mood for maki and wanted some good nigri. TSH, has a perfect selection of all nigri. They got everything from Albacore to Unagi, and the sushi chef sends it out fast. Also, the fish here at TSH is good-fresh seafood. There is nothing wrong with it like many NW yelpers claim. Many people try to compare the freshness to "Sushi Bomb" who actually kills some of  the fish the same day they serve it, but that's why that place is over $30.00 per person, and this place is only $15.00.  If you follow my reviews, you already know that I am very critical of how uncultured  people are who live in NW Las Vegas. Before I came here, I already knew that a lot of the bad reviews about "rude service" was just their cultural ignorance. The servers here don't have much English, and have difficulties understanding someone who is speaking really fast. So, she is not "stupid" or "being rude" if she gives you an incorrect answer to your question. BTW, the service to me was very good. There was never a moment that lasted more than a minute where my drink wasn't being refilled. I guess another plus about this place is that the Sushi Chef is very quiet and traditional. If you have mature older family members or young children, this place might be the best choice. At "Sushi bomb", some of the chefs are young and quite popular with the ladies, so you might hear him bragging about how he banged some chick the other night. In conclusion, TOKYO is definitely has a better atmosphere for families with young children.Most of the Sushi houses on the West Coast were originally established by Japanese nationals(not Japanese-Americans), and quickly sold to Korean-Americans. I don't understand why they always do this? Is this some kind of common investment by business men in Japan? I tried asking my Dad, my lawyer, and one of my best friends who are all Japanese-American, but because they were all born in Hawaii, they had no clue about why investors in Japan do this. Anyone know?So practically, I would say this is a good 4-star establishment, but I will give it 5-stars just to compensate for all the unjust 1-star ratingsNo...just no. Granted we came on a busy afternoon, and I will give credit where credit is due, overall there was just so much wrong with this place.The positive: The sushi chef was busting his butt to quickly fulfill the orders. There was constant hand washing by the sushi chef in between orders. The price of $15 for lunch was very appealing.The negative: The quality of sushi was among the lowest I have experienced. Not only was it mostly rice (explains the low price tag), but the rolls were so sloppy and kept falling apart. My soy sauce dish was completely filled with residual rice. Also, everything tasted mushy and the same with an overpowering amount of cream cheese. We sampled 5 rolls between us and honestly I can't say any of them stood out or would warrant coming back even if everything else wasn't wrong with this place. The salmon was fresh, the rest of the fish was not. The tuna was the mushy glob kind that they just throw on top of the roll..instead of you know, using actual tuna. It goes without saying that the crab was the fake krab kind.The service was non existent. I asked for a water refill twice, and never received it. The waitress was busy, but how hard is it to send someone from the kitchen to walk around with a jug of water and just refill the tables.Or she could have done it herself... it would have taken 3 minutes tops.  As I was leaving, someone actually got up with their empty glass and approached the kitchen area because they had been waiting for a refill during the entirety of their visit. The best part was the auto gratuity added by "accident"...$6 on a $30 order. When I looked at it and laughed she took it back and apologized for the "mistake". Right.... yes let me give you a 20% for doing absolutely nothing for me, not even refilling my water glass. So shady!We tipped the sushi chef directly as he was busting his butt and actually serving us. I will not step foot in this place again.

After seeing this place reviewed on Yelp, I felt it was time to stop by and check it out.  I'm a burger loving kind of gal, and am always on the hunt for a good peice of meat.  This place definately has it going on.After finding a place to park in the garage, I wandered into Smashburger and was happy to see that it was a clean new place. Ample menu of items to choose from, with a small variety of burgers, a hot dog or two and some chicken options as well.I was torn between the BBQ burger and the All American.  I went with the All American, and boy, was it good.  Good came out quick and service was great.  Ya know what else?  They had a bunch of Yelp pens here at the register!!  This brought a smile to my face! Yippie!What I really liked about this place is the burger is juicy, and not dry or "corporate" tasting.  I didn't feel like it was to greasy either.  I found it to actually have flavor on its own as well.  Worth a stop here.I should also mention that this is review #300 for me.  Ya wanna know what else?  I hit 3000 miles on my car yesterday.  Cool, huh?  Possibly a sign, but quite cool that I am doing review #300 and hit 3000 miles on my car in the same day.  Cool.Burgers in my mind are supposed to be grilled over a flame, thick and medium rare. Served with a toasted bun, american cheese with let/tom/pic/mayo and mustard. (It's my review)SB does most of it perfectly. The Bun is a yellow egg bun, toasted and topped with all the required toppings. The toppings were all fresh and very good, including the cheese. The burger, while it is a 1/2 l/b about 1/3 was lapping over the bun. It is a thin, flat fried burger, sort of crispy on one side too. While not my preferred, it was still a good tasting burger. Just not great. IMHO Five guys is better if fried burgers are your thing. The staff was great. The management was great, the place was pretty clean the price was high for what I recieved. $6 burger $1.80 drink.  (it was plenty of food though)3.86 stars

So as you are all aware, football season has commenced.  Now that my roomie and I have NFL Sunday TIcket we are going to be spending football Sundays at home much more often than at the sports bars.  This means having a place that delivers good pizza and wings is a must!We were pleasantly surprised to discover this location delivers to our residence.  I think they have a larger grid than most delivery places which is awesome.  I really can't think of a place that meets all the criteria my roomie and I have to really like a pizza delivery place.  Price, quality, taste, and service are all above average here.  We ordered one of their specials which was an X-Large one topping pizza with 24 wings for 23.99 and a 2 liter of coke.  With taxes, delivery charge, and tip the total came to $34.00.  We ate the pizza and wings for lunch and dinner yesterday, some friends munched on the food too and we STILL have leftovers.  At least half a pizza and a dozen wings.  I would call that getting your money's worth. The pizza doesn't taste generic like the big chains I dare not order from.  I really like the dough, crust, sauce, and cheese.  I also like that they don't COVER the pizza in pepperoni (not a fan but I was outvoted).  Is there better pizza out there? Yes.  But this does exactly the trick on a football sunday.  The wings are delicous.  We had the medium sauce (which they do not skimp on) and it had the perfect amount of heat to it.  There were A LOT of drums which I found surprising.  And these wings came from some fatty fatterson chickens, they are very big and meaty!  Score, score, and score!  One slice of pizza and two wings did me in (I'm sure the beer helped!)Also they gave a delivery time estimate of 45min-1hr and they delivered in less than 40.  Yes, I was keeping track.  Major points scored here. Barros will be getting regular delivery calls from us for the rest of football season!

If you are unfamiliar with Korean cuisine, this would be a good place to start.  What's great about this place is its super low key.  It's situated in a really run down plaza so you wouldn't even know it existed.  Honestly, you would have to do a Yelp Search just to find out.What I like:+ Bibimbap: It's pretty good here, the flavors shine through while keeping the rice slightly crisped for that stone cooking taste.  I can have these weekly!+ Banchan: super good+ Ambiance: its dimmed and chill+ Staff: I've always come here late so I've only known the one lady that takes your order, she is super sweet.+ Hours: Opens till 2am daily.  Awesome! If I ever have a late night crave, I'm coming here for sure+ Pricing: Not terrible but reasonable.The menu  offers plenty of your typical Korean and more.  This place is legit, so if you never had, drop by.Café Ga Hyang was the placed picked for the 5th meet up for the International Supper Club UYE, and I have to say I am extremely thankful for all those who attend!! You guys are amazing!!! Thank you!!Ok like I said Café Ga Hyang was the placed picked, and when I originally called to make reservations for the group, I requested 14, but by the time it was dinner, we had grown to 18!!! Had to have an extra table added to us! Café Ga Hyang was helpful in that and didn't really make a fuss about it!This was my 1st time ever for Korean food, so I was very unsure of what to order, so after looking at the menu I decided to go with Bul Goki, which was sliced beef marinated in a soy sauce base of sorts on a bed of grilled onions, came with a side of steam rice too. In my head I was thinking oh this is like fajitas and I like fajitas. The dish came out piping hot! And I have to say, it was very good!Our server, whom I figured was also owner, was kind of gruff, not so much with the amount of people, just with everything I guess, but sometimes she would come across mad and not listening to you, but then friendly and helpful. I just was not trying to rock the boat haha, the little side dishes came out and she placed them on the table but told us not to eat them, they are for when our food comes out, but some tested the gods and took some of the tofu before our food came out, we were making jokes saying the soup nazi will kick you out! Over all it was a great experience, I would go back and try different dishes, everything looked amazing! it was a great meet up  for the International Supper Club!Please don't judge this place by the "I'm entitled to everything because I'm the customer and the customer is always right" mentality, because the ladies don't give a crap.  If you're hungry, they'll feed you.  If you're looking for the royal treatment, go somewhere else.  This place reminds me of a lot of the restaurants in Korea, where ahjumma's () take your order and treat you like a niece or nephew.  At least they bring you water; a lot of places in Korea are self-service.  In that regards, I can say this place is the most authentic Korean restaurant in the state.  Also, they're open until like 2 AM.  Hell yes.  Most of the food is great.  I'm Korean, and I've tried most of everything on the menu. Yes, their kimchee-jjigae is made differently than my moms, but it's still tasty as hell.  So are a lot of the other dishes and banchans.  You can't expect the same style of Korean food in every restaurants, considering even in the tiny country of Korea, there's an estimated 200 types of kimchee.  That's not accounting for how each family makes theirs a little differently.I'll give you a quick rundown of all the dishes I can remember.Sullung-tang(/):  The one soup I was disappointed with here.  The broth is weak and not very flavorful.  It's so simple and yet so difficult to get this soup right.  It's no wonder there are many restaurants in Korea that specialize in this one soup only.  Galbi-tang():  My go-to soup.  OMG this soup is good.  Go have some and thank me later.  Best combo bite with this: put your rice in the soup.  Get a spoonful of soup and rice and then place a nice fermented piece of kimchee/ggahkdugi on top.  Then place in mouth.  Chew and moan.  Repeat.Shrimp gganpoongi ():  Every person I've taken to this place has loved this.  So much pepper and garlic on it, and yet so good.  They don't skimp out on the shrimp nor the quality/size of the shrimp they use.  Worth every penny.  Don't get as a main dish because that's weird.  Order one for the table and share.  Ddukbok-i ():  I order this without fail every time I go as the standard starting dish.  It's slightly different every time, because it's actually cooked here with fresh veggies and peppers.  So so good.  Again, order this as something to share with your loved ones, ordering it as a main dish is weird.dolsot galbi bibimbap ():  This sizzling bowl of rice with assorted veggies and rib meat is amazing.  See the red ketchup bottle she gives you?  It's not ketchup.  It's magical pepper paste sauce.  Squeeze a pretty pattern on your bowl and mix.  Borrow your neighbors spoon.  It's easier.  Just give them the spoon back full, not empty.  soon dae guk ():  Pork blood sausage soup.  The sausage isn't homemade, but I don't expect it to be.  It'll do to satisfy my craving for it while I'm away from Korea.  The soup?  Amazeballs.  Fresh perilla leaves with roasted seeds gives this soup a new taste you've probably never tasted before.   Jjam-bbong():  It's never been my choice, since I've always been on the Jjajangmyun () side of the Jjajang or Jjambbong (  ?) choice.  Huuuge portions though, and everyone I've seen that ordered it loves it.  If you love seafood and noodles, this is for you.Jjajangmyun (): I've tried this once and didn't really care for it.  Not bad but not amazing like some of the dishes I've reviewed above.  Another reason many restaurants in Korea specialize in this dish.  It's the #1 delivery food in Korea.  Jaeyook-bokkeum ():  stir-fried well-ripened kimchee and pork-belly pieces are a little sweet for my taste but still very good.  One downside, they are very stingy with the meat in this dish.  You've got to go fishing around for it and there's not much to go around.  I've ordered this 2-3 times and it hasn't changed.  Final word:  The Korean law of "Jung" () dictates that when you go enough to be a regular and develop a likable relationship with the staff, the number and amount of premium side dishes and meat chunks in your galbi-tang or fish cakes in your ddukbok-i doubles.Edited:  I typed in all the Korean in parentheses, but I guess yelp doesn't support it.Horrible, just horrible! Went there last night for Korean food and the lady server was so mean to us we had to walk out of there while waiting for our food.First of all, when I asked her about the menu and what her recommendation was, she was like "What do you want me to say? Just order what you like." OK, shook my head and ordered. Then we asked for ban-chan and she said she is not going to give it to us until we get our meal and that we had no common sense. She tried to give us a full lecture about how traditional way of eating Korean food should be. I did not go to this restaurant to get a lecture from this lady. I am Korean and I know how to eat Korean food! I have never received this kind of customer service in my life and I really think this lady needs to learn the basics of customer service. I'm from New York and I thought at least the people would be nicer than this. This is truly a shame that she treats people of her own kind like she did. People, be aware of this restaurant and go to Ohya restaurant which we went to after we escaped this hell hole. The customer service was amazing at Ohya! I don't know if the food might have been better at Cafe Gahyang but I certainly do not want to eat at a restaurant that has a kind of service she provided. Good thing I don't live around this area so I don't have to think about going back there LOL

Review Text :
Finally, after four years in Pittsburgh, I found a real Hispanic grocery store, and it comes with a real taco stand.  I've been grudgingly going to a well-known place in the Strip that charges 20-50% more for a not-so-great selection, but I shall shop there no more now that I've found Las Palmas.  Fully stocked grocery store with great produce (huge pile of tomatillos) and meat - everything you need to make that recipe you found in your favorite Diana Kennedy cookbook.  (Cheap Inca Kola!  Found my fix.)Most of you are more interested in the tacos, and I'll confirm that you can't go wrong there, either.  Real tacos - I tried puerco, barbacoa, and asada.  All were very good; the pork was exceptional - muy rica.  These are the real deal for street tacos, too - just like what I found in Atlanta and San Diego in past lives.  Only $2 (never pay $3 for a taco), and they're stuffed with easily twice as much fillin's as what you'll get at any other taco place in town.  (Note to their competition: tacos shouldn't be huge, but they're not appetizers, either.  I'm tired of eating three at the trendier places and still being hungry.  Four with no sides should completely stuff an adult male.)  The "fixin's" station is nice, too - faster and easier than having to wait on "the guy" to put it on.Four stars for the grocery store and five for the taco stand.  (...And the grocery store takes credit cards.  Hint, hint to all the local shops/restaurants that don't.)I had heard rumors about these delicious tacos.  But I didn't really fully understand it until I had them today.  Today I fully understood their deliciousness.  It's such a simple thing.  One stands at taco stand.  One looks over delicious looking meat.  One chooses between a couple different delicious looking meat including steak and onions, sausage and pork.   One receives taco and walks over to a neat and clean looking buffet of delicious looking toppings.  These toppings include salsa, salsa verde, gauc, tomatoes and onions.  One devours tacos in an animal like fashion because... they're delicious!So for serious, they rocked my world!  And at $2 a pop you can buy a ton without breaking the bank!  I had the steak and the pork.  I liked the pork more because it was uber flavorful.  I also loved the toppings bar because I LOVE to dump toppings on as well.  Although at two tacos I stuffed myself and was full for hours (which does not usually happen!).  Do they beat out Reyna's tacos?  My answer would be they're on par but on different levels because they're just a different style.  That's just my observation.  The more taco stands, the merrier if you ask me.  Bring it tacos!Thank You Las Palmas.Thank you for answering the unsatisfied craving for quality authentic West Coast Mexican food I've had for years since leaving Orange County.Thank you for being that cheap (read $6 for 3 tacos) staple quick food fix when I don't feel like taking the car or bike out to grab some grub.And thank you for offering not only a great taco stand with a variety of fresh simple dressings, but also an always fully and freshly stocked ethnic grocery store where I can find hard to get items for a quarter of the price that competitors charge.As I've watched you expand over the past 3 years...  just PLEASE do me a favor, don't lose sight of what makes you great!Las Palmas is the platonic ideal of the ultimate mexican taco stand.  I'm normally not even a taco fan, but they take it to a completely different level, every savory bite is a transformative flavor experience.  Here is Las Palmas by the numbers:1 other mexican restaurant's all-mexican staff that told me Las Palmas is where THEY all go out to eat2 dollars is the price of each taco.  Each taco is actually wrapped with 2 hand made soft taco tortillas and have a double portion of meat (potato salad is an option for vegetarians), so it's more like 1 dollar per standard size taco.  Gourmet, fresh, delicious mexican at cheaper than taco bell prices!4 is how many tacos I ate.  I ordered 2, left, ate them, and immediately returned to buy more to go to bring home for dinner that night!10 is how many different fresh toppings they have, guacamole, peppers, limes, cilantro, onions and a variety of salsas from mild to absolutely DEADLY hot habaneros!7 is how many days a week I'd happily eat Las Palmas tacos!After living in San Diego for a few years, I was in desperate need of an authentic TJ Style taco, and I have found it here! They serve traditional street style tacos with all your typical toppings. If they man working there tells you a salsa is hot, take his recommendation and don't pour it all over your taco, because chances are, it's really freaking hot!I recommend beef tongue if they have it, but if not, chicken is my second choice. No other Pittsburgh taco place compares to Las Palmas for me! The tacos are $2.50 and 2 will fill me up. (Cash Only for tacos, cards inside the store)

5/19/102.5 stars.Didn't really care for the interior, and the tables outside weren't beckoning, either.  It was very antiseptic and cold indoors, with only the menu handwritten on the chalkboard, the plain-looking pastry display case (devoid of any ornamentation or even a sign of any effort in making everything inside presentable), and, what looked to me, an antique-looking espresso machine on the counter to lend decoration to the all-white interior.  It was also very noisy indoors, despite the fact that there were only a handful of people!  Ordered the Mascarpone and fig jam on marble rye ($4) and the Lox w/ cream cheese and tomato ($8 or $9), as well as a latte, no sugar.  The coffee came in a paper cup... why?  Made me feel like she wanted me to leave.  Loved the mascarpone and fig!  (So much so, I soon acquired a jar of organic fig jam from Whole Foods, but I need to find good marble rye toast...)  The lox, however, was disappointing.  While I found the flavors palatable, I thought the lox strips were too thin (I had lox at True Foods Kitchen that were wild-caught and larger for only a couple of dollars more), and the cream cheese rectangles looked strange with its right angles (after seeing such a lovely presentation done w/ the Mascarpone and fig jam).  Made me wish I'd had two sets of the toast!It was nice to see that they still roasted the coffee beans on-site.  I wish nothing but success to Toast, but I won't be going back-- at least not for a good long while...

$9.99 All-You-Can-Eat Dinner Buffet w/Crab LegsIf you like Chinese food like sweet n sour chicken,lots of seafood stuff like crawfish,crab legs,shrimp and fish.They did have bbq pork but it was kinda tough.Several different soup options, around 60 items to choose from total. Pretty standard chinese buffet fair.They do cook Mongolian "made-to-order" and they have soft serve ice cream.Really can't complain for $10 pp but I'm no fan of asian food to start this certainly did nothing to change my mind.Pretty boring and fishy! But still good cheap eats for those that like Chinese Cuisine.

WHERE: Durango & Warm Springs (in the Vons center right next to Cold Stone Creamery)WHAT: I came here to eat once with my friend. We were both first-timers so ofcourse we had to do AYCE!! The only things worth remembering was the service was great!! (Made me bump one up on my star rating)The food, on another note, was good. The mochiko chicken appetizer was bombness!! I tried a couple of their specialty rolls, and I don't know if it was me, but they all started tasting the same!!I may have to go back and eat there again to actually remember my likes and dislikes, but the only thing I can remember was that it was one of the okay sushi places I've tasted!Oh!! One of the best things there was the Ahi Poke!!! If you love Ahi Poke as much as I do, then that definitely is a MUST! =DCan't go wrong here great sushi at a cheap price! The staff is always friendly and are on top of their game when it comes to service. Now as far as the food it's good quality and always fresh! I only come during happy hour and I always get the garlic chicken which is full of flavor and very tender plus it's only $2.95 I believe which is craziness! I also order the crunch roll which is like 3 bucks and I order the deep fried Cali roll which is delicious and also costs like 2.95. So I end up getting 3 different items for the price of 1 roll at every other sushi place. Good sushiGood service Good prices Can't go wrong here!Never had a worse experience at any restaurant. The main thing that rattled my nerves was the service. I had recently moved into the neighborhood and had a late-night sushi craving, so I thought I would try this place out. When I walked in, I noticed right away that it looked like this place was being ran by a bunch of kids. Granted, the hostess/server didn't do anything wrong, they certainly weren't inviting. I sat myself at the sushi bar. After looking over the all you can eat menu, i told the waitress that i had decided to do that. They informed me that it was just a little passed 10pm and that last call was 10:30. I have been to a few all you can eat sushi places in Vegas around closing and understood the last call rule, but the way the said it to me made me feel like I was inconveniencing them. Let me first start by saying, the menu was very limited compared to other sushi establishments around the city! I was sitting (literally) right in front of the two sushi 'cooks.' Neither of them acknowledged me, but instead were speaking about some of the tables in the restaurant, making fun of them, and bad-talkng the hispanic cooks in the kitchen line behind them.After about 5 minutes of just sitting there, the server came by and took my order. I was craving a baked roll--like a lasagna. They had one similar, so i ordered that, along with a couple others. Right when one of the cooks (bigger guy that seems to have been in charge) saw my order, he told me he couldnt make that roll because he was out of scallops. I know, for a fact, they didn't run out of scallops because I saw one of the prep cooks with them. For whatever reason, they just didn't want to deal with it. Anyhow, I ordered something in place of that roll. While waiting and observing these guys go back and forth about how they cant wait to get out and huffing and puffing every time someone ordered something else, I couldn't help but to think "why am i spending money in this place?!" I sat there for seriously just about 10min for two rolls. When I was finished with those, I was expecting my other to come up...waited for another 10 minutes before the 'cook' realized he forgot to start making it.To shorten up this review a bit, I am gonna leave it at that. The service was awful and the food was crap. Please people, drive a little further and spend your money at Goyemon (or even Oyshi)! At least you know they appreciate your business, you'll get good service and the food is great (speaking of Goymeon).

Restaurant name  Over Easy

Review Text :
We've driven by the PHX Over Easy many times but I refuse to wait for it.  I knew in my heart that it wasn't the same type of food worth waiting for like Matt's.  We decided to head way out to the apparently non-popular Over Easy to see what all the fuss was about.  To sum it up, just don't bother!We walked inside and the place was only about 1/2 full so we grabbed a seat in the middle where there were three terribly placed tables.  My first impression was not a good one, as this restaurant is horribly under utilized and very poorly planned.  The color scheme was nice and cheerful though.  I really really hated the vinyl chairs that clung to my legs.  It was really uncomfortable.After perusing the menu for a few moments I decided that the Wolf Pack was the way to go for me.  I like big manly breakfasts and this sounded perfect!  Two layers of hash browns with bacon and eggs cooked to order in the middle with cheese on top.  Yum!  That really sounded delicious to me, unfortunately it was a big heaping pile of FAIL slopped on a plate.  The bacon was about the only good part of my meal.  The cheese tasted like plastic, the eggs were rubbery, and the hash browns were so greasy that they slicked my lips with oil after every bite.  In the end, despite the fact that I only ate about 1/3 of my food, I got sick.  I was not a happy camper and I will never come back.NEEDS A NAME CHANGE ....... to Over RatedA military mess hall, has more class then this anomaly.    OVERLY rated ......    OVERLY poor service .......    OVERLY misrepresented by the Food Network    OVERLY priced .......    OVERLY praised ......    OVERLY poor location ......    OVERLY not worth another visit .......I can only OVERLY warn others .......... To stay away..My Ethics .... My Standards:Every business starts with one star ..... GETTING MORE .... HAS TO BE EARNED.Food is decent. Service is slow and unresponsive. They brought half our food and then we had to sit and stare at our food over 8 minutes before the other half came. It took three asks to get syrup. The server wrote our order wrong. They have a tight waiting area which feels right on top of people eating.Let me clarify one thing. Breakfast is my favorite meal but I never real make it out for breakfast cause I like to sleep in on the weekends. Saying this. I was watching Triple D on the Food Network and saw this place. Home made everything. So the next day I had to go out of my way for brunch to try this place out. OE was hard to find but it's between the Ice Den and Mountainside Fitness. There was so many good dishes on Triple D I couldn't decide. So I went with Chicken Fried Steak, scrambled eggs, and hash browns. All I have to say is oh my gosh Yum Yum. CFS was so good but the gravy made it great. Gravy was home made with chunks of sausage. The hash browns are home made too and outstanding. My wife had the home made corn beef hash with poached eggs, and sweet potato tots. Great dish too. CFH was really good and the tots was really delish. My daughter had the Wolfpack with hash browns, eggs and bacon. She gobbled it down and the bacon was thick and really good. Service was really good. We only had to wait a few minutes to get our table. Once seated, we were served right away. Drinks were refilled on a regular basis. Brunch was so good. I can't wait to go again and try more dishes. All I can say is great breakfast joint so enjoy.The food was good and I liked the place, but if you walk out from your meal feeling angry, it's hard to give any more than one star. We had a Living Social deal. I guess they wish they hadn't sold them because when I got my check there was a "$4.00 service charge". When I asked about it, I was told that they impose what amounts to a 40% tax on the deal "otherwise we don't make any money"That is not disclosed anywhere so I'm disclosing it here.

Wow...I was absolutely blown away by this little treasure on Morehead. Holy deliciousness, Savor Cafe!Let me first establish (my) rules for eating at Savor Cafe:1) You must save room and daily caloric intake for...       a) their house made strawberry lemonade (it's incredible)       b) their desserts...I practically licked the plate2) Take the server's suggestions - she didn't steer me wrong even onceSo, now that that's established here's what I devoured at Savor Cafe:1) Farmers sandwich: Big, thick slices of fresh mozzarella and tomato accompanied by fresh basil and set between two of the most delicious slices of herb topped focaccia I've ever tasted. This tasty sammie also came with a side of my choice...2) Mac 'n cheese: Sooooo rich and buttery I could only manage a few bites as I was making sure to save room for....3) Peanut Butter pie: OMG. An extremely generous portion of heaven on a plate. Creamy peanut butter pie (made with cream cheese) and a chocolate crust. For $5 this was out of control. YUM.Oh I will be back, Savor Cafe, I'm going to be back to your adorably appointed, sweet little cafe in absolutely no time flat.

Review Text :
Inside the Rivers Casino there are several restaurants, Andrew's Steakhouse being the 'High-End" restaurant among them. We have been here oh, I'll just say numerous times, including fourth of July to eat and watch the fireworks. How do you see the fireworks, well the backside of the restaurant is all floor to ceiling windows looking out over, across, up and down the river. Also there is a backside patio dining area under cover but with outstanding views including up the Mt. Washington hillside. In this warm months this is a very pleasant or even perhaps an outstanding al fresco dining scene.So what do I like best here; the food and views.And the least, a bit noisy from the casino and intermittently slow service.Our usual starting place would be the Bluepoint oysters on the half shell, which are always nicely presented and tasting fresh out of the water. They are accompanied by Cocktail sauce, Mignonette, and Horseradish sauce. Some of our other favorite starters are the French Onion Soup with Applejack Brandy, and Calamari which is served with Lemon Aioli and Arrabbiata sauce dipping which has a nice complexity and heat to it. The Calamari is delicious and very tender.We alternate between the salads all of which are pretty good. I especially enjoy the beet salad. This has read and yellow roasted baby beets, with goat cheese, frisee and arugula and a Sherry vinegar reduction. These flavors all work together so nicely.So far, we have not tried the seafood, chicken or burgers. But the Steaks, Prime rib and the Lamb are what we are drawn to.The Bone In Ribeye done medium rare is just bursting with flavor and practically melts in your mouth. This is an outstanding steak, one which I come back for often.Linda loves the Rack of Lamb. This Lamb is mild, tender, beautifully prepared and very delicious for you lamb lovers. We have had Lamb all over the country and this stands up to the best we have had including Jamison Farms (actually from here in Latrobe, but served around the country in the best restaurants, and Elysian Fields (also local to Green county and served in around the United States). Example, Thomas Keller famed Chef of the French Laundry in California serves Pennsylvania Lamb.One other item worthy of note, there is a very great bar in here with seating and several High-top tables. Overall this is a very good choice if you are seeking the high-end steakhouse kind of dinner and experience. I think the Ribeye here might be the best int he city.

I can't stand the owner here after a few short or I mean alot of short comings here I finally complained brought my pizza to them after being delivered and they are a total rip off and all the owner could tell me was"THIS IS MERICA BABY" THAT'S WHAT WE DO! This place is total b.s. And they wouldn't remake my pizza after I complained one of my extra toppings I paid for wasn't on the pizza but then again he did pick his hands through my pizza and found one... Lol UN believable then told me to take it back...I told him I wouldn't even feed my dogs his pizza keep it and leftFound this place via Yelp search after a long day at work, no lunch break, and a killer wing craving- unfortunately, the wings offered here are not buffalo style, as I assume when ordering wings at a pizza place.Order of wings for one comes with a side of fries (option for regular, curly, or upgrade to onion rings) containing 8-10 pieces per their website. Sauce options are medium, mild, hot, and bbq. The "hot" wings are  sauced prior to baking, and overcooked to the point of being dry, sauce itself seems to be sriarcha-based and includes red pepper flakes- a combination I've never seen or heard of on wings. Unpleasant at best, ended up tossing half the order despite my hunger.Curly fries were decent- then again, they were my only option. Ample portion, would prefer ketchup packets to the weird shot glass of ketchup I actually received, but an order of fries won't make me a repeat visitor.Location is small but decently clean, cashier was polite. Group of smokers on the patio made for an unpleasant smoke odor- may have been employees as one of the group got up, entered the dining room, went behind the counter and removed a bottled beverage from the cooler, then went outside to drink it, without saying a word to me as I waited to pick up my order. "Bizarre" describes both the location and the wings.

Review Text :
Pretty good!  This is one of those neighborhood restaurants where the servers know practically every customer.  So it did feel like we were crashing a party.  Still, the baked clams (oreganate, whatever that means) and eggplant parmigiana were both amazing and the service was good.  And they serve red wine at the correct temperature (slightly chilled).  Amazing!Interesting dessert options that I did not get to try.  Roasted banana gelato, for example, sounded yummy but we were just too full from the fried food.Full liquor license but I didn't see an actual bar.  There is a bar that overlooks the kitchen but I couldn't figure out where the alcohol was coming from.The hostess looked like she wanted to kill me in my sleep, though.  That was a little awkward.  Still, a good neighborhood joint.It's located in a strip mall and doesn't look like much, but the interior is sleek, modern, and beautiful. On the Sunday night we were there it was surprisingly busy with most of their tables full by 7pm.I got one of their specials, a seafood risotto ($30) full of squid, scallops, mussels, and shrimp. There was rarely a bite without seafood. Unfortunately, it was bland and forced me to do what I rarely do in any restaurant -- reach for the salt shaker. I had to use it several times to liven up the dish. The portion size was huge, but it also lacked the creaminess of a great risotto.If you're a fan of chicken parmagiana, the one here is bound to please with a zesty and full bodied sauce. I can't remember having a better version anywhere in town. It was accompanied by a huge side of spaghetti, which made for some great left overs the next day.They do have a kid's menu with a few pasta options.3.5 StarsI tried this place for the first time tonight and it was alright. Service was good, everyone was friendly and water was kept full. Going over the menu I was a little surprised to see some appetizers in the $20 range but the entrees were reasonable averaging $18-25 and a little more if you chose seafood or steak. I ordered the Chicken Parmigiana including  a side of fettucine with marinara sauce. It was pretty good! Large portion and perfect amount of mozzerella. However the tomato sauce was very watery and the pasta was definitely undercooked. My boyfriend ordered the Pork Tenderloin with apricot sauce and said the flavor was good. However, portion wise, looked pretty funny next to my chicken parmigiana. Very tiny!!  McDonald's burger patties were thicker than these tenderloin slices lol. He also had the same problem with his pasta side of being undercooked.Honestly, I probably wouldn't come back here again since this area has tons of options but I'm glad we gave it a try.One of my new favorite places to eat. The service was excellent and so was the food. The restaurant itself is nice with very modern decor. I wasn't crazy thrilled about the music. It was very "elevator type". The jazzy kind that puts you right to sleep. Other than that, our waiter was super attentive. A bit eccentric, but was very on top of his tables. We had:Caesar salad. It was good, but it was pretty overpriced for how small it was. It was the size of a small side salad for $12. The crab cocktail. Again, it was overpriced for how little of crab you get. It's maybe 1-2 full snow crab legs for $21. That's just silliness. For the entrees - oddly enough, they're decently priced. The Shrimp and Scallop Vodka Penne - very yummy. Would recommend on angel hair pasta. Sea Bass Picatta - Mother, this was good. The Seabass just melts in your mouth...better than chocolate. I love any white fish with a good citrus butter sauce. So freaking excellent. Overall, everything was good. We were super happy with our experience.Seafood is the name of the game here at Mastrioni's. We dined here for lunch during a work lunch and I made reservations ahead of time. We arrived early and there was no wait but the restaurant filled up quickly. Despite arriving before the crowd we were a little disappointed to get very little attention there at first. Drinks, menus and bread were slow to come.  Once we got the attention of our waiter it was still slow to get appetizers and entrees ordered but we were happy to indulge in bread as we waited.Our entire table ordered fish dishes. I went with the halibut piccata and we shared the bruschetta as an appetizer. The bruschetta had a huge amount of tomato. It was delicious. The fish was well prepared. I enjoyed everything about my meal. The service was lackluster but I am still excited to come back and try them again.

Came here with a bunch of Broncos fans for the AFC Championship game and they did a nice job making us all feel at home, with plenty of shout outs over the PA to get our group riled up.  Connolly's Sports Grill is a pretty comfortable sports bar with plenty of TVs.  The food was decent, but portions are a little on the small side for a sports bar.Went with an order of the potato skins, which were very small for the price.  There were only 4 of them, but they were good.  Real bacon always helps.  Next up was a chicken philly, made with cheese wiz, like they do in Philly (although other cheeses are an option if you wish).  I thought this was one of the better chicken philly's I've had, chopped up and sautéed with onions and bell peppers, served on a nice soft roll, with the cheese wiz holding everything together nicely.And now for the joke of the day....someone at our table ordered the fish and chips.  While nobody complained about the flavor of the fish and chips, one piece looked a little suspicious in shape.  Could it be?  Did they confuse the fish and chips order and give us....Spotted Dick?  As soon as it arrived to the table, cameras started coming out and I knew photos of this "codpiece" were destined to go viral.  It was returned to the kitchen from whence it came, as no man nor woman could take a bite.  I'm sure looking at the picture, you all can understand why.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/connollys-sports-grill-phoenix#jCc8G2-5-vXaskiY3YayIQWe finished up with a pretty good dessert of rolled cinnamon tortillas, deep fried, and topped with caramel and vanilla ice cream.  Overall if you are in the neighborhood and need a sports bar, Connolly's is a good choice.

Sorry fellow yelpers... This place didn't cut it for me.  We stopped in for breakfast.  I read other reviews and people really loved it! She came to get out drink orders and left menus for us to look at.  My husbands menu had milk all over the inside of it.  So tip #1... Wipe down your menus.  Tip #2... Wipe down your tables also.  Had finished my coffee and had to wait for our meals to be delivered to get my second cup.  Hmmm.  No problem because my food was in front of me now.I ordered the Crab Cake Eggs Benedict.  It came with a side of potatoes.  The Benedict was good! Had a unique flavor and the hollandaise didn't overpower.  The potatoes however... Wah Wah.  They were so disappointing that I didn't have more than two small bites.  They were too mushy with not enough crisp on the outside.  Bummer.  Now for the real let down.  My husband ordered the country fried steak.  He was actually enjoying it until...   A HAIR was found in it.  That completely ruined our appetites and breakfast was over.  So tip #3... Wear hair nets in the kitchen please.  I will say that our waitress was very friendly and courteous.  We didnt say anything about the hair to her.  We were just ready to leave.  I don't see us coming back anytime soon.  Real bummer.I now know why this is place has only 3 1/2 stars. I Decided to come here for some Sunday brunch, which is my favorite day for snacking adventures, and I was pretty disappointed. Everything here looked appetizing, but in this case looks were definitely deceiving. Griddlecakes is located in a small space in a strip mall, which means your wait time can be anywhere from 5 minutes to 45 minutes. Lucky enough, I only waited for about 15 minutes then was promptly seated. Before I knew it; I had three coffees in front of me: two hot, one cold, two glasses of ice water and a cup of ice. Can you say "overly helpful" wait staff? I'm not complaining about that, it was great that I didn't have to ask for anything because they were so on it! The food arrived shortly after, like I said before it LOOKED amazing, I ordered the "Philly Skillet", this is a deconstructed philly cheese-steak sandwich minus the bread. It comes on a bed of potatoes a lot of delicious melted cheese and to add to this heaping mound of meat, cheese, and cardiac arrest, I also ordered a side of biscuits and gravy. This is where the meal starts to go downhill. The biscuits where ok, but the gravy was watery and pretty bland. The "Philly Skillet" was ok, but over-salted. Everything was cooked well, the steak was perfect, the potatoes were firm, but almost every bite had to be followed with a sip of water. I went through two glasses of water while eating this and I didn't even finish the whole thing. My brunching buddy ordered the "Crab Cakes Benedict" and the "Red Velvet" Pancakes"; these too were disappointing. The crab cakes had a very fishy taste, like the meat was from a can. The hollandaise sauce was good, but not good enough to save the dish. The Red Velvet Pancakes, were also a loss. These just tasted like a flat red velvet cake, very dense not fluffy like a pancake should be. They also had a raspberry sauce drizzled on top, which was peculiar. Normally you don't associate red velvet cake with raspberries.  My review for Griddlecakes is a tad tough; I was teetering between a three star review and a two star review. I decided to go with the two star review because this food was not "A-OK". This location is very clean and the service is impeccable. The food just fell far short of what I was expecting, over-salted and questionable flavor choices. I WILL be coming back to Griddlecakes because I believe in second chances for both people and foodies alike.

Too funny, first of all Julia S and I set out today to use my coupon book and where do we end up? Cafe International with no coupon. We get way suckered into fun. We just can't help it. Julia S told me she wanted to go to Cafe International because taxis were always outside, little did we know  some of the Cafe International family drives cabs.  A man with a Carolina Cab jacket sat us and gave us menus.  I loved this.We sit down to a crazy, festive little restaurant, with a bar and a tiny room off to the side with a pool table. Very interesting. They stay open till 2a and serve food til midnight. So if you need to get your injera  (Injera is a yeast-risen flat bread with a unique, slightly spongy texture.) on before midnight, this is the place.We shared a veggie plate with salad, greens, lentil mush mix and a potato, carrot, onion mixture. I have to say, I loved it, it's quirky and comforting. If you haven't eaten Ethiopian food, you don't get a fork, just go for it, scoop up everything with the blanket of bread and most importantly, the food is served on the injera, start with the injera with the food on it. These are the best bites. Don't wait til you are full to start enjoying the most perfect bites.It was also very inexpensive, our lunch was $10. I have been craving Ethiopian food for two weeks, you would think that I had my fill, it's really just unleashed the beast. I want more.

People don't go to Carnegie Mellon because the food is good.  I had a meeting at the beginning of the semester here, and the food was just kind of edible.  We came in for the breakfast buffet, and the place was pretty empty at 8:30 AM.  The made to order omelettes were OK but took forever.  I waited 20 minutes with one person in front of me, which is kind of absurd.  The bagels were low grade store quality, and the juices were all high-sugar choices.  The fruit didn't look so good either.  I'm really glad that I'm a graduate student who doesn't have to eat on campus.I don't really know what the price is, but unless someone else is paying, I would skip the dining hall.  The dining hall has plenty of seating, which is nice, though.

Review Text :
Don't be too shocked,a carniceria in the barrio of El Mirage. However this one rocks.  The pollo preparado or chicken faijita meat is the sole reason I visit this tiny hole in the wall and a near weekly basis!!!  Its the best hands down.  Food City has nothing on them in terms of pollo.  Grab a few pounds of marinated chicken, a bag of real tortillas (no mission tortillas for me thank you!!) and fire up your grill!!  Invite your friends over and its fajita night!!! Their mexican cheeses are great too.  I prefer the ranchero and my hubby the cotija.  They both are great in the fajitas.The meats are good too, just pick your cut and they add the meat to a bag of marinade and you're out the door.  Fair warning, this is in El Mirage!  Don't be to surprised if English is the second language here!! There have been many times the check out girl told me my total in Spanish.  The guys behind the meat counter speak english so you're safe.Also this place has recently changed names it is now Carniceria Uruapan.  its right next door to the cell phone place.

Restaurant name  Thai E-San

Review Text :
While there seems to be a saturation of Thai restaurants in the Central Corridor, I'm not one to complain when something new comes along the pike. And Thai E-San is a welcome addition to the eateries in our area. And being opened less than a week didn't stop us from trying this place out. For starters, Thai E-San took over the former Big Wong space. Since I'd not been in there in ages, I'm not sure if the new tenets did a massive overhaul or if they moved into this clean space. It feels more like you're visiting your Asian aunt than walking into a restaurant. The tables and chairs are so huge, I felt dwarfed by them. The multicolored lights cast interesting hues in the room. But it is a little too cold, temperature-wise for me. Okay, on to the food. Robert M ordered the crispy pork with Chinese broccoli; I ordered the beef Mas-Sa-Mun curry. Robert's meal wasn't exactly what he expected, which would have been cubed pork chops battered and deep fried. Rather, it was pork with the skin still on and crispy. I liked it. The Mas-Sa-Mun was beef stewed in a coconut milk sauce with potatoes, green onions and peanuts. I'll get it again, but hotter than mild as it lacked the kick. But, I ordered weak so that's what I received. There were a few hiccups: service wasn't very attentive, the dishes came out at different times, another table received soup instead of fried rice (but the guy was a nimrod who insisted on eating with chopsticks and proceeded to holler at the staff from across the room), and the bill was delayed in its arrival. All things that should iron themselves out as the staff--which appeared relatively new to waiting tables--grow more accustomed to their craft and the kitchen becomes better choreographed. The prices seems a little high, but in these times I feel like any amount could be construed as "too high." I'll definitely be back, but to order different items and find their signature dishes. I'm thinking their "Special noodles, Soup" items are looking mighty fine and the lunch specials sound like a great bargain, starting at $7.95 for a lunch dish, fried wonton, egg roll and cup of soup.Definitely the prettiest Thai restaurant!  I walked in to meet with one of my favorite girls, Ayesha S., and saw her sitting at a HUGE table.  Huge.  For two of us.  It was a big, round, marble monstrosity but very stylish.  We started out with the spring rolls with shrimp.  They came out and they were gigantic!  That must be the theme here.  Definitely fresh ingredients and nothing in it was overdone.  Service was a little spotty at the beginning, but improved during our meal.  They refilled out drinks a few times without having to be asked.I got the spicy mussels.  They came on a big (HUGE) platter with a few sauteed veggies and a spicy sauce.  I know mussels aren't very good as a leftover, so I ate them all.   I didn't feel stuffed like Thanksgiving at the end of the meal, but properly sated.I will definitely be back again.  I'd like to try a few more items on the menu.  Like Ayesha, I'd like to see more heat.  "If it don't make ya cry, why would ya eat it??"I'd also like to meet the owner.  I mean, since everything is so huge...maybe it's a reflection? ;}I felt a little like Honey I Shrunk The Customer sitting in those large chairs at these massive granite and wood tables. Community tables are so risky as most people do not like them. I, on the other hand, enjoy them. We were seated at one end and then joined soon after by a very nice couple. We bantered back and forth a bit and he realized he knew me from my restaurant. Love that!So, as I said above we were seated. And then waited. And waited. And. Waited. Some. More. Eventually waters were dropped but no beverage order was taken. Again, waiting. Cue the Jeopardy theme music. Finally one of the two servers came by (and in all honesty, they were pretty busy) and dropped off soups, which come with the $6.49 lunch special. Yummy! I ordered tofu fried rice and Rickie had sweet and sour pork. Mine was fantastic, though sadly they neglected to include my spring roll. I would have flagged someone down but I was consumed with worry over my table mate's missing food. They served her friend's food yet hers took at least 10 minutes. Strange. Rickie wasn't pleased with his dish as it was pretty teeny tiny!Two lunch specials. Two beverages for $18. Not bad. Oh. The decor is so Thai...bright green and gold speckled walls with beautiful Thai rugs. And. Then. For some odd Asian reason...like at China Chili random pieces of scrap paper taped to the walls saying "Dessert. Mango Sticky Rice".With a little gay spray I could bump this baby up a star!This place is a farce and a travesty...  as are all over priced banquet style Thai places that place a premium on marketability at the expense of food taste and quality.  It's the sort of place that fat English guys wanting to recreate their holiday in Pattaya or Koh Samui would go.   Again, I go back to my rule about ethnic restaurants - the less people of that ethnicity you see patronizing the place the less likely you are to get a great meal.  Although they do serve authentic Isan food on their menu - they recreate it unfaithfully and only in shades of what you really get in Thailand.  Isan, is a poorer, ethnic minority in Northeastern Thailand that is significantly influenced by Laos.  True Isan food is amazing - usually eaten with hand fulls of sticky rice - larb (ground meat, mint, and lime) , som tum (papaya salad), gai yang (grilled chicken), and sai krok isan (isan sausage). Any restaurant claiming to be the standard bearer of Isan food, should serve these dishes with mastery.  Thai E-San does offer them, albeit at a ridiculous premium, but does so disappointingly.  It is sad to see such a great regional cuisine get such a terrible representative here in Phoenix.  Save your money and go elsewhere... unless you are an English tourist in need of nostalgia... in which case, proceed with my blessing!Heat seekers, Thai E-San and Thai food in general knows how to serve up the heat!For Thai food, I always order a soup, some kind of noodle, Thai tea and dessert. So to start, I did share with my room mate for dinner so let that be known before I am deemed a glutton. We did the Seafood Tom Yum, Pad See Ew and Mango Sticky Rice.The Thai tea was good, sweet and strong (I didn't sleep till 3AM).Seafood Tom Yum had good flavor, not MSG laden, filled with seafood (mussels, scallops, shrimp, squid) Pad See Ew with beef, yummy flat rice noodles with strips of beef, savory and spicy!Mango Sticky Rice was good, though the rice was a bit too wet for my liking and the portion I felt was a bit small for the price point.For all the food, we asked for Medium heatwise and I thought it was perfect! I do like spicy food though, but there is a burn!All in all, Thai E-San puts out solid Thai food. The owner came by to talk to us and also made sure everything was alright with the food. The food tastes pretty authentic to me!

Restaurant name  Off Da Hook Soul Food

Review Text :
I love Lolo's Chicken & Waffles just as much as the next sheep but Off Da Hook Soul Food is where its at...NOW.  There's a new place that popped up on Glendale just east of 19th Ave which is a must go.  All Soul Food...All the Time...7 days a week in fact.Get there asap..for a soul food experience you just might like more than Lolo's..Im just keeping it real because I think I rushed to this place because although Lolo's was my go-to spot, it was starting to become my have-to spot who occasionally gave me soggy waffles and fried chicken someone dropped the salt shaker in that day.Note. I did not get to try the Mac & Cheese at Off Da Hook so that Lolo's still holds my top Macaroni and Cheese spot.OKFried Chicken Wings:Moist, Crispy, Not Greasy (seriously, it was all crispy grease-free skin, weird but very pleasant), less salt-mo pepper seasoning which is what I meant by this is a whole notha chicken compared to what I am used to... but I am freakin in love with itFries:Good and with the all necessary seasoned saltCorn Bread:Bread, not a muffin, but I can live with that as long as I can slather hot sauce or honey on it I'm goodWaffle:Extra Brown, Extra Crispy, Moist on the inside, and served with a modest amount (not a half cup) of whipped butter and some thick a** syrup in that pretty little glass syrup bottle.  Best waffle Ive ever had.  I always felt something missing from all the waffles Ive done before, but now I know the lasting brown crisp was what I have been missing because something needs to stand up to syrup.  Don't anyone come after me saying their waffle was burnt because just wait till your syrup lays all over that and you will know what it is I'm talking bout.Kool-Aid:Kick you in the pants sweet, but with all that ice it all smooths outPrice:Average soul food prices$7.00 - $9.00 a plate$1.00 - $4.00 per sideGreat basket specials like 8 wings & fries for $10, or 2 wings & fries for $4 I think? Atmosphere:Typical, but lotsa people for only being a week, and it was nice to bask in a restaurant stinking with the sweet spice smell of homemade sweet potato pie.Service:Great service, waiter repeats all you ordered back to you, got my drinks to me within 5 minutes, food within 20 more minutes and totally-totally made up for the macaroni and cheese shortage.4 stars for now...I wanted to do 5 but I didn't get to try more since my tummy can only handle so much goodness on one Friday night.You will love it as an incredible change from the typical have-to spot.Tonight we found our new little hole in the wall joint. Brand new at this location ( the owner has another in the camelback swapmart)  this is one sweet little find. Housed in a small restaurant that just opened in the beginning of January . Clean and neat as you enter this place ,  it seems ready to meet all your soul food needs. The menu offers such standards as fried chicken , fried catfish , ribs,  waffles and my new favorite  fried shrimp. We we first entered the service was a bit off , with many people coming in for take out and us sitting down we kind of got lost in the crowd. But soon our waiter got back to us with apologies and we were ready to start the meal.   For tonight's meal we had Catfish , cornbread , yams , fried shrimp, cabbage , beans and rice and sweet potatoe pie.   From the first taster we were happy with our choice to stop in. With tons of pepper and soul this food made us feel homestyle good. We were impressed with each item with exception to the macaroni and cheese , which  was a bit bland in comparison to bursts of flavor in everything else.  Big favorite were  the cabbage -wow what a tasty surprise great home seasoning and velvety taste. We also really liked the sweet potato pie , it was in a light crust and had a delicate flavor not overly sweeten and very smooth. The owner is a big sweetheart of a guy and offered us a taste of his new macaroni salad which tasted like dear old moms.  Yum! If you go give a call and ask if they are serving your favorite because with the great tastes they are serving they go quick!   Can't wait to go back and try the ribs!I'm fi'in to be back soon.  Oh yea.It won't matter what you get it on, as long as you get the breading.  The breading.   !!    Somehow this stuff defies the laws of physics and packs more good stuff into its thin, crispy layers than should be able to fit.  !!I had a Pork Chop Sandwhich with fries for $6.50, and the chop was HEE-UGE.  You can get catfish, chicken, whatever.  Get something breaded.   (!!)  I'm sure the ribs are great, but they don't have them breaded, so forget it.  (Just kidding - I wanted ribs, but they weren't ready yet. "He won't serve them until they're tender enough," said the server, of the chef.)I also overheard a neat conversation about how they wanted to be sure to be able to advertise "GREEN", and that, among other things to that effect, all of the interior decorating -- chairs, tables, wainscotting, etc -- was recycled.   Fabulous.  Do they come breaded?Fans of the Fantastic Indoor Swap Mart may recognize Off Da Hook as one of the dining options at that swap. Now, you can get your soul on without being inundated by the minor freak show that is FISM, unless you're like me and enjoy such things. Off Da Hook is appropriately named, because they have the best soul food north of downtown, hands down. The chicken and waffles combine perfectly, with crispy juicy chicken atop a wonderfully tasty waffle. The greens were wonderful, but I found the mac and cheese a little on the weak side. Nothing a little hot sauce didn't fix. As has been our experience as all soul food restaurants, the service was impeccable. Attentive, amicable and efficient. Ambiance is lacking, but who has time to look around the room once you get this food? The prices did seem a tad high, but if you want great food and service, it's just what you have to do. Solid.We can't give anything more than a 1 star. We hate feeling that way because we love to support local businesses. It might've been that we came on the wrong day but we weren't the only unhappy patrons there. Since we've moved to Phoenix,  we have really been craving soul food. And the reviews have led us here first. To start off, we walked in and the first thing was the smell. Just got done cleaning maybe? But it shouldn't smell like you're reusing the water or rag or whatever it is that you're using to clean. As we are looking at the menu on the wall, the chef walks up to the front and hands us the menu & informed us that the guy taking our order will be right back. (He was across the street buying ice for the soda machine). Shouldn't this have been taken care of before you open? We were there for 15 minutes waiting for him to come back when the chef finally decides to put our order in first. So we're sitting & waiting & still waiting. For a very long time. The guy with the ice finally comes back & fills the machine & heads to the back. A woman then walks in & heads back there as well. Now we are a little less agitated, given that the chef finally has help, maybe our food would be out sooner. By the way, the other patrons were there before us and had been sitting down & looked comfortable when we walked in. Anyways, needless to say, almost 40 minutes later, the food comes out for both tables. Ours came first even though they were there way before us. Now at this point we were both thinking, this better be the best damn food in town considering it just took 3 people almost an hour to prepare. Nope. We were so wrong. My face definitely showed. And we figure the other couple thought the same because they just packed up the food & left. I tried the platter with a little bit of everything, porkchop, catfish & fried chicken. With Mac & cheese & greens for my sides. Far from soul food & left a pretty bad taste in our mouth. The catfish was powerfully salty. The chicken was tremendously greasy & you can certainly tell the grease was not properly cleaned. The porkchop was dry & more breading than meat. Now I love spicy and the greens were spicy. Too spicy because we couldn't taste the greens. Not good. So far everything is just upsetting me more and more & at this point I just want to go. We just spent $55 for not even mediocre food. He ordered catfish dinner with 2 sides of mac & a Waffle that never came because they said it kept burning. How do you burn a Waffle using a wafflemaker? So they packed our Waffle and sweet potato pie togo. We never left a restaurant ready to go to another but we were starving. We had to decide though because we just spent $55, so we would just have to settle for something cheap and fast. Smh. Before we left, the guy that went and got the ice comes out and ask how the food was. I, on one hand couldn't say anything because It wasn't going to be nice. My husband however wanted them to feel good. I wanted to punch him because he lied and that's not helping them if he lied and said it was good. He proceeded to tell us that he had just got back to the restaurant and that he use to be the cook. He knows the food wasn't good and next time he'll be sure he is the one cooking. I was shocked. So you know the food was bad and still served us but more shocked because he came out talking bad about his coworker. That's not a good look. Even worse, the chef comes out 2 minutes later & apologized for the wait & also apologized for the food & that next time we come, it will be better! You guys could only imagined my face at this point. So you also knew we didn't enjoy the food and still took our money. Shame. Oh but he wasn't done. He then proceeded to inform us that he was working with 2 adults that acted like children. That he was better off by himself. Double shocked!!!! They are in there just bashing each other behind one another's back. SMHx2. We said thank you & we left. Walked up to the car and trying to decide where to go eat because we were starving. We got in the car and decided to try the pie & waffle. Oh to my horror, the pie filling looked like it came out of a can. And the pie crust wasn't all the way ready. I was sick looking at it but I tried the filling and bad, it was bad. On to the waffle. My husband opened the boxed & just threw up his arm & asked me WTF IS THIS? They still managed to give us a burnt one. But of course, we tried it anyways & yes, it was the absolute worst Waffle in history. It actually made the food look really good. We were really disappointed and only hoped this is not a daily occurrence. Needless to say, we gave our dog the food. Even though she ate it, I don't trust her because she drinks out the toilet & loves to sniff butt.

Yuck! Low quality food at high prices. We won't be back. I already said this in tips but worth mentioning again that $2.05 for a regular size fountain drink is ridiculous. The kid's quesadilla has too much cheese that doesn't get melted all the way and the amount of grease is disgusting.

Two Hippies Dropped Out of College and Opened Up a Pizzaria, whew what a name eh? Well it's finally open and looks to be promising with only a few things to work out. Ill keep this one short and sweet without doing a disservice to the Hippies.  First off there is NO place to eat here, its carry away only. We were actually going to have a few friends meet us up there but changed our minds after finding this out. Knowing this we still made the drive to Phoenix from Scottsdale to check it out, with mixed results though it is there second day. A killer thing about this place is the pricing. The 12" pizzas are $7 for either paper thin or hand tossed. If you don't specify, you get the hand tossed. They also have loads of different kinds of wings, $6 for a dozen. So many that its pretty hard to make a choice though we went with the Spicy BBQ and the Garlic Parmesan. The wings here are killer and worth ordering again! Sauced up nice and sloppy and perfectly tender, way to go!! Plus you also get a ton of carrots and ranch dressing. I can go on and on about the wings but this is after all a pizza place.Okay, I'm not a fan of the pizza, well, not yet anyway. I have to cut them some slack since they just opened and might be still working out sourcing and such. We ordered 2 pizza's, the Sausage as well as the Cheeseburger. For $7 these are quite hefty and have ample toppings. The Two Hippies never skimp on ingredients! The bummer was that the sausage tasted right out of a bag, this is where the price point finally factors in. I would have preferred a better quality sausage, this stuff tasted much like the same stuff Papa John's might use, not good. The other problem is that the sauce was just tomato sauce and lacked any sort seasoning, including salt. The Cheeseburger suffered from the lack of seasoning as well though it was surly piled high with cheese, fresh tomatoes and ground beef. The crust was tender but for me, pizza crust should be chewy and crispy, this was neither. Maybe just a preference and I'm out of line. All in all I like the new Two Hippies pizzeria, though my feeling right now that it's just ordinary and not much different from a chain. Ill be sure to go back in a week or 2 to see how they are doing. Id imagine that they will be just fine!PS.. the Pizzaria spelling isnt an error.. hmmm..

Review Text :
First, I never drink whiskey unless it's St. Patrick's Day. I had a painful end to a long week and decided to switch to something other than my usual vodka. The Smashed Irishman lives up to it's name. The honey makes it smooth and sweet, but I could feel it workin' it's magic on me. I got it on the recommendation of our sever. He was wonderful, although I got a little jealous when two girls sat down at our communal table and he gave them the same flirty treatment. You know flattery gets you everywhere, don't deny it.  I decided to give the gnocchi a try since it is my absolute favorite thing in the world. Well, Avanti's gnocchi is my absolute favorite and I wanted to do a little comparison. Culinary does it with sausage and mushrooms. It is delicious, although heavy. The sausage made it salty, but in a good way. I still must say that I love Avanti's version more and probably always will. Nothing beats them, NOTHING. Why am I so obsessed with their gnocchi? I think they put some sort of drug in it. Those two flirty girls next to me started with the grilled cheese sliders and again, my side of the table was jealous. Actually, they ate a surprising amount of food so I got to see a lot of what Culinary Dropout had to offer. Back to my side of the table, the butternut squash cannelloni was to die for (according to my friend, I did not taste it) and the fried chicken was better than KFC...  so, I guess everyone was at least satisfied.I came here with some fellow out-of-towner Yelpers after reading the buzz here on Yelp and the restaurant's website. Let's just say that it wasn't at all what I expected.The website proclaims: "... Culinary Dropout is going to be a really fun, cool and casual chef-driven gastropub."Gastropub? I think not. Try gastroclub (TM).Instead of a casual, low-key bar that also serves great food, CD is more like a club where the music is more important than the food. Certainly the blaring music dampened any culinary excitement I had when we walked in the door. We could barely hear the hostess as she told us it would be an hour wait. We put our names down anyway, saw that the bar was packed, and then escaped outside to wait.Eventually we grabbed seats at the outside bar, where two other patrons had just polished off two platters of oysters. No fewer than three servers came to ring up bills and chat while we sat right there in front of them with the platters and dirty silverware piled up, but nobody bothered to greet us or clear the plates until about 10 minutes later. By the time the bartender was ready to take our order, we got called for our table and re-entered the restaurant.We were seated at a four-top just in front of the stage, where a musician started playing a short time later. Not surprisingly, we had a hard time carrying on our conversations. Instead we buried our heads in the menu, which offered a promising variety of eclectic dishes. Our table went with the onion soup, artichoke salad, fried chicken, butternut squash cannelloni, and kurobuta pork ribs. I'll admit the food was good. The artichoke salad was refreshing: crisp shavings of artichoke hearts, asparagus, and endive mixed with some frisee and a slightly sweet vinaigrette. My fried chicken was excellent. Although I initially thought it looked burnt, due to its mahogany color, the meat was succulent. The coating was just a touch spicy with a hint of cayenne, nicely crisp, and also drizzled with some honey. Everybody else enjoyed their food as well. It was the service that continued to be a problem. Our waitress, although attentive at first, disappeared after she took our orders. Other servers brought our food to us, which was probably the reason that we received only one order of salad, split. We'd wanted one order to be split between two of us, and another order for the person who was only having soup and salad. When only two bowls of salad were delivered, two of us shared one of them. Later, while we were eating our entrees, yet another server tried to drop off another bowl of salad, but we waved it off thinking it wasn't ours. Suspiciously, however, this bowl was twice as big as the others we'd received. We flagged our waitress over to ask for water and silverware and explained what happened. She promised we'd only be charged for one salad. Yet, when the bill came, we were charged for two. Again, we had to explain that we'd only received the split order--and finally the lightbulb went on, or flickered. After consulting the kitchen to confirm what happened, she redid our bill and apologized.Would I eat here again? No, not unless it was for lunch because I can't imagine it would be as painfully loud then. The food was good and the service issues can be worked out, but the concept seems confused. Even though the dimly-lit decor featured chairs you might find in a pub and leather banquettes, the overall vibe was far from pub-like. If you're okay with a noisy gastroclub instead of an intimate gastropub, go ahead and come here because the food seems worth it.3 stars with the potential for more if they add happy hour deals that include their cocktails because their mixologist deserves an Emmy or whatever the equivalent is for drink inventors!! Specifically, the Last Word, which includes Hendricks Gin, Green Chartreuse and lime juice garnished with cucumber and cherries and the Ginger Margarita that wreaks of ginger with Milagro Silver, lime, Cointreau and ginger agave syrup. Service was good and patio seating is comfortable.The menu items sound so creative. A genius composed the copy for the menu. Everything sounds so delicious. And, the food is good but it falls a little short of the expectations set by the titles. Don't get me wrong. I'll totally be back. Here's what I've tried so far: I've had the soft pretzels & provolone fondue a couple times now and they're tasty but there's more cheese than pretzels... not exactly a problem if you order something that comes with fries and you're a dipper, though! The pork belly cubano title is misleading but the description sets it straight: "tavern ham." It's not pork belly. It's still yummy. Think awesome ham sandwich with cole slaw on top. And, it may be even better the next day! (The sandwiches are giant - I had to bring half home) This may be my favorite menu item so far. The shaved prime rib dip is served with fontina cheese and a side of the onion soup for dipping. Personally, I prefer au jus and I probably wouldn't order the onion soup on its own... it was very sweet! :( The butternut squash cannelloni is good but it ain't cannelloni. It's rectangular ravioli. Four of them. Again, plenty of food. Good flavor. Would've preferred more brussel sprout "leaves." I tasted my dining companion's short rib pasta and the pasta was over cooked. Might be worth trying again. Seemed like a hearty dish. Finally, finished up with the monkey bread. It reminded me of refrigerator biscuit dough topped with cinnamon bun frosting, apples and cinnamon. The ice cream flat out sucked like generic grocery store ice cream. I think, in the future, I'll chose a cocktail for dessert! Seriously! They're really creative and delicious.Empire building is a curious thing...there are always a bunch of supporters and camp followers at first...then the wind changes direction for a while and people begin to have their doubts about the empire.Sometimes, actual revolution follows and heads (quite literally) roll!I wonder what will happen to the Fox Restaurant Empire in the future?Will there be a revolution?...will Fox launch a "Death Star" to destroy "rebel" restaurants?...will they change to become a representative restaurant democracy (electing a new leader every 4 years or so?)...or will they simply fall into decline and decay away, like the Romans?For now, they seem to be riding tall...good for them!Some of the Concepts are (it seems to me) more successful (in every sense) than some others...Bloom is disappointing in its execution, Modern Steak is just OK for the price, Sauce is pretty tasty and, in my opinion, Culinary Dropout is the best of the breed, so far (OK, I haven't visited all the far flung reaches of the Empire quite yet...you know the sun never sets on the Fox Empire).The Beautiful Carin and I had dinner at CD again last evening, after dropping by Old Town Tavern to have a couple of belts, say "hi" to friends and watch people tuning up for the Scottsdale Culinary Festival (a Saturday afternoon debauch of the 1st order).We have yet to have a bad meal at CD...esp. given the price points...and that always makes me happy!Pub Burgers, Pretzel Fondue, Fish and Chips, Fried Chicken, Potato Chips (and you know I'm a sucker for fresh house made potato chips), Prime Rib Dip and rest have all been tasty, well prepared and nicely presented by very friendly and attentive wait staff!What's not to like?For me the answer is "nothing"...esp. when you add the lovely décor (it kind of reminds me of my own living room...even out on the patio), the ambiance and convivial atmosphere and the wonderfully relaxed dining experience at CD.Last night, we took our time, enjoyed a leisurely dinner on the patio, watched people, chatted with our fellow diners and just let the warm, comfortable spring evening settle over us...in other words, the quintessential Scottsdale experience!For that, I salute the Fox Empire...Pax Fox.4/11/10I've eaten here twice already, and I love this place!  Easily five stars, but a few things keep me from rating so...  One reason is that I'm not that enamored of the vibe here- feels a little too much like a meat market, maybe?  Perhaps the atmosphere's a little too "dark" (gloomy/goth-y)?  Tiny details which, for now, do not prevent me from wanting to go back and try something new from the menu!On my first visit (late March/early April), I sat at the bar and was served by a very patient and helpful bartender whose name now escapes me.  (Sorry!)  However, he did steer me to the right direction on this visit by suggesting I try the Kurobuta Pork Ribs (and on the next visit with the Fried Chicken)!  I thought it funny that one of his pork ribs' selling points was that it was cooked in a sous vide-- sorry I kind of rained on your parade when I knew what a sous vide was.  (Thanks to episodes of Iron Chef America and fellow Yelper Joel L.'s cool blog at onefordinner.com!)  Hey!  You had me at "no, it doesn't contain mustard."  (I asked.)  Woohoo!  It's been a long time since I had BBQ pork ribs, and this platter was worth waiting for!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/culinary-dropout-scottsdale-4?select=i3AkQGxtvOCETdQWiiPMCw#i3AkQGxtvOCETdQWiiPMCw  Great flavors and fall-off-the-bone tender pork...  The dish is usually paired with fries, but I asked if I could sub coleslaw, instead.  Oh my God, the slaw here is incredible!  (I wish they sold jars of coleslaw to take home.)  Needless to say, I ate the whole thing!  But was I done eating?  No!  I had to have something sweet, so I ordered the Apple Monkey Bread.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/culinary-dropout-scottsdale-4?select=LJSG9mQ0OJ0Hg11nLf_PAg#LJSG9mQ0OJ0Hg11nLf_PAg  Again, another winner!  I would've preferred a higher apple content (and less bread), but that's more of a preference than a fault in execution.  Loved the vanilla bean ice cream pairing, as well!On my second visit, I ordered the Fried Chicken, which, according to the menu, comes with a buttermilk biscuit and honey drizzle.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/culinary-dropout-scottsdale-4?select=KVajeeB3_N2SYylwQpxOSQ#KVajeeB3_N2SYylwQpxOSQ  I asked for an extra plate so that I could share the food with Mom.  When the food finally arrived*, we were pleasantly surprised that the kitchen split the food onto two plates for us... so cool!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/culinary-dropout-scottsdale-4?select=C538acZVs3swVhHCQ0vwmA#C538acZVs3swVhHCQ0vwmALOVED the fried chicken!  The batter coating treatment was perfect- very light, yet so crispy and not too greasy.  The biscuits were small, but perfect size for the amount of chicken we received.  I would've liked the biscuit to be a little flakier, but other than that, I liked my piece.  I personally loved the honey drizzle on the chicken, but Mom didn't.  (I told her to just take the coating off.  After awhile, I asked her to just give the rest of her chicken!  LOL.)  I really enjoyed what little of the garlic mashed potatoes I tried, and so did Mom!  (Thank goodness the potatoes made the grade with her, because the honeyed chicken didn't, and now I can't get her to go back to CD....)Cannot wait for my next visit!  The prime rib dip and bistro steak are calling my name :)  [I hear from a foodie coworker that the salmon is not bad, either!]*I wonder how the crusty bread tastes like?  I spied quite a few sitting on a counter on my way back from the restroom.  Haven't tried the bread yet, because CD charges $2 for a serving.  Why charge for table bread?  Does anyone else find this practice off-putting?A solid 3.5 stars for my first visit, if that were an option.  When 5th and Wine dared to close over Memorial weekend, my friend and fellow Yelper, Christina P, suggested CD as an alternative.Trying to grasp onto those last few days of tolerable temps, we sat outside, and drink orders were taken promptly.  I went with the Camelback Cooler.  I wanted to love it, but it was a miss for me.  I wanted it to be a little sweeter and more "orangey."  Instead, it was on the bitter side.  Cocktail number two was the Clown Punch.  This was the hit for me.  The pomegranate foam on top was unexpected, well not really since it's listed on the menu, and fun!We all shared the soft pretzels and provolone fondue.  I could try everything on their menu, and I'm pretty sure that would still be a favorite for me.  But who doesn't love bread and cheese?  I also tried the pork belly cubano, although Christina forewarned me it's really ham, not pork belly.  Maybe that's why the restaurant is called "Culinary Dropout."  Whatever the hell it was, it was really good, too.Although the Scottsdale "Waterfront" is not necessarily my favorite place to be, I can see myself enjoying CD every now and then.  I can also see that 4th star with another try.Neither thrilling nor horrifying, a solid A-OK. From the 'nothing over $20' menu to the wait staff who don't wear uniforms, Culinary Dropout is trying very hard to be unpretentious. Located in a prime spot near the Waterfront and Fashion Square, it ends up being a place where people want be seen.  Look at Meeeeeee!The interior is a large dark open space. This is good for finding the people you are supposed to be meeting, but bad in that the acoustics are not the best. Depending upon where you sit, even before the live music starts this place gets loud. Very loud. Huh? What? Yeah, I said LOUD! The menu contains an assortment of comfort food as well as some pretty creative sounding cocktails. Feeling brave? You can even get a 'paper bag special' beer for $1.95 that could be pretty much anything. Our group of 8 started with appetizers: Soft Pretzels & Provolone Fondue ($10) - these are puffy balls of soft pretzel bread served with a pot of cheese for dipping. While I love my cheese probably more than almost anything, this reminded me of melted American cheese slices. I think a spicier or sharper cheese would have been better. House Potato Chips with Famous Onion Dip ($6) - I love fresh potato chips but these were really, really greasy. The 'famous' dip (who decides that, by the way?) was just OK. Crusty Bread with Good Olive Oil ($2) - basically what it says - slices of bread with a small bowl of olive oil. I had the Roasted Chicken Salad, with sour apples, pistachio and dolce gorgonzola ($12). While this was fairly good, I should have asked for the dressing on the side. There was a lot in there. Probably enough for two salads, so the lettuce quickly became squishy. The chicken portion was pretty small but I did enjoy the overall flavor of the crisp apples and crunchy pistachios and cheese. Our waiter was great, but the runner who brought out our food was clueless. She didn't seem to care that she was just putting items in front of the wrong person, and we all had to shift the dishes around ourselves to get to what we had ordered. She also carried the salad bowls with her thumb inside of them, touching the food! Ick... I think this place could be fun for drinks or happy hour (day-drinking, anyone, when it is cool enough for the patio??) but the food was just average.  I would rather wander next door to Wildfish...Culinary Dropout, I love you and maybe I'm just getting old but loud live music + community seating right against the stage does not make for a good Friday night dinner out. Last night we went to Culinary Dropout for dinner and it's been awhile since I've been there during their live music performances. We asked for first available because of the wait and true to my luck, the table they chose for us was the community table with seats closest to the stage. Not only could we not hear each other over the music, but the seats were so far apart, it nearly turned into a silent film dinner. Luckily another seat a little bit further away from the stage opened up so we got to move. It was still loud but the seats were closer and we only had to say "huh?" a couple times. Culinary Dropout still gets four stars in my book but I wish they could figure out a way to do live music without damaging the ear drums of the eaters in front or hurting the conversation of two people on a date. Or maybe warn the restaurateurs and offer them another option.You know those success stories that start with, " I didn't even finish high school?" They are few and far between, but sometimes the education system just holds you down, man. Such is the case with Culinary Dropout. I think the chefs behind this rebellious culinary institution felt their creativity stifle in the classroom.The dishes were kind of experimental but not too far out there to be considered wackadoodledoo-ish. Soft pretzel nuggets accompanied by a provolone fondue. Homemade chips served with a whipped onion dip concoction. Charcuterie and fromage plates. Artichoke salad. Short rib orchiette pasta. Apple cinnamon monkey bread. It was a simple selection, yet executed with passion so every bite resulted in an "ooh ahh" moment. And to top it all off, the cocktails (particularly the Clown Punch topped with a pomegranate froth) were fun and designed to flirt with taste buds.The décor is a confused mix of brick, chandeliers, mood lighting, loungey booths, communal wood tables, an inside and outside bar, open kitchen area, etc. But none of it clashed or begged for attention, it blended nicely together.The live music on Saturday night had everyone at the table clapping, singing, and nodding in agreement. The band really made the experience complete.Certificate or not, Culinary Dropout makes the grade for me.I've never been one to fall in love easily. Until now. Culinary Dropout was love at first bite. Walking in, the decor of this place caused instant infatuation. I want to steal their purple wall and get a mini version of those wonderful green crystal chandeliers for my bedroom. Their booths are so comfy and the lighting was just right. When it cools down I definitely plan on spending some time having cocktails on their beautiful patio. Our server, Tori was adorable and fantastic. Not only was she incredibly perky and attentive, she knew the menu like the back of her hand. And the way she described all of the items made me want to order one of everything. Also, she encouraged us to take our time. We started with an app, hung out and talked, then ordered an entree, hung out and marinated on that, and then ended with dessert. We were there for quite some time and never felt rushed or abandoned. Tori made our dining experience more than stellar. Now to the important part. The A.maz.ing. food. First out, the soft pretzels with provolone fondue. Oh em gee. I LOVE pretzels and cheese but I will never be satisfied again unless I'm having it at Culinary Dropout. The pretzels have just the right amount of sea salt (not too much) and are so fantastically soft. The fondue was the perfect temperature and they have a little candle flame to keep it the right consistency so you can take your time eating. Although those pretzels disappeared really fast. Our entree, the sweet corn cannelloni. Thanks to Tori warning me this is seasonal and will change to butternut squash I was all over it. My friend and I split this and the serving size was still plentiful. I want to find whomever came up with the idea of putting mashed corn inside the cannelloni pasta and kiss them on the lips. The butter sauce was so flavorful but not too heavy and complimented the corn flavor instead of distracting from it. Dessert. Words cannot describe. I have lived in a world where I believed the best dessert in existence was creme brulee with berries until last night. The salted caramel custard made me want to utter inappropriate noises of delight. Topped with their caramel popcorn and chilled at just the right temperature, my friend and I indulged in silence as our taste buds rejoiced. If I wasn't classy I would have licked the cup. So, Culinary Dropout, I am in love. All I want to know is when we will meet again??? I'll be longing for you until that day.I'm late to the Culinary Dropout party... really late!  But better late than never.  I'm not really sure why it took me so long to head to CD, especially considering I live and work within a half mile, but I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed my first meal here.  (Thanks Todd F suggesting we dine here, and for forcing me into sharing the soft pretzels with provolone fondue app).Speaking of, do not miss the soft pretzels with provolone fondue... it's worth the extra calories for the fluffy, cheesy, heavenly goodness!  I'm already dreaming of returning to have more of these!  Following our shared app, I went with the Chopped Vegetable Salad.  Considering Culinary Dropout is a Fox Restaurant Concept, I was half expecting this salad to be the same as the one they serve at Sauce.  Afterall, the description on the menu is exactly the same as the Sauce version.  But it doesn't do it justice!  In addition to the "asparagus, corn, and avocado," this version has artichokes, pistachios, and a sweet honey dijon vinaigrette.  I had them add shrimp to it as well, and it was incredibly fresh, delicious, and filling.  I'd totally return and order exactly the same thing since I loved it so much.Hannah was our server and she was awesome.  She was friendly and informed us of specials right off the bat (including prices).  She also mentioned that they serve Pepsi products, which I typically find that servers neglect to tell you; especially if you're a Coke person!  Todd and I both had Arnold Palmers to drink, and Hannah (and the other CD staff) made sure we constantly had refills - I was even given a refill to go, which was much appreciated.Overall, I had a great experience at Culinary Dropout.  It may have taken me two and half years (since they opened), but I will likely add this place to my regular lunch location and be there again soon.  Anyone up for lunch at CD tomorrow?!This place is beautiful! I love the open atmosphere it creates with long large tables, large chairs and open windows and doors to the patio area. The chandeliers hanging in the main dining area add just that bit of "fancy" the place needs, perfect touch. I really enjoy the patio seating this time of year, even though you are sat close together to other groups for some reason you still get a privacy vibe. I don't know if it's the way the tables are set up, or the company I was with! They have a small stage inside that they have live music played some nights, but I don't really enjoy it for I feel its a little too much for the restaurant.The food is delicious! We decided to get the onion dip and chips for an appetizer, something really easy that you can eat at home right? Well Culinary makes a great dip! We couldn't stop ourselves, trying to remember that our main courses were coming! I had the rainbow trout! I NEVER eat fish so when I am randomly craving it, this place is where I come. It's smothered in almonds and this delicious creamy sauce...... HANDS OFF I don't share this dish. My boyfriend decided to ordered the fried chicken (which you have to wait a little extra time for) and it was definitely worth the wait. The chicken was moist and tender and the sides of mashed potatoes and coleslaw were like eating at grandma's house.I am very impressed with the staff here. On a Wednesday night, it was pretty packed, for 2 we had to wait about 30 minutes but the staff is very courteous by grabbing your cell number and texting you when your table is ready. The bar had a few open seats, so we were able to have a drink before dinner. I like that there are no uniforms here, each of the staff members are able to show off their individuality and personality with the way they dress, which I feel makes them more comfortable and friendly. Its really hipster, the staff is very friendly and laid back! If you're not paying attention it does make it a little hard to find your waitress or waiter, but you should be so kind to pay attention to the people taking care of you for the evening.Certainly a great place to put on your list. Great location, great atmosphere, great staff and delicious food! Keep it up Culinary!!More pretzels and cheese, please!!!!! I mean really, they are THE BEST THINGS ON THE PLANET! I could seriously eat Culinary Dropout's pretzels and cheese every day for the rest of my life and never get sick of them. SO YUM. Anywho, during this visit, I tried to go a little healthier for my main dish to offset the pretzels and cheese and ordered the Italian Chopped Salad but subbed chicken instead of the Italian meats. It was FABULOUS! Super light and delicious. I loved the dressing and the pickled veggies throughout. I would 100% order it again! I know for a fact that I will be back soon for their pretzels and cheese, happy hour specials and maybe even that delicious salad again!

This is gonna be short and sweet. Good food but I hate when you advertise something you don't have. I can understand if something is online not on your site but you actually don't offer it. You can't fix everything. But on your own windows? If you don't offer delivery please don't have it all over your windows.

Restaurant name  Taqueria Los Parados

Review Text :
This unassuming restaurant in the Food for Less parking lot on Sahara and Valley View has been around for two and a half years but I just found out about it a couple of weeks ago. This is noteworthy because it is only five minutes from my house. After my first bite into their taco al pastor I was terribly disheartened I'd never been to this authentic, inexpensive restaurant as it offers a LOT more than your average Mexican restaurant.Taqueria Los Parados, meaning 'taco joint of the unemployed,' is probably named as such because the prices are affordable for everyone. Most tacos are only $1.19 and many of the more filling options range from just five to seven dollars. Besides the cheap factor, everything is made from scratch and the owner is omnipresent. She's from Guadalajara and has put a lot of love and thought into each dish, salsa, and drink. The horchata, for example, is not made from a mix and is not overly sweet. Many dishes seem to have a little something special that makes you say, 'Wow, why haven't I see this done elsewhere.'It's hard to pick a favorite dish but I've got some contenders. One is the shrimp taco, which consists of corn tortillas topped with six sauteed shrimp (yes, I counted), crunchy cabbage, pico, and a spicy yet cooling crema ($2.75). The ingredient that really puts this taco over the edge is the toasted cheese crisp buried under the deconstructed slaw. It adds great texture and a punch of flavor that is undeniably unique. I also love the al pastor taco ($1.19). The pork is marinated in spices then cooked on a gyro rotisserie to give it that great caramelized exterior. The unique touch in this dish is the addition of ripe pineapple strips that add a touch of sweetness to complement the pork and diced onions. Finally, you can't go wrong with brocheta. It's a hodgepodge of grilled meat (I had chicken), peppers, onions, bacon, and oozy cheese served with flavorful homemade beans and saffron colored rice. Since it is served with tortillas I'm inclined to liken it to fajitas...times ten.Truly everything I've had has been delicious. The lengua (tongue) taco was simple and splendid, as was the carne asada. If you've never had tongue I'd recommend trying it here. Even if you don't like it, and I doubt you won't, you've only lost a mere $1.19. The 'torta ahogada' with al pastor was also interesting ($5.75). It consisted of al pastor and their wonderful beans stuffed inside a french baquette that was then dunked in a vat of tomato sauce (hence the meaning, 'wet sandwich"). I'm not sure if I'd order this over other items, but it's certainly not something you see on a lot of menus and was definitely tasty.Whatever you do, don't forget to visit the salsa bar. Each preparation is carefully balanced with clean flavors. I like to try every combination possible, but if you shy away from heat then use modestly. Make sure to get the authentic guacamole sauce. In Mexico guacamole isn't generally prepared chunky but is rather more like a sauce. I love the pourable consistency that allows me to get an avocado taste in every bite without adding a lot of bulk to my meal. This is a place that foodies should support, as it is a little slice of real Mexico smack dab in the middle of our city.

I really wanted to like this place after reading so many stellar reviews.  Much to my dismay, it didn't live up to those reviews.  I'm going to hope I just came on an off day.  Did the move from Bloomfield ruin things?  I'll never know since I didn't visit that one...I will say the one plus was the fresh made to order mozzarella plate with heirloom tomatoes, basil, olive oil and balsamic reduction.  For tomatoes being out of season, they weren't too bad.  And the mozz was awesome!  They definitely perfect that dish.For the main dish I ordered the gnocchi in a cream sauce with peas and mushrooms.  I love gnocchi if done right.  Wasn't too into the cream sauce or the actual gnocchi.  It just didn't have much flavor.  And the gnocchi fell flat... or should I say heavy.  I'm so in love with the gnocchi from Il Pizzaiolo in Mt. Lebanon that I can't be fair to anyone else's!  I will also make a note that are service was not to hot.  As I've said many of times, I've served so I know the drill.  Put on the pizzaz to earn your tip.  I know we're not a hard table, we even tried to make the dude laugh, to loosen him up.  didn't work.  He just seemed so over it.  It just makes you feel uncomfortable when you have a server like that.This is the thing though, this place has so many positive reviews that I'm definitely down to try it out again.  Hopefully with a better turnout!
Room 112=Hidden in a downtown bank building, Room 112 is easy to miss. But once you take the time to find it, you will be glad that you did. The environs are dark, modern, and comfortable, the staff friendly, and the menu tantalizing with enough variety to suit many palates. My companion and I opted for gyoza, a Just Pete sushi roll (fried smoked salmon, crab, avocado, and cream cheese), a beef and vegetable stir fry, and Singapore rice noodles with chicken and shrimp. The flavors were well-balanced, the meat was tender, and everything was fresh and fragrant. This might be the best-smelling restaurant I've ever had occasion to frequent. Prices were moderate, with good-sized portions for the money: We paid $6 for the app, $10 for the sushi, and $11-$12 each for the entrees. Ultimately, one who has enjoyed a lot of Asian cuisine won't be breaking any new ground here, but what familiar favorites Room 112 offers, it does damn well.
Dad's Grilled Cheese=A first for me - a restaurant that specializes in Grilled Cheese sammies - in Vegas - RIGHT ON !!  I've seen a show about a  peanut butter sammie shop ( another great idea - maybe they put one next to this place )  but grilled cheese ? so they got the specialty menu - about 13 different cheese creations with cheese ranging from good 'ol american to Emmentaier / Gruyere ( damn if i know if  i spelled those right ! ) they also have various meats and veggies  - all UNDER $5 !!!  Grilled cheese brings back memories - fond memories of childhood - one of the premier comfort foods.  So i remember when i had a choice of how to make my grilled cheese - it was american cheese, crushed chips on rye bread - so that's what i ordered from the "construction worker " menu - 9 different cheeses you can try,  6 different breads and 17 different toppings,the result - FRICKIN' AWESOME  !  I actually had  a slight tear in my eye - made me think of momma !  All from a simple  grilled cheese sammie - the simple things in life .  I'm adding this to my monthly rotatation .poor pic addedFound this place on yelp -- they've only been open 3 weeks -- and I'd have to say, this is really a cool concept! I mean who doesn't like a grilled cheese right?We stopped in to grab a snack. We got The Apprentice, one with American cheese on whole wheat the other with muenster cheese on Texas toast with a side of curly fries and tomato soup.After ordering, we sat down and soon, the food was brought out to us. I'd have to say, the grilled cheese was really yummy! The hearty tomato soup was a little too thick for me, but it was tasty! We couldn't finish the soup so we brought it back with us. The young man said he didn't want any grilled cheese but he ate half of my order -- WTH! There are a bunch of cheese to choose from and your choice of bread including white, whole wheat, Texas toast and thin wheat (I think). The grilled cheese starts at under $3 and if you want, you can build your own or choose from one of the gourmet selections they have on the board.I thought it was pretty good! I'd come back again! I think Orange County needs one of these!! For sure!!PS: they even have soy cheese!PSS: the leftover soup, when reheated and some water added to it, came out perfect!!!What to say about Dads? Well there is a lot to say, like, " OH MY CHEESE".  I ordered the godfather and was a pleasantley surprised. They do not skimp on the meat, cheese, or peppers. This perfectly grilled little sandwich of goodness was perfect and really hit the spot. The girl at the counter recommended it and I now feel that she is a very smart person and deserves a tip. The atmosphere is interesting, the red walls tattered with grilled cheese pictures and the row of celeb visitors is an odd blend but it works. IT was a little different when I was standing at the register and the chef came out of the back and was dressed and decorated like he was working at a 5 star restaurant cooking tartar in the back. Now to me, this could be a good and a bad thing he either loves Flare or he is an amazing chef that had an amazing idea to make amazing grilled cheese sandwiches.... Guess what? He must be an amazing chef with an amazing idea because it was very very very good.So to the girl at the counter and the decorated chef in the back, Great job!!
Jamie's Pizza and Pitas=11/29/10 and 12/13/112.5 starsVisited once (falafel pita and pizza) and ordered take-out (lamb pita).  Liked the pita bread and the veggies (though few) used, but the falafel portions were bland and dry.  Not even the extra garlic sauce and hummus (for which I had to twist their arms for) could add the flavor I was missing.  The pizza, while it looked good in the box, was also bland and VERY greasy!  I had one slice, threw away the cheese-barren parts, which didn't leave much to eat, and gave up due to seeing that huge  oil spill on the bottom of the box.  Brought the pie home and showed it to Mom and offered her some; She declined.  I tried toasting a few slices the next day, but by then, I could see that the pizza really didn't have much cheese on it, and the crust never crisped up in the toaster oven, no matter how long I kept the slices in there.  No wonder these pizzas are sold on the cheap!The lamb pita was actually pretty good!  I had low expectations since the first two products didn't deliver, but the lamb was actually quite nice-- tasty and not dry at all.  It actually was better than the lamb wrap I tried a few days later from the newly-opened branch of Pita Jungle at Scottsdale Fashion Square (oh, the lamb served there was HORRIBLE).  Hmm... well, I will say that we both liked it, and Mom has requested me to order it for her once more after.  Strange, though, that the last TWO requests for Jamie's lamb pita she asked of me, she quickly retracted, saying she changed her mind...  I should get her to tell me why the change of heart...I've wondered about their special Rosewater lemonade and their baklava, but every time I decide to try one, they've just run out.
Chicago Brewing=All I can say is that the deep dish pizza here is fantastic!  Super good garlic knots too.  Service is good.  It's located inside the Four Queens.  If you can't find it just ask one of the staff.  I was hungry and after I ate, I wasn't.  That is all.
Brooks Sandwich House=Brooks is that hole in the wall, off the beaten path Mecca.  There is no accidently finding it, you have to be going there.  It is a tiny  walk up counter, pretty smoky from the exhaust.  Simple breakfast items, burgers and dogs. Everything is wrapped in that heavenly white paper.  No tables and chairs, only one long table outside. A very fun visit to fulfill the chowhound in you. Brooks is one of those special places that you need to go at least once.Cash only, closes 2p in the afternoon.This. Place.I can't believe I've lived in Charlotte for 5 years and somehow hadn't wandered over to Brooks'. It's perfect casual location for a take-out lunch with friends.I looked on Yelp to make sure we were all talking about the same place. Greasy, happy food in paper bags-cash only. Yep, that's the one.We arrived and I was immediately overcome with the aroma of sizzling beef. Vegetarian or not, you can't argue with that smell. It's divine.One of my dining partners, a MD, is a regular, and I heard shouts of, "Hey, Doc!" and realized the owners have a personal relationship with their customers. Something I truly appreciate.Having perused the menu ahead of time, I found that there aren't really any overt vegetarian options, but I didn't let that dampen my enthusiasm. I opted for an off-the-menu grilled cheese with tomato. No balking by the staff, and I think my sandwich was sublime. Coupled with fresh, nicely salted fries and a canned soft drink, it left nothing to be desired.What I appreciated about the grilled cheese is that it was served on a hamburger bun, but was pressed almost like a cuban sandwich...so the edges were crisp and held up well to the potentially soggy tomato situation.Once we received our orders, labeled in small paper bags, it was out to the covered, long, standing picnic table just outside the door. I love the communal dining aspect of the experience and the opportunity it afforded to enjoy a lunch while standing and chatting with my friends.One of the twin brothers stepped outside to share a joke with our party. Super southern, super kind. They're open for breakfast and lunch, Monday through Friday, and appear to have a large, fiercely loyal following. Apparently their chili is a big deal. So go try Brooks'. Take along a few friends, a $20 and some TUMS. You'll leave happy.You know how long I've been wanting to try this place?!  LONG OVERDUE!  Finally I got to try the famous Brooks burger last week for lunch. My $3.50 cheeseburger all-the-way (onion, chili & mustard, I asked for slaw on top of it at no extra charge) was well worth every penny. The single pattie was grilled to a slight crisp on the outside but retained a good balance of juicy meat flavor with a hint of seasoning. Everything else added on made it a filling portion (at least for me). The menu board was short and sweet, the only side item was fries basically... which wasn't anything special.  The whole eating under the outdoor hut/shed structure standing up along a wood slab table with everyone added to the experience. There will be many Brooks lunch outing in the future... I may have to give other items a try.Tips to eating at Brooks:1.Don't wear white... or anything light color, especially if you doing all the way southern style.2. Lettuce and tomato cost extra, but seriously, stick with chili and onion and slaw... you're in the South, enjoy the perk3. May not be a bad idea to bring some wet naps4. As you may know already, CASH only, so bring themChili burger or chili dog?! The struggle is very real my friends. My advice: just go ahead and get both. I first discovered Brooks Sandwich House a few years ago here on Yelp. It's nothing fancy, just a little stand alone building over by Heist in NoDa. This little hidden gem has been cranking out deliciousness for more than 40 years. I love the chili. So, my orders always consist of things smothered in that homemade goodness. A cheeseburger or hot dog all the way... either makes any day better. Order both and it makes the day A LOT better. Might as well get some chili cheese fries while you're at it. They also have options like bologna, livermush, and bbq (when available) on the menu. One day, I will be brave and try livermush. My friend Eddie swears by it. Note: Brooks is open Monday-Friday (no weekends) for breakfast and lunch. It is cash only, so plan accordingly. The place is small, so there is no indoor seating. Place your order, wait for your number to be called, then go pay. There are some outdoor seats if the weather is nice.
Terrace Café=So, it's a Saturday morning and I'm in the kitchen making over-easy eggs accompanied by toast, baby tomatoes and fresh basil and my boyfriend in the living room says, "you're cooking? I thought we could go to brunch." Oh... okay. I never say no to brunch so stopped in my tracks and plated the "breakfast appetizers," considering it a good idea since any good breakfast place in Charlotte seems to have a 20-30 minutes wait.I was right. We drove down to South Park and put our name in (30 minute wait, as anticipated) and decided to do a little shopping at the Container Store while we waited. We're getting pretty good at fitting errands into dining based on location. Anyway, once 25-30 minutes had gone by we headed back to Terrace, where the hostess was ready to take us to our table. Perfect timing! We were seated upstairs overlooking the restaurant and ordered coffee and fresh orange juice. I had the shrimp and grits (I'm becoming quite the southerner) and we shared a side of the red velvet waffles... OMG. Both were so amazing. I'm not even a waffle person when I brunch, but these were stellar. Also, give me something cajun with a side of okra and I'm a happy girl- big fan of Terrace's shrimp and grits. I left full but surprisingly not feeling TOO full- we still had a lot of errands to run that day. Oh, Saturdays!First thing to know, you're going to wait! Come early and look through the menu before so you can order as soon as you get seated.I had a bloody mary at the bar while waiting to be seated. If you're alone or with a small group, you can try to get a seat at the bar! I was pleased with the taste (sometimes it's too watery?) and the slice of bacon of course made it even better! We got seated 45 minutes after we got there, which was the estimated time they gave us. They contact you by phone, so you can wander around while you wait.I ordered the red velvet waffle, fried chicken, and a side of cheesy grits (choice of grits or hash browns.) Everything was really good! The waffle wasn't too sweet and it complemented the chicken really well. The chicken was crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside, just how it should be. The grits were tasty, I mean, anything with cheese is tasty.Overall, a great food experience! Just don't come too hungry and think you'll be able to get seated right away. It's a busy place obviously for a good reason!We ordered the Velvet Waffle.  It was Oh boy super delicious.  It was cruchy outside and soft inside so perfect.  I can eat about 20 of their waffles in one meal no problem.  The price is reasonable average about 10 dollars per dishes.The seating is so cute, upstair and downstair.  On the upstair, they set up as a terrace so u could see thru the down stairs.
Lindo Michoacan=Um, clearly many of you have never had real Mexican food.My best friend raved about this place ever since I told her I was moving to Vegas from California and needed to discover new Mexican restaurants to help curb my insatiable craving. She mentioned how much she loved Lindo so I gave it a shot -- but girl you are trippin'.Lindo Michoacan is overpriced, bland, and flavors were just flat out weird. The salsas lacked that kick that I love and expect from freshly made salsa. The decor was a chain restaurant nightmare. However portions were big if you like that kind of thing and the view is quite beautiful. The search for delicious Mexican food in Vegas continues! (Please, any suggestions are welcome!)Has anyone seen the South Park episode where Cartman goes to "Casa Bonita?" Well, this place is the same thing, just with no tall diving board or pool. That would be cool though. Lindo Michoacan sits a top a hill that has a great view of the Las Vegas strip from Henderson. Seriously, fantastic view of the strip and even more awesome at night. I came here on a suggestion from a friend and decided to bring the entire family along. First off, this place is huge; tall ceilings, large dinning area, and a large bar with a window view. Lindo is also very loud with live music playing and giant bells ringing (reminding you there's a birthday happening with 50 feet), plus there are kids everywhere. Kids are usually a red flag for me to turn and run out, but I had about eight people with me so escape was not an option.We sat down and immediately ordered table-side guacamole and margaritas. They have two versions; spicy and regular, we ordered two of each and we're amazed to watch two servers on each end of the tables churn out this green pile of goopy goodness. By the way, you automatically get chips, salsa, and bean dip at your table when you sit down. I lived in SoCal for quite awhile and was privy to a lot of guacamole and Lindo ranks at the top of my guac loving tastebuds. My favorite was the spicy version; great flavor, creamy with crunchy texture, and just enough spice. Highly recommended! There were a lot of dishes going on at this table, but let's focus on me because...well just because. I ordered the Chili Verde Pork plate; it was both fantastic and huge! This plate is made up of pork that is slow cooked in a green chili sauce for hours until it pretty much melts in your mouth. The pork was super tender and also came with homemade flour tortillas.These were perfectly chewy and soft. I rarely can't finish my meal, but I was stuffed by the fourth bite. Yay, for midnight snacks! The service here was impeccable and the atmosphere was fun. Great place for families and a possible low-key date night. I might be back for few a cocktails and sunset view of the Strip.
Union Restaurant & Lounge=I would have given 1-1.5 stars had the manager not tried to make it up to me and my party for the bad service by comping a few dishes. Despite that, I would rather have paid full price and gotten excellent service. There are too many great restaurants in Las Vegas to choose from. My bad experience here has guaranteed that I will not be spending my money here again. It's a beautiful restaurant with low lighting and lots of dark wood. It reflects the design in Aria, which I love a LOT! Very chic and minimalist but very stylish. The food here was excellent. Very good tasting food. However, it took forever to come out and our mushroom sides, which probably takes the least amount of time to cook, came at the very end after we were finished with everything else. Doesn't make sense to me.Our waiter was nice but after he took our order, he seemed to have pulled a vanishing act. We didn't see him at all until we asked a busboy to find him for us. He was forgetful. I asked for straws 3x and he finally got me one. But I had asked for 4. He came back with 6 more. ???What annoyed us even more was that we were trying to enjoy our meals and the busboys removed our plates and dishes without asking first! We weren't even done with our food! Geeez just because we wanted to take our time to eat, savor the food and just chill, doesn't mean we're done. We were conversing and eating at the same time. We don't want to stuff our faces right away like a bunch of pigs. Just because we put our forks down doesn't mean we're done eating. My friend had to stop the busboy from taking her plate by pushing his hand away.So after they removed our dishes and utensils, another dish came out. They totally forgot to give us new utensils. How the hell were we supposed to eat our Bolognese with??? Our hands?! We had to hail someone down after waiting for a while just to ask for forks. Really? For a restaurant such as this, I really expected a lot more. The service wasn't even average. It just sucked. I give credit to where credit is due. This place doesn't make the cut for me. You're better off dining somewhere else. Try Julian Serrano or Beso. Much better.
Ninja Bowl=Just check out the Rainbow Donuts reviews. These people are cool. The ninja bowls are perfect in flavor, size and variety. I have had the one with Jalapenos, it was hot and good. I had the one with bacon, the greasy bowl... it was good and I have had the regular one large and it was good. I like these better then Samurai Sam's. I think it is the freshly grilled chicken, I don't know.
Benjarong Authentic Thai Cuisine=I finally got around to visiting this one.  A few people have asked me now if I've been here, and it is just so far from my house!  It was totally worth the trip though.  I was impressed.  Benjarong is a gourmet Thai restaurant that is taking American Thai food to the next level.  I ordered the Salmon steak green curry ($15.99) and the Crab papaya salad ($8.99).The crab papaya salad was pretty good.  It was slightly sweet with no vinegar, but the flavor went well with the crab legs.  The crab legs themselves had to be cracked.  They weren't the best crab legs I have ever had, and there were only three of them, but this was a really nice addition to the dish.  The one downside is that I wouldn't say this was an authentically flavored papaya salad, and Thais might be disappointed in this classic dish.   The portion was huge though, and I couldn't even finish half of it.  Next up was the salmon green curry.  This had a beautiful presentation, with a light green curry sauce with green peas, spread in a thin layer over the dish.  The portion of salmon was healthy, and the quality was too.  The curry sauce was a bit sweet, but I could tell it was a homemade curry sauce, and was well made.  It reminded me of the style of curry served at Pan Asian, but lighter.  I liked the fact that there wasn't a soup of this curry.  That would have been too sweet.  The curry was used like a light sauce rather than a traditional fully loaded soupy or chunky curry.  It went really well with the salmon in such a refined way.  The salmon, while deliciously prepared, did have a few bones. In Thailand, the bones are eaten, but this could bother some Western patrons.  Take it from me though, the dish was worth the few little bones.  I was impressed by this Thai restaurant.  It fits in well with the area, and goes for an affordable, but upscale atmosphere and food style.  There are a few dishes on the menu that I don't believe I have tried.  Some of the dishes are definitely a bit Americanized, but they are done well.  I have a feeling that digging deeper into the menu would result in finding some good, authentic dishes.  I wish I lived closer so that I could explore this Thai restaurant a little more.
Wolfman Pizza=Quick lunch while waiting for a prescription at the nearby Teeter. It was busy for lunchtime, but I was able to take a seat and place my order quickly. Lunch specials are either a slice and a salad or two slices, each with a soda. I chose the latter.Special slices rotate on a day by day basis, but today was the White Wolf (veggies and fresh basil) and the New York, New York (lots of meat). I went with one of each.Since the pizzas aren't made to order for the lunch special, it didn't take long for them to arrive at my table. The NY, NY was greasy as expected. The White Wolf was tasty and needed only a little shake of the red pepper to kick it up. Sadly, neither slice was especially hot when they arrived.It was okay for quick, but I think I liked the Pizza Peel nearby much better.
Culver's=Utterly superb customer service!There must be at least 47 employees buzzing around like bees.  I was startled by an offer to "help you right here sir!" only seconds after entering the front door, before my eyes had even adjusted to the change in light.Awesome menu offerings and wide selection of choices.+ Fresh not frozen burgers with lots of customization available. + Tasty desserts =Great American Fast FoodI love frozen custard! Imagine super rich and creamy soft serve and that's frozen custard. As Shannon C. mentioned, they'll always have vanilla or chocolate and you can build your own sundae for as little as $2.39 (includes 1 scoop and 2 toppings) and they make something similar to a Blizzard (Concrete Mixer) for $2.89 (short size) but I keep an eye on the flavor of the day (http://www.culvers.com/flavors.aspx?storeId=399) for my guide. I mean, seriously, Double Marshmallow Oreo (Rich chocolate custard loaded with Oreo cookie pieces and marshmallow creme)? Or, Butter Brickle (Specially blended butter pecan custard enhanced with all-time favorite chewy chunks of Heath Bar.)  Who could resist a special trip!?!Culver's is known for their ButterBurgers, though. It's worth noting that unless you order a Deluxe you have to specify which of the toppings like mayonnaise, mustard, ketchup, pickles, onions, tomato and lettuce you want; otherwise, ya just get a buttered bun! They make a big deal about the meat being "fresh, never frozen 100% US raised" and cooked to order and they're pretty tasty, but this is a fast food burger, not what I like to refer to as a "backyard burger." So keep your expectations in check an you will be pleased.The counter service has been good each time I've visited, but I have to give a shout out to my favorite, Luther, who broke it all down for me and, no doubt, made my first visit to the Metro location go smooth. It's worth noting they have items besides burgers, like salads and pot roast dinners. Although I haven't ventured there yet, I happen to be a fan of pork tenderloin sandwiches and am looking forward to giving the one at Culver's a try.  But, it's going to have to be on a day that I cannot resist the Flavor of the Day... maybe Friday for Strawberry Cheesecake!Dang you Culver's, with your proximity and convenient drive through! With all the nearby Baskin-Robbins and DQs now closed, I find myself at Culver's a bit too often.I do love frozen custard. I'd like to say that I'm not going to say that I had way better frozen custard back East. But I'm not, because I did.Nonetheless, theirs is pretty decent. They have some tasty flavors of the day. The toppings are ridiculously sweet, however. But obviously it's not enough to keep me away.Hey buttah buttah!  Hey buttah buttah!3 & 3/10th stars.This food reminds me of my childhood.  That's right, I have been eating healthy since a very young age.  Especially things like chili cheese fries.  My daughter pointed out that they know the 3 secrets of French cooking...butter, butter and butter.The burgers are pretty decent for a fast food burger.  Fries were ok, tasty soft serve but the portion varies wildly based on my two visits.  8 meals for 4 bucks is probably a good idea these days as well.I was watching a Judge Judy show today and JJ was really giving the business to this loser (you know...had bad credit, met a chick, she took a credit card in her name, he didn't pay her back, she's shocked, now they're in court)...she was RIDING his ass. It was awesome. Finally she said "what planet are you from?"...Dude with mullet bows his head, darts his eyes from JJ and says "Why, I'm from Wisconsin Judge Judy".LMAO!Culver's, by way of the Dairy State, has settled on Camelback and Central. Rickie and I ate here after seeing Date Night on our "date night". Thought it was a cute, innocent, 1950s way to wrap up our afternoon. You know, kinda like Richie and Laurie Beth. Please, I need to check ID's on this reference. I'm sure Rickie wouldn't pass this one!Culver's was very clean with well trained and polite employees...think In N Out. We ordered the famous Butter Burgers along with various sides. Burgers. Yum! Sides. Ugh! Would rather have had Ore Ida. Cheese curds had a thick, icky overcooked batter with a Q tip sized cheese curd, fries were limp and sad (kind of like Jesse James career and life now) and the chicken tenders were standard fast food fare.Root Beer! Outstanding! Smoothie was OK...probably should have went with a good old fashion malt. But who knew?We had a fabulous booth across from a large open window with a fantastic Sunday breeze cooling our curds. I would go back for a burger and root beer. I might even wear a Packers or Brewers t shirt...just to see if I get some free stuff.
Sucker Punch Sally's Diner=Umm...W-T-F?!??!!!Came here to grab some food and a drink. First of all, the place was dead and the decor/vision of the place seems all over the place. But whatever. We seat ourselves.After about 15 minutes the server comes over and asked what we wanted to drink. And then tosses some menus on the table, while saying: "Sorry guys, we just opened. We don't have a fucking clue what's going on". Fine. Beers arrive. The menu did not look impressive. At all. I ordered fries and gravy. Not much you can mess up there right? WRONG. How about salt-less stale fries and gravy that tastes as if it crawled out of a can.But this gets better...Server: Omg, did you guys see that guy?Me: What guy?Server: The one that was just arrested outside?Me: Excuse me?!?Server: Oh yeah! It was crazy...he walked in here with his penis hanging out.Me: WHAT?????????Server: Yeah, it was just hanging out.Me: Ummm...check please.Bad food? Overpriced beer? And crazies? No thanks.Phoenix, we need to seriously recognize that we have a great thing going here and exploit it.  We're humbly cool, our best restaurant is a pizza place, we're a tough crowd who has a artistic bent, we need to celebrate that.  Sucker Punch Sally's does.  So does the Roosevelt, Four Peaks, Fez, Stinkweeds, Hoodlums, Cowtown, Sunset Clothing, Frances, Honey Bears, Queen's Pizza, Lux, Pita Jungle...If you haven't gleaned, I love this place.  I don't know the owners, they might not like me, as I'm a bit square, but I'm so happy they are taking this risk.  The use the Rockabilly motif and rock it out in spades.Menu is standard diner fare, but with a twist.  They aren't running their full menu yet, smart move for a business getting on its feet in this economy, but what they are offering is good dinner food.The three of us had a great time there.  $3 16oz Pabst, great loose meet sandwich and the homemade BBQ chips that came with it.  Had a bite of the Navajo Taco and the Pork Tenderloin sandwich, both very good and huge portions.  The rest of the menu is great too, chilli fries, wings (try the Sally's sauce), milkshakes and (thank the lord) affordable breakfast served all day.They also have a full bar and soda fountain.  And they have a stage for live music.  And they are open 24 hours.  You know what else is open 24 hours in Phoenix?  F'ing McDisgustings and a bunch of crap Mex places.  Love Phoenix or Leave Phoenix (or make it somewhere you can love)A breakfast spot on Mill? Hurray! I was so excited when Sucker Punch Sally's opened, I work on Mill and there has not been a "hot" breakfast spot within walking distance in years. By "hot" I mean something other than donuts and bagels. I looked them up online and was confused when the website listed was for a bike shop.. Hmm ok so I can't order ahead. I walked over and placed an order to go. The staff was very friendly, and explained that the owner also owns a bike shop (old school choppers and such) in Scottsdale. They should have the website update soon yadayada.I ordered a Denver omelet with hashbrowns, walked back to work and opened up the box. I should mention that it was about 10am and I was starving. I would have ate just about anything at that point, or so I thought. I opened up my box and looked down in disgust. Before me was an undercooked omelet (see picture) so undercooked that there was a puddle of yolk/water in the box, and to go with it was a side of freezer burned, undercooked hash browns. The hash browns were browned on the top but raw and soggy underneath. I was so disappointed, I tried choking it down but my taste buds revolted and I had to throw it away. It's interesting  to see 5 star reviews for this place. Lower standards perhaps? Or maybe I just had a bad experience? I doubt that as  there have been 4 other people I work with that have been over there and all had bad experiences. 1 star for getting  the name right, after that breakfast I felt "Sucker Punched".
Dave's Electric Brewpub=Ordered the french onion soup and it was so salty I could barely eat it. Best part though? The slice of bread on top was a hamburger bun. How LAME.  The waitress was cool and very attentive. My friend ordered chili cheese fries that were huge and tasted decent.  The burger was a greasy mess. I love the set up of this place, there have been so many different restaurants here and none seem to last long. And with mediocre food I doubt this one will last.
Jumbo Super Buffet=Stopped by with my boyfriend today after saying, "It can't possibly be THAT bad."  At least not worse than I remember.  Oh no dear reader, it was much worse.  I write this review while we both lay around the house in misery bemoaning the urge to throw it all up but courting an even greater urge not to have to taste any of it ever again.The restaurant decor is punctuated by signs telling you not to take more than you can eat so they don't have to charge more.  "They can raise the prices all they want,"  my boyfriend grunted as he pushed an unfinished plate away.  "I am NEVER coming here again!  They can't make me!"The buffet is full of whatever they can find that wont cost them too much.  Jello,  sushi made out of cream cheese, fried rice that's not actually fried - just mixed with yellow food coloring the best we can tell.  I ate a mislabeled shrimp wrapped in what I think was a chicken patty...only the shrimp hadn't been cleaned.  The chow main was made with spaghetti noodles.  The only items were eating were the egg rolls and banana halves rolled around in strawberry syrup, which I imagine came frozen.  Everything else is either stale, old, lukewarm, under-cooked, or questionably labeled.    A tray of shrimp in sauce were labeled "Pigs Feet" and left mostly untouched by the diners.  The last straw came when I sampled an empty cream puff.  (Though my boyfriends managed to get filling in it.)They didn't ask us if we enjoyed our meal when we paid.I imagine they don't really care."Don't worry honey,"  my boyfriend said on the ride home.  "If the spaghetti-mein was that slippery going down just think of how slippery it will be coming out."Oh no.This is probably the most sketchiest buffet I've ever been to. I was told it's $6 so hey why not try it?When you walk in you can already see how dirty this place is. Not a good first impression. Now the food. I'll give it to this place for having a decent variety in food but it looks and tastes like it's been sitting there all day. The rice, meats, and some seafood were hard and dry. The wet food items were sticky and smelled funny. The best things in this buffet are the ribs, chicken wings, and the egg drop soup. Their best is decent. Their soft served ice cream didn't even taste good. All I tasted was wet sugar. I'd only come here if I was insanely starving and only had $6.
Ambrosia Café=Enjoyed it here!On a spontaneous trip to Vegas this past Memorial Day weekend, I had the honor of meeting some down to earth peeps (DJ David and Chrissy) whom introduced my friend and I to some local Mediterranean food off the strip.After a long drive, we needed a quick bite to eat before hitting the nightlife scene so this was a convenient place for us. This small and casual restaurant accomodates nearly all kinds of foodies..from the health-conscious to the hard-core carnivores. Waitress was attentive and we were seated almost immediately. I liked the colorful and bright menu! Being as indecisive as I am, you really couldn't go wrong with the menu selection. Everything sounded familiar, simple, and straight-forward. I ordered the "Vegetarian Gyro" sandwich (tabouleh, fresh veggies, and tzatziki sauce) and my friend ordered the "Simply The Best" sandwich (Authentic gyro meat, lettuce, tomatoes, onions and tzatziki sauce.)  Both ~$6-7 and a decent portion size.KEY IMPORTANCE: Freshness!!!Upon arrival (quick service btw), I was visually impressed at the setup and freshness of the ingredients. Presentation is important to me so my mouth was salivating already. My camera phone didn't do it justice though (see pics), but let me tell you..as simple as the ingredients were...nothing beats a good gyro, but FRESH and TOP QUALITY ingredients! This had THAT!!! The tabouleh was flavored nicely. Simple and Delish!My friend devoured his sandwich in what seemed like 3 bites or maybe it was 2 and a half. It all happened so fast that by the time I looked at him, he was smiling with a look of sweet and utter satisfaction! According to him, "It WAS simply the best." HAHA! Or maybe he was just THAT hungry?! =pAs for me...I'm a pretty slow eater. I made sure to chew 13 times before I swallowed. haha. Okay..maybe not 13 times, but I did let all the flavors dance around in my mouth, but only to get a text soon after to meet up with the rest of our crew in 20 minutes! EEk! So I got to eat half and took the rest "doggy-bag" style.  Only 4 stars since the restroom could have used a bit of a makeover. I know, but I'm anal like that. Anywhoo, I will definitely head back to "Ambrosia Cafe" to try out their other menu items. I hear their "Falafel Sandwich" and "Eggplant Parmesan sub" are HITS!A great and quick stop to get your Mediterranean fix on!
Federico's Mexican Food=When I first moved here it was a Mic-Nics which is no more.  A few years back Federico's acquired the property and cleaned it up and painted it a bit brighter.  This location is open 24 hours but the dining room closes from 1-5AM.  It's a chain that started in New Mexico and expanded to Arizona at some point in time. They already had a presence here in 93 and was my first introduction to 24 hour taco shops.  I haven't been to one in a while for no particular reason, except maybe they were not in my path when I wanted Mexican.Having expanded here from New Mexico instead of the San Diego area like Filberto's and their many copy cats there are some differences in how identical menu items are prepared.  I had my standard plate of shredded beef taco and a cheese enchilada with beans and rice ($5.79) and a med fountain drink ($1.49).  First thing I noticed was there was no grease in the taco.  That may have been part of the slight flavor difference.  Also the cheese enchilada was made with a corn tortilla instead of the more common flour.  I thought they were a bit stingy with the cheese on both items, but I like lots of cheese on almost anything.In general everything was clean and while I was there the tables were cleaned off and the salsa station was checked and neatened up.  This was a Wednesday lunch and three tables were in use and a few take out orders handled.  Only one person spoke English, and then only just enough to get his job done.In a two day span, I frequented this monument to lard, not once, but twice; making Federico's my defunct dinner for two days in a row.How did this happen? Why did this happen?These were questions I woefully pondered as I spent nearly 3/4 of a sunday perched upon the porcelain throne, evacuating my bowels like Anderson Cooper and his news crew amidst a chaotic Tahrir square. The only reason to my madness, that I could fathom, in the clouded and reeking haze I was brewing that sabbath day, was that I had literally drank or smoked myself retarded- so much so that my ravenous appetite overwhelmed my better judgement.Friday night, my mistake was assuming that the graveyard shift would care enough to properly cook an Adobada burrito at 2 am. It honestly tasted like they doused some chorizo in red chili sauce wrapped it in a tortilla and threw it out the delivery window like an unwanted baby in bath water.Saturday night for one idiot reason or another I ordered a green chili burrito, which I'd assumed would be hard to fuck up, apparently not. This didnt taste like green chili pork, perhaps It'd be more apt to label it as "boiled pork offal with a splash of tomatillo salsa" it was proabably the worst green chili i've had in a long while.Sunday, Montezuma claimed his bloody revenge on this descendant of Spanish immigrants (had this angry aztec spirit bothered to scan my family lineage on ancestry.com he'd have realized that the spanish on my mothers side is hardly large enough to exact vengeance for atrocities committed by cortez and his cronies in the 16th century, but who am I to question undead central american monarchs) ahem. Lets just say I dont enjoy prolonged bathroom visits and this is what Federico's translates to in my vernacular.
Mabel's=I cannot pass up the opportunity to take the FTR (First To Review) on Chef Aaron May's latest creation... I stopped by for a drink during their grand opening celebration last night.  While I arrived too late to sample the food, those around me said it was fabulous... The place was packed but I think that is just because it was the grand opening... Located right on Main Street in Old Town, I can see this place being a perfect spot to grab a drink or a light bite after work, or as a more laid back place to go with a small group of people on a weekend night.  Aaron did a fabulous job with the decor.  I will return soon and update my review then... but I encourage anyone seeking a new hot spot in Old Town to go check out Mabel's On Main!Very nice atmosphere- dark walls, w/ furnishings in deep browns and burgundy tones.  Loved the plush railing at the bar- very comfortable!   Cool tunes, and while I really liked how it was very easy to converse w/ the next person in the beginning of my stay here (even the people across from us could hear what we were saying), by the end of the evening, the music did get louder.  The cocktail menu looked great, but the prices made me balk...Mabel's happy hour menu also features great-sounding apps!  A couple across from us recommended the pork belly.  While I can't even bring myself to imagine swallowing pillows of pork belly fat, which will eventually become pillows of belly fat on me (!), I do see other propitious options.Ummm.....so.....what's up with the whole 'goat' thing. Has no one else noticed the goat theme? How has this not been mentioned??Seriously, there's a goat head hanging on the wall (possibly more than one), little goats on the menus and bill book. I half expected to look up in the ladies room to find a goat peering over the stall. It was creepy and confusing. I NEED to understand it!!or...maybe not.Moving forward: The food was truly fantastic. We had the pork belly and deviled eggs with caviar, which were the two standouts for me. The meatball dish wasn't bad, I just feel as though I could have made it at home with things I already have in my refrigerator, so all in all, nothing special.Our Manhattan's were quite good overall but lacked consistency. If there was a next time, I would stick to wine.The problems I have with Mabel's are the following:If this review was based on food alone, it would warrant at least 4 stars, however the running question between myself and my guy the entire evening (other than the goat conundrum) was whether or not we even saw anyone else order or eat anything.That may not matter much to anyone, but why waste such talent on a place that seems to serve little more purpose than to be the next drop in for a bunch of 30k douchebags and  their cheap, tacky, sparkly dressed girlfriends. Seriously ladies and partially tucked gents, 1998 called, it wants it's bad taste back. Have some class. I don't need to see your manscaped chest or your womans' ass cheek hanging out of the bottom of her $29.99 dress. I may have been able to bump the rating up to three stars if the service wasn't  so awkward. I can't stand it when a server (almost always female) makes eye contact and directs conversation to my date only. I don't appear threatening, I smile a lot and try to make eye contact, I'm not going to bite you.....LOOK AT ME!! I'm a pretty cool chick and I'd like you to acknowledge my existence...thanks. For some reason, this happens to me frequently. I waited tables myself back in the day and I can't wrap my brain around that one but oh well. All in all the food was excellent. Drinks were alright. Service was weird. If we hadn't already had a table from dinner and were forced to stand I could totally see myself wanting to shank some bitches.  The whole experience felt a little 'Twilight Zone' especially with the goat situation. Doubtful return.This update is LONG overdue. Mabel's has become one of my favorite spots and is a solid part of my nightlife rotation. With that said, it has also become the cause and center of many drunken stories! And we all know drunken stories are the best stories...but this is about Mabel's, not my shenanigans. :) Music, whether live or spun by a DJ is always stellar. Makes me shake my groove thang and want to party like it's 1999! Service, every visit aside from my first has been top notch. Twice I've had table service with Holly as our server. She is amazing! They really take care of you when you have a group/event. Greg, the manager always addresses me by name and says hi when I'm there. Pure class. Also, they have some hotties working there I love to flirt with. (Yes, I'm talking about you, Silas...I may not have twitted you but I Yelped you! ;)Drinks/Food, fantastic. They have great bubbly here. And bubbly cocktails. Yum. Of course they have all the top shelf liquor. Bottle service is phenomenal. They get creative with your drinks for you if you want and we had this grey goose/soda/ginger drink that was major yum. I've only tried a few of the items on the menu (deviled eggs, scallops, and something else I can't recall, too much bubbly! hehe) but they were all delish and perfect for snacking. I was told they revamped their menu and I have yet to try the new items but look forward to it! Now that the weather is cooler, they have started really enforcing dress code. You see a lot of guys in suits and ladies wearing their Saturday night best. Just the way I like it! I can't say enough good things about this place. If you haven't been to Mabel's, you are really missing out. Your Scottsdale nightlife will not be complete until you pay them a visit.Be careful when you order happy hour drinks! Don't open a tab! Last night, we went to celebrate a friend who graduated and is leaving the country, and came at the beginning of the 7-9 happy hour. We were a pretty large group, and our waitress was very attentive, ensuring that we all had fresh drinks when required. My boyfriend and I each had two old fashioneds (olds fashioned?), which were watered down and full of ice, but for $5 we weren't complaining. However, when we requested our check at 9:15 (fifteen minutes after happy hour ended), our waitress gave us a group check for almost $300, with everyone charged full price for their drinks. When we complained, she said that she had no way of knowing what time any of us ordered our drinks, so she couldn't give us the happy hour prices, even though we had been there for two hours. Suddenly, what should have been a $20 check became $74, including an outrageous auto-gratuity. This may not matter to the typical Old Town Scottsdale crowd, but we are graduate students and can't afford a bar tab like that. So, thanks, Mabel's, for stealing my food budget for the week. With every bowl of ramen, I'll think of you.Love the vibe of this place. It's fun and chill and can have a good crowd. Didn't get to try too much of the food, but what I did try, the mac and cheese, was really yummy and the wine selection wasn't bad and the fact that they had happy hour certainly doesn't hurt either. My friend had a table for his birthday and it was really great and the staff was super. And the music was pretty good and there was a place to actually dance if you wanted to. It's a place worth going to when you're looking for dinner and drinks or an alternative to the usual dance clubs in Old Town.It started off as a crush, but now I think I am in love.  I went here for the first time on a  'Girl's Night Out'.  It was fun, with a great atmosphere, pretty people and good service.  Then there was a loooooong gap in time and Mabel's had faded away as a mere distant memory of a cute bar I once went to.  Then, finally, a few happy hours and I eventually met Chele.  She is the amazing bartender who wooed me many an evening at Mabel's with her bartending prowess and dazzling gin drinks.  Unfortunately, for all of you reading this now, she has left for New York city to concur the bar scene there and I wish her the best.  My favorite Chele conversation: "I have always worked in speakeasy kind of places since I started bartending, so I know lots of old-timer drinks and martinis, but the down side is I don't really know the 'younger' drinks."  And I say, "Well, what do you mean?" And Chele replies, "Well, this college girl once ordered a Tic-Tac, and I asked what is in a Tic-Tac.  And the college girl replied in her most valley voice possible, "how do you NOT know what is in a tic-tac, it is an 'ASU-thing'''...and what did Chele say??? "Well honey this is not ASU"  Priceless, and what makes it better is I don't think Chele is much older than 25!  Man, I am going to miss her.So, this is not even the climax yet.  I also stumbled in another random Tuesday evening to witness the filming of Mob Wives.  Not that I am a Mob Wives fan but it was funny to watch 'reality' TV being arranged...Finally, the point this relationship really turned into love was right before Christmas.  I was out on a cold Thursday night with 2 of my girlfriends, whom I had not seen in a long time.  The beginning of the night had been ruined at another drinking establishment, and the evening seemed to have been forgone and Mabel's was our last hope.  We must have looked defeated as we walked in the door, because after we sat down a fine gentleman came over to ask what we were drinking.  I looked at him closely and thought, he does not look like a server...it was one of the owners.  He introduced us to our fabulous waitress, Christina I think, and our evening was perfect from that point forth.  We also met the General Manager who was just as outstanding.  After 3 hours of many cocktails, shooters, good times and a cab ride later, I knew I had found my new favorite bar in Old Town.
Miracle Mile Delicatessen=I love Sandwiches.....so I decided to stop by this joint for lunch recently.  After browsing the menu for a minute, I decided I was going to order the New Yorker (Pastrami, Cole Slaw, Thousand Island Dressing, on Marbled Rye) w/Fries & Pickle for $8.99.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mKybTX2TTB_f_q9gj0s85Q?select=wYhry_TSaeyE3jlM3kqRTgTo wash it down, I ordered a large drink for $2.29.When you walk in, you get into a line like a cafeteria.  Then you place your order with someone who prepares you meal for you and then pay the cashier.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mKybTX2TTB_f_q9gj0s85Q?select=5tUWH1ZbuhFAMnR5sYaztAIt's an efficient process and it allows you to see other people's orders just in case you want to change your mind.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mKybTX2TTB_f_q9gj0s85Q?select=XQa5ffhPOJPUWHb_ULqogQI couldn't wait to take a bite out of my Sandwich.  The Cole Slaw comes inside the Sandwich, which I love.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mKybTX2TTB_f_q9gj0s85Q?select=Son0jYmuPk8BM11ZBga8dAThe only downside to this is that it makes the Sandwich very soggy fast as the Slaw will soak the Bread.  But that's OK with me.  I took one bite and thought the Sandwich was OK.  The flavor was pretty good, but I don't know, it wasn't great......didn't leave me wanting more.  The Fries were pretty good, but again just OK.  The Pickle was very good and was complimentary....very cool.Overall, it was a good meal.  There are other Sandwiches on the menu that I want to try.Return Factor - 65%
My Arepa=I had dinner here tonight with friend and fellow yelper John M. Rather than ordering individual items, we decided to try a half bandeja: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/NSmTvGgirPJ4mJ9jzNW-eA?select=3WQJvXTP_2auQSAcnL_k0g (a full bandeja feeds 4 people), which turned out to be a very good choice. The savory array in the bandeja included tostones, rice, carotas negras (black beans), fried eggs, blood sausage, chorizo, grilled steak, shredded beef, avocado halves, sweet fried plantains ... and an arepa, of course. If you come here with company, I highly recommend the half or full bandeja (depending on the number of people in your party) - it's a lot of really good food and you get to try an array of dishes that go very well together.
New York Chinese Restaurant=I have a love/hate relationship with this place. If I place the order for pick up or delivery sometimes the wait is much much longer then they say it will be.  I have been left waiting inside for up to 40 minutes and waited almost 2 and a half hours this last time we ordered for delivery. We actually cancelled that order and got a refund.  This would be the hate part of the relationship..Now the love part.. The food is pretty good. There are certain items I have ordered that I wouldn't and others I order each time. Like the "Fried Veggie Dumplings". You get 8 in an order and they are addictive. The Egg Rolls are bigger then I'm used to. I can get a 2 piece order of those and eat some dumplings and rice and be stuffed. I have always ordered online. I have only called when checking the status of my order.  The online ordering is very convenient and they have a area where you can out extra instructions. The "Orange Chicken" only comes in large size on the menu, but if you order it from the kids menu you can get the small portion. If you still want the larger portion then you might want to order the combination dinner meal with the Orange Chicken because then you will get a choice of Soup, Rice, an Egg Roll and a Crab Rangoon for $8.95 and the Orange Chicken alone is $8.55. Might as well get more for your meal for just 40 cents more.
Leticia's Mexican Cocina=After reading many reviews of this place, I decided to stop by here for lunch and try it for myself.  I was please to see how nice the decor of the restaurant was.  There are two dining room areas and bar seating.  The owner, Leticia, greeted me and asked me if I wanted a table or sit at the bar.  Since i was eating alone, I saddled up to the bar and ordered from the Bartender.  I decided on the Nachos and a Raspberry Iced Tea to wash it down.  While I was waiting for my order a server brought out complimentary Chips, Beans, and Salsa.  In Vegas, it's rare to get Beans with the comp Chips/Salsa....also, there were two Salsas.....a Chipotle based Salsa and an Avocado/Cilantro based Salsa.....it was excellent!A few minutes later my Nachos came out.  They were covered in Cheese and had two small portions of Sour Cream & Guacamole on top...certainly not enough for the entire dish.  The Nachos has a lot of potential....the Chips were fresh, all of the ingredients tasted very good....but the proportions were all messed up.  Too much Cheese, not enough Sour Cream/Guacamole/Pico de Gallo.....just the right amount of Beans & Jalapenos.  The Cheese was melted just right, but with some bites it overwhelmed the dish.  A lot of potential here...Overall, I enjoyed the meal and loved the friendly service and active owner who cares about her restaurant.Will I return?  I want to come back with my family and try a few more dishes.Don't ask me how I ended up at this restaurant located in one of those annoying fake-downtown retail/dining centers way the fuck out in B.F.E. Well OK, it's because my boyfriend lives out there. Otherwise, I would never have come here.We went during happy hour, and tried everything on their happy hour menu, all of which was shockingly affordable and shockingly delicious. The house margaritas were excellent, too. The chips and salsa were AMAZING.The atmo is sort of casual upper-middle-class-suburban Tex-Mex, and they have a patio for outdoor dining, where you can bask in the breeze created by all the SUVs blasting down one of those ginormously expansive asphalt rivers that pass for roads up there.Overall, it was excellent food at a great price, but I probably would not drive all the way up here to eat here. If they opened a location closer to midtown, then maybe.Feeling like GOOD Mexican food for dinner I had the idea of eating at Leticia's. We loved it so much the time we ate here before despite the ordeal we went through (see my previous review for details) that I knew it wouldn't be long before I had some of this yummy food in my tummy.I was so pleased with the "Happy Hour Menu". It runs Mon-Fri from 3-6 pm. You can get margaritas 50% off! They have other food items starting at $2.50. We tried the "Cheese Quesadilla" and "Chorizo Taco". Both were well worth the regular menu price but getting them and just a great discount is just a bonus! They had other things like nachos, toastadas etc.I tried the "Carnitas & Carne Asada Tacos" tonight and they were just so tasty. The rice that comes with it is good but the beans are the winner. The beans are thick and have great flavor.The "Fried Ice Cream" is very yummy!My experience as far as service and the food and restaurant are the same. Excellent.I wanted to update my review to let others know about the happy hour menu and the quality and consistency of Leticia's.I've been here several times and have never found "my dish" that I always come back for (until this night).  I come back for the ambiance and to keep trying to find that one dish that makes me crave coming back.  Saturday we brought some out of town friends here for dinner.  Looking for somewhere they haven't been before we thought this was the place that wouldn't disappoint.  We were greeted by the hostess as soon as we walked in.  There were people waiting but we were seated right away.  The waiter came to take our drink order.  He was very friendly and offered up some recommendations.  He brought out the complimentary chips and salsa.  There was two types salsa - one smokey (not good) and the other was a tomato based salsa and was very tasty.  It also came with a warm bean dip which because a favorite of the table.  The chips were an "eh".  Nothing special and not even sure if they were freshly made but with the salsa/bean dip you didn't really notice.  We did order some of the freshly made guacamole.  It was pretty bland and was in need of salt, but I would rather put my own salt on guacamole anyway.The BF and I both ordered the street tacos.  The waiter said they were what he usually ordered and so we thought we were good to go.  I ordered ground beef, chicken and carne asada on flour tortillas.  They were so good and I think I found my craving for this place.  It really was so much food though.  I only ate two and picked at the 3rd one.  It came with rice and beans and I only had a couple bites of rice.  I do love the rice here...its a no nonsense rice-tomato sauce and diced onion is my guess.  The BF and I also split a Mexican style corn on the cob (they cut it in half) that came topped with a white creamy cheese sauce and seasonings on top.  The corn itself had little cornels so it was just blah to me.  I might have to try this corn again because I'm not quite sure how I felt about it.  It was much different than I've had before.The middle of our meal the owner stopped by our table to make sure everything was going good. I think he has done that every time we have been here.  I always appreciate an owner or even the manager that can take time to acknowledge their customers.  A simple effort but not many do it.As our dinner started to wind down the karaoke crew started funneling in.  I had forgotten that they do karaoke on the weekends.  So we extended our drinks and our stay to watch some people strut their stuff.  I believe the starting time was 9pm.  Pretty smart to bring in a new crowd just as the dinner crowd is thinning out.  I hope it brings in some added business for them.  Really fun to kick back, catch up with friends with some good live music in the back ground.  Overall, the service is very personable and caring, the food is a delight, the ambiance is cozy and after 9pm on the weekends live karaoke lovin.  Score!I hate doing this, but I feel it needs to be said. Firstly, I love Leticia's. By love, I mean we eat here a lot. By a lot, I mean we frequent this place at least once a month. That's a lot for me. The reason for this update is the service. We sit at the bar because we like to play for free drinks. And it's usually just my boyfriend and I. Otherwise, we'll sit at a table. And I have almost always had a bad experience when we're seated. The waiters/waitresses seem so rushed, so annoyed and just generally pretty rude. I hate being biased and I have been for way too long. They are seriously lacking on how to treat clients. They rarely check on you, take forever to get you food or drinks. If I'm here with a smaller or larger party,  it's made no difference. Each time, we have been waiting too long or just had a server that doesn't seem too keen about helping us. The bartenders are awesome. They have a few new ones that have been excellent. The food each time has come out perfectly and delicious as always. The main reason we come to this place. Now, I hate referring people here. Each time, they say the same thing. They loved the food but hated the service. So, I give you 3 stars - for the servers, please...do not ruin such a great place. For the food, drinks and bartenders - I give you 5 stars.My Mexican friends don't like this place. They said it's not the food/flavor they grew up knowing. I find the food here real salty. The times I've been here, there's more gringos and gringas than Mexicans.I do love their chips, tomatillo, chipotle and bean dips for sure. I can eat 2 baskets of their chips. 5/5I've tried their signature dish: Quesa Taco. Loaded with cheese, very flavorful and very salty. I asked for no tomatoes since I'm allergic, they gave me tomatoes anyway. I scraped the tomatoes off but I guess not all since my lips were puffier than their puffy tacos. 3/5Puffy Tacos:Fried flour tacos. Greasy. Rice was salty. 3/5I love horchata. They don't have free re-fills though.The wait can be ridiculous even with a reservation. There are parts of the room that is dark and warm (to the left of the hostess' booth) and bright and freezing (to the right). Bring a scarf/jacket just in case.
Ritos Burritos=I'm shocked, SHOCKED at the reviews for this place.  Puzzle this out with me: + Take the top-rated burrito in Phoenix (Rito's "downtown" location has 4.5 stars, primarily on the strength of their legendary green chile burritos).+ Keep the same menu (with food so good that it makes Carolina's look like Taco Bell).+ Remove it from a tiny house in a less-than-savory South Phoenix location.+ Add hours (including Saturday hours!)+ Add indoor seating.+ Put it into a more accessible location with less wait time.Aaaaaaand... you get negative reviews!  What gives?Bizarrely, the criticisms are on its ambiance!   This is incredibly ironic.  Nobody slammed the old Rito's for ambiance because there was NOWHERE TO SIT AND EAT.  It was a crowded little house with an aging air conditioner that worked overtime to try to keep the temps under 90 as everyone stood and waited.  Okay, there were outdoor tables and chairs, but in the Phoenix summer, that's not really an option.  So now that the new location stuck a few chairs and tables indoors where you can sit in air-conditioned comfort while you wait, suddenly everyone's expecting a five-star restaurant environment!  What do you want them to do?  Start hanging the type of tacky decor most Mexican restaurants have around here - red and green sombreros, anyone?Let's get this straight.  Rito's is NOT a sit-down-and-eat restaurant.  It is TAKEOUT.  You order, you pay with cash, you step aside, and you wait.  You pick up your food, go to somewhere more convenient, cut into the best wet burrito you've ever tasted, and go to food heaven.  (It's probably good to go someplace where you have a little privacy, because some people in our society still aren't comfortable with seeing a stranger weeping over the perfect burrito.)The funniest part is that I think the new Rito's is designed to FORCE you to go somewhere else and eat your amazing burrito.  The place is so popular, they want the chairs open for people waiting for their orders, not people slowly burning their lunch break.  I noticed when I was there that they had purchased and mounted a glossy, pre-printed sign that said the restrooms were under repair.  Think about that for a minute.I'll close with this.  My wife is an ambiance junkie.  She loves ambiance.  A beautiful restaurant could serve her a hot pocket and she would be content.  But Rito's is so darn good that she doesn't even care about the ambiance.  We grab the burritos, head back to work, and by the time we're two bites in, we're already planning our next trip.It's that good.  Go get a green chile burrito enchilada style, eat it, and once the food epiphany has worn off, come back here and let's give this place the rating it so richly deserves.  Five stars.P.S.  Always, always, always call to see if they are open before going.  Their hours and days can be a bit irregular (for example, they are now closed on Saturdays during the school year), and occasionally they'll just be randomly closed.  There's no heartbreak quite like showing up at Rito's and then having to settle for some other type of food instead.
Fresh Wasabi Sushi & Grill=I received a restaurant.com gift certificate for Fresh Wasabi for Christmas and finally decided to use it tonight. Yes I know Christmas was 5 months ago.We brought another couple with us and I told them we needed to spend $100 to get the $50 per what the certificate had said. Other than that no restrictions. So we ordered ALOT of sushi rolls, edamame, gyoza and teriyaki chicken. The food was really good. We stuffed out faces and then we got our bill. We gave our waitress the certificate and debit cards. She then tells us that we cannot use that gift certificate even though there is NO expiration date and states the restaurant is responsible for the discount. We then try to use our Yelp check-in for the free appetizer. She tells us that's not for their location even when we show her where the address is on the deal.After all said and done we payed our full bill and left. We never would have ordered so much food if we knew they were going to refuse the gift certificate. The customer service was awful and unfortunately that is swaying my opinion of them. I will more than likely never go back because I'm pretty angry over my experience.
Luu's Chicken Bowl=Service, service, service!!! They always win us over with their smiles and positive attitude!!! The lady at the register and drive through is super nice and consistently friendly!!Plus, I am a super fan of the Special Chicken Roll and traditional teriyaky!!! :)
Sabor=My new favorite "go to" restaurant in the area! Love the food, love the service, love the atmosphere. I have been here a few times already and have left happy and full every time.This location use to be the old El Jefe's restaurant but newly converted to Sabor. I always describe it as a Mexican infusion - Chilis pricing for Carabas quality. I am suprised this place is not busier than it is. It is never packed when we are there.I LOVE the queso dip. AMAZING! I seriously lick the bowl. It is so delicious. Their bread plate is so awesome as well filled with breads, tortillas ext. YUMLICIOUS!My favorite dinner so far is the scallops. OMG - so perfectly cooked and every bite delicious. We finished with the banana foster icecream rum dish....it is so good. I have such a hard time sharing it. Next time...I am getting my own..LOL.So, if you think you can't make it down to Sabor.....I disagree...You Mexi-CAN! Go now and thank me later!
Freddys Frozen Custard & Steakburgers=I was certain I reviewed Freddy's already's but when I looked it wasn't there.Freddy's has good fast food burgers, thin patties cooked hot and fast so that they carmelize slightly.Pencil fries with cheese sauce are tasty, although the amount of cheese sauce varies wildly depending on where the moon is in relation to mercury and the various astrology signs.  This issue may have resolved itself with the advent of the new astrology sign.  As a matter of fact, this may have been the underlying cause for the creation of the astrology sign in the first place.I don't pretend to understand the greater workings of this mysterious universe which revolves around me. I do know that things are more in harmony when I have the desired amount of cheese sauce on my fries.
The Liberty=I've been curious about The Liberty for some time now, and I finally made it in to try some tasty lunch!I went into this meal with no expectations - I just wanted to give it a try. Hubs and I grabbed a seat on the patio, which was just lovely for half of the time, the other half I was covering my ears due to the fire engines leaving the station across the street. No matter though - that's not Liberty's fault!Liberty is pretty neat inside - a great bar area with plenty of high tops and a main dining room with lots of low, amber-colored lighting and a big kitchen in the rear. I also meandered downstairs where there is a really cool private dining area. Super sweet. Anywho, back to my experience. Our server was really sweet and efficient, especially considering we were the only people eating on the patio. I ordered the chicken & dumplings and was quite happy with the bird - crispy skin, plump bird and a small smattering of carrots, mushrooms and a few greens. While I was expecting large dumpling (considering the dumplings part in the description) it came with seven or eight ricotta gnocchi. Now, I love me a gnocchi, and these were indeed delicious, it just wasn't what I was expecting. The star of the meal though was my husband's mac 'n cheese - I totally took over that little skillet. It's the baked mac with more cheesy goodness than I ever though possible. Delicious, creamy and topped with a light coating of breadcrumbs. I don't know what types of magical cheese were in this tasty skillet, but I couldn't help myself. Overall, a really solid dining experience at The Liberty. I look forward to coming back, especially since it's in my 'hood!For our wedding anniversary dinner, The Liberty was a big hit. Starting off with the fact that I booked us on OpenTable and seeing the couple in front of us without a reservation get sent to the bar area!Great service from our waitress who did try to get us to bite on the drink and dinner specials, but we saw from the menu what we wanted and placed our order.My lovely wife had the brook trout with Carolina peach chutney and said it was fantastic. Great tasting fish, sweet chutney and creamy mashed potatoes. It's rare that she clears the plate but she did this time.I went for the crunch burger and it arrived as ordered, medium rare. Very juicy but a huge stack with pimiento cheese, LTO, bacon and crunchy kettle chips on the burger. I had to slightly disassemble it in order to eat this messy delight. Very nice flavor, very well done. Yum.No dessert tonight.Parking is a challenge on a busy night, but there are spaces in the lot next to the light rail and there's a valet stand that might share with Tupelo Honey. Or just take the light rail!Love the "donate" line on the check. It says that it's a donation to PlateShare.org.
Olive Tree Market & Grill=Solid 3.5This place is brand new. it is a market and a great place for lunch.My review is for lunch only.Gyro $5.99Fry's and drink $2.50Total $9.22The place is clean and has plenty of help. Everyone is extremely nice and helpful.The food was average, the pita was warm and the gyro meat was good. It is cooked on a spit. The tzatziki sauce was thin and not too flavorful. I have had better.Fries were a thicker type and had a little seasoning on them. They give enough for two to share.The salads looked good as did the "plate" types of meals .I will go back but may skip the fries and drink.Well over due for an update. The owners 5 StarsThe market 5 starsThe food darn near 5 starsI had the burger the other day..way impressed. It was double thin patties with hummus and cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion if you wish. It wasgood and filling. Today I had the Gyro with salad and a drink.Excelent Falafel - check Great hummus - checkAwesome spanakopita - check**Warning** Beware that veggie doesn't always mean good for you.While I normally try to skip the cabs, I just couldn't stop stuffing myself with those perfect triangles of warm pita covered with their garlic pepper hummus; it was just the right amount of spice with a more than right amount of awesome!I don't eat falafel too often, but this was definitely the most interesting and tasty falafel I have had. Cover it with whatever that creamy sauce was and you're in vegan junk food heaven!If you're wondering how the spanakopita (spinach pie) was, you just can't go wrong with this option. I was plesantly surprised when the spinach didn't taste like you're average cafeteria bitter blah, whatever-ness like I was half expecting. They perfectly topped the spinach with fresh feta - which was some of the better feta I've had in a while. Covered with flaky layers of filo dough and baked til perfection --- mmm its so good.Olive Tree is super authentic with my only regret being that I didn't try the Gyro, I have a personal goal to find the valley's best gyro and have had one at close to 10 - 14 places thus far. For some reason, on my only visit here I was just feeling vegetarian, go figure. :/I don't imagine I will be back too soon, since I hail from CenPho and this place is like 15 miles away, but it will definitely be a destination if I'm within a few miles around mealtime!Quoted in weekly Yelp newsletter 7-25-2012: http://www.yelp.com/weekly?editorial_id=0YYMd5auwMs-83hardCBZA
Pollo Royal Restaurant=Pollo Royal is a lunch favorite of mine. You may order at the counter or take a seat. They primarily specialize in chicken, but have other latin foods. As with many Latin countries, the food seems regional. I believe it's Central American. Ordering here might be difficult, because gal up front doesn't speak english too well. But if you really need to, the owner speaks english fluently and he is also very helpful. Many menu items are in spanish, but most are accompanied with a picture. =)Pollo royal specializes in chicken. They offer fried chicken (unbattered) and rotisserie/grilled chicken. This isn't your traditional American fried chicken. It has a lemony flavor and isn't fried to a crisp.  Both are quite solid though. Being a south of Mexico Latin restaurant, lunches are accompanied with plantains and/or fries or fritas as they call it. One of my fav dishes here is the crispy chicken tacos. Back home we would call them rolled tacos, but the proper name would be flautas I believe. Pollo Royal does them differently, but not in a bad way. They are topped with a cabbage salad, that I might say is pretty tasty for just being cabbage and some type of red salsa. The absolute best thing about this restaurant for me is their chicken soup. Although it is latin, it reminds me of home and of my mom's cooking. Comfort food is subjective and that soup for me is comfort food. It is slightly sour and with the lemon provided you can control the level. Nothing fancy about it. Its just your basic homemade chicken soup made with veggies and cilantro - just like my mom used to make. It  comes with rice on the side also. Mind you, it might not be for everyone. Ethnic chicken soup has a different taste. For me personally though, it is a familiar taste that warms my soul.

Gee whiz, how do I find the time?  Actually, this time I'd like to focus on their prepared food items/pizza/salad bar/gelato.I have tried the pepperoni roll-ups, swedish meatballs, and some other easy prep items from Mrs. G's prepared food area.  None of which was worth trying again.  I'm sadden to say this, really I am.  None of the items had any zip, taste, or verve.  The fiancee and I recently purchased one of their 'new' pizzas.  It's not a NY style, not a deep dish, not a thin/crispy crust.  It's somewhere between a NY and a hmm.... no words to describe it.  The pizza chef/manager told us Glazier's recently (within the last 4 months) changed their pizza recipe.  I wonder why?  Was it not selling, too many complaints, or too many whiny commentors?  So, the new version we brought home was okay and definitely worth forgetting about.  The sauce on the pizza really was quite upsetting.  I personally don't enjoy munching on tomatoes; the pizza had huge chunks of them in their sauce!Ahh the good ole salad bar.   How I love thee.  So fresh, so clean, so good.  My fingers want to keep piling vegetables in my to-go container when I'm around thee.  But at $6.88 per lb. I must  exercise restraint, for I have already created a 2 lb. + monster from your bed of greens.  Remembering when Glazier's first opened, they had fresh dipped ice cream available by the scoop.  Ice cream is good but, I have to be in the mood for it.  However, recently there's been a change in the freezer to GELATO!  This stuff, gelato, yummy goodness, I'm always in the mood for!  COOKIES AND CREAM and MINT CHOCOLATE CHIP are my weaknesses.  Glazier's carries both!  WHY, damn it!  However, at $3.79 for 3 scoops I cannot cower at the price, I'd be willing to pay double or perhaps triple (and have paid 5x the amount for the same thing at the Forum Shops @ Caesar's).Though Glazier's needs some work on the Mrs. G's prepared foods and pizza, they're doing a mighty fine job on their salad bar!  And whomever decided to replace the ice cream with authentic Italian  gelato, I'm coming over to give you a big kiss (j/k).I used to love shopping at Glazier's. USED to love it. Today I went in for my usual Monday morning grocery run. Since I have a new iPhone I wanted to take a photo to post with my Yelp review. So I'm over by the bakery section and this employee comes out and just starts yelling at me "You can't take pictures in here! That is AGAINST COMPANY POLICY!" And on and on and on. I mean, what kind of store doesn't allow photography of any kind? Makes me wonder what the hell they are trying to hide! So after this incident I asked where the stated policy was that said "no photos." No signs posted anywhere. But when I started looking around the store, I noticed more and more customer un-friendly signs. "All backpacks and bags must be checked." "We can refuse service to anyone." "All bakery boxes will be opened and checked." And top it off, the store has these hulky looking security guards that wander the store and will follow you around! Glazier's makes me feel like a thief! I've concluded that you should only shop here if you want to be made to feel like a second class citizen or shoplifter. Seriously!I'm really sad about this because it is such a nice store. Great produce and while it's too expensive for everyday grocery shopping, the wide aisles and wide assortment make it fun to look around. Of course, one dissatisfied customer is worse than having 100 happy customers because, believe me, I am going to share this story with everyone I know. I don't think Glazier's wants to upset the upper middle class community so they might want to rethink the unfriendliness of the store. Instead of shopping at Glazier's, it's going to be Whole Foods only for me.Things I miss about the greater Phoenix area:1. AJ's2. Sprouts3. Smashboxx4. A select group of friends.5. That's it.Today, after reading countless mailers for Glazier's, I finally decided to make the drive to this LOCAL grocery store. It's like Sprouts and AJ's all rolled into one.Thank God, because the first two on this list were something I grew to love while in Phoenix/Scottsdale.For those that don't know...AJ's is a local high end chain in the Phoenix area (think Whole Foods but smaller and for the nose up crowd like myself)...and Sprouts is similar to Trader Joe's but the stores are much larger.Ok, back to Glazier's.As soon as you stroll in, you are greeted to a very pristine sales floor. Everything looks immaculate! The produce section is perfect, the prices are competitive, and the selection is great! The hot deli section has everything from knishes, to pizzas, crab cakes, and even Cincy-style chili. Boom.The meat section...to die for. Everything else is laid out just like any other grocery store, but the rest is still just as clean, and perfect as the entrance.I am so glad this store is close to my house. There is a location in Henderson if you live out there.If you read the various rags around town, you'll notice that Glazier's consistently wins "Best Grocery Store" in Las Vegas. There is a reason. This place is the ish.I can't wait to come back!When I found this store almost 3 years ago, this grocery store would have gotten well over 5 stars. in 2010, this WAS the grocery store of Las Vegas to check out due to the friendliness and quality items. The store is HUGE!The chicken breasts are still the cheapest in town, the ground beef seems to be of good quality (no pink slime detected), and the produce seems to have good deals if you search through enough. Aisles and bathroom are always clean. The New York and Chicago products are well stocked.In 2011, I even spent over $1000.00 in one shopping trip to pay for the high quality food at my own wedding. Glazier's used to be that great of a store.Over the years, Glazier's has become the MOST EXPENSIVE grocery store in Vegas. I have personally shopped at Glazier's, and went to Whole Foods to find an ORGANIC version cheaper than what Glazier's offers at non-organic.Prices are not the only thing that has changed. When walking in, a bouncer at the Dance Club-type greets you at the door. Immediately, you are to feel as though you are being watched. London Broil was on sale for $2.98/lb. I wanted it cut in half - so they charged me last week's price ($5.99/lb!) I did not even notice it until I got to the register, where I found it is "new store policy" if you make the butcher do anything other than hand you a piece of meat. Hope it worked out for them, since at the register I gave it back.One other no-no here... I wanted to bag my own groceries.I worked in a grocery store as a kid. I am well trained to keep perishables together, produce together, etc.  I've been bagging groceries for almost 25 years! I'm told by the cashier it is "a safety hazard" if I bag my own groceries. This is a new one to me. Never in my life I have been told I could hurt myself from bagging my own groceries. If it was a "safety hazard", would Fresh & Easy be out of business by now? Surely the Health Dept would have shut down Winco and Food 4 Less as well. I don't see people in these grocery stores on the ground, writhing in pain from bagging their own food. One other tidbit I noticed... sometimes I shop at 10pm. The donuts used to be 25¢ each after 7pm. Not anymore. Five minutes before closing you pay the same as if they were just made. There is no law that says they have to mark it down... but just saying... one less reason I go there. Naturally, since I did not get to bag my own groceries, I get home to find 3 items in the same bag... a cucumber, chicken breast, and dish soap. This was a good store. I drove 10 miles each way to visit. However, "Mr G" has over-extended himself with petty policies and procedures. He has squeezed people like ourselves from shopping there on a regular basis. Instead of Glazier's I would recommend Sunflower market (soon to be Sprouts). Glazier's, I will still shop with you 2 to 3 times a year when I get cravings for New York stuff. Otherwise, I have found other places to go.How about that?!? After the cashier assured me that my debit card WOULD NOT BE charged twice, I find that it did in fact get charged twice (posted to my account the next day). I know registers "time out." I've been there, done that. I work in retail and it has happened so I know for a fact THAT IT WILL CHARGE THAT PERSON TWICE. She didn't offer to call and supervisor or manager, but against my better judgment, I left. I filed a dispute with my bank and hopefully my money will be returned to me in a timely manner. Glazier's management: Ensure that your cashiers are properly trained to handle all types of situations - and if they cannot, give them the tools necessary to ensure that customer satisfaction is their top priority. I chose not to call your establishment because I felt that if you didn't care if I shopped in your store, then you wouldn't care if you gave me back my $60. To some $60 is chump change - but I work hard for my money and $60 is what I could use for gas money and food for my family.Pretty torn about Glazier's. When you walk in there is a ton of freshly prepared food waiting for you. Pick up a nice deli sammie, a huge pizza to-go, a meal to heat up later or a cafe latte. 5-stars!... But then you hit the weak produce section, the tiny lil' 'healthy' section and you come back down to reality... Glazier's is just a normal-ish market. Given, you'll find some gems along the way (I snagged a random knish from Chicago that was so damn good), but for the most part it was a let down for me. Take into account I can only judge on the crap that I typically buy, so this could be your favorite store. For me, it's just A-OK. Somewhere above a Von's but way below a WF or TJ's.DO NOT EAT AT THE FOOD COURT. I used to work there and got fired for complaining so much about the fact that there were many COCKROACHES by the sinks. On the side wall I found about 6 cockroaches that were all the same sizes in the same area so I know there were eggs there too. My coworker was eating a stromoli and put it in the back and I walked back there for a towel and found 3 fully grown cockroaches on it. I found two baby ones on my sandwich station and when I told my supervisor, he told the manager in front of me then said, "k now that I told him about a problem he knows about and that we can't fix can you go back to work?" Sad part is the manager knows but decides to not do anything about it. Plus the owner's a dick and threatened to fire me when I first started because there was a water spot on the glass. And the owners a cheap asshole who only cares about himself and he doesn't deserve a cent of what he's making.Absolutely terrible business practices!!!I was checking my email after work and saw the new weekly specials for Glaziers - awesome! Scrolled through and saw their deal for Norbest turkey that was going for $0.57/lb if you spent $25, valid through 12/02. So off I went, in the lovely Vegas rain, to stock up on a ham and turkey for Christmas.Turns out when I get there that the deal expired on 11/27, although it said in BLACK AND WHITE in TODAY'S email that it was good through 12/2. The cashier checks with the manager, who then claims to call THE OWNER who says he is not honoring it. Seriously?! It's on your WEBSITE, the printed circular I have in my hand, and in your email. Buddy, I hate to tell you but you're doing a fantastic job of practicing false advertising. My husband and I have been loyal supporters of your store since you opened but your questionable business practices and apparent disregard for your customer's time and, believe it or not, ability to read, means we won't be back. Vons is less than 60 seconds from you and at least they honor their word!PS. Your "Thousands of Prices reduced" tagline in this week's ad? Maybe you should reduce it to the price you're advertising.I go back and forth between Glazier's and Vons. The employees here are always very helpful and friendly. I mostly come here to buy meats because there's a significant price difference in that department. I also come here to buy Blue Bell moo bars, I can't get enough of them and they're the only store in the neighborhood that carries them. They have a good selection of items but they have a small produce section, sometimes they have good deals but I still prefer to get my produce across the street, it's about the same price and I get too lazy to drive across to Glazier's, ha! Food court, the pizza is amazing, the slices are huge and the pizza itself is thin and crispy. They also have a bakery and deli which is nice but I've never actually purchased anything from there, Glazier's can be a bit overpriced but sometimes they have really good specials.Have you ever eaten frog legs? Yeah, well... that's not for me! But, I have to admit this store has grown on me. I really love the cultural influence in this store.I still believe the store is mostly overpriced. So when I shop, I stick to the outside perimeter of the store. I hit the fresh fruits, fresh salad bar, deli department, meat department, and dairy department. I pretty much skip the isles. They have the most amazing deli. Honestly, I go every Sunday now just to get their egg salad, cranberry chicken salad, and California tuna salad. It goes great with their fresh Hawaiian loaf of bread. I make these for lunches during the week! The other part of the deli has a great selection of deli meats. I like that I can place my order from a kiosk, then shop while it is being prepared to my thickness specifications on eat meat. They even text me when my order is ready. No more waiting at the deli counter for my lunch meats! When you have so little time, these things make a huge difference.The meat department always has cool items, like stuffed crabmeat in crab shells and stuffed clams in clamshells. The last time I was there they had fresh frog legs. Really... who eats that? I like that there is something for everyone though. If only they could just lower their prices on standard items like ketchup and cereal, I would not have to go to another store for the rest of my groceries.Items Selected:Pancakes with StrawberriesApple FritterStrawberry FritterPineapple FritterBlueberry FritterLemon Sprinkles BarMocha BeanDouble Chocolate MousseMounds BarKey Lime PieBlueberry Coconut CreamRed Velvet CakeHaving thought to have exhausted The Valley's list of Doughnut shops over the past two years it was on the recommendation of a friend that Glazier's Food Marketplace was identified as another source of novel fried dough, and recalling that Donut Mania's owner had once suggested he originally helped establish the grocery store's program it was just after 7:00am on Saturday that a stop was made, the cabinets well stocked with most options still warm.Advertising a whole new lineup, including four types of fritters to go along with the store's recently launched weekend brunch, it was admittedly with some surprise that Glazier's collection tallied more than two-dozen variations and ranging from cake to yeast and filled to frosted the 89-to-99 cent prices are a far cry from many other artisan purveyors, the results ranging from downright excellent to subpar grocery store stuff.Holding off a moment before exploring the donuts, a total of eleven selected largely as a result of space  per cardboard box, one could not help but wonder how The 702s "Best" Supermarket would fare in terms of made-to-order options, and taking the easy way out by offering fake syrup and a cold pat of butter alongside pancakes so dry they literally crumbled fork pressure the answer can simply be summed up as "horrible," an $8.57 waste of money with more than 3/4 deposited in the trash.Onward to better things, payment at an automated checkout fairly simple before returning to a table to indulge, opening bites of raised options spoke to a brioche base similar to that of Donut Mania and Pinkbox with just a bit more tooth, the blueberry coconut a bit artificial in its flavor while cream-filled rings of coffee as well as chocolate fared far better, the espresso infused glaze particularly robust.Unabashedly fond of fritters, a sentiment that many do not share, suffice it to say that those who cite oiliness as a reason for their displeasure need not fear as the ones at Glazier's are actually much 'lighter' than the average, yet although an attempt to raise the stakes with multiple flavors is indeed appreciated the substantial lack of whole fruit beneath a double-shellacking of sugary sweet glaze most certainly was not, the pineapple particularly affronting in its lack of flavor with the vast majority of each left in the box.Rounding out the morning with a cocoa-rich red velvet cake that made me wish for more classics including an old fashioned or buttermilk bar amidst the group, it was perhaps with good fortune that two bars and a tangy Key Lime Pie complete with graham cracker crumble were saved for last, the lemon filling beneath white frosting and rainbow sprinkles impressive in its tartness while the shredded coconut and cream amidst dark chocolate reminisced of a Mounds Bar in all the right ways, the sliced-and-filled presentation assuring a perfect ratio of each ingredient throughout.More modestly priced than other places offering novelty donuts, but at the same time not always executing on a level that shows the creativity to be matched by the quality of the staff, those planning to visit Glazier's for Donuts are encouraged to choose carefully while those looking for pancakes or fritters should steer clear and visit almost anywhere else."Don't you dare even think about squirting ketchup on that hot dog! It's a Chicago law!" "Yeah Dad, but we're in Las Vegas!" "OK, fine, spoil the hot dog and put more ketchup on your ketchup!"The above satire is typical between my son and I every time we eat hot dogs together. Well, that all changed after a visit last Sunday morning to Glazier's. I found Jay's potato chips, refrigerated celery salt, neon green relish, sport peppers, pickles, Vienna beef hot dogs and poppy seed buns too. Needless to say, we feasted on Chgo style hot dogs @ home in Las Vegas. Ketchup became an argument of the past.Also found my favorite dessert as a teenager, TastyKakes, located in the fridge section at the far right side of the store. They are shipped in frozen from Philly and brought back fond memories w/ each sweet bite.The deli counter is unlike anywhere i've purchased Boar's Head products....talk about hi-tech...felt like I fast forward my life into a Jetsons cartoon.  Glazier's deli shoppers can order from their iPhone app, at the counter kickin it old school w/ good ole fashioned face-to-face communication skills exchanging personable smiles, or enter your deli order into 1 of the 2 computer kiosks and receive a text when your order is ready for pickup. I very much appreciated this kiosk concept as a time saving option while I ventured off into the store in search of hard to find regional food products.TIP: Glazier's is open early and stays open late! TIP: If you can't find it, put down your macho ego and ask one of the friendly employees; chances are they have it and are willing to help shoppers find it.Yay! I'm a fan.See 9 photos below...YELP 300 CHALLENGE 2015: RECOUNTED ALL REVIEWS THIS IS #297.
Devil's Advocate Bar & Grill=This spot is going down as hit and miss. They hit on the HH drink prices which go until 7pm Monday - Friday, half priced drinks, all drinks, and their reverse happy hour many days offer buy one get one drinks. The food here is on the miss side of the coin. They have a full menu of burgers, fries, sandwiches, etc. but their tacos here are mostly the only food I've had. I think I've had a fried something or other at one point or another and likely an order of wings; but again the food isn't why I visit. This spot is fairly busy all the time, again, think drink prices; those cheap drinks really keep this place in business. They do have a Taco Tuesday special on tacos, but I think there *might* be better places out there for tacos. Drinks are not amazing, you won't find anything special or exceptional, but you can't mess up a beer or an alcohol with a diet coke mixer, well, you can, but it's pretty difficult. Take this spot for what it is, a hang out and grab a drink, I like the atmosphere though!Happy Yelping.
Gluten Free Country Store=An entire grocery store (ok, it's more like a 7-11 in size) Gluten Free? Sweet!This place is great.. lots of products. They also sell alternative items such as dairy-free stuff. They have a lot of kits for everything from baking muffins to dinner stuff like Hamburger Helper-style kits.I HIGHLY recommend this place and hope they get the support they deserve. The staff is SUPER friendly, helpful, and engaging. GO HERE AND SPEND MONEY. :)
5th and Wine=After seeing John H's "FTR," Anthony V brought me a copy of the 5th and Wine menu, and it was then that I knew, I had to make my way over to check this place out. So this past Friday, I met my friend Laura for lunch, and I was extremely pleased.  Service was friendly and attentive and the food was fresh, delicious, and priced just right!I went with the veggie salad.  Avocado, white beans, green beans, grape tomatoes, jicama, mozzarella, and just the right amount of herb vinaigrette.  I debated adding grilled shrimp, but i opted for a cup of butternut squash soup instead.  The soup was warm, but I would've preferred for it to be served a tad bit warmer.  It was tasty though and a nice accompaniment to the salad.  Laura went with the grilled cheese panini and french fries.  She seemed to enjoy it also.I cannot wait to go back to try the bruschetta - they've got some creative selections including "apples, brie, fig jam, honey and agave drizzle" and "prosciutto, figs, mascarpone cheese, and tomato jam."  YOu can choose 2 for $3.95, 4 for $6.95, 6 for $9.95 or 8 for $12.95.  Not bad and probably perfect for sharing!  I also noticed that 5th and Wine serves $5 wines by the glass daily until 6pm... you can't go wrong with that!12/17/09Saw that John Hill was holding a happy hour UYE and thought I'd check it out.  Haven't been back here since my first and only visit of what used to be Fine's Cellar.  I like what the new owners did with the place.  Unpretentious space.  I liked most of the dog art- I still can't appreciate dogs dressed in suits and playing poker, I'm sorry, but the psychedelic-prints are very handsome... I have one of a kitten at home, myself!HH apps menu is very reasonable here.  So reasonable, I spent about $50, with tip, on 3 glasses of wine ($5 each), 12 pcs. of bruschetta, fries ($3, I think), and chicken wings ($3 for 12)!  I'd skip on the ordinary chicken wings (which came w/ jicama slices and ranch dressing) next time, but the parmesan fries are d'lish!  I must warn you that if you lack even an ounce of willpower, DO NOT order the bruschetta!  Especially not the Apples and brie, nor the Fig and mascarpone.  Oh. My. God!I'm bumping up to five stars for 5th and Wine...Since my initial review, I've been back at least five times and I have yet to have a bad meal... I am addicted to the vegetable salad and the butternut squash soup, but I finally branched out and tried the bruschetta last night - PHENOMENAL!I highly recommend both the ones I tried: the apples, brie, fig jam, honey and agave drizzle, and the prosciutto, figs, mascarpone cheese, and tomato jam.To top off the attentive, friendly service, 5th and Wine now has live music in the courtyard on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays!Another place that was bumped up on the list thanks to Yelp in Bloom.  And this is probably one of my new favorite places.  $5 glasses of wine until 6 pm everyday, including weekends.  And not just "select" wines, almost all of them.  In fact, I had a nice glass of Sauvignon Blanc for $3 as an open bottle special. Yes, you read correctly.  $3!!! In Scottsdale!We sat on the patio which is behind the restaurant and nicely hidden from the street.  We started with bruschetta, and chose four to try.  I think my favorite was the apple, brie, and fig jam.  Perhaps my least favorite was the tomato, mozzarella, and basil, but only because it was too heavy for the bread and was difficult to eat.  They were all great.  We also shared a  prosciutto and brie panini which was really good.  They're not giant but enough to share if you're having appetizers.  And we were each given a salad with our panini portion.Our server was excellent, but we were given a dirty plate.  It was dirty on the underside so she probably would not have seen it.  Our wines were also mixed up.  When my lips puckered at the first drink, I knew I had the Riesling.  Luckily, I caught it before my husband drank my entire glass in one gulp.Overall, a fantastic find and I can't wait to go back.  Hell, why am I writing this review now.  It's before 6!Finally made it to 5th and Wine last night. Is it bad that I had 3 glasses of wine and a martini? If I wasn't hungover the next day does that mean I am an alcoholic or just a professional?  I don't care to know the answer, because that might keep me from coming back!Our waiter, Michael, whose name I remember because my mom only dates Michaels and he made a joke about her not looking like any of his ex-girlfriends, was fucking fabulous. Sorry, but sometimes I really like to use expletives to describe how great something was. I should probably give 5th and Wine 5 stars.  You know what?  I will.Live singer on Thursday nights- awesome.Me singing along and knowing every song because I'm good like that- even better.Waiter who aims to please- fantastic.Good wine- makes me happy.$40 a bottle- makes me happy I'm not paying.Bruschetta choices- perfect and so far, all delicious.   Reuniting my mom and a Michael from her past who still desperately loves her- what good daughters do.Hoping Mother's current boyfriend named Michael never reads this- priceless.OMG OMG OMG...This was some seriously good grub!  We had a party of 30 tonight on the patio and the staff was amazing.  They were helpful setting up the party and sosososo accommodating.  The chef actually called to apologize that they couldn't make something.We ordered several kinds of Bruchetta...the Apple and Brie with Fig Jam was KILLER, the traditional tomato and basil one was so tasty it was like it was just out of the garden, there was a steak with horseradish sauce that was out of this world.  We also had calamari fried, wings and hummus which were all top notch.  Where they get their bread...I need to know!There were so many excellent wines to choose from, the water was even good as well and was served in a quaint old fashioned milk bottle.On the patio there was a musician who played a guitar and sang who is worth going back for alone!The place is well appointed has cool art, comfy seating  and nice bathrooms too...I can not say enough...you must go to 5th and Wine!After experiencing a whole new light to 5th and Wine, I figured it was time for an update. I ate here during Yelp Eats Week. I wanted to try out the special menu items, but some of them were a little out of my comfort zone for 5th and Wine. Typically, when I visit this adorable wine bar, I opt for a salad, a panini or bruschetta. It's just the tri-fecta I think of when I go to any wine bar. But during Yelp Eats, some other items were featured on their menu, including the Agave Salmon and pesto chicken pasta. This review will talk about the new items I tasted during my last visit. The Agave Salmon was a surprising treat! Sometimes I get bored with Salmon. It's not the menu item I dream of, but it's the one I order a lot of times when I'm watching my waistline. I decided to order the Agave Salmon from 5th and Wine. I expected your typical salmon, which it was, but then they threw me a curve ball with the Agave marinade. It was a candy-like glaze that was perfectly paired with the Salmon. I could drink a glass of this Agave marinade it was so delicious. I also tried the Pesto Chicken Pasta. It was indeed decadent and carbtastic. I wouldn't probably order it as my main dish, but it's a great dish to order for the table to everyone can have a little bite. Or if you're really in the mood for a carbo-load, order it just for you! Some other items I tried were the Parmesan french fries, prosciutto wrapped breadsticks and the hummus. All three were delicious and right up my alley. I was pleasantly surprised with the prosciutto wrapped breadstickts because typically breadsticks bore me. But when they wrapped them in my salty friend, prosciutto, it added the perfect twist to the typically boring stick. After my dinner visit to 5th and Wine, I will definitely remember to switch up my meals here and not just order the typical wine bar food from the menu.Laid back yet trendy dining spot in Old Town Scottsdale, I'm glad tried it out.  We came in on a Friday night at 8:00 and we were able to get a table right away.  We sat on the patio where they had a guy on the keyboard going to town with some jazz music, very nice ambiance.  I ordered their signature bloody Mary and it hit the spot, easy on the tomato juice, just like I like 'em.  For apps we had the tomato and basil bruschetta, the bread wasn't that great.  The menu had a nice selection of seafood, pasta and a nice steak but I settled on a burger which was cooked to perfection, very delicious.  I could only take a few bites and packed the rest to go, super huge burger.The server was quick to bring out the drinks and food but she disappeared after that.  While we were eating our meal some random guy came up to our table and sat down.  We were both too polite to tell him to leave because he meant no harm and was obviously drunk; he just sat there talking to us while we ate... awkwarrrrd.  We kept trying to flag down the server to get our tab so we could bounce out but she never looked our direction when she was visiting the other tables.  We left as quickly as possible.What a fantastic neighborhood restaurant. The type of place that makes me want to move to old town.  And such a great Saturday night crowd! A perfect demographic mashup that felt more like Santa Barbara than Arizona.  For dinner I ordered the panini with prosciutto and caramelized onions. It was very tasty but arrived at our table a little too cold. My butternut squash soup on the other hand was piping hot and excellent. Just right for a chilly January evening. Unfortunately I was a little under the weather on this particular evening so I couldn't drink any of the wine but I am feeling better now and look forward to returning and getting a nice red wine buzz started.Love this spot. Parking never seems to be a problem in this part of Old Town. Walking in, we were greeted warmly by the hostess.  My girlfriend and I chose to sit in the lovely outdoor patio to enjoy the perfect weather that night. Our server was very helpful and recommended some pretty fabulous red wine. My girlfriend who brought me here used to work there so she recommended the bruschetta as an appetizer followed by the  amazing 5th and Wine burger and ending with the cheesecake. Umm... Yes total foodgasm! I need a cigarette. But seriously, I loved my burger, the fries, the salad - everything we had was delicious. Best believe I'll be back very soon!Tip- $5 glasses of wine during HHI came here for the first time last night with a girlfriend for appetizers, and was really pleased with my experience. Unforunately, we missed happy hour by only a few minutes, but we had a blast anyways!For starters, I really loved the decor of the place.  Red chairs, tables of all sizes, with such a great atmosphere.  There's room to spread out some, so its not like your sitting on top of one another.  Menu selection and prices were great, and the place was jam packed!My friend and I went with the shrimp appetizer and split it.  Order came out quickly, and the dish was so cute looking! Served with crackers, some sauce and some other stuff, we dug in immediately.  The shrimp was spicy! But in a good way...we both were surprised, but whatever it was marinated in had a nice kick to it.Overall, I had a really great experience here. So you ask, why not 5 stars? Well, here's why.  First, parking here can be a bit tight. The later you go, the more difficult it will be to get parking. This is a very popular part of town, with lots of other locations around 5th and wine to hang out at.  There is a parking structure, but plan on doing a little walking in case you go for a late dinner.  (Really its not that bad, but if your in heels or the weather is poor, come prepared!)  Secondly, the happy hour ended at 6. UM, most people work and can't get there that early!  my schedule allows me to get their earlier, but would be nice if they extended it until 7, especially on a Friday.  Thirdly, our server was fine, but overall she didn't seem to take much interest in spending time at our table.  She would literally continue walking and ask if everything was okay without hardly stopping. Yes, I know its a busy Friday night, but she seemed like she just wasn't interested.Anyways, place is great, I love it here, and I will probably be back for more in the future!Wine bars... What's NOT to love! Especially this one! I came here with some friends the other night and I already love wine bars so I love trying new ones. I loved everything about this place. From the food, to the wine, to the environment...I ordered the Chicken Pesto Pasta. This entree was delicious! I like it when they don't skimp on the sauce because I feel that it makes it taste dry. The pesto sauce was really yummy. I'm a pretty light eater and usually always have leftovers to take home, but I devoured it! My friend ordered the Portobello burger that I tried. Quite tasty as well and I like the combination fries and dipping sauce that it came with. I also ordered the Red Sangria which was quite yummy. It wasn't too sweet like most Sangrias that I've had. Our server was very friendly and knowledgeable as to his recommendations to what was good on the menu. I loved the lounge area that they have set up as well. You can stay and hang out after you eat. It actually reminded me of the Living Room wine bar in Chandler that I absolutely love. Another great thing is that it's in Old town Scottsdale so it's not that far from me. They have a happy hour menu as well that I'd really like to come back and try and will probably do an updated review on that as well! If you like wine bars with great food this is definitely the place to go! =)So, I can thank Groupon for finally coming to this place.  I've heard so much about it, but waited for 3 yrs after moving here before I finally gave this a try.  The experience and food was great.  Over several visits, we ordered:Wings Korean BBQ http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5th-and-wine-scottsdale?select=pTbXHxZ8CicgWm7jBdWvlA#pTbXHxZ8CicgWm7jBdWvlALamb Burger w/Pork Bellyhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5th-and-wine-scottsdale?select=92bjst7gE-8qXpkb95HEvw#92bjst7gE-8qXpkb95HEvwhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5th-and-wine-scottsdale?select=9dyAgYrFMaWu8tpXcdtMAg#9dyAgYrFMaWu8tpXcdtMAgFrieshttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5th-and-wine-scottsdale?select=-S_-WGJYnRVH7vQATf2SpQ#-S_-WGJYnRVH7vQATf2SpQBison Burgerhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5th-and-wine-scottsdale?select=-fWYw7JinySzB4reU21JGQ#-fWYw7JinySzB4reU21JGQ5th & Wine Burger w/White Cheddarhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5th-and-wine-scottsdale?select=gN4OONYG9QxzVITRaTpfRg#gN4OONYG9QxzVITRaTpfRgPortobello Burgerhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5th-and-wine-scottsdale?select=lQkcHDKn3MCqNf8CA8r1cw#lQkcHDKn3MCqNf8CA8r1cwPomodoro Pasta w/Meatballshttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5th-and-wine-scottsdale?select=G3Jc9YQUM7xx4NN1szZ6FA#G3Jc9YQUM7xx4NN1szZ6FAStuffed Mushroomshttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5th-and-wine-scottsdale?select=yMUE2PBzrW6l5tBWbrxoNg#yMUE2PBzrW6l5tBWbrxoNgMy favorite out of all of the items was the Bison Burger and the Pomodoro Pasta w/Meatballs....very very good!The servers here were good, except for 1 visit where she was a bit inattentive....that could be due to the fact she had our table, which was inside, and other tables out on the patio....out of sight, out of mind is what they say.During each visit, I noticed that there was always a large table full of women and tables with women only with gifts, etc.....this must be a bachelorette/birthday/GNO hub of sorts...who knows, those tables are always loud which is why I noticed them every visit.Overall, this place is pretty cool.Return Factor - 90%
Donna's Bakery Cafe=11/03/10A close coworker and good friend recommended I try Donna's Bakery many, many months ago (maybe even a year ago, whenever it was that it first opened-- the owners are close family friends of hers).  This visit was a spur-of-the-moment decision-- a rare thing for me as I like to do some legwork first before I try a new place.  I even texted my friend for directions and DB's phone number so I could inquire if they were still even open for business that evening!The young clerk I met there was very friendly and accomodating-- answering most of my questions w/ firm authority, and when he didn't know the answer, especially that concerning of the large fruit-topped birthday cake in the display case, he'd pop into the kitchen and ask someone for the answer.  I soon met the affable Mr. of Donna's Bakery, who informed me that the Mrs.- Donna- had to leave town that evening, but not before making the very cake I had a fixation on that very morning!  I hadn't planned on making such a purchase, esp. since Mom already had a birthday pass, but he made the cake sound so healthy (made w/ all-natural ingredients-- no powdered sugar, cornstarch, or corn syrup!  The fruits were brushed w/ a tapioca-fruit juiced glaze.  I don't think it even had eggs in the batter!), and topped with fresh, sliced fruits (w/ the exception of the maraschino cherries) AND filled w/ more fruit inside!  After selecting a few pastries to take home: a slice of German chocolate-mousse cake; a couple of red-velvet cupcakes w/ icing topped w/ red velvet cake crumbles (!); and something akin to an almond slivered-topped and flattened mocha cream puff (not pictured), Mr. Donna kindly offered a 10% discount on the cake.  Still hesitant in purchasing such a big item I hadn't had a chance to sample, I splurged and brought the cake home.  None of the smaller items wowed me (I found the cakes' texture to be very tender, yet lacking in moisture- strange), but that birthday cake was very, very good!  The layers were made of angel cake, and I LOVED the fruit-and-cream filling the most!  Mom didn't think much of the slice she had, but she was going through a period of a few months when she wasn't craving anything sweet, which was a good thing!  So, I sliced the rest of the cake and brought it to work-- everyone who had caved in to the temptation loved it.  Some even had seconds and thirds!!I plan on going back to try a few savory items that sounded good on the menu!
The Compound Grill=I always thought it would be cool to have my own private compound.  You know, kind of like the "Cheney Compound" that our former VP had.  Except I would let Google Maps display mine...mostly because I don't have the power to bend the intertubes to my will and control the Googles.  I also don't have a man-sized safe in my office or play "pepper the lawyer" with my lawyer friends.Not that I'm against the occasional "peppering" when it's called for in the case of not just lawyers but oil company and health insurance company executives, politicians or media talking heads.  I would of course only sanction rock salt or bird shot, I'm a reasonable man after all.But since I don't have a compound I guess I can go to The Compound Grill from time to time.  I was here for a UYE send-off of our illustrious Yelp Community Manager, Gabi.  Not that we won't see her anymore but she is moving up the ladder and overseeing multiple Yelp communities now, sort of like a really cool and sophisticated mother hen overseeing a bunch of foodie chicks from different nests.  Not exactly like chicks because she can tell if we're male or female by looking.  So The Compound Grill hosted this event because they stood to make a few bucks off of the deal.  Hey, they're in business to make money, right?  When we arrived we had the choice of going "off the menu " or buying the wristband for $10 and having the buffet and a couple free drinks.The buffet was pretty good.  I liked some of the food better than others.  The chicken satay sort of things were tasty and I appreciated that they had some nice hot pepper sauce to punch it up.  The salad was good, the sushi ok, the key lime torts were tasty, I loved the grilled sweet potato. The Compound apparently has live music regularly and they get some pretty good acts.  Overall I liked the atmosphere, the service and the food and I would come back to take in some live tunes.  The Compound Grill displays easily on Google Maps so they may want to look in to that.This place is random.  R A N D O M random.  I don't "get" it.Went for lunch, while taking a break from medical testing at the Mayo Clinic.  This place was empty.  Ok, there were a half dozen other people there, but it barely counts with the size of the place.Now, I like that there is a stage (guess who thought of doing comedy there???!!!) and that they have live music that promotes local bands.  I am all for that.  But, there comes a point when you can't have the place seem too classy for that sort of thing.  Framed pictures of different musical icons are nice, but overplayed.  Everywhere else.  It just doesn't work here at Compound Grill.I had the fish n chips for lunch.  5 nuggets of fish places over a bowl of fries that weren't anything special.  When will people stop serving shoestring fries????  It was cool that everything was served in a bowl made from an old record that had been warped into...the shape of a bowl, though.  Service was friendly and attentive.  The manager or owner or whoever he was also present.  I'm guessing because they though there would be a lunch rush.For this area, in N Phoenix, so close to the 101/51 and N Scottsdale, I would expect a bigger lunch crowd.  Without it, I guess shows I'm not the first person to just find the place "meh."The CompoundThis venue does not honor their contracts with artists that perform at the premises...do not play this event unless you are prepared to receive a BS story about why they wont pay there contractual obligation despite your band packing the house with at least 250 people, their music director "Kyle Day" is a liar, cheat and participates in un-ethical business practices...AKA....Arsehole....
Whiskey Warehouse=Well, it seems the potential for upscale whiskey bar is being squandered on the frattiest crowd ever to descend on Plaza/Midwood (which is saying a lot, considering the crowd TST draws). Since the cask beer is my main reason for coming here - and its seldom on tap - I'm giving up. The parking in this area has always been tight but its been taken to a whole other level of screwed since WW opened. Harris Teeter and CVS have put towing programs into effect because patrons of this joint (and hey, others too, but no one really complained until, coincidentally, right after WW opened) are too lazy to park in the municipal lots scattered around the 'hood. Watch out driving by the place in the wee hours, too - you'll inevitably be lunged at by Turd Ferguson and the Misses, thinking you're the cab they called. Idiots.Whiskey Warehouse - your service sucks and I could get better pimento cheese dip at the HT across the street.  I was here last Thursday and at 11pm a snottty manager-type lady came over and asked us to cash out because she wanted to leave for the night.  WHAT??  How can you be rude and come over so early?!  I looked at my watch and thought geeez time must have gotten away from us but no - it was only 11.  Are you kidding?  Can yall get with it?Above average whiskey selection! I was impressed how this place has "Jack Daniels" stamped on nearly everything. The place is a giant billboard for Tennessee whiskey. When we arrived, it was super loud. They had a DJ playing dance hits, with people getting out of their seats and getting rowdy with the music. The place had a definite fratty vibe. The whiskey selection was decent. I've seen much better lists of bourbons, and it seemed like they were mainly just picking out as many whiskeys as they could. They were missing great bourbons, but I guess it's not a bourbon warehouse, huh? They offer a variety of decent locally brewed beers, which was exciting. The beers were nearly all $5. The service was pretty good, our drinks never went empty, and we were checked up on regularly. The place is clean, and well kept. It has a classy interior, with an awesome rooftop patio! My favorite thing about this place was the number of televisions that they had going. They're on every surface around, each tuned to a different sporting event. This seems like a great place to catch a game!
Tienda Los Gemelos=5 star update!  This is, so far, my favorite place for tacos in Madison.  If you're looking for tasty, authentic Mexican eats this is the place to get it.  I went back a few times for lunch recently and left super satisfied. Here's how it goes:1) walk in, head straight back and grab a beverage from the cooler.  Mexican coke, anyone? 2) take a seat, any seat. And wait (sometimes a while) 3) place your order.  3 tacos: campechano*,  al pastor and steak4) eat5) pay. 6 bucks. That's some cheap eats, friends. I recommend eating in so you can try their amazing sauces in your tacos. Everything comes out fast, hot and fresh. Everything I've had here has been incredibly tastyService isn't the best, but the food is so tasty that I don't care.  When you're done eating, check out the store.  You'll find some housewares, spices, groceries and even some of the meat you just consumed. Pastor meat, get it. I still need to get out there on the weekend to try their specials.  Barbacoa, pozole, carnitas and chiles rellenos are a few that come to mind.  *the BEST taco in Madison. Chorizo and some crispy steak bits. Do yourself a favor and get this.
Xo Chinese Food=Meh is right... lets start on a positive note. The service was friendly, very friendly. I ordered take out the General Tso Chicken with Lo Mein and Edd rolls. It came out pretty prompt (7ish minutes or so) But when I got it home i opened the bag only to notice the guy hadn't closed the lid all the way and the sauce and lo mein were every where. it drenched the egg rolls and made them soggy. It also made everything taste the same. And the noodles seemed to be over cooked, they are so soft... yuck! And for 10 bucks you can get much better. Ill stick with my Grand China on Durango & Warmsprings...
Julian Serrano=Being the food-crazed person that I am, I perused the menu extensively before making reservations for my husband and I for NYE. We even half way picked out what we were going to have before arriving (yup, I'm food obsessed). I was beyond psyched to try the lobster/pineapple and ahi tuna/raspberry. Drink orders were taken after 20 minutes. Drink orders were forgotten. Service was pretty damn bad in general. Also I did experience the issue the other person faced where they kept asking about dessert after 10 minutes with our first course (WTF)? These things I can forgive them for, given it's a new place. The guy finally takes our food order, and after taking the order says "well we're out of lobster, tuna, and scallops". WTF. It's 5:30, we're literally one of the first diners of the evening. He doesn't offer an explanation (mb the supplier flaked?), or an apology. Just "we're out of half the menu" essentially. I'm more than a little irritated, as these were the items I was most excited about. Why 3 stars? The food we did try was really good. *Risotto with mushrooms and manchego: Tiny (it's tapas), but DAMN Good. I was scraping the plate. *Beef with brie: Note, this has honey and nuts all over it. I found it scrumptious, but mb the idea of a honey covered steak doesn't appeal to everyone!*Mini Chorizo over garlic potatoes: yup as good as it sounds*Garlic shrimp: Boring. This was a sad substitute for my lobster I wanted.. grrr*Spanish creme brulee - HUGE and quite good*White Sangria - packs a punch.. there might be 2 hours of NYE that I can't remember and I blame this sangria!Overall it has major potential, but my first dinner here was a bit of a disappointment. I'm excited we have a high-end tapas place finally, so I'll definitely be back to give it another shot but I'll probably give them a few months to get the kinks worked out.It was a Saturday night, my LV partner-in-crime and I were in the Aria Hotel, and decided to dine at Julian Serrano after reviewing the menu. Truth be told, since this resto name somewhat resembles mine (as people have mispronounced and called me by this name along with others- ask me about if you're interested), dining here was really a no-brainer. hah! With no reservations, we chanced it and apparently lady luck was on our side, as there was no wait. The warm colors of the restaurant looked so inviting. Here's a pic of the bar area, taken with my iPhone http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_w5hBpkjHs5_Hv3pLeHtIw?select=0OlrsQnQXZSPeD5NFJMvmAFrom our table, here's a shot of the entire restaurant http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_w5hBpkjHs5_Hv3pLeHtIw?select=GblIBlQF3t_da6M1L-zYbwEverything on the menu looked so delicious, so we ordered (and pics credit go to my girl, Li):- Beet Salad: Roasted and oh so beetalicious! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_w5hBpkjHs5_Hv3pLeHtIw?select=758bzflJcsXww0Lrl4dYeA- Beef with Brie: Tender pieces, with brie, (one of my fav cheeses). Oh Mylanta, such a digalicious combo, and with walnuts on top, and the savory sauce was divine! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_w5hBpkjHs5_Hv3pLeHtIw?select=ILrElkjFRWwhzXsjWWQ8xA- Striped bass: Fresh fish, cooked to perfection. Delish! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_w5hBpkjHs5_Hv3pLeHtIw?select=z4xiwtEsBVbf-jFhDgX7AA- Creamy Risotto with Mushrooms and Manchego: Mouth watering deliciousness, and so rich, creamy, and cheesey goodness!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_w5hBpkjHs5_Hv3pLeHtIw?select=bJAq88XYZOcUhvlGSTUkuA- Pan Manchego: Spanish Toast with roasted tomato and garlic paste with melted Manchego cheese. All I have to say is mas pan, mas pan! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_w5hBpkjHs5_Hv3pLeHtIw?select=HLxPDvdXAqwLErnnHtCVdw-Chocolate Cake: Chocolate molten cake, which rivals my favorite chocolate souffle at Roy's Hawaiian restaurant. Combined with mango sorbet, and I was in dessert heaven with these two loves of mine. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_w5hBpkjHs5_Hv3pLeHtIw?select=Igp440NlqPIVtgwWajkFfwWhile we feasted so well, our beverages were refreshing white sangria (para mi) and red sangria (para mi amiga), and later had very 'brave' coffee. We needed the caffeine jolt, as it was only the beginning of a very fun and memorable night out.Que bueno, Julian Serrano! Beautiful interior, efficient service, reasonable prices, and wonderful food. This is a great restaurant for a date, a small or big group of friends, and perfect for getting the night started off right in Sin City! Viva Las Vegas!!This place is a surprisingly good vegan eating option on the Strip.  Most of the vegetarian tapas are vegan (since they use olive oil and not butter in their preparations) or can be made vegan with the omission of a sauce.  They even prepared a vegan paella for us! We tried pretty much every vegan-friendly dish on the menu, and I was very pleased for the most part. The only disappointment was the cold eggplant salad.  Bad texture and very bland.  Beet salad, patata brava, padron peppers, gazpacho, etc. were all very good.  They have vegan mango and maybe pineapple(?) sorbet there as the only vegan desserts... but they are fantastic.  Good Spanish wine and sherry (if you're a sherry fan), fancy cocktails (nothing special, especially for the price).One of the servers there, Stephanie, is vegan... so request her if you want to ensure that you get all the vegan options!The Skinny: undercooked rice in the paella, bland chicken croquettes with no chicken in them, flavourless sauteed spinach (2); service: is good and prompt (4); value: I'm sorry... we spent $90 including tax and tip, no booze, on food that isn't that great (1)We were hovering between going back to Sage for round two or heading over to try Julian Serrano for dinner. My hubby decided, for the sake of Yelp reviews, that we ought to try something we haven't done before. This is even despite the average 3.5 star rating.So, we checked out the menu and ordered the Valencia Paella, the chicken croquettes, the sauteed spinach, the mushroom soup and the stuffed dates.The chicken croquettes were singularily unpleasant. Not much chicken inside, the bechamel sauce was bland. So basically, you bit into a croquette filled with bland bechamel... yuck!The mushroom soup as an odd mushroom underseasoned consumme with foie gras foam (that didn't taste like foie gras). Considering the price you paid for this dish, it clearly doesn't deliver the luxury you are expecting.The stuffed dates were atrocious - greasy and boring.  You couldn't taste the bacon, just the warmed dates with the crunch of a flavourless blanched almond.Sauteed spinach with apples, raisins, shallots and pine nuts - sounds really yummy right? Well, it would have been if they'd added a grain of salt to the dish. The spinach was also unappealing on two levels - 1) uneven cooking method (see the pic - some are cooked, some slighty wilted) and 2) not enough oil leads to that filmy sensation feel inside your mouth.The Valencia Paella was improperly prepared. First of all, the flavours were off for such a dish - perhaps too much saffron. Secondly, the rice. Now, I know that the rice is supposed to be al dente. But this was not al dente, my friends. It's considered raw when the rice after chewing leaves a grainy texture in your mouth. Plus, if you look at my pics - no evidence of that wonderfully toasted socrrat layer (no golden brownness to the rice or the bits sticking to the bottom of the pan).Third, the chorizo was subpar - texturally dry and one note... salty - it could not stand up to the other mediocre components of this dish.So overall, a 2 starred review - mostly for the excellent service.The Julian Serrano Tapas Restaurant carries the name of its executive chef, Julian Serrano, who has made a name for himself in Las Vegas as the celebrated chef at Picasso's at the Bellaggio for the past decade. Prior to that, he was the head chef at the world famous Masa's, in San Francisco.Here in the Aria at City Center, the grandiose, massive and latest project of MGM Hotel Group, it adds a nice modern Euro feel to the ultra modern and art infused City Center complex, and adds a splash of mediterranean hot colors to the understated Japanese-like hotel color motif of the Aria hotel. It's like a saucy Flamenco dance hall in the middle of the hi-rise offices of corporate giants in the Shinegawa section of Tokyo. Or like the Guggenheim's museum in Bilbao, Spain amidst the rustbelt of the surrounding aging industrial factories that once were the heart of that city. It was later on a Thursday when we came, and it was fairly unoccupied. Sat at the bar and was professionally waited on with a lot of attention, owing to the sparse crowd. The room is large and very open; there are dozens upon dozens of bar seats, the ideal tapas location, strung along one side of the restaurant. The ambiance is a classy-festive feel and decor, but very pro in service. The specials were told, but they were all fairly heavy and hearty, and we were in a lighter mood, it being about 9:00pm. So we opted for 4 light dishes:-Marinated Olive Medley ($3) about 5 different offerings including pearl onion-White Ceviche ($10) This was light, with just a touch of onions and tomatoes, served with a wafer and garnished with cilantro and radicchio- Escalivada ($8) - were roasted bell peppers and mushrooms in olive oil with a baguette toast slice- Avocado Cannelloni ($10) this was a light cannelloni wrapped not in noodle, but thin avocado slices topped with chopped nuts, and sided with a dollop of guacamole topped with watercress and a side splash of aioliWith a Gin and Tonic, the bill was $43.24 before tip, and satisfaction came with the refreshing flavors with the creative and traditional dishes from Julian Serrano at Aria.***Aria's Julian Serrano is a nice looking tapas spot with a menu that sounds good; unfortunately, the food was surprisingly mediocre***Julian Serrano is a tapas spot that is near the front lobby of the Aria Hotel.  The decor reminds me a little bit of the Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill in MGM Grand in how the restaurant is very much open to the casino and the hotel.  There are no big and thick walls separating the dining area from the nearby bustling activity of the casino.The decor is very upscale cafe-like and hotel restaurant-like.  Nice and contemporary but pretty standard stuff (not unique or memorable).We had a few things here and I felt the food looked better than it tasted.  Several of the dishes were average.  I was not a big fan of Fleur by Hubert Keller (a tapas spot in Mandalay Bay), but I felt Fleur was noticeably better than Julian Serrano.Here is a rundown on what we had.(Ahi Tuna Tempura) This was ahi tuna two ways.  There was a standard ahi tuna tower on the plate that had an avocado base (fresh and a good flavor but something you will find at a lot of other restaurants).There was also ahi tuna that was flash fried in a light tempura batter (crispy on the outside but still rare on the inside).  This was okay and I liked the contrast of the cool center with the crisp outside.  Still, I've had a much better version of that dish at Ocean Avenue Seafood in Santa Monica.(Mediterranean Bass)  This was a bass with the skin-on that was served over some veggies with a light sauce.  It was a light dish and had a mild flavor.  The fish was pretty moist (the skin could have been crisper).(Cheese Platter) The cheese selection at Fleur was much better.  The cheese here was a little dry (not great flavors either).  The garnishes were also disappointing.  The fruit paste was too thick and lacked sweetness.(Chicken Skewers) The chicken skewers here were juicy enough, but they lacked flavor.(Prime Tenderloin Topped With Cheese, Honey And Pecans) The quality of beef was really poor (at least when compared to the other dishes we had here). The beef was a thin piece.  They overcooked it  (it came out well) and it was dry and chewy.  The cheese, honey and pecans were all fine, but the centerpiece of the dish (beef) was a real disappointment.(Stuffed Dates) The dates here were wrapped in bacon and then deep-fried.  This is a pretty popular combination and their version of it was pretty tasty (though kind of a given with this flavor combination).Service was okay.  Food came out at a good pace and the staff was attentive enough, but I felt the wait staff was not as strong as what I experienced at other Vegas spots recently (including Fleur, Mesa Grill, Comme Ca, Bouchon, and Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill).I've been fortunate enough to have a lot of service where it felt the wait staff was really putting in the extra effort to make every aspect of the dining experience enjoyable and memorable.  While the wait staff was pleasant enough, I did not get that same feeling here.Julian Serrano sounds like it would be a nice place.  The menu reads nice as well.  There were mostly misses here though and the food was just not as good as other Vegas spots I've tried in the same price range.  I will give a lot of places a second try, but since we had so many dishes and so many were average, I doubt I would return here.Aria features complimentary valet parking.  I am not sure if they feature complimentary self-parking as well.Top notch modern Spanish tapas served in a very cool, contemporary setting.The food combines the traditional flavors with just the right amount of modern, molecular gastronomy to keep it cool and fresh.  After several visits, these are my favorites:Ceviches.  Excellent.  Both (white fish and mixed seafood that adds shrimp and octopus) are near perfect.  The seafood is extremely fresh, peppers and onions still retain their crunch, and the lime juice adds a bright finish without being overpowering.Angulas (baby eels).  The slight brininess of the eels blends perfectly with the garlic and chili oil that they are served in.  If hundreds of eyes looking up at your from your fork is a problem, skip this dish.Incredible ham.  The serano is good but the imported pata negra is much better.  A real treat although I would prefer that no sauces or accompaniments be served with it.  Why mask a good thing?Paellas.  How can you not love chicken, rabbit, and chorizo rice or calamari, shrimp, mussels and monkfish.  All the proteins are cooked perfectly and deeply flavor the saffron rice.  Plan ahead if you want to enjoy the paellas.  They all take about 30 minutes to prepare.Service is excellent.The wine list is extensive with a lot of choices from Spain which pair nicely with the food.  Prices are fair by Vegas standards.Had dinner here with a good friend.  Have always passed this by on prior visits to Aria and never gave it a 2nd thought.  When he suggested Tapas for dinner, I was excited to give this joint a try.The menu isn't as extensive as other Tapas restaurants, but the quality is exceptional.  We ordered:- Brava Potatoes (Spicy Tomato, Alioli Sauce, $8)- Creamy Risotto (Wild Mushroom, Manchego Cheese, Natural Jus, $10)- Pan Tomate (Toasted Bread, Fresh Garlic, Tomato Sauce, $6)- Spanish Tortilla (Potatoes, Eggs, Onions, $8)- Stuffed Piquillo Peppers (Goat Cheese, Mushrooms, $10)- Stuffed Dates (Almond, Applewood Bacon, Spicy Piquillo Pepper Sauce, $8)- Buñuelos (Spanish Doughnuts, Butterscotch, Caramel, $8)The Brava Potatoes were OK.  They had good flavor, but were very filling.  I don't recommend having this if you want to try more than a couple of items....this is a gut-buster.The Creamy Risotto was awesome!  I finished it off in no time.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_w5hBpkjHs5_Hv3pLeHtIw?select=lMySncNeWzMMnVjutvUdYwThe Pan Tomate was pretty good....an excellent start for the meal.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_w5hBpkjHs5_Hv3pLeHtIw?select=GGXY6sUnEQD0-tlpUFHM_wThe Stuffed Piquillo Peppers were my favorite...yum!  They cooked just right and the sweet and savory flavor of the Peppers went perfectly with the Goat Cheese and Mushrooms.  I could eat a large plate of those, easily.My friend had the Stuffed Dates and the Spanish Tortilla.  He enjoyed both of them.The other highlight of my evening was the Buñuelos.....damn, these were good!  The Caramel Butterscotch dipping sauce went perfectly with the Spanish Doughnuts.  I love how they have the toothpicks for easy dipping/eating.  They are addicting too because I can't get my mind off of them.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_w5hBpkjHs5_Hv3pLeHtIw?select=6365pbJb9_eE-Hj_kxdMtwOverall, it was a great meal and good times.Return Factor - 90%Mmm. Firefly to the tenth power. Food came out bangin'. To begin we ordered the stuffed dates, some of the lightly breaded calamari, pan y manchego cheese, paella and I believe braised mussels. Definitely one of the best food experiences I've had since moving here. Paella was delicious. It came out hot, with a lobster claw and a ginormous prawn for the "Mixed Paella" that was nice and tender. Service was on point -- filling our water when needed, divvying our paella, providing us with some bread when we needed to sop up some mussel juice even. Service wasn't too obtrusive and dispite being a little secluded in the back corner (it was by choice as I wanted for me and the date to have a little privacy) came by frequently enough to check up on us when needed. Oh and all that seafood paired with the light, crisp white wine sangria just made my mouth melt. I wanted a pitcher. But watch out tho' folks, just like any well prepared, crazy yummy, addictive sangria, this one is a creeper drink. Talk about the perfect libation to cool off that stifling Los Wages heat. Definitely enough to get that party started.. When it was all said and done we were so full we passed up dessert.One *very* minor knock though is the restaurant's casual ambiance. While I knew it was a fairly laid back spot with it's open air setting I expected at least a few secluded areas with more private dining where I didn't have to hear the adjacent table's conversation.. or visa versa. But so what, it may not be an incredibly romantic spot but the great food, white wine sangria and service left me wanting to come back for more, date in tow or not.Yes 5 stars!  Julian Serrano is worthy of all the stars , the moon and the sun too!  THIS IS WHERE I HAD THE  BEST CEVICHE I HAVE EVER HAD IN MY WHOLE LIFE!I'm so not a Las Vegas fan! (Yeah, I'm that boring!) If I want to "live it up" South Beach has  never dissapointed.  BUT, I love road trips! So much so that I would go anywhere even when I don't care for the destination. "Hey you wanna take a road trip to hell?" Me: " Oh! Hell yeah!...you are driving, right?" WHY I HATE VEGAS, WELL IF YOU CARE...THE CHEESY DAY CLUB SCENE:Don't get  me wrong, I love pool parties but the whole Vegas day club culture with cheesy Z list "celebrity" hosts from mind numbing reality shows-BARF! This scene can be entertaining for about 20 min ...well unless you are slizzered! The scene as in dudes with huge biceps,  meaningless "tribal tatoos"  and chicken legs walking around like they're about to fly! Oh! And their counterparts, Pamela Anderson wannabees looking like they came to audition for America's Next Top Pornstar.  Meanwhile, the evil twin in me is itching to stick a pin in those thingies, something about inflated balloons...NIGHT CLUBS:Even worse; populated with the same roid heads from the pool trying to be all "big pimpin"  because they just paid $500 for $20 bottle of Grey Goose Vodka for the privilege of being sorrounded by 20  "hot" girls.  And the sad thing is  that, these ladies  are not even interested in these "ballers". They would play the part for a free drink and a place to park their asses and rest their 6" heels wearing feet! As you know, In Vegas, no bottle service, no seating! So if you don't want to get bottle service yourself, you'd better  find someone who could...SENSORY OVERLOAD 1. 2000 ladies of all shapes and sizes(not a compliment) wearing the Vegas Saturday Night Uniform-the "Freak Em Dress"... with 6 inch heels! Yap! That super short, super tight dress that used to be a favourite of prostitutes all over the world but now... Hey!  I don't even know what  Vegas "working girls" wear to gain a competitive edge over that girl from Kansas who just want to  "let the freak out" for the weekend! That is some conundrum!  2. The Wayne Newton's face everywhere- taxis, buidings, mugs...DISTURBING!3. The annoying slots machine ringers that I keep hearing even in my sleep!  The fake foreign cities,  waterfalls and beaches...4.  Millions of Elvis impersonators...I mean seriously, who goes to Vegas to watch a fake Elvis?OTHER ANNOYING FACTORS:1) The fact that you have to walk many carpeted miles in your highest heels to get to the main door? 2)  LET ME NOT START WITH THE VEILED SLOBBERING DRUNK BACHELORETTES! WHY I GO TO VEGAS.Besides the road trip, I go to Vegas because of one thing and one thing only-THE RESTAURANTS!THE VEGAS DINING EXPERIENCE:I can comfortably say that  with all the fake glitz and cheesy glamour, Las Vegas  is home to the best restaurants in the country...well, in close third to NYC and San Francisco!  We turned up at Julian Serrano by chance after an award show at MGM. A night before, we had a late dinner at Comme Ca at the Cosmopolitan, so for the next dinner, we wanted to try out restaurants at Aria. We first headed down to Bar Masa because of its New York connection. We get to Bar Masa " Bla! Bla! Bla! You have no reservation, you'll have to wait for the late sitting" (an hour later).  Moi, I am in no shape to wait-I am hungry, cranky, I am in so much pain, my hooker heels are killing me from all that walking through the Casino to get to the MGM main entrance!So I  told the Maitre d' I can't wait but needed a recommendation. This guy  personally walked us to Juliano Serrano. And of course, I am not that excited to be at JS because I was looking forward to eat at Bar Masa-my mind was already made up! And I am also thinking, I have had the best tapas already, what can this chef do that is different form all other tapas restaurants? The restaurant when you look at it ,is so unassuming-bright color modern decor-nothing special.THE FOOD:We had:- Lobster Salad - Red Beet Salad -Ahi Tuna Tempura  -Avocado Cannelloni -Huevos Estrellado -Sautéed Padron Peppers -White Ceviche (EASILY THE BEST CEVICHE I HAVE EVER HAD!)-Steamed Mussels -Gambas a la Plancha -White Anchovy Fillets -Grilled Lamb Chop -Stuffed Dates Yeah and we definitely stuffed our faces too ;-). We paired the tapas with a great bottle of wine as recommended by the sommelier. I was so happy that I ended up here instead of Bar Masa; what a great surprise that was! I had no expectations coming in and ended up with the best tapas I ever had (as far as I can recall!)  I highly recommend Julian Serrano as the restaurant to dine at when you are in Las Vegas. I have dined at some of the "best restaurants in Las Vegas" but this one is high on that list!Compliments to Chef Serrano!BY http://www.girlstrippin.comFollow me: http://www.instagram.com/pendoloveamoreFan-frickin-tastic.I admit I went to this more than a year ago but our meal still stands out as one of our better Vegas dining experiences.The 'atmosphere' is a bit odd, just between the Cosmopolitan and Aria but the food and great service make up for any oddity.I know I should have taken notes because I can't remember what we had, but I doubt there's a 'miss' on the list, just go for it.From atmosphere to food to service- from drinks to tapas- Julian Serrano is a must when even close to the Aria Casino. If you are a fan of Spanish tapas, you will be as close to heaven as you will ever be. We are huge fans of tapas, the smaller portions and the many flavors that will explode on your taste buds. So many varieties and all of the tapas were beautifully presented on great, long rectangular plates that facilitated the three of us getting to all that was available. Favorites included the Spanish tortilla de patata, the octopus, the scallops, the ceviche was so delicious. We tried everything we thought we would like including the lamb, and then because we had a great rapport  with our waiter, we let him pick some of his favorites for us to try. We had reservations for 9pm and ate easily for at least 2 and a half hours, as a matter of fact, we actually closed the restaurant down and were never made to feel that we were a bother. It was a birthday celebration, and they brought the most beautiful plate complete with candle! (see pictures) Rarely will you find a restaurant that gets all of it right- but at Julian Serrano all of the stars aligned for us to give us a perfect meal.Swanky tapas, Vegas style!  Who doesn't like the sound of that?I certainly don't, so that's why I made a beeline to Julian Serrano for my first night's dinner on the Strip.First of all, Chef Julian Serrano's eponymous restaurant is absolutely beautiful.  It overflows with bold, colorful tile that's a feast for the eyes.  It's also *very* loud in there, since it's directly adjacent to the Aria resort lobby, a mere feet from hordes of tired hotel guests checking in and out.  And, no, there are no walls to keep out the hubbub.After taking a seat at the long, comfortably, and classy bar, I was quickly helped by one of the friendly and efficiently bartenders.  After ordering a glass of Sauvignon blanc to whet the palate, I browsed the mouthwatering -- and **long** -- menu of tapas options.  The menu is nicely organized into fish/ceviche, veggie, and meat/poultry tapas, making it easy to navigate.  There's also a catch-all "new style" tapas category, as well as paellas and "platos grandes" for those of you with larger appetites.Four items were just enough to fill the belly without making me uncomfortably full.  Here's the rundown of what I tried:1.  White ceviche.  Everyone knows I love a good ceviche, and this one was a knockout.  The white fish was tender and flaky, with just the right amount of heat and tang from the lime and cilantro.2.  Brava potatoes.  This dish was a little less exciting than I thought it would be -- it's essentially just fries with aioli.  That said, the flavors were excellent.  There's a *lot* of aioli provided, so I ended up taking the excess off to prevent the potatoes from getting soft.  I did enjoy eating the potatoes with the little skewers provided.3.  Tuna cones.  This dish was the weirdest and also my least favorite.  It consisted of 3 wantons (rolled into ice cream cones), which were filled with avocado, and then ahi tartare and aioli on top.  Again, my issue was the overabundance of aioli, which overwhelmed everything else.  I couldn't taste the tuna at all.4.  Santiago's cake.  This was an almond cake dusted with powdered sugar, with a side of almond ice cream.  Simple but very well done.  My only gripe was that the cake was a little dry, but this was remedied by letting the ice cream melt all over it.  All in all, Julian Serrano was a great dinner, although the little hiccups along the way make me hesitant about rushing back.  After all, you're paying Vegas Strip prices here (most tapas are in the $10-15 range, but some are more), so you tend to expect perfection for your buck.That said, with all the amazing options on Julian Serrano's menu, it'd be hard to resist the temptation to try them all.  =)*** REVIEW IS FOR LV RESTAURANT WEEK 2013 ***I have been meaning to visit Julian Serrano for awhile. After all, for all food connoisseurs in Las Vegas, surely Julian Serrano must be somewhere on their list. Tucked away inside the alluring Aria by the front desk, yet ever so far away from parking garage is this spot of expensive tapas paradise. To be of note - it IS a tapas place, hence why I haven't been on pins and needles trying to come here. Always in the back of my mind was the voice saying, "So expensive for just tapas! Just go to Firefly instead!"Luckily LVRW2013 has rolled around and I enjoyed a meal here with friends on a Tuesday night at 6:30 PM. Before being seated my friend and I ordered cocktails at the bar (all $14). I tried a fruity type drink that provided a nice start to my meal. Not too sweet, not too alcoholy, but still pretty steep in price. After drinks we were seated in the dining area further back, which is nice since it is over carpet, which brings the sound of the clacking of feet down to a minimum and it also hides your table from the casino. Chairs are plush and comfortable, lighting is perfect, and the ambiance is classy. Service was excellent. Our server was prompt, kept our drinks filled, and in general was a very courteous gentleman. I ordered a chardonnay from the Bordeaux region of France ($16). A lovely wine indeed and of the two options (another which was from California) I am glad I splurged. Worth every drop.  On to the food...Chicken Croquetas - Simple yet tasty is the best way to describe these. The dish is not the most pleasant to look at, but the taste was deliciously fried on the outside and creamy on the inside.Salmon (with mashed potatoes and baby carrots) - The main dish is what let me down and which brought down my rating. The salmon was cooked well enough, but the portion size was disappointing. My friend got the chicken and after seeing her dish I was wishing for chicken. Also, the horseradish cream served on the side of the salmon just did not go well with the fish, to me personally. I am wishing now someone else in my party had wanted to do the paella, but in order to have that option you must have more than one person ordering the dish. *womp womp*Molten Chocolate Cake and Blood Orange Ice Cream - I do love blood orange ice cream and sorbet and this one was refreshing to have with the very decadent and very good chocolate cake. If anything, this may have been my favorite part of the dining experience, coming in second to the glass of chardonnay.Overall - I realize I am reviewing the LVRW2013 menu, but even so, this food reflects the establishment. I think the big thing was how flat the salmon fell for me. After all, it was my main dish. While the other items were good I believe they should have been better considering the establishment. Would I be back? I would try happy hour. I would even go back for a birthday party I was invited to here... or some other special event. BUT, I do not believe I would come back for a full-out full-priced meal.During a recent stay at Aria, I did one thing that I NEVER thought I would do while staying at a hotel... I never left the property once during my 3 day stay. I don't know about you, but that is unheard of for me, especially in Vegas. I'm all about the hotel hopping and restaurant at this hotel and this other hotel. With that said, Julian Serrano was one of the reasons I never left the property. I simply did not need to. I came here for the lunch three-course menu, which I concluded was an AMAZING deal and steal. If you want to try this place out, but are wary about the heavy price tag, come for lunch. It was $19 for a three course meal. My three courses was the Wild Mushroom Soup, Rib Eye Steak w/ fries and the Santiago's Cake. I really enjoyed the rich and earthy soup and the rib eye was cooked very nicely and served with thinly cut and crispy fries. The cake was surprisingly delightful and I preferred it over the flan that they offer. Our waiter was very friendly and checked up on us several times. He also gave us some sangria mini samples and informed us of the happy hour they have daily 4-5:30 which includes sangria and app specials!Overall, a good bang for your buck, especially for being at Aria and I'll be sure to come back for their happy hour!As I was driving to Vegas for my vacation, I was contemplating on dining options and suddenly thought of Julian Serrano. Julian Serrano is a great alternative to the multi-course restaurants in Vegas, and here are the reasons that I may revisit the restaurant: 1) If you are looking for a good place to grab lunch and do not want to wait in line, this is the restaurant for you. 2) The waiter knows the menu well and points out food for our friends who have dietary restrictions. 3) The food is simple and arrives on your table quickly. However, I have decided to give the restaurant only three stars because of the following reasons:1) Although the restaurant is not full, it takes a long time before the host takes notice of us.2) The food is good but not great. Having had the tapas in Purple Pig and Girl and the Goat in Chicago, my friends and I are not impressed with the food at Julian Serrano. 3) The restaurant lacks vegetarian options. If you are a vegetarian, I would recommend you visiting Jean Philippe next doors.If you were me, would you visit Julian Serrano again?Tapas 101:A glass of wine, a plate of tapas.A glass of wine, a plate of tapas.A glass of wine, a plate of tapas.Repeat until full.Siesta.Don't  be intimidated by the almost 100 selection menu.  Don't order more than one plate at a time (this isn't dim sum).Do take your time.  Savor the flavor of simply prepared, quality ingredients.While the kitchen excels at traditional tapas, do not pass the  tuna-raspberry skewer.  A multi sensory dish opening with the aroma of sesame and essence of raspberry, textural contrast of the silky cube of ahi against the seeds, the contrasting temperature of ingredients.  It just works.To the traditional.  Top props to the monkfish and pisto.  Beautifully pan seared, moist monkfish paired with a mix of eggplant, zucchini and tomato.  Vinegar adds a good acidic zing that brightens the flavor of the fish.  Excellent mixed seafood ceviche with perfectly "cooked" shrimp, white fish and octopus bathed in lime and cilantro.  Other standouts, gambas a la plancha (prepared head on; oh the head fat..), tender octopus whose oceanic flavor is heightened by the earthy paprika, calamari a la plancha simply dressed in olive oil, and a very simple plate o anchovy fillets.  Not into seafood?  Excellent rabo de toro (braised oxtail), falling off the bone, served with Iberian pork atop a very creamy, mashed potato, an excellent Iberian pork shoulder with it's deep, porky flavor, and a sublime plate of imported pata negra (ham from the black footed pig).  The hazelnuts of the pig's diet is very prominent in the complex flavor of the ham.Many repeat visits.  Service is consistently excellent; friendly and accommodating.  Very good wine list with well focused selection by the glass that pair well with the dishes.  Vegas resport pricing.Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.....
Plaza Fiesta Carolinas=The old Cross Road (aka Carowinds) Mall. I think the only thing left from it's previous incarnation is the old Hamrick's (and that's a review all unto itself about how it reminds me of old, country, 80's, Sears stores). But, from what I understood, the Cross Roads mall suffered a slow and painful death and Plaza Fiesta came to try to revive it.I don't know if it did though. For the most part the place is pretty deserted outside the main playground/food court area. The layout is a simple grid of large vertical hallways and smaller horizontal ones. The large ones have names like Avenue of the American while the little ones each have the name of a Spanish-speaking country.They hallways have a variety of stores that range from ethnic eateries/pastries, shoe stores, hispanic/latin products, cell phones, sound equipment, Quinceañera dresses, knock off clothing, brand clothing, and others. The anchors, untraditionally, include Hamrick's, a Tae Kwon Do schoo, and a small Latin grocery store, a Van Heusen Outlet and a Cowboy Clothing store. One of the most unique stores though is definitely the Botanica, which specializes in Latin American folk medicine, religious candles and statuary, amulets, and other products culturally regarded as magical or lternative medicine. Strolling the hallways is a very interesting way to spend a Sunday afternoon once or twice... but after that, you've pretty much seen it all and the fascination wears off.The food court is really good. They have some pretty unique eateries here that you won't find in any other mall. They have a Mexican restaurant with pretty traditional Mexican food (not really dishes though, more like tacos, subs, sopes, etc), A Ceviche stand, a Greek restaurant and others.The food court also houses the biggest/tallest indoor playground in the Southeast. Our kids LOVE this thing. It's like a massive hamster maze with slides. If you have kids, try it out. It's a pretty cool concept. You buy your kids a bracelet and you throw them in the fenced-in, round-the-cloock guarded playground. The kids are not allowed out unless their bracelet matches yours. So, short of someone from the Colombian black market chopping your hand off, you're pretty safe to get your kids back... whether you want to or not. Their arcade is pretty awesome as well, a little pricey, but unlike most other places that still have arcade rooms, all the games work!!!They also have special rooms to hold parties. Becky and I have held two parties here, one for Girl 1 and one for Boy 3. We were fortunate enough to get great service from the girls who run the arcade/party room and the parties were a success at a very reasonable price.They used to have a Latin-themed music store... but that went out of business. Which sucks cuz they also carried some awesome books in Spanish that you can't really get anywhere in Charlotte.It does seem like the mall is flailing though. Stores seem to appear and disappear every time  you go and customers are scant at best. I do not know if this is going to last much longer but it seems the only business they get is on weekend. I could be wrong.I enjoy coming here and bringing the kids. Hopefully they'll be around for while.
Mimi's Cafe=2 stars, would have been 4 if the service was at least decent.  Hard to justify waiting 25 minutes before someone came and talk to us after we were seated.We came here after hiking Picacho so we were too tired to leave but this is shamefully bad.  Food quality was actually pretty good, better than the Chandler's Mimi, but after the drinks came and food order was taken, it was another 25 minutes before the food came.  Refills were slow, the lady who helped us tried to smile and apologize but she was certainly quick to drop the check off when we barely finish eating.  So25 mins wait for drinks order25 mins wait for food order30 mins to eatcheck was not late, came right as soon as she took the first few plates off.Oh and we did not go during rush hour, we were there at 2pm.  All in, we got out of this place at 10 till 4.  Not impressed and kind of shocked that a national chain could be so bad.  If anyone from Mimi Corporate is reading, just send someone over there and pretend to be a late lunch client on Saturday, guaranteed a very full report.
Croshaw's Gourmet Pies=In the immortal words of Homer Simpson, "Mmmmmmm pie......."I had read the Yelp reviews for Croshaw's and wanted to try them for some time now.  I was finally able to get there.  Upon walking in we were warmly greeting and looked over the pies in the cases.  Beautiful chocolate cream pie, lemon merangue, berry, and several others.  It was hard to decide.  What I loved the most was that they also had "mini" pies.  A pie for one or two is perfect if you don't have a large family or you're not taking a pie to a dinner or just don't need an entire large pie,  And mostly because if I bought a regular 9 inch pie, I'd eat the whole damn thing.  I really do have very little self control.  I settle on a mini german chocolate pie, a mini peach cobbler, and a chicken pot pie.  All of this for $12!!  WOW!  I took my delicious morsals home and popped the chicken pot pie in the oven.  About 20 minutes later it was done.  This beats any frozen Marie Callander's pot pie any day!  You can taste how fresh it is.  It tastes like mom made it and the crust is delicious!!  So then I tried some of the german chocolate pie.  Creamy chocolate with pecan bits and coconut topped with whipped cream.  YUM!!!!!  I'm in heaven!  And the peach cobbler......another slice of heaven! And in case you're wondering, I did not eat all three in the same night, thank you. I didn't say I had no self control at all.  It appears that I will be making frequent trips to Croshaw's.  And with the holidays coming I'll bet their pumpkin pie is amazing!  Thank you Croshaw's.  Now I'm obsessed with pie.  :)
Amore Patisserie=You have a sweet tooth? Come here.You want desserts to chase your drinks? come here.You want alcoholic smoothies? come here.You want something pretty to eat? come here.This place has it all. Small patisserie (pastry shop in French) but very eloquent with their desserts. They're pretty to look at and fun to eat! The staff are very friendly and they let you sample all flavors of gelato, cakes, drinks, etc. The decor of the artistic cakes and pastries may seem snooty at first but this place is anything but! Hubby and I came here for some treats after our dinner. We couldn't decide on the gelato, so we tried about 8 flavors before deciding on 2. The cosmopolitan gelato was delicious! Hubby ended up getting lemon and "Samantha's forbidden apple" for his gelato. I got the strawberry shortcake since it was dipped in grand marnier! WOW! We also got 2 small pineapple mojito alcoholic smoothie and strawberry lemonade vodka! The samples didn't taste so strong, but once we got them in our cups, we got to see how much alcohol was really in our smoothies, we got drunk off it!Hubby loved the cup and they let him keep it. Even when they were closing, they didn't throw us out, we got to take our time and finish. I plan to come back here every time I'm in Vegas now!
Red Kimchi Korean Restaurant=Boba!Yes, I said boba.  Boba as in "a name for the sweet, chewy, tapioca balls found at the bottom of the Taiwanese bubble tea/boba tea drink."There are few places that have boba in the Valley, and after seeing a sign out front of Red Kimchi on several occasions, I finally decided to go pay them a visit.I walked in at an odd time... around 5pm on a Tuesday.  I was heading to a meeting and not sure how long it would be, so I wanted a little something to hold me over until dinner.  The restaurant was empty except for all of their staff sitting at a table in the back eating.  I felt like I was interrupting but once I was in, I wasn't going to turn around and walk out.  I came in for boba and I was going to leave with boba!I felt kind of awkward as I just wanted a boba to-go, but they sat me at a table while I waited... I perused the menu of boba choices and narrowed it down to either green tea, mango, or strawberry boba.  I asked the guy for his input and he asked if I wanted it to be low cal or not.  When I said, yes, I'd prefer the low cal option, he convinced me to go with the green tea flavor.  Imagine my surprise when he brought me my drink five minutes later and it tasted like ice cream!  I really really doubt it was low cal, but I decided to "suck it up" quite literally... and it was delicious!I took a menu with me and since then, decided I need to return sometime soon to give their Korean food a shot.  Hopefully when I do, it will be a less-awkward experience.  If you're up for joining me for Korean sometime, let me know!  And regardless, go check out Red Kimchi's boba and yelp about it so I can see what you think!
The Bauer Kitchen=Connected to the Bauer Lofts and part of the Charcoal Group (that brought Waterloo Martini's, Wildcraft, del Dante, and the Charcoal Steakhouse), you get the dining-for-the-nouveau-waterloo that you'd expect. I don't mean it derisively; the atmosphere is modern and fresh, the menu albeit meat-heavy is interesting (complete with wine pairings), the service is mature, and the food doesn't disappoint. If you've been to Wildcraft, the vibe is the same. My wife and I dropped in on a Friday night. We didn't have a reservation, they were fully booked, but they were happy to seat us in the bar area with the rest of the ill-planned 30-something-professional couples. I had the sirloin burger (at the recommendation of the bartender) and it's probably one of the top 3 I've had in Waterloo. My wife had a halibut steak on top of mixed veggies -- it was presented well, and she enjoyed it. The beer selection was good -- they made the right trade off decisions. I actually had a laugh when I noticed 10 taps: 5 typical main-stream selects (I think canadian, blue, blue light coors), and 5 "micro brew" selections (tank house, creemore, waterloo dark, and a couple of others). In general, the BK is a safe date, work, or parent restaurant -- recommended above others in the same category in waterloo (sole, wildcraft, rude native).
The Sporting House Bar & Grill=After browsing the selection of draft Beer, I was pleasantly surprised to see some quality....I started out with a Dogfish Head IPA ($7) and ordered a 10" Pepperoni Sausage & Jalapeno Pizza ($11.95).  The Pizza came out and to my surprise was very good!  The crust was soft and doughy and tasted great....the Pepperoni and Sausage were good quality.  I normally like Jalapeno on my Pizza, but for some reason I didn't like it this evening and regretted ordering it as it took away from all of the goodness of the rest of the Pizza.  I ended up picking them off the slices.I watched the Lakers lose to the Bulls....that called for an Abita Purple Haze ($7), which I couldn't believe they carried!  It's brewed out of Louisiana and is hard to find in bars in Las Vegas....bonus!Later I tried a Duvel ($7), which is a Belgian Beer....very good too.  I'm amazed at the selection of Beer here.After a few hours of fun and games, we left.  Kiddo had a blast with his buddies and discovered a cool place I enjoy on the Strip!Will I return?  I'm trying to think of an excuse to go back....ha!
Papa John's Pizza=Saw a guy smoking in the car while delivering pizza in my neighborhood. Called and spoke to a manager, who says this is ok and that ALL delivery drivers are allowed to smoke. I respect the fact that people have the right to smoke, just not in a car while delivering food..GROSS!!
McDonalds=I've never tried a McRib Sandwich and I heard via the Talk Threads that McDonald's in Las Vegas started serving them the other day, so I took my Son here to give this legendary Sandwich a try.We ordered two McRib Meals (Sandwich, Fries, Soda) $4.19.  I also wanted to try the $1 Spicy McChicken Sandwich.The verdict......I didn't like the McRib at all...blech!  The Sauce was the best part about it. Other than that, it was pretty bland.  The Fries were good of course....and the Spicy McChicken Sandwich was decent, not bad for $1.Overall, it was a complete waste of calories.  I'm not dinging McDonald's for my stupid curiosity, so they get 3 Stars.  The McDonald's experience was A-OK. Did I find value in my meal?  Not today....my fault though.Will I return?  I'd come back again to order something I enjoy.
Wild Rosemary=I'm hesitant to review this because it's a small place and it's kind of a secret, tucked away on Bower Hill road between Scott, Upper St. Clair, and Bridgeville.  Alas, I'm a committed Yelper, and this place deserves every bit of 5 stars.The food is tremendous.  Wild Rosemary would be successful anywhere.  As Kerry D. mentions, get your reservations weeks ahead.  My mom has been trying to get us in while we are in town for a while now and it's always been booked.They do not serve alcohol, but it's a BYOB situation. I think they charged us like $10 corkage.  Totally worth it.  Stop by and pick up a great bottle of wine and prepare for a top-notch meal.  I'll attach photos of our plates.  You can see the care taken in every plate.  At the end of the evening the chef came out and was taking time at every table to introduce herself--a nice touch.The menu changes, but I think you can check online to see what's offered.PS: Rocket is a type of arugula salad.Cons:The food is very hit or miss. When you wait months for a reservation, the food better be delicious. It's expensive. Chicken prepared in a perfectly ordinary way with pantry staples should certainly not be over $30. Additionally, if you are paying that much for ingredients that are as a whole inexpensive, you'd expect to have a decent portion. Not quite. I had less than 5 bites of the protein I ordered in my meal. This happened each time. Finally, I ordered the pasta dish and that came in a more reasonable portion size. For reference, I'm not expecting gigantic portions or to even take leftovers home. I want to feel reasonably full at the end of my meal (especially when it includes appetizers, soup/salad, an entree, and dessert). Also, I'm not quite sure what it is, but I have been to WR 3-4 times. Each and every time I've had a major stomachache within a few hours after eating there. It could be the richness of the food, but I am not certain. I am not the only one to experience this though. Pros: Very small and secluded with a cozy ambience. There were very few tables and the service was excellent. The food did taste pretty good in general. Sometimes there were major let-downs in the preparation of the meat or the sides.  (There were times when it was inconsistent--see above)The pasta--it was wonderful. Amazing. Expensive, but really quite good. If you want good homemade pasta for a fraction of the price try La Tavola on Mt. Washington. Much better. BYOB would certainly be a solid pro.One of the things to love about WR is it is BYOB (more later on this).  Another is the food is usually great. However, it is noisy.  We were with friends that go to WR several times a year.  We started with the one appetizer that was some cheese and charcuterie.  Really enjoyable. The menu changes frequently, except for two items.  WR now has a winter/December menu that is interesting.   I had the Lamb Rack Lollies that were spiced and grilled perfectly and roasted beet carpaccio and sumac creme came with the Lamb.  The meat was prepared perfectly and tasted great. The beets and sumac creme were a nice compliment.  I did manage to get a bite of the Duroc Pork chop that was very good.  Again, a very well prepared meal.  Will WR is BYOB, we were charged $12 for the BYOB, I guess because we had two bottles at $6 per bottle.  That is to much, I understand you have to have glasses and clean the glasses but $12 is to much and not competitive.  Also, our server opened the wine but did not offer to pour the wine or have much contact with us.  Service was acceptable but not exceptional.  One thing that WR likes to do is make sure you get your meal and finish for the next seating, which I understand, but we felt rushed and were never told there was a time limit.  Actually, our friends said they tend to rush so lets not hurry and feel we have to order our main course immediately. Yes, I will go back but only with friends for a special occasion.  It is expensive and the food is good but noisy, noisy, noisy.
Lo-Lo's Chicken & Waffles=The beautiful Carin and I went to the Village this morning for our respective workouts...She hit the cardio machines hard and I played squash with my buddies.As I finished my last game with one of my buddies, Jim (who happens to be a cardiologist), he mentioned that I looked a little emaciated...peaked even, and prescribed chicken and waffles, "stat" (stat is a medical term that means "with extra butter, syrup and a side of grits":)Fortunately for me there is a new emergency location for Lolo's that has opened up altogether too close to my home:)Serendipity started to smile on me when we pulled up just as someone was leaving and we scored the parking spot right in front...serendipity continued as we put our name in for the 30 minute wait, only to be called after 15 minutes...and continued to weave it's way through the entire meal, as we got our drinks right away (really, is there much of anything better than a 1/2 gallon of sweet tea with your Saturday afternoon brunch?:), and we were waited on promptly and served right away.I was saved from wasting away:)I was particularly delighted for 2 reasons:     - This was only their second day open in Scottsdale and they were   absolutely slammed with both people eating at Lolo's and with take out orders, so it looked like the service was a little uneven...but the Lolo's staff were so darn nice to everyone, most of the customers seemed  to be pretty understanding:)     - This was Carin's first experience with Lolo's, and like all of her other "first times" with me, I wanted it to be both "special" and "delightful"...I am a loving, thoughtful and caring husband:)We couldn't have asked for it to go any better, especially for going by so soon after they opened:)The chicken and waffles are every bit as good as the original location down on Yuma:)...Carin has fallen in love with Lolo's, too:)The decor in the new place is pleasant...welcoming and comfortable...I love the wash tub lighting treatments:)And the staff continues to be pleasant (trending toward sweet as pie) to everyone...they could have been pretty tight-faced today, because they really did have a ton of people (all looking to get their chicken and waffle on) come by Lolo's today.I wasn't expecting to give these guys 5 stars right out of the gate, but doggone it, they earned it!Great food, great atmosphere, nice people and now, right in the hood:)I wonder if Jim is going to send me a bill for the medical advice? :-)I ride my bike to work.  Today I was running a little bit later than I usually do.  I had the slightest of hangovers, so getting out the door was a bit more delayed than is typical.I was riding my bike down Scottsdale Rd.  I've peaked in the window of Lo-Lo's before and I saw that it was under construction.  Today, I saw people standing around inside.  It was open.I decided, Fuck it.  I'm never late to work, so today I can be a few minutes behind schedule.  I still made it to work on time, but I set down a Styrofoam box next to my computer with chicken and waffles.The waffles have a taste of cinnamon to them and they're super buttery and delicious.  The chicken is not the best chicken I've ever had, but the best chicken I've ever had was so good that if I told you how good it was, you would simply assume that I was exaggerating.The chicken is damn good though.  The recipe that they use is very much complimented by using a splash of Louisiana hot sauce.  It was phenomenally bomb.I stared out the window, watching the clouds loom in the distance and raindrops spit down the glass... all the while chewing on a chicken bone and feeling my hangover dissolve into genuine comfort.In order to arrange a upcoming UYE "Butter Party " , Jim , Audrey, Donald , Amy B , Heather  and myself set up a little waffle exploration meeting.  For the good of the order we met up to partake in the phenomenon known as "waffles and chicken ". To be fully prepared for the UYE we ate to our hearts content . I have to be honest and not lie, that I fully loved every scrumptious morsel. From the yummy waffle, tasty chicken , to the  yummy cornbread  it was all good.. but the highlight of my eating was the macaroni and cheese ...creamy , sublime , rich , crusty in places, sharp cheese laced, man ,I really like that stuff. I didn't know if I should share the delicious treat with my family or squirrel it away in my purse to savor later.   Kids loved it , waffles and fried food goes over big in our family. The service was exceptionally good, courteous , well thought out , and  made the place. Decor is a bit of whimsy with homey flair . Bright and airy , fresh and  comfortable.  Love the big old mason jars for drinks , nice down home touch, folks .  We met the manager who was very nice and willing to make all of our UYE dreams come true. She also informed us that they will be opening soon for the late night crowd from 5pm-3am. Simply can't wait to go back.... Anybody busy tomorrow?************************WEAR BIG PANTS************************I had never had chicken and waffles together.  In fact, I don't think I've even had fried chicken outside of KFC and Hungry Man (I guess women don't get hungry?).  For a meal that did not involve a tortilla, I was pleasantly surprised.I went with the Betty Boop, a breast and a waffle.  The chicken was juicy and perfectly fried to a crisp golden brown.  The waffle was delicious, although maybe I wish it were just a little crispier on the outside.  But the cinnamony goodness was complimented by a nice baseball-sized scoop of butter and plenty of syrup.  Of course, I had to have the mac & cheese, too.  It was some of the best I've had in a restaurant (I'm a little partial to Kraft I'm afraid to admit).  We had a large group, and the staff was very accommodating and friendly.    But word of warning, they don't split checks for large groups and will only process two transactions per table (two credit cards or cash and one credit card).  Luckily I planned ahead and brought cash...and wore big pants.I went to the new LoLo's location with other fellow yelpers to check this place out.  I had been to the location downtown and wasnt all that impressed with what I had seen, so I thought I would give it another chance.  This one was a much better time.Upon entering, said parties were already seated.  I was happy to say that my experience here was much better then before.  This place is actually clean!  and has decent parking!  and, as a bonus, the service was substaintially better then the one downtown.  Same menu, same tasting food, but a better experience.When coming here, expect to wait.  This place is super popular, and tasty.  Be prepared to eat!!While I was waiting for my food at the counter, I had to try the last piece of red velvet cake that had been staring me down and calling my name. Verdict: the BEST Red Velvet cake I have ever tasted!!!But I digress, my first taste experience upon entering Lolo's this Sunday morning with my husband, was the refreshing homemade lemonade served in a large mason jar. It really is the best lemonade, better than any I have ever had the pleasure to drink, even my own homemade lemonade does not compare.  I quickly downed half a jar and then was promptly offered a refill. Customer service is alive and well at Lolo's. What brough us to Lolo's was the fried chicken, so needless to say we were filled with anticipation and can tell you that it is worth the trip. It is the best fried chicken west of the Mason/Dixon line! The mac and cheese was wonderful as were the sweet potatoes. Let's not forget the grits...yummy! The corn muffin was the "icing on the cake" (if you don't count the scrumptious red velvet cake icing!)We drove home and promptly devoured the red velvet cake and then took a nap. In short, a perfect way to spend a lazy Sunday. Starting September 11th they will serve dinner and be open until 3:00AMSave money!  Eat at Lolo's!  Go here for an early lunch and you are set for the day!  Perhaps a small snack 6-8 hours later but that's pretty much it!My second visit to Lolo's didn't quite measure up to the first visit...and still it was 4 stars.Great company with a group of Yelpers and my family too!Seriously, I was full 6 hours after eating here.I've never been to either Lolo's location until today.  I'm not a huge fried chicken person, particularly not for breakfast, but i ordered up a Betty Boop and buckled in for the full experience.  Bottom line: best fried chicken I've ever had.  The waffle was pretty great as well.  I sampled two sides - the fried okra didn't knock my socks off, and by the time i got around to trying the mac and cheese, i was too full to appreciate the creamy cheesiness.  it was really good, though.  The service was great, I was quite pleased on that front.  I was a tad worried that a great local place that knows that they've really made it would have a bit of an attitude, but i didn't get any of that from the people who served our table.  five stars on that front (other than the fact that the drink orders were served to the middle of the table - i don't consider that a deal-breaker).Speaking of drinks, I recall a recent "twitter" or status update in which someone noted that she was looking for a bathtub full of ice cold lemonade or something similar.  I'm fully prepared to go a few steps farther.  I would willingly give up seafood if all the world's oceans were made of Lolo's ice cold Arnold Palmer, in perfect proportion.  It's that good.  And it can't be much more sticky than the nasty saltwater those oceans have now, right?  plus that stuff tastes disgusting.anyway, i cannot tell you how excited i am for the night hours that begin next friday at this location only.  every friday night, this Lolo's will re-open at five and remain open until THREE the next morning.  I don't care if I have to walk from downtown phoenix (where i usually do most of my weekend drinking), the people-watching here is going to be epic.  (oh, wait, those are the people i came in with.  funny i don't recognize them in the light...)  i can't wait.I've been hesitant to review Lolo's. I know everyone creams their pants upon its mere mention, but I really don't. I don't like fried chicken at all, and I'm generally too hungover in the morning to eat anything besides a gallon of gatorade, so I was afraid my review might only be relevant to a specific audience. Namely: Me.But I wanted to review the Scottsdale location since I just went last weekend and have also been to the Phoenix location, so I figured the differences between the two might be worth pointing out. They both have good food, endearing servers, and awesome atmosphere. The differences are subtle, but noticeable. For instance, at the Phoenix location you get an ice cream scoop of warm, melty butter on your waffle. At the Scottsdale location you get a spoonful of cool, hard butter. I realize that waiting 5 minutes would solve this problem, but who has time to wait while there is a delicious breakfast pastry sitting right in front of your face?Basically, everything was just a little different. Though this may have been in part because Coda B. and I split a 3 piece and he stuck me with the thigh.  Bastard.  He liked the grits better here but again, I liked them better at the other location.  Main reason: Not enough butter. I am in a race against time and if you think I'm going to die as a 95 year old healthy person you have another think coming. All of my decisions shave years off of my life, and I wouldn't have it any other way.They did have an awesome little gospel band there because it was Sunday. So I left feeling that much closer to God. And not just because I felt like i might have a cholesterol induced heart attack at any moment. I would say if you're not generally a fried chicken fan, I don't think Lolo's will blow your mind. If you want an awesome breakfast experience go to the Lolo's in Phoenix. If they're too busy, come to this one.Same great Lolo's fried chicken and waffles without the risk of getting stabbed or shot... and it WAS worth the risk to visit their South Phoenix location on occasion. The food is that good, it might even be the ultimate in comfort food! Lucky for us they have a new Scottsdale location where the most dangerous situation you could encounter might be a hungover Scottsdale "clubber" (who could scratch you with their Ed Hardy bling).The only suggestion I have for them is to drop the prices about 25%They tried to make me go to rehab, I said Lo, Lo, Lo..So it's Friday night, it's getting late, and there's a rumble in your tummy, where to go? Before you'd might hit up some fast food joint and regret it in the morning. Say good bye to those greasy drive-thru burgers and say hello to some down home soul food lovin' at the new location of Lolo's Chicken and Waffles.Situated at the corner of Scottsdale and Thomas in what used to be a Kyoto Bowl, this is a welcome location to the neighborhood. It's the same delicious menu as the Yuma Street location and for me, just as tasty and deeply satisfying. Ordering the Lolo's Soul Food Platter ($13) is all about eating way too much way too late but with food this good I wouldn't order anything else. Your choice of fried chicken or fish plus 2 sides and cornbread, can be split between 2 healthy eaters and will be plenty to fill the tummy and the soul. The chosen 3 plump pieces of fried chicken, are so fantastically seasoned, and when smothered in gravy and onions is pretty much addictive pleasure. The sides are fantastically delicious, including the mac & cheese which is so rich and cheesy you'll probably order it every time. The collard greens are wonderfully tender and bursting with bitter sweet goodness. Dinner here just isn't complete without ordering you a hot buttery waffle ($4) to accompany your fried chicken. The tender sweetness of the waffle works really well with each savory bite of fried chicken, so much so that you might wake up early to come back for breakfast.Who knew how these 2 components, which sound like such strange bedfellows, would work so well together? It really is a beautiful thing.First off.. back home (Northern California) I have to go to either Oakland OR Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles in LA to get anything decent (I live in Santa Cruz... aka either a 5 hour drive or a 1 1/2 hour drive to get some southern goodness). This was on my list of places to go since our SBCer transplant got an ROTD at the other location.  Honestly, for me personally the chicken and waffles were average *ducks and covers*  The waffles had little flavor and the chicken was meh....I will stick with Roscoe's down in LA.The sides however were ridiculously bomb: The grits were cooked perfectly to our liking and were served with a big #$cking thing of butter.. amen...amen. The home potatoes were light, crispy and well seasoned. The collard greens were by far the best I have had in a minute..they were not too salty... not super soppy/mushy and came in the perfect sized bowl. Drinks came in a jam jar and once half consumed we were asked if wanted it either in a to go drink container (GENIUS!) or if we wanted more... I knew we had a drive with no real established potty so we declined.Clean establishment with an autograph wall in the back (very cool). Service was good.... no complaints.Okay... I love LoLo's. I think it IS better than Roscoe's. I live for their Red Velvet Cake. I DO love most of their food and usually the service is great... so why the two stars? Because I'm not a fan of THIS location. and here's why...- The crazy hours. I never know WHEN this place is open, sometimes the sun isn't even set and it's closed and other times I go by and late at night and they're open. It's very inconsistant and frustrating. - The loud azz sound system blaring in the background makes it hard for me to hear the person I'm dining with. So usually we just eat in silence while the music plays on.- The food simply isn't as good as the original location. Everything is a subpar immitation. The chicken is usually overcooked and the waffles lack that certain crunch or crispiness. - and my own personal reason - I had hit up Lolos on twitter and said they should have a separate to-go menu and I even said on twitter that we were dining at the counter and it was way facinating to watch the food come from the window. Which it was. I liked it, they were cranking it out and were having a good time when in comes this manager who started barking out orders and basically bullying the staff. I thought it was unfair. and then I got the bill... and was misbilled. I told the waitress who didn't do anything about it and ran my card. I asked her to fix it before running my card - she didn't. I didn't sign my ticket and asked the bully of a manager (who was bald with a tan shirt on June 10th) and then shrugged off my complaint and didn't change it. He didn't even look at it. I was astounded. I didn't know what to do - so I entered my tip and signed my ticket and vowed to never return to the Scottsdale location. oh and before we left, the Bully of a Manager asked me if I wanted a to-go menu, I said yes, thinking it was so serendipidous but when he handed me a regular menu with this shitty look and scarcastic tone he said that THIS WAS their to-go menu... and that's when I knew... he had read my tweets. I didn't mean any disrespect, honestly. It WOULD be awesome if they had a to-go or catering menu. There will be feedback from customers. And I don't care HOW good your food is, nothing warrents such rudeness to a PAYING customer. I think success had gone to the manager's head and they forgot how to keep it real - one of the drawbacks of being "Hood-rich" as the waitstaff's t-shirts declare. To my yelpers I say: Be careful of what you tweet. The manager at the Lolo's Scottsdale location is sensitive so perhaps you should just save your opinion for yelp. And as for the food... imagine you found Lolo's recipe book... and you tried to make yourself a little feast, you did everything EXACTLY as it says, but it misses something... some pizazz, some flavor, some... soul? You will have the Scottsdale location's food down! Stay away from the Scottsdale location. i will keep to the Downtown location where they keep it realI've been on a real bender lately...and this Fried Chicken was worth it!...I got the Betty Boop which is a huge fried chicken breast with a super fresh and tasty waffle...the chicken was juicy, moist and perfectly fried!  I smothered my waffle in the butter and syrup and need I say more...this was paradise!  I complimented my meal with a super sized mason jar of red koolaid and it was the perfect thing to wash this meal down with!  You have to get the Red Velvet cake it's a must have!!! This is a super fun place to go!Well where do I start.....I didn't know what to really expect when I came to this establishment....but it compared very favorable to the world famous Roscoe's Chicken & Waffles in Los Angeles. We waited about 15 minutes to be seated because this locale is always crowded and there is always a wait. When we got seated we were immediately approached by a server to take our drink orders. I had the homemade lemonade which they call "Dranks" at this location....LOL....I loved that. The jars are huge that the drinks come in and while the refills are free....I didn't even need one.I ordered a dish called the "Betty Boop" which is a juicy all white meat chicken breast....and perhaps the BEST WAFFLE I HAVE EVER HAD. Now there are a lot of great "Soul Food" items on the menu but the Fried Chicken and Waffles you must try without question. If it is not the BEST WAFFLE you have EVER put in your mouth please write me and let me know because I guarantee you will LOVE the waffles. The service was second to none....I mean every few minutes someone was checking on us....it was like having a maid....butler....and housekeeper while you just sat back and enjoyed your meal and the experience. One of the nice ladies there even lowered the blinds for us sitting in booths with our backs to the sunlight so we could cool off.....I mean wow....that was so nice of her. Now I don't about the location in Phoenix....but this one in Scottsdale is fantastic. The parking is a bear because it is located in a strip mall.....but all-in-all it is not to terrible. Like I said I am always skeptical about "Southern Food" that is not served in the south per say....but again this is MUST DO chicken....WAFFLES....and soul food dining at it's best. So if your ever near Old Town Scottsdale.....take a short drive over to N Scottsdale Rd and Thomas and pay a visit to LO-LO's. Remember while your there to Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!!make sure you enjoy your waffles and chicken onsite. it doesn't taste nearly as good heated up at home.weekends are busy so try to go during non-peak times in the evening.tourists: servers are sassy and the waffles are one of the top ten you'll ever taste!This review is PURELY based on service. I typically try not to do entirely service oriented reviews but this last visit was unacceptable. To preface this, I have always been a huge fan, I bring visiting family, force it on co-workers, etc. My earlier 5 star review was even featured here on Yelp. I have been there easily once every other month for the last 3 years. I even pick up the chicken for camping trips (cold Lolo's chicken and beer is heavenly). My wife and I were at the one in Scottsdale on Sunday (managed to get a babysitter so we could hit brunch there sans-kids). We arrived at 9:20am so I was fully expecting a LONG wait. We actually got seated right away and ordered coffee and water. The server came back with the water and told us the coffee was brewing and took our order. After about 15minutes a different server stopped by and said our food wouldn't be too much longer. This was OK since I knew they would be busy and it would take awhile, no problem. I did ask if we could get the coffee we ordered. He said the coffee machine was broken and they were trying to fix it. I mentioned it really sucked having it break in the middle of their breakfast rush. He said it had actually broken they day before and that lots of people wanted coffee (crazy right?). At this moment I thought, that's odd, I thought it was brewing... oh well....Well, not being one to complain, I worked in restaurants for years during college, but also not being one to enjoy waffles without coffee I opted to run across the parking lot and grab a couple coffees from Einstein bagels for the wife and I. I came back with the coffee and before I got to the door one of the servers popped out and said, "Sorry, no outside food or drink". He was very polite, but I said maybe this could be a special circumstance since their coffee machine had been broken since yesterday and we couldn't get any. He said no. I asked if we could just pour it into their mugs, he said no. I asked if we could switch to an outside table, he said no. I said I would like to speak to a manager and could he please go tell my wife to change our order to go since I couldn't go back inside. He went inside and came back and said the manager said no also. I was in shock. I could NOT believe this was their response. I went to the car to put the coffees down so I could text my wife and tell her to just leave the order and we would go somewhere else.  Unfortunately by that time she had paid and had the food. So, that's it Lolo's, I refuse to give you another dollar. That was unacceptable. And seriously? What kind of place doesn't have a backup plan for coffee on a Sunday morning? You couldn't send someone out to Target to pickup some cheap coffee makers for the morning? Or rent one from a catering company? Or worst case scenario just order a massive batch from Einsteins? Instead you opt to tell people they don't get coffee and won't and if they get their own somewhere else they have to leave?  FAILThis place was recommended by people at work so checked it out yesterday, and I was not disappointed. I started off with the richest, most moist Red Velvet cake I've ever had. Was so rich, that I only was able to eat 1/3rd of the slice. I went with the "Betty-Boop" plate which consisted of 1 breast and 1 waffle. Perfect portion. I'm no master chef, but I believe I tasted a bit of cinnamon or some kind of spice in the waffle- it was very delicious. The fried chicken was my favorite part if the meal. I took advantage of the Chile vinegar as well as the Louisiana hot sauce. I also love they serve Kool-aid here. The prices are decent- not too cheap, not too expensive.  Overall, I would love to come back and would recommend this place to anyone who likes some good fried chicken.Finally made it to a Lo-Lo's!  Met up with some folks for the Yelp Breakfast Club's first meeting.  I had the Stupid Fries which were very good.  I will have to go another time to try the chicken and waffles which were receiving high marks from everyone else at the table.  Service was good.  We got there early enough on a Sunday so we didn't have to wait for seating.  They only seat complete parties and don't split checks so bring cash for a group.  They do provide a receipt identified by seating position.Just as delicious as all the hype warrants, and impeccably clean. This is hangover food at its finest. Played hookey from work and came here with a rager of a headache, like a crippling debilitating hangover. Lo-Lo's put the kibosh on that noise real fast. The fried chicken is succulent and moist, the skin has the perfect texture of crunch and a savory spiced coating. Their signature homemade hot sauce is just the right accompaniment to the fried chicken and must needs be slathered all over the fried bird, leaving you, your table, and your face a hot mess. Again I have to reinforce how clean and tidy the place was, you'd think there would be grease and chicken bits all strewn about as hungry patrons devour their selections of fried chix but nuh-uh, spotless. Service was fast and friendly to boot. I have to mention that the waffles, while not anything especially great, were certainly not bad either, piping hot and fluffy, with a fat glob of butter and saccharinely sweet syrup they are what a decent waffle should be.I didnt get to try their famous red velvet cake, but hey, that's reason enough to come back for me.(Lyrics - Spice Girls - I Wannabe)LoLo!, I'll tell you what I want, what I really really wantLoLo tell me what you want, what you really really wantLoLo!, I'll tell you what I want, what I really really wantLoLo tell me what you want, what you really really wantI wanna, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna reallyReally, really want some Chicken & WafflesIf you want some cool-aid, get some on tapIf you wanna get some breakfast, better make it lastNow don't go wasting these pieces of chickenGet your appetite together, and we will be just fine.LoLo!, I'll tell you what I want, what I really really wantLoLo tell me what you want, what you really really wantLoLo!, I'll tell you what I want, what I really really wantLoLo tell me what you want, what you really really wantI wanna, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna reallyReally, really want some Chicken & WafflesLo-Lo's Chicken and Waffles has been around the Phoenix are for quite some times and has been a local favorite for many reasons.  Chicken and waffles? Yes, indeed it is a deadly combination!  If you ever need to carbo load I tell ya this is your place.  I generally can't eat a lot so I opt out on the sha-bang of 3 pieces of chicken, 2 waffles, grits, 2 eggs, and cheese.  Yeah tell me about it!  That's a lot of food!  Yummy though!  I go for the Shee-dah's Special; 1 breast, wing, and waffle.  Overall, I love it!  Nice succulent chicken and syrup induced waffles!  By god, what have you done to us!  I can't complain about obesity problems in America especially when you come to Lo-Lo's; instead embrace it haha!  I did indeed tried the Kool-Aid on tap.  Personally, I don't think I can handle so much sugar in a beverage!  Once you take a swig; you're thirsty for water!In the end, Lo-Lo's deliver what they say; Chicken & Waffles.  Service is real attentive and overall the food is a must try if you never had chicken & waffles! - Enjoy!Sorry but Lo-Lo's is highly overrated. I don't know where to even begin with Lo-Lo's... I guess I will start by saying I will never be back! The food is OVERRATED. Anyone who can actually cook will tell you that their fried chicken isn't even close to die for. It's just average fried chicken. Their collard greens are garbage as well. The greens from Honeybears aren't even that good but those definitely trump Lo-Lo's. The Mac and Cheese sucks! I know I am not the only one who thinks that too. Serving sizes are not generous at all. And the price is way too expensive. The service is about as average as it gets. Maybe this is due to the fact that the servers are always so busy but most act like the could give two shits about their tip. The WAIT is horrendous. It's always at minimum a 35 minute wait for my party. Not to mention if anyone shows up who is consider a "somebody" they will usher them past everyone right to their table.Anyways, I hate to hate but the main reason that this place is so successful is because the have entered into a niche market in the valley. It's not because of their food, service, or management. Pros-lots of seating-great drinksCons-Service-Food-Wait times-atmosphere-Too expensive-overall unfriendly staff"Everybody Want A Piece of My ChickenSouthern Fried ChickenFinger Lickin' "-- Ms Peachez These are the words that ring in my head every time I know I'm going to get some Fried Chicken & Waffles(C&W); for those who don't know what I'm talking about, do me a favor and search YouTube for: "Ms Peachez". Go ahead, I'll wait... Pretty funny, eh? Anyways, I'm always down to grub on some C&W and after seeing the solid reviews for Lo-Lo's Chicken & Waffles (LLCW) I knew I had to make a stop here on my tour de Arizona. Fortunately, their Scottsdale location is less than 1-mile from Scottsdale Stadium and I leapt at the opportunity.Sides:Cornbread- This is a pretty tasty Northen-style Cornbread and for only $1/each you can't beat that deal with a stick! One of my dining companions loved it so much he ordered one for the road! 4*Entrées:#8 DD: x2 Fried Chicken Breasts and Waffle- The chicken coating was crispy and tasty, but the chicken itself was a bit dried-out. The Waffle was nice and crisp but I would've preferred it to be thicker--however the taste was very good. Overall, not as good as Lillie Mae's back in San José but it hit the spot. 3*-Chicken/4*-WafflePuffs Chicken Tender Basket- I was a bit disappointed to see that LLCW doesn't have a children's menu; so, I had to order my 3-year-old an adult meal, which is OK -I suppose- who doesn't love leftovers? This came with 3 Chicken Tenders and Fries and he gobbled it up pretty well. 4*-Lance RatingDrinks- All you have to know is they have Kool-Aid, and they serve the Purple flavor (aka Ghetto Grape). 'Nuff said. 5*Service & Ambiance- Service from our waiter, Carl, was terrific! He was super-friendly, helpful and on top of things. LLCW is a really chill diner-style atmosphere that's kept clean and has some neat chicken paraphernalia decorating the place. 5*-Service/4*-AmbianceValue- Pretty decent value and a bit cheaper than Lillie Mae's; we paid a little under $15/head for a copious amount of food and drinks. 3*I really like LLCW and I'd probably rate it at a solid 3.5-stars, but the friendly service, great atmosphere, and fun menu will give it that 4-star bump. My only wish is they would get a children's menu and then they'd really have something. Irregardless, I'd still give it a hearty recommendation.
Fred's at Barneys New York=Yabba, Dabba, Doo! :-)http://tinyurl.com/45psjkThat's what I thought the first time we strolled into Fred's at Barney's in Scottsdale Fashion Square (BTW, anyone have any idea why they call it "Scottsdale Fashion Square"?...It's not a Square...it may or may not be Fashionable, too close to call...It is in Scottsdale...so, maybe 1  1/2 out of 3? :-)How wrong I was about the origin of the name, and how very happy I am to have found one of the best little restaurant and bar combo's in all of Scottsdale.The place is actually named for Barney's son, Fred (also apparently long departed, like Barney, for the great cocktail lounge in the sky:)But I'm still here and while I am, I will take every opportunity I get to soak up the cocktails, food, ambiance, service and convivial chatter at Fred's:)Fred's is as pleasant a place to dine as anyplace I've found in Scottsdale...the food and cocktails are excellent, the service is as good as anywhere in town, the room itself is both comfortable and sophisticated (overlooking scenic Scottsdale Rd....although the décor and scenery inside is also delightful...esp. at lunch during the week...if there is a larger gathering of attractive women in a single place at noon, I don't know where it would be:)... and the people...they are all first string...everyone at Fred's is a delight, from the hostesses and wait staff, to Richie the Barman (more about our pal, Richie later), and the managers of Fred's:)After working all morning and finally finishing things up for 2009, it was time for a cocktail:)The Beautiful Carin and I dropped by Fred's to ring in the New Year (at least it was midnight in Minsk, Prague and London while we were there:)That's right, we closed Fred's down, yesterday...at 5:00 pm:)We sat at the bar and had some delightful afternoon snacks and several cocktails as we chatted and laughed with Richie, the bar manager (and the Best Barman in Arizona:) and several other afternoon revelers (including the guys who put together all of Barney's "look and feel"...incredibly talented guys:)More about Richie...Richie is simply the best barman I've encountered here in Scottsdale...he's a certified genius at creating cocktails that are both imaginative and tasty...the 007 martini, the Pomegranate Lemon Drop (Richie's Special), his brand new Blueberry...10 oz's. of ice cold, alcoholic pleasure in a glass:)...and Richie is the kind of guy that makes me feel like I'm in Manhattan, sitting in the bar at the Waldorf, helping the barman solve the problems of the world...he can talk about anything and he's got that great NYC personality:-)Even more than the cocktails, the atmosphere is stylish and sophisticated...something that other bars and restaurants try for, but can't (quite frankly) match...again, Fred's feels more like Manhattan than Scottsdale...and that is the right atmosphere for this marvelous little spot:)David (the GM) has put together a very talented team of the best and brightest from a number of high end establishments in the Valley of the Sun and essentially given them free reign..."Here's the framework, create what you want and the customers will come".The result is an interesting menu and top notch execution (where even the Club Sandwich and Pomme Frites both have interesting and subtle notes), where everything is made with fresh local ingredients and obvious care and attention to detail:)No kidding, even the chicken wing appetizer is spectacular!...(you should see the "ladies who lunch" hoover those little bad boys down...delightful:-)Fred's just charms me:)So, I think I can be forgiven for my little bit of whimsy (you know, the Flintstones thing:) because Fred's (and Barney's, by extension) inspire a little bit of whimsy...especially after two or three of Richie's signature martinis:)Yabba, Dabba, Doo!!Scottsdale Fashion Square Shrimp Salad.  That's what I ordered both times I lunched at Fred's and both times I was extremely satisfied!  I was also impressed with the friendly and attentive service and the welcoming, fun atmosphere of the restaurant.I must admit, I was hesitant to eat at Fred's - I had an image of snooty staff and crazy expensive menu items.  But this image in my head was proved wrong when I went in for happy hour several months ago; i had a very pleasant experience.  And then with so many four and five star Yelp reviews, I just had to make my way back for lunch!Try their flavored iced tea - it's really refreshing and tasty... and the fresh bread they serve adds just the right carb deliciousness to the meal. I recommend dipping it in the olive oil on the table.I look forward to returning to Fred's for brunch and/or dinner. And while I overheard someone say that Fred's has the best Creme Brulee in the world, that Meyer Lemon Square sounds more up my alley!***Oh, and a pointer for those that don't want to be tempted to shop at Barney's if you decide to dine at Fred's.  Park out front on the Camelback side of the building and go straight to Fred's via the elevator outside. It's worked for me so far... it's a treat enough to dine at Fred's (as it will cost you a pretty penny).11/30/102.5 stars.Came for happy hour, but didn't find anything on the happy hour food menu I wanted to try, so I ordered a medium Emilia Romagna pizza (mozzarella, parmesan, and 12-year balsamic vinegar- Aceto Balsamico).  Can't recall what the price was on this pizza, but it was probably around the $14 range.  The pizza came a bit too charred on the bottom, and the very thin-crust didn't stay crispy for very long, perhaps just 5 minutes, and definitely soggy by the 10-minute mark.  While I enjoyed the slice I had at the restaurant, the leftovers proved to be too salty when I tried to re-heat the pizza at home, so I had to toss the rest- not economical for the price, I'm sorry to say.  I only ate a slice at Fred's, bec. I wanted to try the cobbler-of-the-day, which was the apple cobbler topped w/ Haagen-Daaz ice cream (if I recall correctly).  Had to order it sans powdered sugar (corn allergy), and I found it good, and not too sweet.  I'd try their other cobblers, too, if they didn't come at a high cost ($9, plus the ice cream has corn syrup in it- corn allergy).  I'd also like to try the profiteroles, but they, too, come w/ a $9 tag, which means $4.50 per profiterol- I believe I'd asked how many came in a dish and was quoted two...Don't be fooled by the scowl that the bouncer-type bartender constantly has on his face-- he actually was nice to talk to, at least the first time I spoke to him.  A couple of friends and I went there after a mixer about a month ago, and he was unapproachable, and projected himself to be too busy to do more than to come over and take our order.  No hellos and how-are-yous that night- such a big turn-off, and w/ a high-priced menu, I don't think I'll come by again.(I originally was going to rate 3 stars, but type it up as 2.5, but now that I've finished w/ my review, I'm going to go w/ 2 stars.  I wish you better experiences here yourself!)
D. Vino=So my closest 17 relatives and I were going to Vegas and I wanted to try to introduce them to some interesting food that they might not otherwise try. Talking to a group like that is like herding cats! MY GAHHHD!!! It was such a loooooong, painful process! I showed them pictures, menus, prices, and spent hours deciding what to eat for our 3 days in Vegas.While talking about our dining options, I often heard: "It's expensive!" "Buffet! Let's go to a buffet!" "That's such a small portion!" "Let's go to the Filipino restaurant!" "Umm...where else can we go?" GEEEEZZZZ. I wanted to end my misery so I gave up persuading them to eat somewhere else.PAN SEARED SCALLOPS - Yessss, oh yeeeees...These scallops were perfectly seared, fresh and tasty! The red wine sauce was so good that I actually ate all the brussels sprouts and parsnip pear pasta that came with it. The sauce had a tremendous flavor but it didn't cover up the scallopy flavor! Is "scallopy" a word? Well, it should be!Nothing else was as superb as the scallops, though.COMPLIMENTARY BREAD - They gave us so much! Unfortunately it wasn't fresh off the oven. I didn't even mind if it was recycled but at least heat it up! The olive oil/balsamic vinegar it came with was spicy and wasn't good. My family, on the other hand, must've liked it cuz they inhaled most of the bread and the olive oil, maybe because the entrees were taking too long.OSSO BUCCO - This was the special that night but it wasn't that special. The meat was fall-off-the-bone tender, it was alright but it was thirsty. I was not impressed with the risotto it came with either, it was a little tough. A little more water all around would be great!TIRAMISU - It was decent and that's all I can say about that.PANNA COTTA - Light, silky, creamy, yummy! But it was just like many a panna cotta I've had.SERVICE - Needs improvement! We were the only customers for a while and their service was so slow. Our entrees took about 45 minutes. It got even slower when more people came in. Our waitress was MIA for so long that we asked another waiter for the dessert menu. It took about 15 minutes for everyone to decide what to get and our waitress was still missing when we were ready to order. When we asked for our waitress the waiter replied, "She's busy." Uhh...how about us??? We didn't want to be late to the Cirque du Soleil show! So another waiter took our order. We finally saw our waitress again when she served our dessert.I was kind of disappointed that my family chose to eat here cuz there are so many other excellent restaurants in Las Vegas. It wasn't a total bummer because the scallops kicked serious ass, the panna cotta was good, and my family liked their dishes. So in the end I guess I didn't mind so much that we had dinner here, but I don't think I could be convinced to eat here again.The online menu on the Monte Carlo website they have is NOT current. So if you were hoping to have their seafood risotto or seared scallops appetizer like I was, well get ready to be disappointed. They have a winter menu now.My bf and I came here to celebrate his 25th birthday and mentioned that when we made our reservations but they didn't do anything to make us feel special. No dessert or anything whatsoever. The hostess did say 'happy birthday' as we were leaving.. I guess that's better than nothing at all. The service was extremely slow as we waited forever to get our checks, forever for them to pick up our payment, and then forever again to wait for them to return my credit card. I also asked our waiter what risotto they had for the night. He said he would ask the chef and never came back with the answer.Don't bother getting the trio of bruschettas. It was disgusting, especially the tomato one. It was mushy and the sauce they had underneath had a grainy texture. I took one bite and that was more than enough.The only positives I could think of was the sopressata pizza (4/5) we ordered and the chicken cannelloni (3.5/5). Our total came out to be around $51. There's no way I'm coming back. I just feel bad picking this restaurant to take my bf out on his big day...
Sweet Chill=Yes, the Aria in the new City Center is a very chic, very European, and very out-of-my-league-so-don't-bother-trying kind of place. So I would expect nothing but a tres-chic ice cream parlor in a hotel as fancy-schmancy as the Aria. With its perpetual video showing on the outside wall to draw you in, Sweet Chill is just that type of place in all its muted day-glo rainbow glory. Its clean, pinkish and slightly retro-look is meant to evoke an earlier time when people enjoyed sitting on plastic, butt-contoured chairs (see photos). It's as if Paris Hilton opened her own gelateria, bitches.They serve sandwiches and salads, but the eye candy is really the variety of ice cream flavors to be seen in their long glass display case. Prices are not surprisingly on the high side with a large cup a whopping seven bucks. Jamie W. and I shared a small cup of peanut butter gelato for the comparative bargain of $4.75 (see photo). I say bargain because you do get three small scoops which you can lick slowly to take in all the colors of the seats in the place. Eventually, the cacophony of pan-EuroAsian voices does make your ears bleed - and you have no choice but to leave and go back to your $80-a-night hotel way, way down the Strip.ICE CREAM - 4 stars...judging from the peanut butter, very creamy and tasty if a tad priceyAMBIANCE - 4 stars...chic while you lick with abandonSERVICE - 3.5 stars...a bit non-descript...it is a new placeTOTAL - 4 stars...stop for your sweet tooth and then do fifty laps in the Aria pool around the cornerCute, modern, pastel love-fest looking place.I requested a sample of the Carrot Cake, which was promptly handed over: white gelato, white spoon... and a black, curly hair.Truly, a Kodak moment.
Streets of New York=The post-hike dinner has been a personal tradition. After my hiking trail adventure ends, my dining adventure begins. Today, after hiking up in the Sawmill trails of the Spring Mountains National Recreation Area, I set out for the Streets of New York. It was a logical choice. I am a New York transplant that loves his pizza and subs.    It took work to find the Streets of New York on account of the fact that the streets of northwest Las Vegas are so confusing in the vicinity of the US 95 and the 215 exits. Streets of New York is located in a pedestrianised street that looks like Town Square. In similar style to Town Square, customers can park on the Main Street or in a parking lot at the back of the building.    Streets of New York is a casual sit down restaurant with extended booths and tables where televisions showing professional sports provide entertainment. When I walked into the restaurant, the host and waitress invited me to sit anywhere. I'd chose a long booth. After hiking, I appreciated the comfort of the plush booth.    Now for the menu. I was hoping that they offered my favorite sandwich, which is an eggplant parmesan on toasted bread that the pizzerias on my streets of New York offer without fail. But not these Streets of New York. The menu features New York pizza where their customers have a variety of choices and sizes in pies and slices, sandwiches including pastrami, and the meatball parmesan sub. What truly reached from the Streets of New York to the heart of my soul was their broaster chicken. This is where I was aware I was on the streets to a rewarding dining adventure.   It was only recently that Chilly Jilly'z at the other end of the continent Boulder City turned me into a fan of broaster chicken. When I set eyes on Streets of New Yorks special menu of broaster chicken, my mind was set on the two piece white meat broaster chicken meal. It included a chicken breast and wing, a 4 ounce side that I picked coleslaw and two potato wedges. It was also supposed to include bread that they never gave me. Oh well! The food was so filling and tasty that I had forgot all about the bread. The chicken breast was a large portion where the chicken wing was sufficient. The two potato wedges were large. Regardless that the potato wedges tasted fine they fell short of Chilly Jilly'z, that up to the time of this review is the best that I ever had. The cole slaw was a nice size portion and tasted average. All this food wasn't bad for $6.25 before tax. But, I have to have a fountain drink with my dinner. Especially a post-hike dinner. The Cokes, that didn't have a dint of flatness and that the waitress refilled in a timely manner brought the dinner up to nearly $10 before the tip.   After my leading dining adventure at Streets of New York, there is still more adventure that awaits. I truly want to try their New York pizza. Maybe this is first-rate New York pizza. My dilemma is that there are miles of streets if Las Vegas to reach Streets of New York. However, sometime in the future I leaning toward a dining adventure in their Spring Valley location to explore their New York pizza.
FnB=We had dinner plans with friends on the calendar for over a month... When we made the plans, we said we'd figure out the time and place as the date approached.  So when my friend suggested we go to FnB, I hesitated for a moment..."What is FnB," I asked? (Embarrassed that I had no clue)."It's the new restaurant located where Sea Saw and Digestif used to be," my friend informed me."OK - Perfect," I responded - still having no clue what to expect.Jared and I were fans of Digestif and ironically, we happened to be there on the last night they were open.  We went in for dinner on Sunday, October 18th (the day after our wedding) and were shocked to hear the news... But enough about that!In just six weeks time, this restaurant transformed into FnB, the creation of Pavle Milic and Chef Charleen Badman.  It now has a bit more space and a warmer, lighter feeling to it... the tile on the floor is really unique and colorful.  You can tell it's a family-run business too... we felt extremely welcome from the moment we set foot inside and we met the entire staff, Emily, Josh, Pavle, Chef Charleen, and Sous Chef Sasha.But enough about the atmosphere and the fantastic staff, I'm sure you want to know about the food!The menu is limited, but pretty much everything on it is appealing.  Luckily, our table was up for sharing.  We started with two orders of the crispy rock shrimp & jalapeno tartar and a fried green tomato salad.  Both were delicious... I especially enjoyed the combination of the fried green tomatoes with green goddess dressing and feta.  We continued with the citrus marinated olives as an appetizer to share... they aren't kidding with the "citrus" description - you can really taste it and I loved it!Jared and I shared the boneless trout entree and our companions shared the roast jidori chicken entree and we all shared an order of the spigarello.  What's spigarello? It's similar to broccoli rabe but not quite as bitter.  Chef Charleen prepares it with garlic and chili and it's delicious!  Needless to say, we cleaned all of our plates!As if that wasn't enough, we proceeded to order one of each of the dessert offerings: a lemon creme brulee, an apple crisp, and the cherry chocolate bread pudding that Angela mentioned in her review.  The lemon brulee and the bread pudding were the favorites at our table.  And from listening to Pavle talk about it, I think the chocolate bread pudding is his favorite too!Oh, and I forgot to mention that I was the only drinker in our group last night... I had a glass of sauvignon blanc - one from Chile - and it was perfect.The prices aren't bad considering everything used at this restaurant is bought fresh daily from local farms.  We'll be back to see our friends at FnB again soon... and I encourage you to go check out this little gem of a restaurant as well!  Just make sure to save us a seat at the bar.I haven't had a full dining experience here yet, but I wanted to relay last nights delightful visit to FnB.  I swung by last night for dessert with the girls and FnB was packed. I love the decor and the new floor is exquisite and I think they've made it look a much lovelier dining experience all around, especially considering the space constraints. We waited a few moments at the door while Pavle and Co found us seats at the bar. Though we were there for sweets, Dottsy couldn't resist getting an order of the rock shrimp with jalapeno tartar sauce and god bless her. It was delightful! MMMM, now I want more of it...anyway, we went ahead and ordered 1 of each of the desserts on the menu (only 3 last night we're not animals). I ordered the apple ginger thingie (can't think of the name, sorry), Dottsy had the chocolate cherry bread pudding and Chrissy had the lemon creme brulee. The creme brulee blew me away, it was so delicate and lightly infused with lemon essence it was like a pillow of sugar deliciousness. The chocolate-cherry dessert was a mouth full of yum as well, and my apple ginger dessert was tasty, thought I like a bit more ginger zing in general. Ohh they are so good. The rest of the dinner menu looks fantastic as well. I will be back to test the rest of it out soon!I have to go w/ five.  I can still remember every, even the most subtle flavor, starting with the bread and oil, the Ginhound cocktail, followed by the salad (we chose the salad Pavle talked up, and we were not disappointed).  As we munched on the salad, I commented to my dining partner that we were eating a lot of grapefruit - both the Ginhound and the shaved fennel salad featured the fruit, but neither were overly bitter at all.  It was the ideal way to start the meal.We elected to carry on with the Spigarello (delicious- excellent balance of garlic and a slightly buttery taste) again per Pavle's recommendation, along with an order of the mozzarella w/ an egg over braised leeks.  This was my favorite dish (well, tied with the salad and dessert...).  The mustard breadcrumbs added a little tangy flavor along with a fantastic texture.  Finally, we decided to split the bread pudding dessert.  Made w/ chocolate/cherry bread from the Phoenician's bakery (available at the Old Town Farmer's Market in Scottsdale), it was decadent.  All in all a fantastic meal - everything was perfect.  The atmosphere, the service...  It was fantastic.  You won't regret going there.I love the special feeling of being greeted by Pavle and the ceremony of him checking to see if there's a space for me. (Of course, I've been able to get a seat each time, so that makes it especially alright) I love sitting at the bar and watching chef work her magic. She's so focused. If it weren't for her assistance in refilling my water glass, I would question that she knew I was there. Being able to watch the kitchen is one of many highlights at FnB, for me. The food is hauntingly good. It's been almost a week since my two visits and I still think of the lemon creme brulee and the cool way they "brand" the top to caramelize it. I can taste the chocolate cherry bread pudding in a way that I can recall the feel of the dense, soft, mild, chocolaty goodness and sweet cherry on my palate. I crave the refreshing goodness and beauty of the shaved fennel salad with lovely rounds of watermelon radish. The braised leeks were hearty and delicious! I want to work my way through the entire menu. I have already begun to prioritize my list. My only worry is they will have an alluring special to distract me and, if that were to happen, I would not lose sleep over it!Dearest FnB,I realize we have just met and I am putting a lot of weight on our first evening together...but I love you.  I have been infatuated before and I know this is so much more than that.Last night, even as I sat staring into your local produce, the sweetness of your grilled butternut squash still upon my lips, this poem was forming in my mind.  I know it is not original but a take off from the great Elizabeth Barrett Browning of the Romantic Movement.  To me it feels right and fitting that a great sonnet taken from among the best the world has to offer is an appropriate way to enumerate your intoxicating virtues:FnB, how do I love thee? Let me count the ways.I love thee to the depth and breadth and height of your menuMy palate can reach, when tasting out of sightFor the local produce being prepared in grace.I love thee to the level of every day's mealOk, that's enough romance.  When can I get with you again, FnB?  I must have you from the top of your delicate appetizers all the way through to your sweet and tender desserts.  You plied me with your cranberry infused vodka and zest of lemon, your spiced roasted nuts bursting with flavor again and again.Your crispy rock shrimp, flash-fried to tender perfection in their light and revealing cornmeal covering are etched upon my mind.  And the jalapeno tartar...you can be a spicy vixen indeed!  Your lovely salad of apple, celery root, walnuts and blue cheese was sublime in it's awakening flavors brought on by the simple vinegary coating, awakening in me the abiding desire to plough through your menu and consume you to your core.Yes, from there it rolled inexorably on to grilled butternut squash with pear and bacon, each bright flavor building on the next.  The fried green tomatoes were a revelation to us both (yes you had us both, you saucy wench) with their tart and delicate interiors exploding through the complimenting dressing and feta cheese with which you plied them.Oh yes!  And your flatiron steak...I don't often play with the red meat team but your presentation, your flavor...purple and cheddar cauliflower, caper and golden raisin salsa verde...enough I say, you overwhelm me with your generosity, you just give and give until...And your desserts!  I tremble at the thought of your chocolate bread pudding, macerated cherries all over with nary a care of what others may think!  Outstanding!As if all of this were not enough your service throughout the meal was warm and comforting.  To a member, I felt your staff was there to please me and me alone.But, Fnb, as in all healthy relationships, open and honest communication is tantamount to a wonderful and enduring relationship.  With that understanding I have the following constructive criticism.  I had to look deep within to find even the hint of a fault...your fried green tomatoes.  When my mother used to make them they were sliced more thinly and fried in a skillet...this made them delightfully crunchy on the outside.Oh my God, have I compared you to my mother?!  Freud be damned! Just forget that, and forgive me FnB.  I'll be back soon.In heartfelt adoration,Jim WI can't believe I forgot to write a review for FnB, I feel like I've been singing their praises since I first stepped foot into that welcoming atmosphere! First let me begin with how much of a joy it is just to meet Pavle Millic; he is by far the friendliest and most doting personality I have ever encountered. The menu is an interesting read, nothing that I would ever consider creating myself, but it all sounds intriguing. My first visit to FnB was with a group of foodie/wino friends and many of them had visited before. I let them recommend their favorites and then went and ordered the only items they didn't have covered, so we could try just about everything on the menu. I am SO glad I did, as I would've missed out on the best trout I have ever had... scratch that, probably the best fish I have ever had as a whole. I cannot begin to describe the symphony of flavors that Charleen has created in this trout dish, just try it... whether you like trout or not, just try it. That's not to say I wasn't impressed with the braised leeks in mozzarella with mustard bread crumbs and a fried egg on top... delish. The crispy rock shrimp and salads are also terrific.FnB also has an all-Arizona wine list which is why I was eager to support this place, but it goes so far beyond the locavore/locapour effort. Overall, dining at FnB is a wonderful experience with a comfortable atmosphere, amazing aromas, top-notch staff, and incredible flavors. I've stopped in several times just for a drink or dessert and it feels like I'm walking in to visit family. Someday I'll make it in for the late night specials... they tempt me every time!1/30/10Came in for dinner.  My second time at this location (the first was when it was the newly-transferred Digestif during Yelp Eats Week).  What a great transformation from a dark, smoky venue to a warmer, much-more inviting space- thanks to those b/w and prismatic floor tiles!My EXCELLENT meal consisted of table bread and basil olive oil; the marvelous and perfectly cooked flat-iron steak, medium to medium-rare (cauliflower, golden raisin salsa verde); and the stupefyingly-addiciting puff pastry Chef Charleen created that night w/ AZ pecans, vanilla ice cream, and Wild Turkey caramel sauce (corn-free!!).  I had to muster up all of my willpower to sock-away half of the steak (the raisin salsa verde made this dish a winner!) for my Mom to try at home (she's hard-to-please, but LOVED the leftovers), so that I could demolish the pastry creation :)  [I just recently found out I'm allergic to pecans, but y'know, this dish is so good, I'd definitely keep it in mind on my next visit when considering my dessert options!]While still enjoying in the aftermath of such a wonderful meal, I was pleasantly surprised to find that my table ticket arrived w/ a small chunk of homemade toffee crunch.  However, this lovely-looking sweet contained an allergen or two, so Charleen switched it w/ a two-bite chocolate chocolate chip cookie.  What a sweet way to wish me good night!Yelp Eats/Restaurant Week, where are you??As we arrived at FnB we immediately felt right at home. There was a faint smell of toasted marshmallows in the air and the hustle and bustle of Chef Charlene Badman's small open kitchen felt like being at mom's. The warm glow of owner/manager Pavle Milic's face fortified the welcome feeling.Short for Food and Beverage, FnB seems to have everything aligned for culinary greatness. With food and service worthy of a long-established restaurant, you'd be surprised that FnB has been open only a few months.Located in Old Town Scottsdale, the space formerly housed the famed Sea Saw. The bar surrounds the small open kitchen, with views of Badman and Sous Chef Sacha Levine working their magic. Or, if romance is in the air, opt for a table for two. FnB is cozy and intimate.Farm fresh, seasonal and comforting describe Badman's creative and fun menu. Even something as simple as Citrus Marinated Olives ($4) just tastes better with a touch of orange peel.The menu is not large, with only a handful of nibbles, appetizers, sides and entrees. On one visit, our knowledgeable waiter didn't even bat an eye when we ordered just about everything on the menu.Lightly dusted in semolina flour then flash fried, each crustacean of the Crispy Rock Shrimp and Jalapeno Tartar ($9) has a nice feathery crunch. Fried Green Tomatoes with Green Goddess Dressing and Feta ($11) combines classic components, yet brings something new and balanced to the table.Braised Leeks, Mozzarella, Mustard Bread Crumbs and a Fried Egg ($13) are as simple as they sound, but tastier than you'd imagine. This is the beauty of Badman's cooking: farm-fresh produce prepared with love and attention.Since it is based on seasonal bounties, the menu is always changing, so don't be surprised when your favorite dish is no longer available. During several visits I had the opportunity to try something new each time.Try not to fall in love with the pasta offering -- on one visit the pasta was a Garganelli and other times it was Strozzapreti ($19). Both were perfect, cooked al dente and served with local veggies.Blue Nose Bass, Snap Peas, Hazelnuts and Citrus Sauce ($21) was fresh and light, yet meaty and satisfying.Roast Jidori Chicken ($20) sounds like a cooking preparation, so I was surprised that it's actually a breed of Japanese chicken. Smaller than your standard chicken, it's amazingly flavorful and juicy. As one of my dining mates put it, "It tastes how chicken used to taste." Each succulent bite reminded me of how simple ingredients in expert hands can be so fulfilling.Grilled Broccoli, Meyer Lemon Aioli and Crispy Onion ($6) is one of the sides. The smokiness of the slight char on the broccoli is alluring and adds an exotic dimension to something that would otherwise be ordinary.Badman's desserts are handled with as much love and care as the rest of our experience, which made them all the sweeter. Topped with whipped cream and finished with a grating of nutmeg, each joyous spoonful of the Butterscotch Pudding ($7) brought comfort and delight. Looking into the kitchen, I could see plumes of smoke in the air as a ramekin filled with Mint Chocolate Creme Brulee ($7) was getting seared with an iron.It all made sense as burning sugar filled the air, like roasting marshmallows at a campfire. It's one of those things you long to come back to -- home.I'm updating to five well-deserved stars. The jidori chicken is so good, it even has me eating meat off the bone (I'm a boneless girl... no wings or ribs for me under ordinary circumstances. But, for this chicken I am compelled to make an exception)!! The pasta is perfectly salted and cooked. Hearty, fresh and delicious. I'm certain you cannot have a bad meal here. One of my favorite Valley restaurants!!Hoooolllllly cripes on a popsicle stick.Ever eat a full-course meal and then want to start all over again because it was just that damned good? This place is a home run in every sense. Not just a regular home run, but one of the ones where the ball shatters the stadium lights and Robert Redford is running the bases with sparks falling everywhere. I honestly don't even remember every bit of what was consumed. It was a blur of pure delight. There were these delicious peppers in cream sauce and tomatoes with goat cheese for appetizers. Oh, man. I could've eaten those until the act was criminalized. At some point corn on the cob with parmesan appeared. Then entrees came. I had the halibut (yes, you can get insanely fresh seafood in Phoenix, it's a myth that you cannot). It was so perfect and firm and tasteful... others got the lamb and it was sinful. You have to literally find a wooden booth and go to confession after eating it. I'm available for light penance if you can't find willing clergy.Anyway, the desserts. I'm not a dessert-ordering person, but we got puddings and cakes and I wanted them all in my mouth immediately now. We polished everything off and I seriously wanted the menu back so I could start again. The drinks!  The drinks were off the hook. We tried ordering mint juleps but the bartender had other things in mind. He had invented a variation on the mint julep and would we care to try it? Of course we would. Oh, it was game on. So tasty.Also, the ambiance here is just killer. The kitchen is right there in the middle of everything... and it's the quietest, most efficient kitchen I've ever seen. Ever watch those reality shows where everyone is shouting in the kitchen? How long till the risotto is done and whatnot? I didn't hear a peep from those geniuses all night. They just toiled back there and pumped miracles all night. Also, most of the ingredients for everything made are local!Get thee to FnB.Happy birthday to me! Possibly the best dining experience I've ever had. My date had dined at FnB on more than one occasion and talked it up quite heavily. Between trusting his palate and the 5 star direction of Pavle Milic, I literally didn't have to make any decisions. None. Being the control freak that I normally am, I really enjoy when someone else takes over and just 'makes it happen' for me. It's sexy. This time was no different. I wouldn't have changed a thing.We started off with a couple of perfectly crafted mint juleps and tasty marinated olives. I don't venture into mint julep territory very often but I'm glad we did. Light, refreshing and the perfect beginning to what would end up being over 2 hours of gastronomic sensory overload. The menu is forever changing; one of the perks of using only seasonal/local ingredients.The Braised leeks, mozzarella and over-medium egg is a little slice of heaven on a plate. Throwing an egg on almost anything will make my eyes light up. It's like bacon in that way...a no brainer. As for the entree, I had the jidori chicken and spaetzle. Holy WOW! Had I not known that it was chicken I would have assumed it was some sort of exotic fowl that I shouldn't legally be eating or maybe even WANT to be eating except it's so damn tasty that I can't stop, so ya...This was a first time spaetzle experience for my half German ass (sooo pathedic, I know) and it was superb. I have no comparison... but I am a dumpling fearing texture-phobe and let me just say there's nothing to be afraid of here. Insanely good! I did only have one bite of my guys lamb dish, though it too was excellent.I have a true soft spot in my heart for local wine and I've never seen a list composed entirely of such. Kudos FnB! I don't remember what we chose (see what happens when someone else does all the driving) but it pared perfectly with our meals.One more thing.....don't ever let anyone tell you that lemon cake and butterscotch pudding don't go together. They do. Let them scoff. The only rule is that there aren't any.Even though it took us 2 hours to get seated (no fault of FnB, Joel L NEEDED to sit by the window!), I had an awesome time here last night.See, I get teased a lot for never leaving CenPho.  In fact, Lara asked me "Are you ever allowed to get out?" so I knew it was time to finally check this place out.I'd been in touch with Pavle for a couple days.  He's adorable!!  Had to meet him.They have late night eats, which is $10 plates after 10pm.  Score!!!  They had two choices last night: brisket and chilaquiles for the vegetarians.  Once we were seated, it only took about 10 minutes to get our food.  We were served a small veggie platter to tide us over.  There were these little garlic pickles that were to die for!  Kirti even asked for a little extra of these and they were devoured instantly.The place was PACKED.  They were out of the brisket, but seemed to come up with two servings for my dining companions. I had the chilaquiles.  Holy cripes!  They were delicious and came with an egg on top.  I loooooooooooooove eggs.  So much so that I want to marry an egg.  Not Humpty Dumpty, because I'm little, but maybe he has a little cousin or something.Anyway, the service was unbelievable.  They made me some lime drink concoction (non-alcoholic).  I had 3 of them!  Chunks of lime, lots of ice.  Sooooo delicious, especially for a warm summer night.Sitting by the window was the BEST.  Watching the drunk Scottsdale girls stumbling around Old Town made the wait worthwhile.  Watching them park?  Priceless.I ran into a lot of CenPho Escapees there, too.  What does this mean?  That it's ok to venture to Old Town, but *only* for FnB.Thank you so much, Pavle, for an amazing night.  And thanks to my friends, for making me feel guilt-free about leaving my 'hood.When I first heard about this place going in to this little space in  Scottsdale, I initially thought it was going to be an Italian restaurant...a cute little play on the Italian alphabet.F'n A, F'n B, F'n C...I know...not really Italian at all...more Brooklyn and Bronx.But it's not Italian at all...it's world food...world class, world of comfort, world food.After a number of meals at FnB over the past year, I'm trying to recall a dish that didn't knock my socks off...and I can't think of a single item!Last night was no exception!Chef Charleen was in the kitchen giving everything from roasted chickpeas and a little piece of cheese, to fried green tomatoes and braised leeks, her special touch...innovative, imaginative, interesting...but never at the expense of the food itself.She uses simple ingredients, her skill and imagination, and obvious love for the art of cooking, to make every dish special and astonishing.One of the things I love about going to FnB is just walking into the place...You can tell it's going to be a great meal just from the fabulous aromas coming from Chef Charleen's kitchen...plus, who doesn't like the Technicolor floor in this place!The Beautiful Carin and I have had a few things to celebrate lately and another terrific dinner at FnB seemed like a fitting way for us to enjoy a lovely Saturday evening together.In addition to sharing our braised leeks and fried tomatoes and what-have-you, we spent our dinner feeding each other Red Snapper (pan-fried with a dusting of cumin and couscous) and pasta with bacon and morels...satisfying and rewarding entrees, that delighted us both with the flavors and with the quality of the food and the preparation!A quick word about the service at FnB...and that word is "welcoming"...Pavle and his excellent staff encourage you to linger just a little bit longer...to enjoy your conversations and relax with your meal...to enjoy the ambiance and the fact that you are in another world for while.So we did...with coffee, cordials (Chartreuse will set you free) and some of the best little sweet treats you will ever eat...Butterscotch Pudding that is sublime in both its simplicity and subtlety and Chocolate Date Cake...nutty, chocolaty and cinnamon-y.People occasionally ask me to name my favorite restaurant...I know, that surprises me too!When they do ask, I'm generally hard pressed to pick out one particular restaurant from the five or six that I would consider the best places I've ever eaten...and FnB easily falls in that top five.But I will tell you that if I had to eat at only one restaurant for the rest of my life...I would do just fine at FnB!Go. To. FnB.I just recently had my anniversary dinner at FnB with my girlfriend and it was truly a phenomenal experience. Char, Pavle and Emily deserve every pleasant thing that I've heard about them, and they certainly deserve every single star in this review. I felt like a "guest" (I want to stress guest because I didn't just feel like a customer) the whole time I was in the restaurant. Oh, and I noticed the same treatment to the rest of the guests in the restaurant as well; Pavle knows what he's doing.Oh, yeah! Food! We tried a lot of different items on the menu by splitting everything, and I couldn't have been happier. We had the eggplant with pomegranate, za'atar and yogurt, a cauliflower dish that was substituted for the okra dish, the braised leeks and the pasta with creme fraiche, bacon and butternut. Every single dish  was very well crafted with multiple layers of flavor and texture, but they were very simple when it came to ingredients. I would really like to say that there was one thing that I would call favorite, but I can't. If the cauliflower stays on the Fall 2010 menu, it's worth a try. The eggplant was dreamy to me because I love za'atar. Za'atar is a simple Middle Eastern spice blend that adds a great flavor to most things it is put on, and it brought the eggplant dish together. The braised leeks? Well, I now understand why critics are crazy about them... Fantastic mozzarella, mustard bread crumbs and leeks covered with a gooey eggs? Count me in anytime. Lastly, the pasta. Bacon is really a wonderful thing to see when looking at the description of a pasta dish  that already had butternut and creme fraiche. It didn't disappoint; scrumptious until the last bite.Oh my... I've gone on and on. I couldn't help it though, FnB was and is a place with hype that does not falter when faced with customers ready to be blown away. It was worth every penny and I can't wait to head back down to Old Town the next time I want to have a great meal at a classy (and cozy) eatery.PS: My girlfriend and I also had the butterscotch pudding for dessert. Wow, just wow...Maybe my expectations are getting high...but why not?   We went to FnB last night and the menu lacked great choices.  The whole menu except for the last 4 items and one item on the top was all vegetarian.  We started with the cheese plate and it was a small slice of blue bree,nuts and burnt piece of nut bread that we witnessed being scraped off after it was burned and a blob of yucky apricot goo...wouldn't the dish washer tell them no one was eating it?Next we had a braised leeks with mozzarella with a fried egg on it...it would be fine as a side... but not an app?Next came the pasta...it was ok, not house made it had a heavy sauce and a lot of chewy mushrooms,squash cubes and wilted bacon...nothing special.Dessert was a steamed chocolate cake that was dry as a bone served with a table spoon size scoop of banana ice cream...the coffee was pretty good.The tap water was even bad so we ordered bottled...I fear that the owners are cutting corners and making things that are easy to make with the small quarters they have.  We have been many times before and the menu has been more inspired and so has the food.  I hope they are not getting burned out...Excellent dessert.  If you go here you must try the desert.  We shared the  butterscotch pudding which is the best pudding I  have ever had.  I was trying to steer clear of sweets, but with the recommendation of you must have this...I went for it.  I am glad I did since the desert at FnB can be put in my most memorable deserts of all time. Yes when I am dieting I can dream of FnB.  I also enjoyed the fingerling potatoes with the dirty chicken gravy and a super fresh sandwich.  I am not a fan of basic sandwiches, but with recommendation by FnB staff I went for it.  The mix of hummus, turkey, avocado, even feta cheese made a great dish.  I even liked the pickled corn and peppers.  Can't say I ever had pickled corn on the cob before, so it was another exciting moment for me:)What a great lunch, so great that I can't wait to come back and enjoy some dinner dishes.  You should try them out as well, what a great place.This is one of Scottsdale's treasures.  The concept is refreshing - they incorporate fresh local ingredients as best as they can. This means that there are seasonal changes to the menu but that only gives you a reason to go back.I like to order dishes when I go out that I've never had before.  You'll find a number of odd sounding dishes here but don't be afraid to be adventurous. Who knew that I'd like braised leeks with mozzarella and a fried egg? But I do.  I doubt that you'd be disappointed in any of the appetizers but in addition to the leeks, try the pork and duck pate.At one time or another I think I've tried all of the main courses - pick whatever tickles your fancy - I don't think you can go wrong.  Save room for dessert. A personal favorite is the butterscotch pudding.You'll also find an interesting wine list here - I believe they are all from Arizona wineries - Who knew?  They're surprisingly good.One tip - This is a popular place so you should make a reservation.* FARM TO TABLE GEM in Downtown Scottsdale!!! *friendly staff, nice atmosphere, flavorful plates.FnB stands for Food and Beverage.  farm to table restaurant with local ingredients.  i did not take a picture of our actual menu since i figured it would be online...oops.  menu changes with what's fresh and in season. (and i left my phone in the hotel room on the charger, so i didn't take photos either that night...shame on me.) beet salad - different colors of beets, mixed greens, wheat berry, lightly dressed in a viniagretteasparagus with polenta cakes - i love polenta cakes. these were triangular in shape.cauliflower dish - this one tasted like a healthy meatball marinara dish!! IT WAS THE MOST DELICIOUS CAULIFLOWER dish i've ever had.  cauliflower, marinara sauce, fennel sausage.  there was a bit of spiciness in it. Mmm...kudos to the chef!!  she's amazing.butterscotch pudding - good balance of salty sweet flavors. butterscotch pudding topped with whipped cream and nutmegchocolate whiskey cake with ice cream - should've stopped at one dessert but decided to indulge since we were on vacay. enjoyed everything else, so figured...why not? =)  moist, round chocolate cake drizzled with a whiskey chocolate syrup. a scoop of vanilla ice cream complimented it well (though i thought the vanilla ice cream they used was too sweet)they have a simple menu. there is one for lunch (no brunch), dinner, and late night. dinner is from 5-10pm. late night is after 10 (until midnight).  for the late night menu all wine is half off.EAT, DRINK, and BE MERRY!!!If you're coming here in a group, follow this advice:Order as many dishes your mouths can handle. I am stunned by how exquisite the dining culture is in Arizona. I can at times be a Bay Area food snob but this place really blew my mind away.As soon as my colleagues and I walked in, we were pleasantly surprised with an intimately set up table for three and was introduced to a knowledgeable professional server. I hate that I never got her name! Don't be afraid to ask what some of the funky sounding ingredients are; the waiter will guide you through the menu. My colleagues and I ended up choosing about 4 of the smaller appetizers- oh the wonton, yuzu salmon dish was heavenly. And please try out the eggplant dish too! This would be an ideal place if you:1) Care about what goes in your body; health conscious yet still a big foodie2) Love vegetables 3) And desserts (how can you not?)4) Prefer an Intimate, quiet ambiance 5) Look forward to Farm to Table, beautifully concocted and creative dishes As a side note:Our server had to move my group to a table a foot way because a group of 8 was congregating at 10pm. To thank us for our "move," our lovely server treated us with THREE DESSERTS. WHAT. I know...If it's your first time in Phoenix, please stop by this place. I promise you won't regret it!After having Sheepdogs and Moscow Mules with bites of nachos and chips with guacamole and salsa at the CMYE: Meet Your CM event, I was ready for some good eats!  Yuko H. had plans with Aileen B. for some dinner here at this adorable place and with a hungry appetite and booze to burn off, I tagged along with Linh L. and Brett B.!  What a night!  It was our own UYE/PYE inside the Charleen Room.Out of our intimate party of five, Aileen was the only one that had been here before and she told us all about the co-owners and their previous location.  It made for pleasant talk while we nibbled on warm bread with EVOO.  McCallister was our server for the night and he was great.  He was charming, knowledgeable, and I think he had a thing for Aileen AND Yuko!  ;)With a rotating menu, it's not very helpful to talk about my dish for the evening but hey, it's my review so why not?  I had ordered the Yellow tail for $30.  It had featured a beautifully seared and nicely seasoned yellow tail served on top of a generous bed of cous cous with avocados and hearts of palm and tomatillo sauce.  It was a beautiful medley of flavors and texture and with the help of some friends, I polished off my plate.  I also got to sneak some bites of the Summer Squash, Pork Tenderloin [chick peas, radishes, kidney beans, and other yummies in one bite... goodness!] and Socca with cultured butter.  The food was amazing and fresh and I like the farm-to-table theme this place has going on.  All in all, I had a wonderful dinner with some of the best Yelpers in Phoenix!  Thanks for the great night!
Five Guys Burgers and Fries=I've had Five Guys elsewhere, but maybe this one is different? Nope. It's a great burger that is well assembled and I love how the cheese gets all melty and messy in there with the loaded toppings.Your order will be prepared extremely quickly while you fill up your soda and then you can get down to the eatin' part. Fries are good, but not great.Five Guys is a huge step up from the fast food joints, but it's not the best burger around. If you're looking for something just a bit more upscale, try the BT's Burger Joint across Tryon in Rivergate.
Dandelion Food Cart=And so I finally bagged the elusive white whale of the vegetarian world in Madison. I had attempted to eat at Dandelion Food Cart on at least five or six separate occasions over the last year or two, but I was always either too late, or had come on a day that it's not open (it's only open Tuesday-Thursday, 11:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m.).The owner graciously prepared a potato-tofu wrap for me (vegan, of course, by my specification), even though he'd technically already closed for the day (as usual, I was barely late). He also gave me a peanut butter chocolate cup on the house.The wrap ($6.25) was excellent: super-fresh, filling and flavorful. It was full of tofu, spinach (or was it kale?), a creamy dressing, potatoes, black eyed beans and other vegetables. It also came with a side of tortilla chips. The wrap/burrito was spicy without being overpowering, and felt like comfort food. I can't wait to try another dish from Dandelion.The chocolate peanut butter cup was also amazing. It had a rich chocolate flavor and the peanut butter inside was some of the creamiest I've ever tasted.My only gripe is that this being a food cart, you're forced to eat outside (unless you have an office or apartment to go to, which I don't, as I'm always just passing through Madison). There's no shortage of benches and open space where you can sit and eat in downtown Madison, but be prepared to be bothered by a constant stream of buses and more than a few panhandlers.
Chili's=I will begin by saying, it is 2:37 and I am indefinitely stuck at work due to our bi-annual inventory.  Now this already makes me crabby, but as it got late the boss wants to buy everyone lunch.  Great!  Where?  I suggest Chinese...  Five minutes later he comes to me with a takeout menu for Chili's.  I guess I was vetoed by everyone else...  So I picked the spicy shrimp tacos.  It came with 2 sides, black beans and rice. The shrimp tacos were skimpy with the shrimp, and the spice level was more mild than spicy, but the shrimp was cooked ok and my stomach doesn't hurt, so they pass.  The beans and rice are another story.  Really bland, no flavor.  Oh well at least I didn't pay... Well back to work... this is the saddest part of my review...
Fran's Filling Station=Another YERRAA challenge, Fran's turned out to be pretty rad! They've recently remodeled the interior and while the decor is a little confusing (a mix of southwestern color and old timey chotchkeys) the space is pretty comfy, if very open. Tables are painted with varying themes, cute. Service was great, as we had several waiters checking in on us from time to time in addition to our main gal. You gotta love a staff that works together to make sure everyone's happy.The lunch menu was simple, and somewhat veg-friendly. The specialty sammiches looked awesome (Croque Monsieur, Thanksgiving Stack, other inventive plates), but there was no veg option. You do have the option of assembling your own - choose a bread, cheese, veggie, etc. Salads work the same way - a list of house special concoctions, or build your own. I opted for the soup and salad side of the day, both of which were good - french lentil salad with onions, maters, goat cheese garnish. Tomato bisque, while salty, was very flavorful. A little expensive at $5 for a mug of soup accompanied by captain's wafers, but the cheapness of the salad side offset that to end up at about $8 for my meal. Sammiches are in that same range, and come with chips or a choice from their tasty housemade salads and slaws.They have a wider range of veg options at night (including the ubiquitous veggie burger), according to our waitress. I'll make a point of coming back, as the flavors and attention to detail at Fran's imply that someone's really thinking about flavor. Lots of potential! Yay!I went to Fran's today after reading the reviews, I couldn't wait.   I was in the mood for some comfort food, I was going to over order, so I could have leftovers for my husband tonight. Yah!!  Couldn't wait.When I sat down and looked at the lunch menu, it was like, "rrrrrrrt", the needle going off the record, you know that noise.  There were no mashed potatoes.  No creamy cheese polenta and no crab cake with spicy remoulade.  WAHHHHHH.   There were only sandwiches and salads and one cup of soup.  Rat's ass.So I ordered the hot turkey sandwich with cheese, slaw, bacon and russian dressing.  Toasted bread does not a hot sandwich make. It was a beautiful sandwich don't get me wrong, piled high  and great quality turkey, but cold when you took a bite.  I don't want to be petty, but a hot sandwich shouldn't be cold in the middle. The sandwiches come with a side and I ordered slaw, it was shredded cabbage and carrots with a little mayo and salt.  It needed a little more love.  I did see some desserts go by and they looked AWESOME!  They did not look like processed sweets that restaurants try to pass off as homemade.Alright, I made my mind up, I will quit being a baby and quit whinning about cold turkey, but it feels so good to vent....Service was great and they wore cute t shirts.  Fran's is everything a local neighborhood restaurant should be, can't wait to go back for the evening menu.Fran, your food is filling. So filling. And sooo delicious. Hubs and I dropped by for a casual dinner and pretty much ordered way too much. Big shocker, I know, but really we couldn't help ourselves. The menu was filled with comfort food goodness. Inside, Fran's is really adorable. There are about 15 tables and a small bar right at the front. All the servers seem to work together to greet, seat and take care of their customers. I'm a big fan of teamwork. Once we settled in at the bar, we started with the Fried Pickles and were happy to see a huge portion - one side was spiced, while the other was plain. The flavor was right on and the breading was nice; my only suggestion would be to crisp them up a bit more. For my meal, I ordered the Latin Wedge Salad which is filled with yumness - corn, roasted red peppers, iceberg, creamy sherry vinaigrette, avocado, boatload of cheese and grape tomatoes. The salad was one of the best I've had in Charlotte; it was super flavorful and ginormous. And of course, I had to try the Mac 'n Cheese, just for research purposes. Holy yum. Again, a huge portion for $6. It's absolutely a meal and half on its own. Per Fran, who is just incredibly sweet and friendly, her 'mazing mac includes cheddar, American and pecorino cheese. The service in total was top notch - all the servers were knowledgeable, laid back and offered great suggestions for we first timers. Although, I was clearly super full, I ordered the Chocolate Cake, again, just to see how it was. (Yeah right) Now, I'm a huge chocolate fan, but not always a cake fan because of the potential dry factor. I am delighted to say that the chocolate cake was fantastic - moist cake, delectable frosting (not too thick) and a huge scoop of whipped cream AND ice cream. You can say I made room for dessert and planned a long run for the next morning. I left Fran's Filling station with a super full belly, a huge bag of leftovers and the notion that I certainly want to be a regular here!I ate lunch at Fran's last week for the first time and WOW! I'm going to be back again and again.  I like the eclectic menu, it's not the usual boring..... burger, some sort of chicken, some sort of fish, sandwich with some canned choices of a side dish. Oh No,  Fran's menu is pure innovation. My server was well versed with the specials of the day and gave great service.  I got the sense that they mix it up in there from day to day.  I had what they called a meatball slider and Madone was it good.  I had a side of Mac and Cheese (which I consider myself a M-&-C connoisseur)  Even the Mac and Cheese had a Fran twist that separates it from the pack using several shapes of pasta and a few different cheeses.  It was the best M-&-C I've ever had in Charlotte (including what used to be my favorites Lupie's and Mac's BBQ).I was also impressed with the presentation. My ten dollar lunch was presented and garnished with the care, pride and attention like that of a Saturday Night, Uptown $50 Entrée at the newest sheik place with a trendy one syllable name.   The tableware was really cool and retro styled (Melmac or Fiestaware like) very fitting of the charming-ness and uniqueness of Fran's.Fran came out, introduced herself, welcomed me, asked what I thought and even gave me a couple of cookies.  How great is that?In short, awesome menu, excellent service at a great value.  Should I become a serial killer (though not likely), get captured, found guilty and sentenced to the death penalty, I want my last meal to be Fran's Mac and Cheese.
Vaqueros Carne Asada=Vaqueros is ostensibly part of a chain, since I have seen them around other places. But make no mistake -- the people cooking here have a brand of their own that Casa Grande locals may recognize.Vaqueros is fairly new. When I pass it in the morning, there are always people in the drive-through. I finally got curious enough to stop by for dinner take-out. They are indeed open from 5 am to midnight most days, serving up breakfast burritos in the morning hours.It didn't take long looking at the menu to recognize that it is almost identical to the menu of a long-time hidden secret in Casa Grande that closed last year, Ruperto's. I had heard that the Ruperto's staff had opened or was opening a new restaurant, and this appears to be it. Many of the same dishes Ruperto's was known for appear on the menu at Vaqueros. The most distinct is the 3 rolled tacos with guacamole. The guacamole is unique and extremely good -- it is a favorite of my daughter's and she recognized it at once as being the same as Ruperto's. We also ordered carne asada tacos, and a burrito and enchilada combo -- all were great. The rice is awesome, but the refried beans could use a little work.All in all, a great and quick stop on Pinal, which has a dearth of good restaurants. Feed your family of 4 for under $20.
Buffalo Wild Wings=GOOD LUCK, AND GOOD NIGHT.I've been to a lot of BW3s before and sure it's an average chain restaurant, but wow does this location have some serious issues.  I hate writing bad reviews, I really try to only review places I like (which there are plenty of), but tonight on yelp I'm slamming down a second bad review and this place takes the cake.I've been here probably 4-5 times, and the last 2 visits were just ridiculous.  The first time was for my fantasy football league.  The service was atrociously slow, with us waiting 20 minutes inbetween every waitress visit and 45 minutes for our "wings", the wireless connection was dropping constantly throughout the draft, they sat us right next to another fantasy league and both leagues could barely hear what anyone was saying, and the food was . . . well typical BW3s food which is to say not that great but fills your stomach I guess.  At the end of the draft, all of us vowed never to have it there again.My last visit was probably one of the worst customer service experiences I've ever had aside from maybe someone "doing something" to the food.We had a pretty big group; about 15 people, and were all meeting up to watch some playoff football games.  Our group was coming in sporadically over the course of about an hour, but I'd say about half of us put our food order in around the same time.  The waitress was an older lady and I could already tell by how slow the drink refills were coming to not expect much.  Shoot ahead a little bit and we're waiting a LONG time for our food.  Normally, I wouldn't care at a place like this on a day like this because we're watching football and laughing and all that good stuff.  But this was crazytown long wait.  The two friends of mine who showed up last (about 30-40 minutes after us) got their food before the rest of our group!  So at that point we knew something was up, we talk to our waitress when she finally comes back 15 minutes later, and she goes back "to check".  Another 15 minutes go by.  She is walking around helping other customers, trays of food are going out to every table but ours, and finally she comes over when we flag her.  She tells us she made a mistake and didn't punch in our orders but she's now taken care of it and the food should be out soon.Another 30 minutes + go by.  I'm not joking.  She's come by maybe once to refill drinks and let us know casually that the food should be out soon.  Most of the time we see her walking around like we don't exist.  We flag her down and ask what's going on with the food.  She tells us she'll check.  15 minutes go by.  Finally, food comes out.  She doesn't know who's food goes where, and half the orders are missing.  We ordered stuff to go with our wings, it's not here.  She goes back and tells us it should be out soon.  20 minutes go by.  Finally, we get the rest.  Hell, it took us like 15 minutes to get DIPPING SAUCE that was supposed to come with our wings let alone the rest of the food.  Nary an apology or sign of sincerity.  I go over and talk to the manager and he immediately seems to be on the up-and-up about the situation.  He seems distraught and genuine, and says he'll take $50 off the food and hands me a stack of $5 off coupons.  We're watching the game waiting for our checks.  Another 30 minutes go by.  I'm not making this stuff up folks.  Bills finally come out, comps are on it, food is all with the wrong people, we send the waitress back to get it figured out after we all write down for her what we all had.  15 minutes later, we get new bills, it's *mostly fixed but there are now no $$ comps like the manager said.  So we all throw in 2 of our $5 coupons.  20-30 minutes later we're finally able to pay as most of us are yawning and wondering if we're going to have to pitch a tent.  I was on the verge of a dine and ditch; something I'd never consider.  On the way out a few of the girls go talk to the manager again, and then relate that he was upset when he saw that we used the coupons and explained that the bill was correct even though 15 people saw that it was clearly wrong with full prices and no comps.   It turns out it was the waitresses third day, half of me felt bad, the other half was still disappointed that she didn't handle the situation better.  She didn't even make an attempt to be apologetic or act like she cared.  I only gave them any stars because they have big tvs, beer, and space.  I'm being generous. We got there at 5:15pm.  We left at 9:30pm.  DO.  NOT.  GO. HERE.
Hula's Modern Tiki=I am so excited to have yet another awesome hot-spot added to the Phoenix restaurant scene.  I've been watching the renovations of this building for a while now and read the blog of all the fantastic things they have done inside the place, so I was waiting at the door 10 minutes before they opened.  Needless to say, I was pumped to finally eat here.We were welcomed in a little bit before open time by Dana, the owner, who is a really awesome guy and his enthusiasm and excitement is truly infectious.  You can tell that this is his baby and he is so proud.  We were given menus which are minimized for the time being, but there are still a ton of stellar selections on there.For a starter we chose the sweet potato fries and they were excellent.  They were not too sweet and had a fantastic texture.  Crispy on the outside and slightly soft on the inside made for a pretty addictive pre meal snack.  Next up was the ceviche, which was actually brought out complimentary by the chef.  I've never had ceviche before, but if this is what it all tastes like, I love it!  The fish was lovely and had a nice firm texture and the spices/peppers added a great bold flavor while the coconut milk mellowed it out a bit.  My dinner entree was the Cocojoe's Coconut Chicken Plate and it was delicious!  There were two huge, flattened pieces of chicken totally covered and crusted in coconut.  It was also slightly covered in a deliciously spicy and slightly sweet lilikoi sauce.  I loved it, but my husband loved it more, so I let him have it and I traded him.  Now I had the pork plate which was also delicious.  The pork was tender and the pineapple/soy bbq type sauce was addictive!  There were also chunks of pineapple which was a nice addition.  The coleslaw it came with was actually a great stand-alone side.  It had a tangy buttermilk base with just the right amount of pepper.  For dessert we got the key lime pie.  It was amazing.  It was so tangy, smooth, and creamy.  It was simply unbelievable, and unlike any key lime pie you have ever had.I adore this place.  I'm truly in love.  I will be back here many many times.  I cannot wait till the weather is perfect for relaxing on the patio and sitting around the really cool firepit.  Obviously, I was impressed with this place.  The architecture and reuse of the building is wonderful.  The laid back/island atmosphere of this restaurant is a true winner that will be bringing in the people for a very long time.Screw you, Hula's. As if Spouse and I aren't alcoholics enough, you have to go and open one of the funnest (that's right, I say funnest) restaurants in Central Phoenix, fill the menu with phenomenal island drinks, and plop the whole thing within stumbling distance of our home. Our livers are on you, buddy.It takes a lot to impress a professional boozer (that's a lie, but let's move on). That Mai Tai I had last night tasted better than the ones I had in Hawaii. And can I just say how refreshing it is to finally get some fruity options (because I am a huge fruit) rather than the same ol' margarita and martini variations served at every other restaurant in town. Not that I don't live for margaritas and martinis. Let's be honest, I'd drink mouthwash if the bartender poured it in a glass, mixed it with grenadine, and served it to me.Where was I?Oh, there's food too. Loved the sweet potato fries. Loved the Hula burger with sauteed onions. Loved, loved, loved Spouse's coconut chicken thingie. I am so ordering that next time because he refused to share. So stingy. BTW, I love that they have a Pupus menu (that's Hawaiian for appetizers) because I am a child (teehee, I said Pupus).Speaking of next time, we're going back this weekend. Bringing a bunch of friends to hang with on Hula's groovy new patio. And I'm ordering about 17 more Mai Tais. If Hula's could go ahead and place an AA phone number on the drink menu, I'd appreciate it.I'm going to be real here, I'm unimpressed by this place. First of all, it is not Hawaiian. Let's just get that out of the way now. Half of the menu consists of tacos! Wasabi is a common ingredient. The standard side dish is coleslaw, when everyone knows in Hawaii its macaroni salad. Let us all just agree to call this some a pan Polynesian/Pan Pacific/Southwestern /American fusion restaurant. Yeah, I find that confusing too. Our first trip to Hula's was unexpected. We were walking from our friend's home to Maizie's and decided we should just pop into Hula's on the way. If you are taking the LR I would suggest getting off at the Campbell stop, but I think its 6 of one, 1/2 dozen of the other between that and Camelback. If you are driving they have a huge parking lot. The initial visit was 4 days after they opened and we had some hits and misses with the food. I really enjoyed the fish ceviche, while my husband did not as he does not usually like fish ceviche. The shrimp rolls were a huge hit. I thought that the hapu was adequate, as was the mahi mahi. Our friend ordered a steak which was one of the grossest, grizzliest steaks I have ever seen. We left that night wanting to try it again, so we made reservations for a group of friends for my husband's birthday the following week. Upon our return we tried the tuna poke which was fantastic and the pulled pork sandwich which was poor, IMO. My kalua pork is a million times better. On the first visit we had tried the sweet potato fries and they were pretty lackluster so we tried the plantains the second time around. The fried plantains were some of the most disgusting things that I have been served at a restaurant in a long time. I was hoping for fried plantains in chip form but they were hunks of plantains. Plantains as a non fried fruit are not really all that great, there is a reason why they are always served cooked in some way. By not splitting them up into smaller pieces the starchy flavor is overpowering. As far as food is concerned I feel that you have to really try different things to find their strengths. As far as drinks are concerned, get the Absolut Boston with lemonade. Thank me later. I have a PhD in mai tais and I will tell you that these are just average. They are entirely too sweet and the dark rum was not floating on the top, but rather it was shaken with the light rum like you would shake a martini. That is not the proper way to make a mai tai. We ordered a few volcano bowls for my husband's birthday and while they were strong, they were also very sweet. Tropical drinks don't have to be sweet! I really want a Tropical Itch or a Lava Flow but to be honest I'm not sure they offer them. Service is hit or miss. On his birthday my husband was wearing a birthday hat and our server actually asked him- in what I believe was complete seriousness- if it was his birthday. What? Really? The indoor space is great, not such a fan of the lighting on the patio. I think I will probably be back for that adult Arnold Palmer and apps. At the time we were there they didn't have a happy hour, but they have added one now.I have to say that the staff did a wonderful job taking care of a table of 8.  I had wanted a reservation for 7pm, but was told I couldn't get it until 7:15.  No big deal.  Got there just a little after 7 and the table was already ready for us.Our server, Jennifer, was great.  I didn't have to ask for a refill for my iced tea more than once and that glass was kept full all night.I like that I wasn't familiar with everything on the menu.  Hula's is definitely a different cuisine than we have here in the PHX.  WTF is a Johnny cake???  Good thing someone in our party asked and ordered it.  I mean, who wants to go to dinner with people who have no food adventure???I had the shrimp and coconut egg rolls.  A little greasy, but still had tons of flavor.  I also got the fish cakes.  They had a good kick to them and I was full with just the two appetizers I ordered.We went for a friend's birthday, and I was told that they give the birthday person a little dessert with a candle in it.  Jennifer said "We do it for everyone."  I wasn't expecting to be charged for it, though.  Not that I'll be broke the rest of the week, but I guess I had figured it was complimentary.One bizarre thing happened, though.  The other large party sitting near us must have been a bit warm, because they asked their server to prop open the side door to get some air.  It felt good at first.  We noticed the door was propped open with a silverware setting.  You know, the napkin with the knife and fork inside it.  Stuck in the door.  I asked our server after a few moments to close it and guess what?  I called it.  She put the rolled silverware back on the empty table next to us.  It was a really nice night and the ambience was comfortable.  I'll be back again to try something new.  I'll just inspect my napkin first, for any door-grease marks.Aloha! Mele Kelikimaka! Don Ho! That's pretty much all the Hawaiian I know. I'm delighted a little bit of our island state has reached Central Phoenix. And I say little because, clearly, this is not authentic Hawaiian, nor are they trying to be. Let's start with the ugly. Cuz there's lots of good stuff to like about Hula's. Probably not the New York Steak Sandwich. Which I quickly renamed the Rhode Island Steak Sandwich. Cuz it was teeny tiny. And that's not so bad, except it was served on a large hamburger bun slathered in Hula sauce and a couple slabs of Monterey Jack and loads of Maui onions which were outstanding! It fell apart quicker than my Aunt Helen when I told her I was a mo. Wait? Have I used that line before? Anyway with the sandwich I had the cole slaw which had fresh ginger in it and I loved it! Rickie's Cajun burger and field green salad was delicious as was our friends Cobb Salad complete with diced fried Spam! And just like the islands' friendly culture, the staff here was spot on with service, smiles and suggestions. Prices on our food hovered around $10 a plate. Now. The space. LOVING IT! Think Brady Bunch decor meets Hawaiian lore. There's a large, kickass photo in the dining room with some 60s/70s hipsters sipping bubbly around a pool with a Camelback Mountain lookalike in the background. Sort of looked like a still from an episode of McMillian and Wife (ok, this is where I lose anyone born after 1975!). Much like St. Francis, I love the textures. From the tiny tile on the wall near the restrooms, to the horizontal wood paneling, the nifty lighting above the bar and of course, the dozens of tikis lining the room. Eventually the two glass garage doors were opened to a beautiful AZ breeze and we could almost feel the slight heat from the fire pit on the patio. Though I did get a bit of a stench from about a dozen gnarly, pimpled skateboarders on the sidewalk. This is a 3.5 review FYI Hula's. Welcome to the desert! Welcome to CenPho. And as they say in Hawaii...um...hmmm...well...I dunno....Aloha?! Yep. Aloha!At the end of an action-packed Saturday including a hair-raising drive and strenuous hike, it was time to simply sit back and R-E-L-A-X.My friend and I declared that Pain Killers on Hula's outdoor deck were just what the doctor ordered.  There is something very right about the combination of rum, coco lopez, pinapple and orange juice.  Since Hula's has all-day HH on Saturdays (ending at 7pm), these beauties will set you back only $5 each.  Bargain!  We kept telling ourselves "hey, we burned like 2,000 calories today.  We EARNED these!"  They came with a fruit garnish, so technically they were "health beverages", right?  :)Our very cool waiter took good care of us, and even shared a little background on his detailed tattoo work.  While I don't have any ink, I love hearing the back stories behind people's art - interesting!  As the sun made it's way down on this good day, the deck, the fire pit and of course the Pain Killer elixr made all those bumps, bruises and scrapes earned on the trail just seem to disappear... for a while, anyway...On balance I liked Hula Modern Tiki and would return.  That being said, my experience with Sunday brunch at Hula was rather hit or miss.I debated between 3 and 4 stars in large part based on the service.  For a moment I considered giving them the benefit of the doubt because they were pretty busy and giving them the fourth star.  But service should be just as good when the restaurant is busy right?Then came the goo.I had French Toast with thick sliced bacon and maple syrup (according to the menu).  The French toast was very good.  The bacon didn't arrive and I had to ask for it - when it arrived it was good, no big deal.  The big deal to me was that the menu said MAPLE SYRUP.  The French Toast did not come with MAPLE SYRUP.  It came with some gooey, thick, out of the bottle syrup.  I'm sorry but maple FLAVORED syrup is not MAPLE SYRUP or anything like it.  FAIL.  I would not have ordered the French Toast if I knew it was being served with corn syrup instead of MAPLE SYRUP.If you are not sure of the distinction here Hula, go somewhere that has crab on the menu.  Then, instead of succulent and tender crab have yourself some of that KRAB that is some unholy amalgam of whitefish, miscellaneous proteins and crab flavoring.MAPLE SYRUP is runny.  It comes from Maple trees, not corn fields.I have absolutely fallen head-over-heels in love with Hula's for so many reasons! Let's just go over a few:-The amazing tofu tacos-The "I'm-gonna-fuck-you-up" Scorpion Bowl (they light the 151 on fire!)-The kick ass happy hour-Outdoor seating with misters-Sweet potato friesThis is a really laid back environment with a lot of options for veggies AND vegans, and they have really awesome drinks. Do yourself the favor and head here with a group of friends and split the scorpion bowl. You can thank me later, just be prepared to call yourself a DD.After a couple of technical complications early in their operation, I've been back a few times and always come to the same conclusion: Go for the drinks, not the food. At first I thought, "Maybe I'm just in a bitchy mood and it's throwing my taste buds off." But I've gone with different people and been mostly in a chipper mood so that wasn't it. Then I thought I was ordering odd items off the menu, but I've tried a variety of items from the brunch and dinner menus and come to the same conclusion. Finally, I decided Hula's is an awesome place to get a great cocktail. It's just meh on the food side. Hula's definitely has one cool patio, amazing architectural features and mighty friendly staff. I just can negate the eating experiences to provide a better rating. It won't be my last time here, so I'm hoping I can update with a more sparkly review.I will apologize in advance to Amber W. who will undoubtedly light my house on fire after reading my dissatisfaction with her happy place, but Hula's really is a 2 1/2 star place to me. I've been several times at this point, and while I'll happily return when I'm in the mood for a fruity over-syruped *strong* cocktail, I will not however be spending my money to eat there again.The first time I went with a small group in the springtime and we sat out on the patio which was a blast. Great ambiance. And two over their 151 packed Scorpion Bowls later, I was sufficiently blacked out. Unfortunately the blackout did not happen soon enough to make me forget the flavorless and overcooked Ahi Wontons i ordered.Second time I went and ate was with Amber W. herself and I ordered the butterfish which was drenched in a terrible thing overbearing cream sauce. I asked for it pan-fried and apparently that is their definition of it- certainly not mine.All in all, Hula's is a fun place to go, hang out, and have a couple cocktails and enjoy the patio when it's not 400 degrees out, but if you're going there with the hopes of being wowed by exemplary seafood, you will be sorely disappointed.Hula's you've won me over.My second visit was brimming with warm friendly service, reasonable drinks and tasty food.The indoor/outdoor blended space here is awesome on a gorgeous Phoenix evening in February!Until next time Hula's!My how time flies.  I remember all the buzz when this building was being remodeled.  Now almost a year and a half after it opened, and a bunch of reviews, I finally had the opportunity to dine here.  I was amongst a Smunch group that met for brunch on a Saturday.  I love the space. A combination of indoor, outdoor and part of both.  The service for our party of about 20 was really great.  Our group consisted of folks from 1 to over 60 and all our needs were well attended to.Their brunch menu consists of items from their regular corporate menu and some special items designed locally.  I chose the Island Eggs Benedict and enjoyed it and the hash browns it came with.  I ordered the decaf and it is the first decaf I have had in a long time that tasted like a real cup of coffee!  At least at our table I heard no big complaints about the food.A couple of things that kept my rating at 3.5 instead of 4:  Parking sucks, this is more important to those like myself not used to uptown/downtown venues. One of my poached eggs was hard cooked in the middle.I would certainly not complain about going here again.My friends and I decided to celebrate my birthday at Hula's a few nights ago and we had a fantastic time. It was on a Wednesday night, so they happened to have an all night happy hour on that day. We surely lucked out, so we enjoyed  $5 appetizers and discounted beverages all night. I love the spicy edename, but I didn't really care for the black bean burger.My friends also ordered food which they deemed satisfactory.I can't decide if it's overpriced or not though. I could barely finish my burger and mash (that doesn't happen very often),but paying $7 to $8 for your signature drinks seems kinda steep. Happy Hour is definitely the time to come here in order to get the discounted price.  I do love the delightful modern kitschy decor and the friendly atmosphere.I'd definitely come back here again and give them another try. Perhaps meet up with friends on a weekend to enjoy a brunch.Truth be told, I was holding off on my review of Hula's because I just didn't share everyone's enthusiasm for the place. Without a doubt, the space is cool. The concept is original for Phoenix. But, I'm not big on super sweet drinks so their signature cocktails were not on my list of "big deal happy hour bargains" and the food wasn't anything I craved. Until now. They must be new, because they are not included on the menu posted on the website, but there are some rice bowl additions. I had the steak bowl. I'm telling you: the steak was pink and tender, the sauce was spicy and craveable, it was a generous portion size and, over all, that bowl alone will get me to be the first to say, "Hey! Let's go to Hula's!!"Definition of "a-Ok".Not a destination dining experience, that's for sure.I would say over-hyped, but over-hipped is more like it.I'm sure it's all so impressive to someone less jaded and cynical, but c'mon. This is really nothing more than someone collecting all of the 'exotic' dishes one at a time from generic american restos like applebees and chilis, and combining them onto one menu in one place.Omigosh! You put a ring of grilled pineapple and some terriyaki on my chicken sandwich?!?  OOOH, how pacific rim fusion.  Someone call Martin Denny.Spotless! Service. Dining room. Restrooms. Patio. Spotless!!Next time I shall forgo table seating and plop my butt on the floor to eat. Yep. That's how clean Hula's is!Service was polished and friendly. Dana was working the brunch crowd and attending to everyone's needs. Most importantly everyone enjoyed their brunch.I say Bula Bula to Hula's!!Oh Hula'sThe first time we came in a noticed the spicy shrimp caesar.  I thought mango in a caesar was a pretty odd choice.  I tried it thinking that the two really didn't go together but was pleasantly surprised!  The next trip I ordered the Jerk Pork.  Holy pig.  Seriously, this pork was melt in your mouth tender.  Chewing was hardly necessary.  The flavor was really really good.  All of the sides were delicious, the fried plantains were just right and the Jamaican johnny cakes were passed around our table for everyone to try.Out of all the guests we have taken with us no one has ever left disappointed.  We have yet to run into anything mediocre and always look forward to our next trip.I came here once for a work event and after a few hours my boss said he had to leave before I "drank everything on the menu." I always have fun when I come to Hula's and I love their cocktails. I last wound up here with Laura L.; Liz S.; Tom S.; J.D.L. and Kelly R. after doing Happy Hour at Fez and we had a great time drinking and having some food. We had two of the whopping huge drinks that come with four straws and flaming rum in the middle. My favorite drinks are the Dr. Funk and the Blood Orange Martini but they have some great beers and lots of other yummy cocktails on the menu.I also LOVE the Spicy Thai Fish Cakes...DELISH!!!!! Great Happy Hour specials and an awesome patio....once summer is over!We really enjoyed Hulas and its wonderful outdoor patio. I wish I could elaborate more, but I remember very little of that night!!I do remember it was great and that I really enjoyed the Mai Tai's!!! Service was quick and friendly!!  Lovely place!!We came here for an early Mothers Day lunch. For my girlfriend and her daughter.Nice place and parking is tight, but since it was Saturday afternoon,we found a spot.It is located right across the street from St. Francis Chruch so it is easy to find.Good Ice Tea & lots of lemon for starters. Drinks are pretty reasonable for sure.I ordered a Burger. It was OK ,good but the bun was just so so.Lighty toasted, nice cheese,3 choices on the cheese.It came with regular fries. WHen they came out they were all over cooked and had no flavor at all. I think the Oil was old.However, our server was nice enough to switch them out and give me Sweet potato fries instead. Which were entirerly different and so much better.The girls each got Ahi Eggs Bennie.Of course I had a taste or 2 and they were really good.Love the way it is decorated in here. Very Mad Man,50's 60's.A very clean place and the Rest Rooms are as well.Cannot believe this is my first time here. I liked it and will be back.I have driven past Hula's so many times and thought someday I will have to stop by, well thanks to another fellow yelper who set up an Happy Hour UYE, my someday showed up so off to Hula's I went!What a great lil place, love the feel of it, makes you feel like you stepped out of Phoenix and are now at some island bar, I loved that they even had Elvis Presley's Blue Hawaii playing up on the wall.They have some pretty awesome happy hour deals, and on Wed happy hour is all night long. I ordered the Pink Bikini Martini which was pineapple infused vodka, sweet & sour & watermelon liqueur, garnished with a pineapple & cheery, this was a sweet lil drink, so very good! I also tried the Mai Tai, which was pretty good too, but I think the Pink Bikini is my favorite drink their so far! Also tried the coconut shrimp rolls, and I normally am not one to would pick a shrimp dish, but it said it came with a pineapple horseradish dipping sauce, I love pineapple, I love horseradish, so I had to try it!! They were very tasty and packed with shrimp, there was no shrimp shortage in those, and coconut gave it the perfect crunchiness! Very yummy for sure! Glad I have finally tried Hulas out and look forward to going back!This place just never fails to delight!  I have been here a few times now and it is always exceptional. Today was another wonderful experience.Meet a friend here for lunch I got the fish tacos.only I got one fish and one tofu.You can mix and match. It was with a very unique rice and bean dish. My friend got the Tofu Curry salad. I tasted a little of hers and it was also fantastic. Our waiter was so nice, he even gave me a sample of the Lobster bisque. Although I did not order it, it also was good.The water is filtered ,it does not taste like poison so that was really nice as well. I had hot tea (they have an assortment). He refilled it continuously.  One thing we noticed while we were sitting in the bar area was how clean the place was . I mean sparkling clean.  I know that may sound strange but, I was right by a corner and I noticed how it sparkled. The more I come here the more I like it. The bathroom is spotless and beautifully decorated. The place is so retro ,plus they play the best music on the P.A.Parking was good today, not so packed. But ,sometimes it can be hard to find a spot.Hula's has captured perfectly that hip, urban, midtown Phoenix atmosphere. You'll always find a crowd, their fire pit is pretty interesting, the indoor and outdoor spaces are cool, and they've got posters of old surf movies on the wall in the bathrooms. I was once inspired to try and find one of them, but wasn't able to on Netflix or Amazon. Maybe I just wasn't really that dedicated to the task at hand though.I've been to Hula's a number of times now and only about half of my visits I was ordering food. Not to say their food isn't appetizing, just that Hulas works well as both bar AND grill, and I'm not always out during lunch or dinner. While a bit on the upper end of my dining out price range, every time I've ordered food, it was either good or delicious, but when ordering a drink, I usually stick with a vodka & soda, their other drinks just aren't for me.Their signature cocktails are generally made with either rum, tequila, or vodka, or some mixture of two or three of them, but I've found that a lot of them are to sweet for my tastes. I'm not a real fan of super sweet drinks, and they can reach levels of excessive in my opinion. My favorite food item on their menu are the pork taco's and you can order one taco during happy hour for about $3. HH is Monday - Friday until about 6pm. I've also had their sweet potato fries, tofu taco, edamame, a Hula Burger, and their mac-n-cheese. All were tasty, and worth coming back for, but I imagine I'll try something different next time, like their habanero chicken tacos or their house made black bean burger.Overall Hula's is a fun spot to meet with friends, but I wouldn't go here for more than one or two cocktails unless you're looking to leave with a sugar high.Happy Yelping Phoenix!Being familiar with the 90's tiki bar trend of tired, low-grade pseudo-Polynesian food, coupled with overpowered rum drinks, I approached the family's suggestion to try Hula's with some hesitation.  Much to my surprise, Hula's is quite different than the prior-century icon.In a warm and inviting Old Town storefront, Hula's dim lighting, ample space and large central bar immediately brought to mind a comfortable dining and drinking environment.  Jazmine, our waitress, was patient, quite informative and quick to deliver our order.We ordered a shared portion of the whitefish cerviche appetizer, and it was good.  The marinating of the fish in lime juice appeared to have been rushed, as neither fully tenderized fish nor a fully developed flavor profile were the result.  Next, we each ordered entrees and generously sampled from each plate.The macadamia-crusted ahi, served medium rare, was very good.  A large cut of quality ahi in a nicely seasoned crust preserved the subtle balance of flavors between the two.  The luau-style pulled pork was tasty, if a bit sweet for my tastes.  Laced with a small dice of pineapple and pineapple juice, it remained satisfying none the less.  A scoop of jasmine rice helped to balance the flavors.  The star of the evening, however, was our older son's jerk pork.  Shredded, with a pleasant heat and light curry flavor, the dish was identifiable from its Caribbean origins, yet uniquely Hawaiian.Portions are very large, and quite fortunately, the food was delicious enough to make this "a good thing."Hula's Modern Tiki is a clever concept which, as the crowded dining room will attest, serves very good food.  Dinner for the four of us, pre-tip, was $75.50, making Hula's an outstanding value as well.
Wendy's Noodle Cafe=I didn't feel like cooking yesterday, but then again I haven't been feeling like cooking for a few days now.  Instead, I decided we ate Chinese food since that's really what would be open during this day here in Vegas.  First I drove to China Ginger  but decided to go a different route after reading some of the reviews.I found Wendy's Noodle Cafe through Yelp, thanks!  The lady that greeted me was really nice and friendly and seemed to go above and beyond her duties.  She was helpful and patient with me as I looked at their menu trying to find something good to order.  Finally, I ordered French Style Beef Cubes with Black Pepper Sauce & Rice $7.95, Chinese Broccoli with Oyster Sauce $5.50, and Walnut Shrimp $12.95.  After I made my order, the host served me some green tea as I was waiting for my food.  I was pleasantly surprised.  It didn't take too long before my food was ready which then I rushed home so my bf and I could eat.  The food was awesome.  Everything was as Yelp members said it would be and I would go back over and over again to try all the other food.  The meat and shrimp were tender and seasoned perfectly.  The Chinese broccoli had just enough and right amount of oyster sauce, and the rice was cooked perfectly.  Hands down, I'm coming back.  One of my bf's friend's talked about Chinese porridge and they do have it in their menu.  This will be my next item to choose when I come back here.Meeting a friend who was visiting from out of town, our party of 5 (plus infant) decided to meet at Ramen Sora for dinner. We got there, but they were packed to the gills, so we decided to head to Wendy's Noodle House instead, since our friend had a plane to catch and didn't want to waste our time waiting for a table. I remember coming here years ago when they first opened. I enjoyed my meal here that time, but haven't been back since. We were seated quickly and the service was pretty hospitable. They came to take our orders pretty quickly despite sending them away several times because we were chatting so much we were too distracted to actually pick something to eat from the littany of menu options. Our table started with some xiao long bao and steak baos for appetizers. I didn't get a chance to try either of these, but my friends raved about them. I ordered a Thai tea with boba and the noodles in xo sauce. The food came out quickly and and everyone in our party thoroughly enjoyed their meals. My noodles were nice and spicy and had a great texture. There wasn't one thing we ordered that we didn't enjoy. There are many things to love about this place. The prices were beyond reasonable, their menu selection is extensive and everything we ordered was tasty. I'm looking forward to coming back and trying some of the noodle soups and desserts on the menu. Great little spot I'm glad I rediscovered.Eating out is awesome.  Eating out at Wendy's Noodle Cafe is awesomer. 3 pieces of their Rib Eye Bao Burger, 5 pieces of their Grilled Beef Short Ribs, Great Service...Wendy's Noodle Cafe Go Boom!!!There's so much on the menu that you really have no excuse but to come back.  At Wendy's, you have a gang of choices from Starters, Noodles, Rice Plates, and even some East Meets West dishes. Their grilled beef short ribs was good, but I loved me some Rib Eye Bao Burger.  You get 3 with your order and if you're eating with me, I warn you that I exercise portion control.  That means I control all the portions.  Sorry Terri R., I just realized I didn't offer you any.  30 minutes into dinner, Christina W. (aka the Duchess of Wendy's) sent me a super lag tip to try their fried chicken wings, fried bread, and Tom Yum fried rice. My meal was so delicious and filling that I didn't have any regrets that I missed out on Christina's tip.  But looks like I'll be back because if it's good enough for the Duchess, then it's good enough for me.  Wendy's Noodle Cafe is legit.  I'm quarter Chinese and the meats that I had reminded me of what you can get in Chinatown SF or at my very own family parties.Still one of my favorite Chinese places. Good friendly service, clean and bright space, good consistently food. The owner is always so cheery and humble and remembers us each time and comes by to say hello. There are some unexpected fusion type dishes, but also traditional foods too (though this is not your average Chinese menu, more like Chaozhou style). Everything is fresh and comes piping hot, in large portions. There really isn't much over $10 so I feel this place is also good value on top of it being on with flavors. Since I come with fair regularity, I figured I should just make a running tally of what I'm ordering. Favorites - E-fu noodles: I have a thing for e-fu. It's a soft noodle with very subtle flavors, but comforting to me. Honey Glazed Eggplant - It's like honey walnut shrimp, but eggplant and less mayo-y. A bit of hot sauce and this crispy bite is a guilty pleasure.Lotus root w/ pork - this isn't on any of the menus, but the black board menu all in Chinese. I've only ever had lotus root in soups so I had no clue it was crunchy. Thanks to Christina W. this became my favorite, though it's hard to order it since I don't know the Chinese name. I show them the picture I took! Haha. BBQ Pork Rice Plate - their bbq pork here is juicy and perfect. Comes with rice, and steamed veggies. Singapore Noodles - not on the menu anymore, but they have all the ingredients and still make it for me. This is my favorite place to get it actually, just the right amount of curry flavor, has that yummy bbq pork slices and shrimp on it. Fish filet salt & pepper - theirs is really nicely crisp and I like they make it smaller pieces than larger filets so easy to split, and plenty of crunchy surface. Other stuff I've tried worth mentioning - Nan Yang Chow Noodles- I've only had this once so far, but it was interesting and good. I didn't know what it was so figured, what the heck? It's wide noodles in a rich peanutty, spicy XO sauce. I would order this again. Crab with XO sauce vermicelli - I'm not too keen on vermicelli, but somehow between this and Singapore noodles, Wendy's sells me on it. Seafood XO sauce stir fried udon - This is like, chow meins  spicy, savory cousin for foodies. I think I just like anything in XO sauce. It's that umami spiciness that is irresistible. You can also do this with thin rice noodles, but have not tried it that way. Spare rib black bean sauce hot pot - I love those spare ribs at dim sum, but I just wanted a whole bowl full on rice. Finally a place with it in a entree size just for meeee!  Pan fried rice cake w/ egg - The BF isn't a fan so I never get to order it, but I love crispy rice cake and with the over easy egg on it and dipped in a bit of soy and red vinegar - yum! Salty fish rice with chicken - their fried rice is fluffy and not greasy at all here so even if salty fish isn't your thing, try another fried rice and I don't think you will be disappointed. Also their desserts here always look great and interesting but I never have the room for it. One day. One day I will have a dessert. I've also never really ventured much in terms of their soups, though I always see people ordering it up. I know I've forgetting a few things I liked. I try to order 1 new thing and 1 favorite when I visit so I'm sure I'll be updating this review a few times.I was able to knock off another spot that was bookmarked and loved it! It was almost 9 pm when we arrived and the there was a good amount of customers inside. They have different sizes of tables to accommodate the size of your party. There was a nice man who greeted us and took us to a table right away. Drinks and peanuts were brought to the table and the night was off to a great start.There were tons of things on Wendy's menu that I had never seen before. After much menu gazing I decided on the "Flaming Hot Stir-Fried Beef" priced at $8.99 and it was so good! The portion was much more then I expected and the dish was packed with delicious flavor. This was a dish that could easily be shared. The rice brought with it was cooked perfectly. You just can't go wrong with the prices at Wendy's or the portion.Wendy herself came over to our table to introduce herself and ask how the meal was. I mentioned that I was curious about a few items on the menu and she took much appreciated time explaining the items on the menu and asking me what my personal likes were so she could suggest certain dishes for the next visit. She mentioned that the "Clay Pots" take at least 30 minutes to prepare and that you can just call ahead if you are on a time crunch and they can start preparing it for you. Wendy was so genuinely nice and it is evident she cares about the food they are serving as much as the customers.They have TV's inside and offer catering. This is the type of place you could go on a date, take your family, or just grab some lunch on a break. Inside was very clean and the water they serve is filtered. I will for sure be back![T]asty doesn't even begin to describe this dish![O]nce you try it, you'll get the hype-[M]any reviews cite it as the reason they come here...[Y]ou will too once you try it![U]ntil now, I never knew the  flavors of this soup; [M]y taste buds still did a happy dance, regardless.[G]o now and grab an [O]rder, it's[O]verflowing with seafood ['N'] it packs a punch of [G]ood and balanced flavors.[F]inally, a dish I can[R]egularly order when[I]'m overwhelmed by Chinatown options.[E]ven though I love trying new things,[D]efinitely going to get this dish, here,[R]egularly.[I][C]an only hope that you[E]njoy this dish as much as I do.
In-N-Out Burger=When I yelp, I bark animal style. When I dine in In N Out I pass over animal style and enjoy a mouth watering cheeseburger & fries.  Speaking of animal style, in the fast food jungle, In N Out is an animal with the style of simplicity and efficiency. It is delicious fast food made simple. With the exception of a secret menu, there are only three meals to choose from. A hamburger meal, a cheeseburger meal, or double cheeseburger meal. It is simplicity made fresh. Forget about ordinary burgers being left under warm lights or frozen patties warming up in a microwave style device. At In N Out, they cook the burger right there and in front of the customer.  Delicious fast food made simple is brings me inside the Blue Diamond Road In N Out Burger oftentimes when I am in the vicinity of the Target in the parking lot. Lol. Sometimes I go out of my way to do an errand in this Target just for an excuse to patronize In N Out. The thing is, it seems that on any given visit hundreds of people are also patronizing In N Out. The upshot us that I am rarely in n out. But then again I always dine inside. Regardless that I might be number 240 and they are serving customer 186; efficiency speeds up the wait. Due to supply and demand, In N Out is so popular that finding a table is as difficult as finding a cold day on a June in Las Vegas. Just like at any In N Out; I consider myself satisfied sitting at a bar chair.   On the subject of crowded, I observed that at In N Out; customers rarely seem agitated or annoyed. Ditto for the employees. The employees here are even friendlier than at casual dining restaurants that I have experienced. An example is last Saturday when I dined here, a friendly employee went up to all the customers asking how the food was and making small talk.   In a City where there are countless restaurants to dine in, In N Out is the ultimate option. It is upbeat, inexpensive,  and delicious. When it comes to yelping this In N Out, I give it a 4 star bark :-)Pretty snazzy fries and a decent double double were my companions during this workday, and I must say they were truly good company. Perhaps if I was able to sit down and enjoy my meal rather than have to eat it on the go, I could have savored it much better. But, I'm in the process of streamlining our courier service and had to focus more on the navigation of the driver than this delicious burger and tasty fries, so something might have been lost in translation.Needless to say, if I ever find myself transferred to our Mesa branch for the day, I know I'll stop by In-N-Out Burger to sate my loins.IN-N-OUT IN MAH BELLY!So freaking good it's almost criminal. Small menu here but what they do they do most excellently.As we had a long ride up to Sedona today and needed to get some gas in the tank I noticed the sign on the highway for this In-N-Out location and made a bee-line for it after hitting the gas station. Did not want to get all bloated and sleepy by ordering off the "secret menu" so I went with the basic crave satisfying meal of a double double, fries, and a Neopolitan shake.Good beejeezus this burger is like an orgasm in your mouth! Two beef patties of juicy goodness, fresh lettuce and tomato, crisp onion slices, and a soft buttery bun. Oh my! Decent enough fries and a thick delicious shake to wash it all down. Just ridiculously tasty! This location itself is super clean with a cool retro look to it like back in the 1950's. A bunch of tables outside on a front patio that we ate on with the perfect weather out today. It just doesn't get any better then this!That little devil on my shoulder kept taunting me to eat another burger, but I had to resist. Sedona was calling and it was a long ride. After this I already needed a nap!-The BEST fries in the whole wide world!! Cheap too!-I LOVE these hamburgers, it's worth waiting for! I envision the toasty buns, secret sauce, and greasy goodness as I slowly wait my turn in line.-Good location, right off the freeway.-Service was friendly, just like any location.-I learned there's a Jersey Mike's in the same parking lot, as I waited in the Drive-Thru line.-I found this location with YELP's help.
Fair Trade Café=Honest to God, Sheriff Joe's jail is more comforting than this venue (trust me, and don't ask why, but I know). So here's to hoping that they just opened earlier than they had wanted to, 'cause right now this maybe the coldest coffee shop I've been in since Drip. Or maybe they just don't want you hanging around, and if that's the case they certainly have succeeded with flying colors. As at this point in time (1st week) they have ONE comfortable piece of furniture and all the rest are bare metal chairs. The space certainly does have potential with their big outdoor patio. And by the looks of it they will have a hot kitchen sometime in the future. As for the coffee, it's okay but nothing special, and/but don't expect any orange flavor for your Italian soda 'cause they don't seem to think it's worthy of stocking (at either stores).Unfortunately Lux still has no competition in this town ...i liked the location more then the original. but i liked the people at the original more. it's not like there is anything wrong with the people at the new location. i just was like super regular at the original location..so i didn't feel like a nobody. :-/ ohh wells. :)
Ari Sushi=After eating there at least monthly for the last year, Tokyo Lobby is a distant memory. We have a new item every time we order and we've still barely made a dent in the impressive menu!The place isn't fancy, but who cares? It is clear that it's a family business who has no aspirations to becoming a nationwide chain. And that's fine by me.The waitress is very friendly: greeting me by name when I walk through the door, remembering my orders (even when I forgot to get my usual garlic tuna roll), and giving me small treats as I wait for my takeout. The owners are similarly pleasant, so i imagine that it's part of their customer service culture.I recommend Ari Sushi to everyone I know that lives near the area and they all have loved it as well. The place has gotten busier, which results in longer wait times at the peak. But it's the price you have to pay to make sure that it stays in business.
Tommy V's Osteria and Pizzeria=I had lunch with a friend on Wednesday this past week...we were on the phone trying to figure where to rendezvous when the name "Tommy V's Osteria and Pizzeria" came up (I know...it's mouthful...I just said "Tommy V's":)We are both fans of Tomaso's (see my excellent review of Tomaso's...oh wait...you can't...it's one of the 89 partially written reviews sitting on my laptop waiting for me to figure out what to say...well, trust me...it's an excellent review:)And speaking of excellent, so is Tommy V's:)What a delightful little adjunct to Tomaso's...the wood fired oven facing the bar and dining area, the flat panel TV above the bar tuned to Italian World Cup soccer...murmuring softly in Italian in the background...the place is very nicely decorated and the ambiance of the place is quiet and pleasant:)And the food, my friends...the food!In the end, it's pretty much always about the food and anyplace that bears Tommy's name is not going to disappoint in that area:)I had a lovely Umbrian Sausage Panini...made the way a Panini is supposed to be made...on house baked flat bread (with wood smoke and dark brown blisters in the bread from the wood oven), filled with thin slices of savory Umbrian Sausage, caramelized onions and Italian peppers and set off perfectly with homemade garlic aioli...re-baked in the wood oven so that it was warm all the way through (very little that I dislike more than a panini that's still cold in the middle...that's just damn laziness! :-)My buddy had a pizza...a custom pizza...the kind of pizza that I wish I could get Bianco's:)And we didn't have to wait 3 hours for Tommy V's pizza:)...they brought out his beautifully blistered, crusty and delicious, Quattro fromaggio with artichoke hearts and caramelized onions about 20 minutes after we ordered...just about right for a pizza order:)Once again, essentially edible art...smoky and delicious, hot from the oven...all the ingredients were perfectly proportioned (I think my friend has a special genius for ordering...this pizza wasn't on the menu, but clearly should be:)The price to portion and price to value ratio are so clearly positive at Tommy V's that I didn't even bother to create a chart...Under $30 for the 2 of us and we couldn't finish all the food...my Panini alone was over 12 inches across, cut into quarters...easily enough for 2 people, and included a wild greens salad in a light vinaigrette...wonderful:)We didn't try the bar out (lunchtime...on a Wednesday...meetings later...can't afford to look drunk:) although we did gawk a bit...an excellent selection of Italian beers, decent wines, scotches, vodka's...even bourbon's:)The only thing that was a bit jarring was the service...but not for lack of service!:)I don't want to rag on them for being too attentive, but they may want to throttle back on the love just a little...I was asked "how is everything" 3-4 times while I was in the middle of a conversation (we hadn't seen each other in while so we had a bunch to catch up on) or in the middle of a bite...listen...I really appreciate that so much more than the typical "where did everyone go?" kind of thing...just ease off the gas pedal a little bit...we already love you...we really, really do! :-)And that's it...that's the only thing about Tommy V's that even remotely causes a ripple...they are just so very eager to please! :-)So drop by 32nd and Camelback (remember...this is Tommy V's...not Zen 32...you would be disappointed:) and have yourself one of the best pie's or panini's you're likely to experience anywhere:-)
Bonfyre American Grille=Highly recommend! The food here is always good. No matter what you order, you can't go wrong. Highlights: The rotisserie chicken is juicy and flavorful. The steaks are cooked so perfectly, they almost melt in your mouth. The salads are delicious; my husband likes to add the salmon with his salad. One of my favorite dishes is Mort's Pot Roast. I don't usually get dessert at restaurants, but Bonfyre has great little creamy desserts in shot glasses that are the perfect size if you're looking for a sweet treat.This is a great place for happy hour. You can get $5 bar plates in the bar area---flat breads, tacos, fries, etc.This is a nice place to take out of town guests.  You can make reservations, they can accommodate groups well, and you know everyone will be happy with their meal.
BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse=For my birthday every year, my parents come down from Payson to take me to lunch. We try to coordinate where to meet, and since I have a client in Gilbert, my boyfriend suggested this. Oh, and they wanted to go to Winco right after, so this seemed like a good spot. I had never in my life heard of the place. Sometimes, that's a good thing.Today, though, it wasn't. Turns out, it's just a huge room with an even bigger menu. I chose the Cobb salad. Now, let me make one thing clear: If I am going to have a salad, I always get a Cobb salad. The Vig Uptown has my favorite one. I *know* a Cobb salad. The menu said it came with feta. F. E. T. A. on a Cobb salad. I asked the waitress to substitute the feta for blue cheese, remove the bacon (I knew it wouldn't be real bacon, and I hate bacon bits), and keep the dressing on the side. It also came with "turkey."Never in my life have I sent anything back to a kitchen. Ever. But there was no way I was going to let this pass. I've seen enough Kitchen Nightmares to know that Gordon would have told the server to have the chef eat that salad, just to see how horrible their food was. And that's exactly what I told her. The "turkey" were a bunch of cubes of white stuff on my plate, that had obviously been frozen, and had as much flavor as the iceberg lettuce. There were chopped tomatoes all over the place, and my "cucumber" was a tiny slice off the end of the cucumber. (see photo)She offered to bring me something else, and I declined. I didn't even want the free *$&#*$&# pizookie, that's how angry and disappointed I was. They took the "Cobb salad" off our bill, and we went on our merry way. My stomach was rumbling on my way home. I fear it's going to be a looooooooooong night. From a salad. The worst salad in all the land.I will never, ever eat at any location of this hole again. I had no idea it was a chain, or I would have picked something else.I've never cried during a birthday lunch with my parents, but I was mighty close today.Delicious margaritas in a beautiful setting with stellar customer service.  A margarita on the rocks with no salt is my go-to drink and it's fair to say that I've had my fair share of margaritas at different bars and restaurants all across the Valley and this one was THE BEST, hands down.  It was expertly mixed, with just the right amount of alcohol and citrus tanginess, served tall, on the rocks and garnished with slices of lemon and lime and most importantly NO salt.  You can ruin a margarita for me by ignoring my 'no salt' request, thankfully our server was paying close attention.Rumor has it, there was food in front of me too, but it was secondary to that amazing margarita.So for those nights where I prefer to drink my dinner (don't judge) this is the place.Margaritas: Not *just* for breakfast anymore.
Zoës Kitchen=Had dinner here last night. It was crazy in Uptown, everyone out at the Panthers Pre-Season Game. We went the opposite way and decided to finally have a relaxing sit down dinner at Zoes.Place was nice and quiet for it was like close to 7:30 PM. People coming in to grab meals to go and several patrons placing orders.The Steak Kabobs were delicious. Cooked to your liking. The hummus was creamy.Rice Pilaf good but a tad salty. Have to watch my salt intake and sugar levels for I have gained a huge muffin top.They have wine here too.
Meatballz=I have been excited for the Grand Opening... sort of a let down. Good thing I was in a who cares attitude today. First a little history... These meat heads started the whole chain and franchised out. They still own Peoria and Phoenix but have either sold or franchised out the rest. The place was busy and there were plenty of people working. Most had no idea what they were doing. LOL I browsed the menu and decided that the kids meal would suffice for lunch. (Since there are no lunch specials) I ask the order taker if the kids meal come with a meatball, she said YES but then asked if I wanted a drink, which it come with it. I KNEW there was not going to be a meatball. The little dude with an earring and Michael Jordan shorts on said to me... Is it for a kid? I said Yes, I am a big kid. He said to no longer order from the kids menu without it being for a child. Then proceeded to tell the order taker never let it happen again. LOL AZZThe same dude made it a point to serve me the food. It was a perfect lunch size portion of spag with meat sauce NO Meatball and two of the best garlic rolls/knots whatever I have had in a long time.  The sauce was good but it got a little watered down by the pasta not being drained enough. I see quality is not a high point here. The other plates looked great and I look forward to trying something else off  the kids menu.
Cracker Barrel Old Country Store=Starving after 4 hours on the road but not wanting fast food places attached to gas stations Donna and I settled on Cracker Barrel. It's like every other Crack Barrel where you enter and exit the restaurant through a enormous gift shop full of surprisingly well prices candies, candles, knick knacks, toys, etc, etc. Food is comfort foods such as chicken fried steak, meatloaf, chicken and dumplings, ham, fried chicken, catfish, and other stuff. They even have breakfast. For my meal I had the hickory smoked bone-in country ham with fried okra and turnip greens for my sides. The ham was very smokey and tasted great. The greens were actually some of the best I've had. Chunks of ham hock all throughout the tender greens. Okra was fried perfectly and steaming hot. For $7.39 this was some good eats. Donna had the chicken and dumplings with "hashbrown casserole" and fried okra. Her meal didn't look good to me but she said it was excellent. Her meal was also $7.39. Very efficient and friendly service. Since you pay in the gift shop we couldn't resist and impulse bought some stuff. Their mission was accomplished!***Cracker Barrel is a countrified Denny's, but the food is better than that chain and their lack of presence on the West Coast makes their Arizona location feel different and more unique than some of the other big chains you'll find there***When I was a kid, I used to eat at Cracker Barrel a lot (Cracker Barrel is a combination of a touristy general store and a countrified restaurant focusing on big breakfasts and home-style lunches/dinners).  Cracker Barrel is very popular in the Midwest and it is also a popular along-the-highway-stop in the Southeast.  I remember enjoying it, but my fondness for it has decreased over the years.Every Cracker Barrel looks the same.  They have a faux rustic outdoor cabin-like exterior with a faux porch lined with rocking chairs that you can purchase.  When you enter, you are immediately in a pseudo general store that offers touristy souvenirs and a lot of food items.  Not really pantry items.  Instead, you will find a lot of sweets like nostalgic candy, chocolates, caramels, syrups, jams, apple butters, candy sticks (15 cents per stick), Jelly Belly jelly beans, etc.Just past the general store you will find the restaurant.  The breakfast (which I believe is served all day) is a mix of your standard stuff like pancakes, french toast, eggs, bacon, sausage, biscuits, etc.  Bob Evans is a lot like Cracker Barrel and I think Bob Evans' breakfast is far superior.I went with a dish I have always ordered--chicken and dumplings with mashed potatoes and corn niblets.  The last time I had this dish was in Ohio and the dish was quite oily and bland.  The dish was still on the bland side though the dumplings/sauce were less oily (there was a much creamier base).The dumplings were a little bit too thin, but they were mostly fine and enjoyable.  The chicken was a relatively small portion and it was a little dry (but not too bad).  The chicken and dumplings could have definitely used a lot more seasoning (though places like Cracker Barrel tend to have to please an older clientele, who may have more sodium restrictions).The mashed potatoes were okay.  Not the creamiest or smoothest texture.  Very hot.  The corn was okay.I had the hot fudge sundae for dessert and it was not that bad of a deal (it was under $3).  Served in a frozen mug, the sundae consisted of two scoops of Blue Bell vanilla ice cream, hot fudge, whipped cream, and a maraschino cherry.  The whipped cream was of the canned/aerosol variety, but the ice cream was decent.  It had a good flavor and was firm and creamy.  It was also not too whipped or airy (which you get at a lot of family restaurants).The hot fudge was also good and warm.Service was fine.  It was pleasant and quick.  I do not think I would classify Cracker Barrel as authentic country cuisine, but they definitely achieve a consistent look and personality with all their waitresses (no matter what state you are in).Pricing is more than reasonable.  You get a lot of food and you do not have to pay much.  Most of their entrees are below $10 and desserts run about $4 and below.You could probably do worse than Cracker Barrel on the road.  Still, I think the food was pretty average at best.  But if you find yourself needing to stop somewhere on the road in Arizona, you will come across a lot of chains you can find in California.  Cracker Barrel is a big chain too, but their lack of presence on the West Coast at least makes this restaurant feel somewhat different and unique.This Cracker Barrel is in a seemingly new shopping development that has a huge and free parking lot.
Bobbee O's BBQ=If you read my reviews before and tried the places I write about then you will realize this may be the only one you need to read!  i will make this short!Bobby O's CRUSHES any other BBQ place around.  Midwood, Macs, Jim n Nics.....etc.  Tastes like you just took it off the smoker and the brisket is tender and stretches a little before it tears, yumm. The sauce on the pulled pork is vinegar based with a little spice to it and their signature sauce is sweet but not overpowering (best bbq sauce I have had).  Sides are incredible (mac n cheese/cabbage, collards are my recommendations). Staff is unbelievably friendly! Flaws: they need another location! it is always hot in there (but that comes with the whole experience of being right next to all of the cooking equipment so it could really be seen as a pro and not a con depending on how you look at it). Recap:  this is hands down the best bbq but if you are planning on going with more than 4 people I would suggest getting takeout as there is not much room to sit.
Irish Wolfhound=Ok, came here to enjoy happy hour and the service was ok?  Waitress really did not want to help us, she rather be somewhere else for sure.  I have had better times in other bars, outdoor patios than here so I must only rate this an ok place.  Wish I could give it a higher rating? Why you ask?  The place is nice, just the service is ugh and the crowd.  Wish it could be a younger crowd, but it seems to attract Sun City here and not Surprise.  Luckily the patio is big so our group could be far from the other patrons.
Flaming Kabob=The delicious meats, spreads and other concoctions are worth the trip.  The decor, the lighting, the location, not so much, but I put food over decor 9/10 times.The restaurant that was in this location before left such a bad impression in my mind that I wanted to try this new one quickly. I'm really glad I did.  We went here for a quick bite and wound up having a feast.  Their menu is ambitious, many types of Middle Eastern and Greek influenced preparation styles, each achieved with great success.The menu features everything east Mediterranean from lamb chops to kibbee to grape leaves to kafta.  The prices are a bit high, but when you look at what you get, it really is a good deal.  The owner was happy to beam about the fact that everything is brand new, everything is made in house and under his watch.We had the platter for 2.  Now, I'm cheap and a grad student so $25 is a good chunk for a weekday dinner for me, but man was this a bargin.  1 of each: beef kabob, chicken kabob, chicken kafta, beef kafta, hummus plate, salad.  Huge stack of pita, 2 falafel and 2 beef kibbee.  Everything was excellent.  The kabobs were excellently grilled, the falafel was crispy on the outside, fresh and moist on the inside.  The sauces that came with (garlic, tdaziki and tahini) were all great for everything on the plates.The decor needs a lady's touch and I really hope they spend a little cash in there to fix it up.  The location is prime for selling $5 gyro sandwiches til the cows come home (or at least til the lambs do), but if they want their excellent menu to keep the customers coming back they should fix the lighting and decor.  The old place was like a prison cafeteria, food included.  Out with the old!I'll be going back for a sandwich for sure.  And with the combo for 2 coupon for $22 they gave us, we might be seeing the huge boxes of leftovers in our fridge again soon.
18 Degrees=I'm sad that I had a terrible experience here, because we live in walking distance and it had the potential to become a regular stop for us. BUUUUUUUT no. I had a living social voucher I think.. some type of social media discount. The first problem they had with me, was that my voucher wasn't printed. Well on my iphone it clearly states, either print out your coupon or show the merchant your mobile voucher. If you are not going to honor mobile vouchers then maybe YOU SHOULD PUT THAT IN THE FINE PRINT.After I made it clear they were going to honor this, they tried to tell me I couldn't use it for happy hour prices. Now I would definitely understand this too, had IT BEEN WRITTEN SOMEWHERE ON THE VOUCHER. Nope, nowhere. So our bitchy waitress goes to get her manager because clearly she doesn't have the brainpower to think of another excuse for not honoring this voucher....So then this braindead manager comes over. He proceeds to tell me that he would be fine with using it for happy hour prices but the computer will not allow him to do so. I tell him to enter it in to show me that it won't let him & SHOCKER. It does let him.Now why on earth would a place try so hard to make a customer unhappy. Because to say I left unhappy would be a fricken understatement of the year. DON'T PUT OUT A SOCIAL MEDIA VOUCHER IF YOU ARE GOING TO BE ASSES WHEN WE TRY TO USE IT.9/5/13Stopped in to use an expiring $20 for $10 Amazon Local Deals coupon**.  Was told to sit anywhere I'd liked, so I sat at one of the tables near the windows overlooking the Ice Den, the ice-skating rink next door-- pretty cool. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/18-degrees-scottsdale?select=3vIs8mTZeROUqDL3yPzWpw#3vIs8mTZeROUqDL3yPzWpw  There were booths alongside one wall that had their own flat-screens, which were nice touches, and an area with leather (or was it pleather?) seating, and yet another flat-screen, which looked inviting.  The young female server wasn't particularly enthusiastic or helpful about the menu offerings, but was honest enough to steer me away from the sweet potato fries when I inquired about them.  I have to agree with her that the green chile mac 'n cheese was the better option out of the two.  After studying the menus for many minutes, debating on trying three courses (app, entree, and dessert), or just two main entrees, and finally decided on ordering the Bacon and blue cheese burger, with green chile mac to start, and then later on going with the cheeseburger (cheddar) and subbed sweet potato fries for an extra $1.25.  (Perhaps she's not a sweet potato fry fan, or maybe she is and she didn't like the way they were prepared here?  I had to find out for myself.)  The burger patties weren't of high-quality-- I found them consisting of more fillers than meat and too fatty, yet not very flavorful.  I had a bit of the blue cheeseburger http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/18-degrees-scottsdale?select=KDB96IhpSqi3JgGvR259HQ#KDB96IhpSqi3JgGvR259HQ for lunch at work the next day, didn't enjoy it, and threw away the rest of both burgers that night.  Same thing with the sweet potato fries-- too soggy, even after I'd requested "extra-crispy," and not a lot of flavor.  The green chile mac was the only decent item I had.  Back to the burgers, I found it strange that the bacon and blue cheeseburger didn't come with any veggie trimmings ("only the cheeseburgers have them"), but I was given a plate of shredded lettuce and tasteless tomato slices when I asked.  The cheddar cheeseburger http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/18-degrees-scottsdale?select=LXfGcKQ1Z9fFAPSKVkRYFQ#LXfGcKQ1Z9fFAPSKVkRYFQ did come with lettuce and, even more interestingly, more flavorful and redder, tomato slices.The happy hour prices seem like a good deal, and it seems like a decent place to hang out and watch sports on TV, or to just  meet with friends, if hanging out at home, or someone else's, isn't feasible.  I thought it something novel to be able to watch both novice and experienced skaters practice next door...  I hope I can bump up my rating next time.  That is, if I return.**Sister with two kids were coming for a visit in August, and I thought I'd take them ice-skating.  The kids weren't interested in trying on ice skates, so the certificate went unused.
Aces & Ales=Came here for the Winter Beer Fest on a Saturday afternoon.  As usual, tasting glasses were $15 for the 1st round (you keep the glass) and each round after that is $4.  Not bad!  The lineup of Beer was pretty good, but not as good as the Summer Beer Fest in my opinion.  We arrived at 12:30 pm and here's a list of Beer I had:Stone Double Dry Hopped IPAStone Smoked Porter w/Chipotle PeppersBallast Point Brewing Company Dorado Double IPAStone Imperial Russian Stout Bourbon BarrelStone Smoked Porter w/Vanilla BeansBallast Point Brewing Company Sculpin IPABig Dog's Sled Dog StoutBig Dog's War Dog Imperial IPAMoylans Brewery Kilt LifterJoseph James Barrel Aged Desert DawnThey were all very good.  My favorites were the Stone Smoked Porter w/Chipotle Peppers.....I should have ordered this with a Burger.  Instead, I ordered a 16" Margherita Pizza ($13).  The Pizza was awful.....0 Stars.  I'm a Pizza lover too and I'm very tolerable about bad Pizza....but this one was soooo bad.  The crust was tough like cardboard and the ingredients were subpar.  You're not suppose to use regular Tomatoes on a Margherita Pizza....but that's what they did and they were bland.  Blech.  Ken M ordered Fish Tacos and he loved them.....I think I ordered the wrong menu item.  Oh well, next time I'll try a Burger.Overall, it was a good time.....I wish this place was closer to my neighborhood.  Return Factor - 99.9%I've noticed that I've only given Aces and Ales 4 stars.  Shame on me.  This is the best craft bar in Vegas.  What other place gets Deschutes Jubelale, seriously?  Even craft beer nerds from San Diego or Portland would be at least moderately impressed with Aces.  Sure, the atmosphere leaves something to be desired.  It does sort of feel like a dive bar.  But the craft beer selections here are the best that Vegas sees.  From Port Brewing to Double Dry Hopped Stone IPA to Belgian sour beers, Aces is the place for the true beer nerd.  The food has also improved since my last review.  I love the salads.  Try the Tuna Ahi Salad or even just the Caesar.  Awesome stuff.  If you don't like healthy food, the rest of the menu will definitely give you a delicious heart attack... at least you will die happy!  It is worth mentioning that Aces has events almost every weekend.  For example, the owner of Stone, Greg Koch, seems to visit annually.  Other great breweries that are new to the Vegas market take over the taps at Aces to offer their finest selections.  Parking can be a PITA though, so be prepared to park behind the gas station out back (not in front!).  SNAFU, the local homebrew club also has their monthly meetings here.Cheers!I wanted to love this place.  Everyone else loves this place.  But I don't.I must be an oddball.Anyway, I actually like the atmosphere here.  I like that it's dark and kind of divey with plenty of seats either at the bar or at the tables.  I like the super friendly servers.I've visited a couple times and although the menu rotates, it seems to be heavy on (very) dark beers.  It's the summer and it's hella hot outside- can I get something a little lighter?  Plus, the prices seem a bit high to me.As for the food, they have a decent selection for a bar and I'm impressed at the number of vegetarian options they have.  I've had the parmesan fries, fried cheese curds, and veggie pizza.  The parmesan fries are really good and the portion is large.  I have a mad crush on the cheese curds and like that they come with three different sauces depending on your mood.  I would come back to Aces and Ales for the cheese curds alone.I was completely unimpressed with the veggie pizza though.  The dough was raw in the middle, there were too many toppings so it was watery, and the mushrooms were old and funky.  I let my husband eat it.  He's not pickyAnd just a fair warning not to get here starving.  Our food took forever to come out.I think I'll give Aces and Ales another go if I'm in the area.  But it's much too far to make a trip when there are plenty of other places closer to me that I know I like.I can see why there's so much love from people who appreciate beer more than I do.  I'm guessing I'm a dummy that doesn't know any better.  Oh well.PS- Be prepared to get some odd looks and maybe hear a record scratch if you walk in as a newbie.  There are definitely regulars here that notice new faces.What a find! The only bad thing about this place is there aren't more around the Vegas valley. Talk about a beer selection.. Amazing! I got the oatmeal stout they had on tap. It was very rich, silky, and bitter. So good. My girlfriend and I got the pretzel appetizer to share. It was so good, and the mustard it came with was super good too. The only drawback the bartender didn't comp any of our drinks and we gabled quite a bit and she charged us a buck for a side of marinara sauce. haha no big deal just thought it was odd. If your ever in the area of Nellis and Flamingo I suggest checking this place out.I am not buying into the hype. This place was dumpy with snotty airheaded old bartenders who will snub the shit out of you if you are a girl. She "forgot" about my drink for 15 minutes until I pointed it out to the other bartender. Then the original bartender magically remembered. $20 for two shitty drinks and atrocious service. The manager was more interested in groping the bartender when he was behind the bar than actually checking in with patrons. Other than that, it is a standard dark, dumpy bar with a decent selection of beer. There are six TVs playing sports, 80s music blasting, and a pool table. I think they played Juke Box Hero like 5 times.  Video poker at bar. Smoking allowed. Weak drinks. Crowd is pretty old. Very meh ..not much separating from chains like yard house. Except at Yardhouse you aren't treated like shit. Also, the idiot airhead bartender added extra $2 to her tip to make it 20% which I am disputing with the bank. It isn't about $2.00 it's about the entitlement these idiots feel even when they provide below sub par service.I was in Vegas for work last week, and for the last night there I brought a coworker with me, we'll call him Mr. K, and explained that this might be the best beer bar he has ever been to.  I know.  I know.  That's a lot of build up.The receipt said Wendy and Jeff, and if that's accurate, both of them took excellent care of us.  They are funny, friendly, and knowledgeable about beer.  I love them.  OK.  I don't LOVE them love them. I'm not a complete weirdo.I was the DD so had to select my one drink very carefully.  I believe it was a New Belgium/Lost Abbey collaboration, Brett Beer.    I think this is supposed to be a sour ale, but it's not very sour.  I was calling it a farmhouse ale, but I don't think that's right.  I enjoyed it.  I don't remember exactly what Mr. K had.  I do know that one of his beers was aged in Wild Turkey barrels and he liked that a lot.Normally I am in awe of the beer, which is expected, but the food that night.  The food was amazing.  So simple yet so good.  I had the grilled cheese with cheddar, slices of apple, and bacon.  Need I say more?  Yes I do.  I also had the Arrogant Bastard onion rings, and when I forced one upon Mr. K, he said that was the best onion ring he has had in his life.  Yeah.  It's that good.He ordered a pizza with I think shrooms and sausage and possibly pepperoni.  I forget, but I swiped a piece and it was very good.  The crust is not too thick, not too thin, just perfect.  Delicious with the beer.Now I remember why my memory is so bad.  We were carbo overloading.  I've been thinking about the beer bites since the last time I was here and we started with those.  Just as good as I remember and I was happy to share since I knew we weren't done yet.I love this place.  And I mean really love it.Aces & Ales is a no frills bar, with an odd lay out, 5 tables scattered throughout, a killer jukebox, a solid selection of craft and microbrews, solid bar food, and cheap drinks.Monday nights they have a huge karaoke following. Starts at 12 AM. Karate Karaoke. You can earn you way up to a black belt. It's a great way to meet people and to people watch.Came here for a friend's birthday and it was a great time. The place was clean, the staff was friendly and accommodating for our large group. I wish it wasn't clear on the other side of town for me because I would invite people to come play and hang out here. The ladies room was also clean, too, which is real struggle in Vegas outside of casinos and nightclubs. Definitely a fan of this place.
Plum Pan Asian Kitchen=I had the pleasure of having lunch here with my yelp buddy, Lisa G. and her well-mannered little guy last week.  I took vacation during restaurant week so I could purposely try different places.  Though Plum wasn't participating in Restaurant week, it has been on my list of places I MUST try.  This area of Shadyside is booming with restaurant activity and shopping places so it was quite a treat to find a parking lot above the restaurant for free!  We arrived there shortly before 1pm, and there were only a handful of people dining at this time.  It was very quiet inside.  The place had an echo to it, however the décor and the setup was lovely.  I did feel the urge to keep my voice down as it seemed to travel all threw the place.  To start we ordered drinks.  The waitress was very sweet to my friends son, and made his little drink to his exact specifications.  Gotta love a man who knows what he wants:) I ordered an Asian Sangria.  I am not sure what makes it Asian but it was yummo.  Very refreshing, but a little on the pricey side.   For lunch I ordered octopus sushi a la carte, and Shrimp Pad Thai which I requested be prepared spicy at a level 8.  I can say I actually found a sushi I wasn't thrilled over.  Don't get me wrong it was fresh, I just didn't dig the octopus the way I thought I would.  But it sure made a pretty picture.  My Pad Thai was pretty good, but not really spicy.  The waitress recommended another dish since I requested spicy but I stuck to the Pad Thai.  I love when the staff recommends things, I probably should have listened.  I look forward to returning hopefully for dinner next time, oh and next time here I am going all sushi baby!
Braddock's Pittsburgh Brasserie=Braddock's should be admired for it's dedication to buying local.  Everything is described to you by friendly servers with where things come from.  Very impressive.  Especially for a hotel restaurant!  I think a lot of people have a common misconception that all hotel restaurants must be a chain of some sort.  It's nice that the Renaissance welcomes them in. The outer part of Braddock's is just a bar area or "Braddock's Streetside."  The back part of Braddock's is a fancy dining room.  It's really quite gorgeous inside.  I couldn't pass up a tasty looking beet salad so I ordered one up.  It's a beautiful presentation with two unassuming fried goat cheese balls.  But holy crap were those some amazing balls!!  The beets were good, don't get me wrong... and I liked shallot vinaigrette, but those cheese balls... star of the show!  I'd come back just for a plate full of those, even though I know it wouldn't be the healthiest option!  I definitely want to come back for dinner and get some of the other delicious sounding items and perhaps a cocktail.  It would be a nice date night spot.  Maybe even a romantical evening stay downtown at the hotel as well!  Fried cheese balls included in that package please!We stopped at Braddock's Pittsburgh Brasserie on a Friday night before heading over to the Byham Theater for the annual DVE Morning Show Comedy festival.  We had already eaten elsewhere so this visit was simply for wetting our whistles before heading to the show.We bellied up to the bar.  The bar area was moderately busy but not overwhelming.  From what I gather there is a dining room located across the way.  There was only one bartender and we patiently waited to be served.  The bartender was pouring some drinks for the patrons already seated.  I glanced over the drafts and picked an IPA to go with and waited, and waited some more.  In the meantime a party of about 6 rolled over to the corner of the bar where we were seated and were standing there.  We had probably been waiting about 10 minutes by now.  Finally the bartender comes towards us just to pass right by to the crowd standing at the corner!  Blood boiled; foot tapped hard, face red.  So you know I am not happy.  I am actually trying to tell this bartender that we had been waiting long before these folks walked over but he ignored me.  Thank God there was a server that just so happened to be behind the bar when this occurred.  I said, I guess kind of rudely, do you think you could get us a drink?!  He looked at the bartender and kind of shook his head saying he was a server and was trying to get the drinks for his tables but sure.  I said I was sorry but we had been waiting and was completely ignored.  He seemed sympathetic, almost like he was solemnly agreeing out of experience.  We finished the first round and thankfully the same server happened to be behind the bar again.  I asked for two more and our check.  I thanked him profusely and stated I believed they have the wrong person running the bar.  He saved this review from one star.  Great job, wish I knew his name.  Maybe some time I will try them again, but I would steer clear of the bar if that same bartender were working.
Slices=You know, maybe I am a diva or I just expect too much.  But when I get the worst possible service known to anybody, I don't care how good your pizza tastes.I go to Slices from time to time to get my pizza fix.  I always thought that they have great pizza and I love the different varieties that they have.  But I may never go back...ever...So I am in line waiting to be served.  (And when I say waiting, I mean at least 5 minutes with one girl staring at me while she is putting together boxes. )  Finally this guy came up and asked me what I wanted and I said the Tomato Basil and then asked him what pizzas just came out of the oven.  He told me and I said that I would also like a piece of Pepperoni and Mushroom.  I get to the counter and there is only the tomato basil waiting for me.  The girl (who loves her boxes) looked at me and I told her that I also ordered a Pepperoni and Mushroom.  She asked the guy and he said "I don't remember anything"  Ok, whatever.  So he gets a slice.  While I am waiting for that to warm, I told the girl that this was to go.  I am not kidding you she handed me a box and told me to put my pizza in the box.  (The two guys before got theirs boxed for them)  This place, especially the counter, is very small and I don't think it would hurt her to do some customer service and box my pizza.  I am now irritated writing this review.
Long John Silvers=This place has been here for over 25 years. They have had good times and bad times. Right now must be a good time. The place look great, fresh and clean. The service was ok but the manager dude was great. The food was good and they have some decent choices now. We had a fish plate with 2 big filet's, slaw, frys and hush puppies. I had 2 fish tacos and lobster bites. The plate was shared by both kids and they eat the majority of it and liked it. I had the tacos and while there are no good fish tacos in AZ these did alright. I would prefer not so crusty breading though. The lobster bites are fantastic but be sure to share them as the butter flavor get a little over powering and gross after 15 or so. Over all it is better the McDonald's and cheaper.
The Green Owl=Praise be, Madison finally has a vegetarian restaurant! Best of all, The Green Owl fits the bill as a go-to spot whenever you happen to be in town---it's casual, affordable and has a good-sized menu so you can try something new each time you stop by. About 80% of the menu is vegan and all vegan items are labeled. Green Owl also has rotating vegan dessert specials daily. If you're in Madison and you're vegan or vegetarian or just like good food, this place should be at the top of your list.The space itself is lovely: bright; colorful; retro-mod with a bistro-bar ambience. The bar up front is a bit cramped and too close to the front door (a chilly spot in winter) but it'll be great in the summer. Green Owl has a good selection of unusual wines and beers.I do wish that Green Owl was a bit more casual and offered original coffee & tea drinks, so that the space could double-up as a coffee shop as well. I think it would draw people in and (hopefully) steal away customers from less veg-friendly places in that area. It would also save me the hassle of driving a mile down the road to the Williamson Street Co-op to pick up a fresh chai for my frequent trips to/fro Minneapolis to/fro Chicago.I first time I went I had a BBQ jackfruit sandwich with roasted potatoes ($8). The sandwich tasted good on a whole, but was not without flaws. For one thing, there wasn't enough jackfruit---it seemed like only a few small pieces. Secondly, I don't know if mixing coleslaw on the sandwich worked with the smoky-sweet flavor of the barbecue sauce. Lastly, the artisan bread was not toasted enough, and was too thick; I would have preferred a thinner, toasted whole wheat option. The roasted potatoes were a tasty side, though.I also had a slice of coconut creme pie ($6) for dessert. This was spectacular. It was oh-so-subtly sweet, with wonderfully airy "creme" and nice crispy-crumbly notes from shaved coconut and a great crust. The second time I went to Green Owl I had the "vegetarian Italian beef" (which is vegan; $9). This sandwich was excellent and tasted just like Italian beef sandwiches, though with seitan. The bread got nicely soggy and wet and brought back many memories. I think the seitan could have been marinated more in the sauce, but it was a great-tasting meal and much better than the BBQ jackfruit sandwich. I got it with a side of kale crisps, which were also awesome, and not usually seen on menus. The portion size could have been slightly larger given the price, but this was definitely a high-grade meal and well-executed.For dessert I had a slice of New York cheesecake ($6) which came topped with strawberries, whipped cream, caramel drizzle, and one fresh mint leaf. This cheesecake was wonderful and one of the best I've ever had. It was rich, but not too sweet, and the interplay of the caramel, strawberries, mint and whipped cream was divine.On my third visit, I had the vegan schnitzel ($13) which comes with either a soup or salad. The soup was an amazing winter vegetable medley that was quite spicy (probably too much so for most people, but just perfect for me). The schnitzel itself was also spectacular---I've never had real schnitzel, but this was a breaded, meaty marvel covered in a savory mushroom stroganoff-style sauce. I enjoyed the garlic green beans and roasted red potatoes that also came with the dish. For dessert I got a chocolate mousse tart ($6) which came with raspberry sauce and soy whipped cream; this was delicious and the chocolate had a slightly minty flavor. Green Owl consistently does excellent desserts.For the fourth visit I had their crabby cakes sandwich ($9) which was tasty on fluffy white bread. It seemed a bit small for the price tag, but it was still good. On a whole, I would recommend the Italian beef or the schnitzel over anything else (I have yet to try their jambalaya, however). I also had a slice of key lime cheesecake ($6) which was good, and had a nicely browned/baked top layer, though it wasn't as good as the New York cheesecake I'd had a couple months back.The service is always friendly and helpful. On at least two separate occasions my server also got me samples of the other available vegan dessert of the day, which was a great way to help me decide which dessert to choose.Every town should have an all-purpose veg. spot like this one. I'm glad Green Owl is around, though I'm afraid it'll prevent me from ever trying other places in Madison!i hate to admit it. but i'm more impressed with the seasonal cocktails, the charming decor and the waitstaff than the actual food the restaurant provides.still, i think this place offers an excellent and much-needed service to the vegetarian/vegan crowd.Second time here, and still a fail. I want SO BADLY to like this restaurant. As a vegetarian, it can be hard to find good options at restaurants. However, for me, Green Owl falls flat on flavor and originality.Last go around, I had the TLT (tempeh instead of bacon) and kale chips. The TLT was just boring to me, and the kale chips too bitter (although, note that I'm spoiled by the chips I make at home).This go around, I tried the veggie chili and stuffed bell pepper. The chili was full of chunky tomatoes and some onions, but I only found 2 chili beans. The flavor was tomatoey without much spice (if any?). The stuffed bell pepper also had very little flavor, and I couldn't find any almonds or raisins in it (as the menu indicated). It would have been delicious with a variety of different spices, but instead was just another tomatoey-flavored soft mess. My table mates doused their food heavily with salt to make up for the flavor...I couldn't bring myself to add all that msg when some red pepper, cumin, cilantro, ginger, dear-god-anything would really have been amazing!For those who are vanilla eaters and don't like any sort of spice, this might be your perfect cup of tea. Or, if you're in to all the fake meats--most of the menu options involve fake meats. However, I'd rather eat something that isn't trying to be some meat entree. I'd rather my vegetarian meal stand on its own, as something delightfully yummy for what it is (not what it's trying to be). A focus on vegetables would be a nice touch, too...love my veggies! Vedge restaurant in Philadelphia is fantastic, for comparison...Oh, Green Owl, good luck...I want to try you and like you. I'll keep an eye on the menu to see if anything changes!There's a reason why the two-three star reviews of disappointed palates and deflated wallets share the same webspace as the five-star reviews that seem to feature broken capslock buttons, and read like they're taken out of an eBay customer satisfaction survey:You have to know what you're getting into when you come here.As the proprietor herself put it, The Green Owl seeks to:"...Please vegetarians and vegans--both those who gave up eating meat long ago and those who sometimes still miss it--as well as meat-eaters who eat out with their vegetarian/vegan family members and friends."Being Chinese, I'll proceed to do the math for you (and enjoy it!) as to what follows logically from that mission statement:Food:This restaurant is in no way a celebration of vegetarianism, veganism, or what distinct flavor profiles or textures vegetables themselves can offer.  Whereas Asian cultures, all with a high level of Buddhist influence, celebrate the many variations of tofu like Westerners celebrate cheese (there is popular franchise restaurants in China featuring Buddhist cuisine; all tofu, all the time), this place is expressly trying to make vegetation derived proteins and fibers resemble meat.In that respect, you can expect your "sloppy joe" or "fish sandwich" to undergo a bit more processing than a meat-based equivalent, to achieve the same desired goal.  Kind of analogous to how much makeup a drag queen needs to put on, in comparison to someone who is female to begin with; in our case, well the flavor just depends on if you notice the eggplant's Adam's apple or not.Money:All that vegetable makeup doesn't come cheap!  The irony is never lost on the Engineer in me that even though there's a roughly 10:1 conversion of pounds vegetation to pounds of meat, you can end up paying so much more for the vegetable "equivalent" (debatable, see above.).Atmosphere:If you're a vegetarian or vegan, you've probably already noticed that there tends to be a bit more malnourished rhetorical bravado within your demographic (skinny hipsters).  You're going to get those here.  In fact, you will probably be seated next to one, and he will probably be having a very opinionated conversation with himself (that his "friends" are forced to listen while they wonder why they bothered to go to dinner with this guy anyway) about why the wine this place serves isn't as baseball-glove-flavoured as another vintage.  I'm almost exaggerating, but this guy ruined my appetite more than the food ever could.Desserts:These babies deserve a separate section all their own.  Thankfully many desserts may use animal-based products, but at least they don't need to feature them.  In that respect, this place really shines for desserts.  Anything off of the dessert menu can stand in its own right, and there is no noticeable flavor nor texture difference between the vegetarian and vegan offerings.  They are also tastier and more unique than many offerings I've had at slightly more "upscale" foodie establishments in Madison.  Hell, I think this place may receive better reviews if it just became a completely vegan dessert shoppé.Director's Cut:My opinions of this location are tempered with the fact that I was a vegetarian for two short, hungry years, and I did it out of stubbornness for my best friend, who was one for most of her life, out of sheer love for animals (took me to a county fair, made me hug a piglet, told me to think about him whenever I wanted bacon).In that respect, I disliked this place, seeing its menu offerings as an affront to my stubbornness.At the same time, stubbornness can only last so long, and this place was absolutely amazing to my bestie, who's spent much, much longer than I have walking by every other brat and burger joint Madison has to offer.So there you have it, take a look at the menu ahead of time, try not to be disappointed by the obvious, cross your fingers that you'll be pleasantly surprised, and if all else fails, jump straight to the dessert!
Mastro's Ocean Club=Delicious! We came for "Linner" and I just wish I was hungrier! At Morel's in the Palazzo, we met the most amazing waiter and totally chatted it up with him. He let us know that he also works at Mastro's Ocean Club so we also had to go visit him there...This restaurant is gorgeous to look at and basically looks like a tree house with the Crystal's shopping area of City Center. It's gorgeous!We started with amazing cappuccinos in the bar area since our favorite waiter, Dion, was not quite ready yet. I noticed that a cocktail that one girl in the bar was drinking was "smoking"... I think they put dry ice in it for effect!When we were seated for lunch, we ordered the fried onion strings as an appetizer and the escargot. The bread including "pretzel bread" was a great appetizer too. The onion string serving size was HUGE and could have fed about 8 people. The escargot were in amazing sauce that I dipped my bread into afterward! Then, I ordered the Cobb salad that came with a generous serving of huge prawns; it was delicious! He had the sea bass with the light bread crumb preparation and it was also amazing! We also shared the house mashed potatoes that included scallions, bacon, etc mixed in and were rich and delicious. What a fabulous late lunch/early dinner on the way to the airport! It was tough to leave Vegas after an amazing meal like that though!Excellent Came here with a party of 30 so I got to sample everything. We reserved their private dining room and it was fantastic. Service was great, the room was perfect because we could be as loud as we wanted, and the food stole the show. Must have....... would be their seafood platter. It's a 3 tier platter that comes with dry ice giving that smoky, cloudy look. It came with oysters, shrimp, king crab legs, and lobster over a bed of shaved ice. The bone in rib eye, bone in Kansas city, and bone in fillet were all perfectly cooked and seasoned. Do not get the fish here. The sea bass was a little overcooked and dry. Then again, why the hell would you order fish at a steakhouse? Lobster mashed potatoes was great but not when this cost more than the entrees. I was told that this dish was featured in Entourage and a few other magazines. We celebrated 8 birthdays so the staff gave us 8 individual desserts which was very nice of them. Their butter cake was to die for. My God that was good. Their bread pudding and apple crisp were also very delicious.I've dined at many a Mastro's, and I must admit: this location hooked me (and my rumbling stomach) + a pal for lunch because I found it architecturally intriguing. The staff in the front of the house were still very wet behind the ears. I was asked, "Is there any special occasion that you're celebrating? Anniversary, birthday...?" I replied that I am a living kidney donor and I celebrate that every day. My response didn't even register with the hostess and there wasn't any acknowledgment at all. *shrug* People have birthdays every year; it's not that often you have the privilege of donating a kidney. Just saying. I'm a sucker for waitstaff in white jackets; there's something very genteel about it that I absolutely adore, though the ambiance was a bit odd - the skylights above took away some of the mystery and glamour that one might otherwise enjoy over dinner. All the better to admire the lines and the strange view that our perch afforded us. Couldn't help but wonder: because the "pod" is not enclosed by walls, but mesmerizing woodwork that undulates and is breathtakingly organic... do shoppers at the nearby boutiques get distracted by the smells of the kitchen? "Yes, I'd like this limited edition Dior - hold up a minute - I need me a steak! " Surf, turf and couture - pinch me, please, and pass the pretzel bread, I'm wearing a silk shift with an empire waist - Carbonanza!!! The pretzel bread is otherworldly. I ignored the other varieties in the very generous bread basket, and asked for more pretzel bread, which was delivered warm, fluffy and perfectly salted. A healthy slathering of room-temperature butter didn't hurt, either. Even though I don't eat wheat, I was no match for the PB, and just surrendered to each bite of pillowy bliss. My virgin strawberry martini was not as tasty as the high octane version (yes, I had a sippie and was glad I did) and was just too sweet for my palate - but I had to wash all that PRETZEL BREAD down with something, right? Another quirk: there was a phantom lounge singer, who was, to be honest, not good at all... it was almost comical. It took me a while to figure out that it wasn't tongue-in-cheek lounge-lizardy - the dude was actually that schmaltzy. He was playing and singing live... but from an indeterminate location - I think it was behind the blue curtain - but it was just so odd, we kept laughing about it. My crab cocktail was okay... it was fresh and bright, but the last 1/3rd was frozen, because of the ice bath in which it sat. To their credit, when I pointed that out, a fresh one was brought out. The salads were nice. Nothing that knocked my Paul Smith espadrilles off, but I was very pleased that the greens were not drowning in dressing. Nice, simple, tasty. I plan to go again, but will make a reservation for dinner; lighting makes a difference, but then again... Pretzel Bread tastes good at any hour! BELIEVE.Before heading out for a night of partying at XS, my buddy and I found ourselves wandering around the Cosmopolitan looking for a good restaurant to try.  While the rest of our friends were grabbing dinner at the literal hole-in-the-wall pizza counter upstairs, we wanted to take advantage of the opportunity of trying something a little more unique.  Well, that is, assuming we could find somewhere that didn't have a crowd; each of our first few tries were met with wait times of 45 mins or longer.  Hoping for better luck at the mall at City Center next door, we eventually worked our way over to Mastro's Ocean Club to check things out there.  Greeted by a friendly hostess and the opportunity for immediate seating, our search came to an end.  Score for table seating by the bar!For a while now, I've heard a number of good things about Mastro's from friends in LA.  From the service to the food, they've all mentioned how great their experiences were.  At the end of my meal, I could certainly see what they mean.  After perusing through the menu of seafood and steaks, I ended up going with the grilled Chilean Sea Bass with a side order of the Garlic Mashed Potatoes for my friend and I to split (rather, I wanted it for myself, but needed to "share" it to justify getting it).  Now, I know...ordering a fish dish on my first ever trip to Mastro's is pretty counter-intuitive considering their reputation as a steakhouse.  However, given that it's one of their two Ocean Club spots, I figured that maybe I should give the seafood a shot since I don't know if it'll be as readily offered at their pure steakhouse spots.When our orders were brought to our table, I have to admit that it wasn't stunning at first glance.  Although the cut was larger than I had anticipated (which is never a bad thing), there wasn't much in terms of frills and dressing.  Since everything is a la carte, you literally get just the fish on the plate, with half a lemon on the side of seasoning.  Despite how lonely it may have looked though, there's no questioning the quality.  Although Chilean sea bass is generally more forgiving when it comes to cooking because of its fatty nature, this one was done perfectly regardless.  The meat was soft and tender, and it was moist throughout.  Flavor-wise, you couldn't ask for much more - modest seasoning to it, with a great buttery and velvety sort of flavor from the fish.  Excellent.As for our sides, the Garlic Mashed was pretty good.  I liked the consistency (thick, but not gloppy or too thin), and the flavor wasn't too potent.  While I would generally prefer a stronger punch to it, it worked well to not overpower the sea bass.  In addition, my friend also slipped in an order of the skinny fries, and let me tell you - a "basket" of fries here really is a basket of fries.  The order was this huge mound of fried potato goodness, and even after chipping away at it throughout our meal, there was still plenty left for our other friend to snack on when he joined us.  Oh, and I can't forget to mention their bread basket either - all served hot and soft with salted butter.  All of the ones I tried were good, but my favorite was the toast-like bread with cheese...so good.As for the rest of the experience, everything else was spot on.  Our server Sarah was awesome - really attentive, friendly, and pretty damn cute.  Now, I'm sure that last part MIGHT have had something to do with it, but seriously, really cute.  While it's kind of odd that it's located in a mall, I really liked the vibe of the place.  The main dining area is on a sort of a semi-open balcony (check out the pictures...quite a distinctive look), while they have a piano and singer by the bar.  While the music can make conversations a little tough, it's no worse than if you were sitting with a large group. While I do somewhat regret not having ordered beef instead of fish, I have no complaints about what I had either (plus, was still under that damn zero/reduced beef pledge).  That said, I know I'll be back to try more of their menu anyways (saw several tables with the seafood tower), as well as to get a table in their "tree house" section.  Great ambiance for a date as well, and while not a cheap meal, it's certainly worth the price.  But then, that could just be my waitress-induced bias doing the talking too..Thanks to the Mad Hattrix's mouth-watering review of the pretzel bread, Mastro's became my top choice of the perfect Vegas steakhouse to celebrate my steak-loving boyfriend's birthday.Knowing that the restaurant is located in Crystals--a shopping arcade (mall is far too down-market to describe this place) featuring Tiffany, Cartier, and LV--I had a feeling this would be an expensive celebration, and it was, but well worth it.Our table in the treehouse wasn't ready when we arrived, so we sat at the bar and ordered a drink. I thought I was prepared for Vegas prices, but I was wrong. Martinis that cost $18?! But when in Rome ...As our bartender raised the shaker to pour the martini into the oversize martini glass, I noticed that the cocktail shaker itself was about one and half times the size of your regular shaker. That's right, we got about three generous martinis out of that one shaker. Unfortunately, we'd each ordered a martini, which is why the rest of my review will be a bit vague.This Mastro's features a variety of seafood, and you can create your own seafood tower appetizer, even if it's only for one. We passed on a seafood appetizer and ordered a very good Caesar salad, followed by a bone-in rib eye for him and a bone-in filet mignon for me. Our waitress also sold us on the lobster mashed potatoes--1 1/4 pounds of lobster chunks folded into buttery mashies--so we enjoyed some seafood too.Between the monster martini and the addictive pretzel bread (soft with a slightly chewy exterior, sprinkled with salt), I had a hard time saving room for the entree and ended up taking half of it home. But it was one of the best filets I've ever had. Although I love the tenderness of filet mignon, I typically prefer the flavor of a rib eye. Both were excellent, even as leftovers.The restaurant provided a complimentary slice of chocolate cake to mark the occasion. And although it would have been nice if they'd given us their famous butter cake, which they'd talked up, it didn't really matter because I was too full to have even one bite.I guess I'll just have to go back for more pretzel bread and that butter cake. But next time, I'll definitely share a martini--and maybe remember a few more details.How can anyone not love this place?  Amidst Yelp's Spring Break festivities and other dining excursions we had in Vegas, the dining experience at MOC was one of the most memorable.  From the amazing "eighth wonder of the world" tree house we were sitting in, to a generous martini offering, to excellent overall service....it was beyond a five star experience. And I haven't even scratched the surface yet.   With all the eating going on in Vegas, I could have been very content with just their fresh pretzel rolls and a fantastic Campagna Burrata salad.  But I couldn't resist and......order more pretzel rolls.  They were just too addicting....try their Brussel Sprouts.  Lightly salted to perfection....taste the Lobster Mashed Potatoes.  One order can feed an army.  ...sample their Petite Filet.  Medium rare truly melted in my mouth....and savor the Seared Sea Scallops.  Cooked just right with an orgasmic garlic butter sauce. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/GI-CAiZ_Gg3h21PwrANB4Q?select=krtNnXcIArthzdx-FQ1_RA#MwXtyVuKcCbgmgFiZySLuQ)Just when I thought it was over, I was reminded of their infamous Warm Butter Cake for dessert.  So I had to be a teamplayer and try a little.  It was heavenly.  No matter how full we were, dinner was not complete without indulging in this popular dessert...and the accompanying gigantic bowl of whip cream. I discovered that 10 spoonfuls is "just a little taste" when it comes to this cake topped with vanilla ice cream and sliced strawberries. Ay! Their mysterious live piano artist kept us entertained and added a nice touch to the ambiance of not only the restaurant, but around all of Crystals mall. This will not be the last time I dine here, that's for sure. Even though we were running late to a Yelp event, it was well worth it!Good, straight forward fish house / steakhouse.  Best of all, you get to dine in a contemporary "pod" in the middle of Crystals (they call it a tree house, either way its cool).  Unfortunately, because of it's mall location, it doesn't feel like a special occasion, destination restaurant rather  "I'm hungry after all YOUR shopping, oh look, a restaurant, let's eat".With the exception of a few starters and a hand full of mains, you get exactly what the menu says, unadorned. No special sauces, no veg.  Just fish or beef on a plate.  Portions are large.  Unless you're hungry, pass on the starters.  They are traditional (raw bar, seafood cocktails).  You can get them anywhere.  Fish is expertly cooked to order.  The thick cut fillet of pan roasted Chilean sea bass and salmon are excellent.  Cooked medium with no sign of albumin (white substance that comes out of fish if the cooking temperature is too high).  Both were moist and naturally oily, exuding their naked fish flavors.  Good quality prime steaks.  Decent aging.  Good selection of bone in cuts.   Sadly, nothing sets them apart from other quality steakhouses in Vegas.  The bone in fillet is tender, mildly flavored.  No complaints.  For sides, its gotta be the rich and incredibly flavorful, king crab and truffle dressed gnocchi or the lobster mashed potatoes.  Chunks of lobster enveloped in a buttery mash that explodes with lobster flavor.  I could eat either an a main and be happy!  Solid wine list.  Vegas resort pricing.Sometimes "a kiss is just a kiss..."  and that's fine by me.Seems like I've been on a steak kick recently, which makes me realize that my stomach and wallet are inversely proportional. After visiting Gordon Ramsay and Old Homestead recently my gut has increased exponentially while my wallet is shrinking dramatically. Mastros, of course, had the same effect.Our party of four dined family-style and sampled the following:A dozen oysters (Kusshi and Bluepoint). All were delicious but, personally, I prefer the smaller Kusshi.The ahi tuna tartare was beautifully presented in a cylindrical stack with, perhaps, too much avocado, but contained plenty of fresh tuna and a variety of textures and flavors. Ocean Club crab cake. There was very little filler, nice big chunks of lump meat, and a perfectly balanced tartar sauce.The scallops were too rich and buttery and was drowning in sauce. The accompanying toast was deliciously crisp and cheesy.The 22 oz bone-in ribeye, cooked medium-rare, was tender and had a decent amount of fat, as was to be expected. A solid steak, but not as mind-blowing as the beef from the top steakhouses around town.Alaskan king crab black truffle gnocchi. A little dense with a rich, cheesey truffle flavor. Pieces of crab were scarce, but there were plenty of gnocchi for the four of us to share.Alaskan king crab legs. 5 large legs, slightly warm, with clarified butter and lemon. Each yielded plenty of tender meat.That was plenty of food for all of us, but we couldn't leave without trying their infamous warm butter cake. It was large enough for each of us to get a few bites. It came with a ridiculously large side of fresh whipped cream. I was expecting the cake to have a very moist texture, but instead it was a bit more firm with a slightly crispy exterior. The flavor was as sweet and buttery as you would expect. As delicious as it was, it's not something that my arteries and heart can take too frequently.Mastors is pricey, but not as pricey as other steak or seafood houses along the Strip. The atmosphere isn't the greatest either. It is located in the center of a shopping mall, afterall. There's no dim, mood lighting. Just the bright florescent  lights of the mall. The tree house thing looked cool, so request that if you have the chance. We sat just outside of it and it had all the appeal of eating at a food court.There was also live entertainment in the lounge area when we dined. I had to do a double-take because the girl performing looked like Aubrey O'Day. I didn't stick around long enough to see if she had the voice or attitude to match.I'm not sure how this Mastros compares to the ones in California that people rave about, but relative to Vegas steakhouses it's a solid option. It's a step below the top ones in town, but is great for seafood and, of course, the butter cake.After living in Vegas for about a year, this is easily the most disappointing high end meal I've had.  I'd give the food a 4/5 but the service was probably a 1/5.ServiceThe first disappointment was waiting.  We had a reservation and even so I can understand waiting by the bar for a few minutes.  However, we wanted far more than a few minutes.  Our "leader" went up to the front to inquire and they said on someone will be by shortly to seat you.  That didn't happen so we had to check back again and someone gave us the apology of "oh, I'm sorry I thought they came and got you."Maybe a miscommunication, but certainly something that could be excused.  However, things didn't get better from there.  It seems like about 10 minutes from when we seated until we even got drink menus, then another 10-15 before the drinks arrive.  Easily 15 minutes before bread arrived at the table.  It just felt like everything was so slow.  After the first round of drinks came our waitress or waitresses seemingly disappeared.  I mean when you have a table of 10 people ordering rounds of $15 cocktails or better you'd figure service would be fast.  I think they easily missed out on  at least 1 extra round due to the slow service.If you look at the prices at Mastro's and compare it to other places across town, you would expect to have a waiter or waitress that knows the menu back and forth and can describe all of the stars.  We got none of that.  I would say our service was at the level of an average chain restaurant.  You aren't adding any value when you ask about menu items and the waitress just lists 3 things that are "good".  We asked how the steaks come and the reply was something like "what do you mean"?  I mean are they seasoned, sauced, dry aged?  There is no explanation on the menu or listing of sauces or accompaniments for the steaks...."oh yeah, they are seasoned and broiled"....thanks.This was followed up with no description or explanation of any sides.  During the meal we couldn't even locate the waitresses and people were still anxious to get more drinks.I will say that the food was good.  The steak was unique in the regard it was so warm when it came out.  Usually food has somewhat cooled but their steak still had a sizzle and was warm for the first few bites, pretty good.  The asparagus was nothing special.  The lobster mashed potatoes were good but at $40 can be steep for a side dish.  Crab gnocchi was good, but I'm not crazy about gnocchi so I'm not an expert.  The problem in Vegas is that you can find a place equal to Mastro's food wise with probably lower prices so suffering through bad service can be a deal breaker.Needless to say, nobody ordered dessert or drinks after dinner.  With so many other options in town for steak I probably wouldn't come back for that.  I will say I tried the ahi tuna sashimi which seemed great for under $40.  I didn't try it but the swordfish looked the same.  I would come back if I was in the mood for seafood but would be nervous about the service, maybe with a smaller party and a better table things would be better.My favorite place to dine in Las Vegas!(1) Service - I forgot his name but awesome, awesome server! Best service ever. He was hot too! Drools! 5 stars for amazing service and seating me with a hot server.(2) Seafood Tower - massive shrimp, king crab, lobster, three types of oysters, and massive mouth jizzy. (3) Bone-In Ribeye - mouth jizz... must get! 5 stars(4) Lobster Mash Potato - one of my favorite dishes. Drenched in BUTTER... yum! 5 stars(5) Asparagus - well cooked! 5 stars!(6) Bone Marrow - 5 stars!(7) Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi - 5 stars(8) Birthday Chocolate Cake - I got this for free... so sweet of them... but it wasn't my birthday... I think they gave it to the wrong person.(9) Coffee - a little weak... I wanted a strong one... so I can get ready for the clubbb... yeahhhhh... woots!OVERALL** Yup! That was all for 2 people... haha! I eat a lot! Massive bill... but worth every of my penny!I just can't say that I am a fan of this famous steakhouse, but hubby is definitely a fan of their steak, so still 4 stars, the service was over the top, the restaurant is classy and beautiful. Decided to have anniversary dinner there, we asked to be seated at one of those window tables in the tree house, our host managed to get us one, very nice of her. Started off with bottle of French champagne, loved it, the bread basket was so delicious, just too much for 2 people, it could easily feed up to 5 people seriously! The hard part was to order, the entire meat section is out, that's pretty much all of the items on the menu. Saw seafood and sushi choices, a bit relieved really, glad I am usually a Pesce at nice restaurants, otherwise I would have nothing to order except salads or some sides, that would be miserable at a nice restaurant, wouldn't it ? Our server introduced lots of things, we decided to do chilled seafood platter first, a little bit of everything on the platter: The presentation of the platter was amazing, smokes came out of the prawns container, so beautiful and appetizing. The Kumamoto oysters were so good, the lobster claw meat was fairly tender. But the other things in there were bad, the crab & lobster meats were so hard and chewy, the prawns were even harder. They were hard to cut, even harder to swallow, we didn't finish them, so wasteful... The horseradish and cocktail sauces were so good, added nice flavors to chilled seafood. Clam chowder soup with garlic bread: our server was so nice to split the soup for us, even though we didn't ask so, the soup was still huge after splitting, too bad I didn't want any soup, so I just gave it to hubby, kinda felt bad for our server's thoughtful gesture. Lobster roll: had it as my entree, it was bad, really? The rice was thick, the stuffing was not that flavorful, I didn't like the cream sauce came with it, I had one and half pieces, and stopped eating. 12 oz bone in filet in medium rare: the plate was 400 degrees hot! Perfectly cooked to medium rare, the steak melted in hubby's mouth right away, he said it tasted amazing! Absolutely loved every single bite of it! Mushroom side: I love mushrooms so much, but those mushrooms were flavorless, they were just not that good. I had one bite, that's it. So, either my taste buds were numbed from too much drinking? Or Mastro's is really just for steak lovers? My food was just bad... I didn't even eat that much, just sat there , sip on my champagne, and tried very hard not to fall asleep in the middle of a dinner date.... They gave us anniversary chocolate cake with a lit candle, so beautiful, and a huge plate of whipped cream too. The cake was so good, both of us loved it, so yummy! I had a 20 -yr -old tawny ($27) to go with it, it was amazing. It's a famous steakhouse, of course it's pricey. Reserved wine list starts at $100 a bottle, up to 10 thousand. Tab was $350 for two. To be honest, I didn't like my food, dinner experience was good, I was just too sleepy to really enjoy it. Their restroom located upstairs next to private dining room, the elevator to upstairs was claustrophobic. And I don't think this place is good for dinner date, food is too much for two people, impossible to finish everything. The restaurant is too bright, not intimate at all. But it's great for family, group dining, or steak lovers!I made reservations for dinner on a Thursday evening and my hotel was nearby so I was able to walk here. I heart the decor of the tree house dinning which we were seated at. See it: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mastros-ocean-club-las-vegas?select=VeYIzprrIievG0x5eYXb7Q#VeYIzprrIievG0x5eYXb7Q This Mastro's has three levels dinning areas and tree house is on the second floor with views of the Crystal mall.  Ordered a a bottle of Napa Cabernet Sauvignon after the yummy bread basket arrived. Followed with the iceberg wedge salad which contained smoked maple bacon and chunks of blue cheese - refreshing and so yummy. For the main entree I opted for the 22 oz bone in rib eye - cooked medium rare and a side of the Alaskan King crab black truffle gnocchi. As with every Mastro's I've dined at, the food and service were impeccable. If you're a fish eater check out the Chilean sea bass here, it was incredibly fresh and delicious. We ended the meal with the chocolate sin cake which was moist and a perfect ending to conclude the meal. Even though Mastro's was bought out last year, the quality and service in my opinion are at the top tier of the industry. BTW, have a beverage in the bar before or after dinner for some interesting people watching.Thank you to the entire staff at the Las Vegas Mastro's for an awesome dinning experience!I have eaten at this location more times than I can remember.  I adore the gorgeous setting in Crystals, part of City Center in Vegas and  I love sitting at the opulent marble bar and enjoying a glass of wine.  The bartenders on this particular night were a little busy so we were not getting the service we usually would expect, but it was still good.  We ordered oysters for the appetizer.  As always, fresh and delicious!  The seafood here is consistently fresh and perfectly prepared. I have never had the steak, but people rave about that as well.  Mastros, you never let me down.  Next time I am home, I shall visit you.For starters I really wanted to give this place a great review because the food was good, but after receiving my bill I just can't do it.Our total bill came up to $243.23. That's not my complaint. My complaint is that we left a cash tip and when we saw the charge on the card, it was for $291.88. I'm glad I kept my receipt.This prompted a call from me to the restaurant today to find out why there was an additional $47.00 charged to my card without disclosing it to me. The manager told me that the company they use AUTOMATICALLY adds a 20% gratuity to the bill. This was not disclosed to us by the waitress. It was not disclosed on our receipt. In fact, when I called, he said they receive that complaint at least 5 times a day, as if that's the normal order of business. FIX IT if people are complaining. You have no right to charge them an additional 20% without disclosing this BEFORE  they eat.Tips are VOLUNTARY, not mandatory unless disclosed. I leave my tips in cash and I always cross out the tip line on the receipt.  The money isn't the issue,its the principle that they have no right to take my money without my permission. That is basically theft. So now, I have to wait 2-3 business days for the additional $47 to be refunded to my card, which means I won't see my money until Tuesday or Wednesday, since we ate there Friday night. Other than this absurd experience with my bill, here is a review on the food.1) The customer service is great except for not disclosing that I'll be charged an additional 20% even if you leave a cash tip.2) The  crab cakes were good, but both my wife and I had a small piece of shell. Nothing worth complaining about.3) My wife had the blackened ribeye. It was delicious.4) I had rack of lamb. it was delicious.5) Twice baked potato was good.6) Gorgonzola mac & cheese was good.7) Clam chowder was good.8) Calamari was just OK.9) The complimentary bread was mostly hard except for the pretzels. I don't mind a mix of breads, but when the majority are hard, its just not for us. Overall, the food was good, but we will not be going back until the change they policy of charging people an additional 20% without their knowledge.If you eat here PAY CASH.I've been fascinated by this "tree house" for the longest. This was my first time visiting Mastro's and I had long heard of the famous warm butter cake, so I was excited to come for a pharm. rep dinner, get to learn and try a new place. We made our selections from a pre-set menu.My first course I went with the Caeser Salad, this was pretty standard except for the bits of anchovie throughout, which is my favorite kind of Caeser. For my entree I chose the 8oz filet. I asked for it to be prepared medium. What came out was between rare and tartare. Since we were in a small private dining room for the lecture, I didn't feel comfortable sending my steak back, it would be disruptive, and I didn't want to interupt the lecturer. I ended up giving it to my friend to take home to her dogs.The family style shared sides weren't impressive either. Mashed potatoes had no flavor, and the sugar snap peas as well. Only one I liked was the creamed spinach. Dessert we had a choice between chocolate sin cake and cheesecake. I went with the chocolate cake, it came with a side of homemade whipped cream which I thought was better than the cake itself. Pretty disappointing meal all together. I would come back for a second try, just not in a hurry to do so. I definitely enjoyed the lecture more than dinner.I brought clients here on a Thursday evening for dinner around 800 pm. I recommend reservations since  the place gets busy. My clients who arrived from Denver around a year ago and never experienced Mastro's previously so I knew they were in for a treat.We started off with drinks at the table  once we were  seated and were brought the awesome bread basket -  I indulged in the pretzel bread yum! We ordered a few appetizers - scallops, crab cakes and ordered our starter salads. I opted for just the 1/2 salad of the iceberg wedge - it's plenty large and so yummy. For my main entree I went for he rack of lamb and we shared several twice cooked potatoes and cream spinach. Everything was spectacular and the service was stellar! My lamb was cooked to perfection and  my clients were impressed as I expected. The only con was nobody had room for buttercake!I received a telephone call from Mastrro's the following day thanking me for my business which again is so out of the box. I'm happy to see even with the change of ownership that nothing has changed here!*** Word of warning: this steakhouse is located inside a mall and you will most likely have a view of a high-end store while you eat. *** Typically, I'm a huge fan of Mastro's and every time we are celebrating a special occasion, we will pay a visit to Mastro's. Unfortunately I was a little disappointed in the Vegas location. I will start with the pros. The food was sublime. It was exactly the quality of food Mastro's provides at their locations in Phoenix. I started with the Ocean Club Salad which came with fresh shrimp with blue cheese dressing, avocado and tomatoes. The salad was refreshing and delicious and filled me up! However, I wasn't done just yet. Following the salad, I ordered the crab cake and shared the lobster mac and cheese with my husband. The crab cake was made of fresh crab and was more crab than filling which was perfect. The Lobster Mac and Cheese is always a must and you can't visit Mastro's without ordering it! I also stole a bite of my husband's filet which was cooked to perfection. Yes, I did roll out of the restaurant but rolled out fat and happy from the amazing food! They cook everything to perfection and it's always a gluttonous good time. So why the three stars? Sadly, that goes to ambiance and service. The restaurant in located inside a mall. Granted, it's a very high-end mall but it's still a mall just the same. That wouldn't make a huge difference except that the restaurant has an open floor plan with an open balcony which means you are looking out into the mall while you eat. It's very light and bright and just doesn't provide for a very romantic experience. They do have a tree-like structure that you can eat in which hides the mall a little bit, but it's hard to forget that you're in a mall during your meal. Considering that it's Vegas and there are so many venues with wonderful ambiance, I would choose another restaurant next time. The customer service was also a bit disappointing. I felt like we were always trying to get our server's attention. He wasn't very attentive to us and anytime we wanted to order another drink or food, we had to hunt him down. We were going to order dessert but it took him so long to check on us that by the time he came to our table, we were just ready to go at that point. I would have liked it if the server was a bit more attentive so that we didn't have to track him down the whole meal. While the food was amazing, the ambiance and service left something to be desired and since Vegas has so many restaurants to choose from, we will choose a different restaurant during our next visit to the Strip.Mastro's was the capstone in a hedonistic tour-de-force of eating and drinking, and oh what an excellent climax it was! We set up dinner reservations for 6:30 prior to a 9:45 flight that would get us the hell out of Vegas; while it wasn't the best idea in terms of timing, we were just super eager to eat at Mastro's and couldn't cram it in earlier in the trip.We were seated in the middle of the big floating wooden structure, which was excellent for the view and being in the middle of all the hustle and bustle of the restaurant (something I really like). Our waiter was excellent; he made us feel at ease and happily answered all our questions about ordering.The first order of business? A nice bottle of wine. Fortunately, they had several wines in the $60 range that I like and pair nicely with both fish and meat (keeping our options open :-) ). We chose the 2009 Grgich Hills Merlot, and sat around merrily sipping until our starters came.The Seared Albacore with Truffle (see the picture) was really damn good. I could have eaten two plates of that and been happy. The Tuna Tartare was good, but not amazing. Yep, I've dinged it for "not being amazing". We went in all different directions for main course: one bone-in steak, one cooked fish dish, one sashimi tuna dish. All were excellent. The sides were excellent. Everything was excellent. See a pattern?Somewhere in the middle of the main course we ran out of wine and unconsciously ordered another! Why not go out with a bang.The hour was winding down, our stomachs at near capacity, and fears of the implications of missing our flight creeping in, yet we got dessert. The Warm Butter cake. Dude. Best part of the meal. Might have been the best part of the weekend. Don't go without it.Thanks Mastro's for an awesome dinner. I'll be back next time I'm in Vegas.He always said we should have a nice proper steak dinner.  But every single time I'm in town, we end up skipping the whole steak thing.  But this time, his boyfriend had a client to impress, so we off we went on a steak dinner.  Yay me!Anyhow, since it is rare back home in Honolulu to find a filet with bone in, that's what they got.  Myself, because my eating habits have changed (boo!!) I opted for the petite filet.  I know, sad, right?  I got 8 ounces of meat!  Not the 12 ounces they ordered.  I got my meat rare, cold center, hot plate.  Mmmm I just love a good piece of meat especially when you can control how you're gonna receive it.  I got it just the way I want it, which is actually hard to come by.  I'll take it the way I want it.  He says out loud, "you think you know a person," when I ordered my meat rare.  Oh, honey, you've known me for how many years now, and you still don't know how I like my meat?  As rare as can be is how I like it and I got a true piece of meat perfection.  You know that I ate all of it!  I love me some meat!The rest of the dishes were typical.  Salads, soups, sides were just regular, nothing extraordinarily spectacular to really write about.  The portions for those items are generous, I must say.  We did order a bottle of wine to go with dinner.  I think it was a shiraz.  I didn't pick it out, but it did go well with dinner.  And since it was their birthday, there was dessert.  Not 1, but 2, since two of them were celebrating.  One was a butter cake and the other a chocolate cake.  How nice, right?  We couldn't finish the desserts, but I must say they were very rich and of course yummy.Would I return again?  Most definitely!  It's good that this place was a nice walk from our hotel.  I sure am glad that they are open late, since my eating habits were out of wack.  I love me some meat!!Dinner in a treehouse! It was my first time visiting Mastro's located in the shops at Crystals.  This beautiful and elegant dining can be seen while walking through.  The 'treehouse' as they call it sits directly in the center so it's very hard to miss.  The wooden structure will catch your eye in a heartbeat.  We made reservations for our group and were seated early.  I would like to give a tremendous thank you to Paul our waiter.  I don't think I've ever been so entertained while receiving the best service anyone could ask for.  He went above and beyond to make our evening memorable. The table is brought a bread basket which has 3 options. I will say their pretzel bread called my name.  I asked for more in which Paul graciously brought an entire basket of just those.  Fantastic! I started with the wedge salad.  Perfect and delicious.  The crumbled bacon had a great flavor combined with the creamy blue cheese.  For my entree I chose the Chilean Sea Bass accompanied by creamed spinach, Gorgonzola mac and cheese and Alaskan king crab black truffle gnocchi.  Of course all of the sides are huge and were shared between all of our group.  The sea bass was so light, fresh and baked perfectly.  The gnocchi was a disappointment.  I don't think there were any crab pieces in this. But the other two sides definitely made up for it.  They were so creamy.  Anything with Gorgonzola will make me happy. Simply delicious!If the appetizer, bread basket or main meal didn't fill you up, they have a great dessert list.  On top of that list is their signature butter cake.  It's topped with vanilla bean ice cream with strawberry drizzled around the cake.  It's calorie free and fat free... In my dreams! It's moist and delectable.  After the huge meal, I would suggest splitting this huge cake.  Mastro's delivered an impeccable meal with first class service.  It was surely a memorable evening!I'm so disappointed to write this review.  We had such high expectations of Mastro's having been to their other locations.  Celebrating our wedding anniversary and completely giddy, we sat down, ordered cocktails and dove into the incredible bread basket.  Our waiter seemed annoyed with us from the start, but no big deal, we ignored it.  I ordered chicken (please spare me the "you don't order chicken at a seafood place" lecture...I ordered it because it was on the menu, so let's get through that, k? Lol).  Our waiter was non-existent all evening, so he wasn't around at all for me to tell him that the chicken was glaringly under-cooked.  The manager happened to see us looking around and took it back to the kitchen.  He brought the same re-cooked piece back, but one spot (it was a really thick piece) still didn't look ok.  We had the flash light out and kinda debated if it was cooked enough, but the chance of eating slightly under-cooked chicken and getting sick was not an appealing option to me.  (And should I be having this debate at such a fine restaurant?).  I decided not to chance it, but not say anything.  The manager saw me not eating (our waiter was still in abandonment mode), took it away and insisted on replacing it with a filet.  The filet came out and was delicious and we were happy, albeit the mood had changed.  We felt like we had done something wrong.  Honestly, our least favorite meal of the whole weekend.  No butter cake, no second drinks--happy anniversary to us.  :(Thank you to the manager for not charging us for my chicken or filet and really trying to fix it, but I'm so sad we spent our anniversary there.The fourth new discovery that was a five-star worthy dining experience was at Mastro's Ocean Club.  I had heard good things about this place for at least two years, and before then espied its distinctive wooden bird's nest with admiration at its quite innovative and modern design just before the restaurant's opening inside The Shops at Crystals.It was the day of our 25th wedding anniversary, and our request for seating inside the nest was granted.  It actually felt like being two young birds sheltered inside a protective nest.  Not only that, but we were surprised at meal's end with a complimentary Warm Butter Cake ala mode, Mastro's signature dessert.  This was a great mouth-watering end to a very memorable meal, as the soft cake seemed to melt in the mouth. But the beginning of our meal was no less auspicious.  After enjoying a bread basket that included large homemade pretzel breadsticks, Diane and I dove into succulent hot Vanilla Battered Shrimp.  These big crustaceans bursting with flavor really deserve to be called "prawns" rather than "shrimp," and did deliver a taste of vanilla in the light batter--but not overpoweringly so.For our main we each ordered an 8-oz Filet, which here is called a "Petite Filet," along with 1-1/2 lbs. of Alaskan King Crab Legs.  Both tender steaks were cooked perfectly medium rare as ordered, and with little char on top.  Accompanying Bearnaise Sauce was drinkable, and a Peppercorn Sauce was not far behind.  The hot and long sections of crab legs were pulled out of the pot at exactly the right moment  and presented as already opened legs, so no prying with tools was necessary.  They tasted great dunked in warm drawn butter.  And while Diane praised her large and cheesy Twice Baked Potato, I delighted in a huge mound of skinny Sea Salt & Vinegar Fries, which was reported to be a small rather than regular-sized version.  Sauteed Mushrooms were lovely, too, but I hardly needed them.  We were stuffed.  With a ratio of about one waiter for every four guests, service was great.  Our knowledgeable and conscientious server checked on us several times, and water refills were regularly poured without any need to request them.  Even with the restaurant packed with guests, the ambiance inside the bird's nest section of the restaurant was romantic, intimate, and classy.Mastro's is pricey to be sure.  But, executing well at delivering artfully prepared high-quality offerings from both land and sea, there is a reason why several local diners in the know call this one of the best restaurants in Las Vegas.  Without question we will soon become repeat guests.
Garden Pizza=I usually try to check out a restaurants health inspection before I go there...this time I did not. The pizza was alright, nothing special, my daughter wanted to go because I think she liked the guy behind the counter. Anyway, after going home and looking them up I discovered they have failed their last 2 inspections for things like debris on their meat slicer, food not at correct temps, and worst of all there was indication that they were either smoking in the kitchen, smoking outside with the kitchen door open, or both. This is unacceptable to me that employees of a food establishment would even think this was ok...here is the link to look them up and other restaurants http://www.maricopa.gov/envsvc/envwebapp/business_search.aspx?as_page_title=Food%20Establishments%20Search&as_type=FoodWe have ordered pizza to go a couple times from Garden Pizza and have enjoyed it, but recently we decided to stop in for dinner. I have a whole new opinion of the place since then. I really enjoyed the staff who were extremely welcoming to us and all of the patrons they interacted with. We ordered a large meat pizza which was huge! My husband can eat pizza so I was shocked when we had several pieces left. We were also happy to see the pizza and wing combos that are available. I ordered a glass of wine which turned out to be a mug of wine (did I mention I love this place) for $3.50. It's close to our house and an amazing local business. They also have awesome salads. We will definitely be back!
Jersey Mike's Subs=Yo!  30 freakin' minutes from the time I walk in the door til' I'm draggin' my keester back out.  That don't sound half bad until you figure I didn't eat yet!  Yo!  I ain't yankin' your sausage either!  30 minutes through the line and waitin' for the freakin' food!I called ahead and they said it would be faster to just come in!  How you like that?  Then I get back to the office and one of the freakin' sandwiches ain't even what I freakin' ordered!  You gotta be freakin' kiddin' me!This was a one star review until the sandwich was pretty good, know what I'm sayin?Hey, did you talk to da guy about dat thing?  You know dat thing I told you about?
Restaurant Atti Montreal=It's definitely one of the best Korean restaurant in montreal. I had the typical dish at this bibimbap recommended by my colleagues who had been there many times. I had the beef variant with atti sauce. The food was delicious. It is so fresh and the special atti sauce makes the difference. The food comes with soup, kimchi and salad. It was worth every penny. In the lunch hour don't miss out the drinks for $3. It's the only place where I find it so cheap. Cheap and "the best" Korean food.
Kous Kous Cafe=This was my second visit to this tiny restaurant on the main drag in Mt Lebanon.  I had been once before a couple years ago for dinner but decided to try lunch while in the area.  I had ordered a tagine for dinner and wasn't in love with it.  It was really heavy as I recall even though I had ordered chicken.  It was awhile ago but I can remember thinking it was expensive and not brilliant.  I ordered the appetizer platter for lunch and it was absolutely terrific.  It had a black bean hummus, vegetable hummus, roasted vegetables and an eggplant dish.  It was served with a small side salad minty and lightly dressed and surrounded by a fortress of grilled pita wedges.  We were going to go to Aladdins but their pita is thin and looks and tastes like shoe leather.  This pita was really nice.   It had a grilled flavor and was a quality product.  The hummus were great.  I loved the vegetable hummus, it was spicy and nicely seasoned.  Everything on the plate was delicious.  I would definitely come back and try some more.  I should have given them another chance years ago.Very tiny and cramped space, so go early or make a reservation, and hope that you're not seated near the door, as there is nothing between you and the winter wind when it's opened. The food here is made from scratch and very fresh, and I very much enjoyed my lunch of house salad and soup of the day, which was a tangy and delicious tomato bisque. The salad is very lightly dressed with a minty vinaigrette and was tasty. I would go with the veggie sampler next time, as my husband ordered ti and it was great. I have had the chicken tagine and found it swimming in a little too much oil for my taste. Great place to go if you're a vegetarian.For just under 16 dollars, my mom and I enjoyed traditional Moroccan food made from scratch and drizzled in love.Kous Kouse has simple decor and limited seating, but from the moment you enter - the staff here will go out of their way to make sure that you feel welcome.My mom ordered the tomato soup of the day and I ordered the salmon tagine with fragrant rice.The tomato soup was made that day and my mom adored it. It was creamy and rich with flavor. My salmon tagine was exceptional. It was made in a clay pot and the salmon was tender and soaked up the tagine sauce nicely. There was a great array of accompanying vegetables and the rice - though small in portion was spiced and melted in the mouth.Leading up to our meal - we could see their chef preparing everything with precision and care. Everything was made there and on the spot - and though it can be a little slow at times - it's because the food is fresh and not re-heated.My mom and I were tempted to order dessert, but being that we were under a tight schedule - we thanked their kind chef and efficient waitress and headed back into the Mount Lebanon cold.Kous Kous is definitely worth trying. The number of other dishes that I saw being put together while we waited for ours' all looked delicious and were presented beautifully.Trust.

Try the burgers.  This location is located near the MGM and Ross Dress for Less.  Look for the giant electric guitar.  As a bonus, at any given time of day, you'll see your favorite celebrity impersonators out front.3.5 STARSCame here for a little get together for my company over the weekend. We had a private room on the third floor as a get together and served buffet style!GRUB*Tex-Mex Salad (okay)*Asian inspired Salad (pass)*Mash Potatoes (yum!)*Mac & Cheese (uber yum!)*Pulled Pork + Dinner Rolls (yum!)*BBQ Chicken (okay)SERVICE+ Awesome service from staff members! Thank you for tending to everyone's drink requests!The facility was clean and the set up was quite nice. I wouldn't mind recommending a group party here if you're looking for a venue! It's on the strip and nearby the MGM!This review is for the place as a venue. I've been here before for a Yelp elite event and Motley Brews, but I caught a show ( ill.gates - church of bass) here recently. This HRC is one level retail, second a restaurant and the third floor is a music venue. I  like that it's a decent sized but still intimate. There's a large patio if you want some air as well which has a nice view of the whole strip. I am a old crab and in the back by the bar is a raised area with seating. I can't do this whole standing and squashed onto people type business anymore so when there is seating, I am way more happy. Sound is pretty good in here but depends on the setup can get loud in a small space. It was a fairly decent place for a beer fest, given that it wasn't too busy but this can be a clusterfuck if it was double the amount of people. Overall, good non club venue for music. (Yelp 100 Challenge 4/100)It's a pain in the ass to get to (as is everything on the strip) but it's worth the hike for locals cause this place has the coolest local bartenders and supports local music! Plus it's a great place to see a show cause, contrary to the convenience factor of getting there, its on the strip! Tip: park at Monte Carlo for free and walk over to avoid parking fees in the garage connected to it ;) And try the breakfast quesadilla, its magically delicious
Chipotle Mexican Grill=On the whole, I'd give the Chipotle chain a solid three and a half stars. The burritos are big, the food is dependable, it's easy to customize, and things are surprisingly tasty for being a subsidiary of McDonald's. The reason this review gets one star is the horrible customer service and a fairly major flub on their part. This location is fairly busy, so I placed my order online so I could just go in and pick it up. I ordered a vegetarian burrito and chips & guac. Started with some chips, then moved on to my burrito. Took a bite and got a mouthful of chicken - not so pleasant when you order a VEGETARIAN burrito. Now, I'm not a vegetarian, but I'm not a super-big fan of meat, especially when I'm not expecting it to be there. If I was a vegetarian, I'd have been pissed. The receipt said veg and the wrapper had my name written on it, so I should have been reasonably confident that my burrito was not going to contain meat. I'm fairly easy-going, so if my burrito had otherwise been what I ordered, I would have just sucked it up and gone with it - I'd already driven there once. Unfortunately, it wasn't - whatever combination of fillings they put in the burrito was really unappealing to me.My unexpected meaty mouthful put me off my appetite for a burrito, so I decided to just finish my order of chips & guac and call it a day. I was meeting friends shortly and I didn't have time to drive back to Chipotle, wait in line while they made me another burrito, then eat. I needed to gas up the car, so I decided I'd just bring the burrito back for a refund and go to the gas station across the street. Upon my return, I went up to the register and explained to the cashier what happened. She was very apologetic and did her best to help me out - five stars for her. She went in the back to talk to the manager, and came back to offer to remake the burrito correctly since chicken and veggie burritos cost the same. I politely told her no thank you, and that I just wanted my money back. She disappeared into the back again, and came back to tell me the manager would be out in a minute. By the time the manager finally came out front, about 15 minutes had passed since I first talked to the cashier. This should have been a quick in and out. While at the register, the manager completely ignored me. Literally. No eye contact. I had expected her to ask me why I was returning my food and maybe offer in some way to "make it right" - at the very least an apology and maybe something more along the lines of a coupon/free drink/etc, seeing as how I had to come in twice, she kept me waiting forever, and, you know, I had been served meat in a vegetarian entree. Nope. She didn't say a single word to me and didn't so much as give me a glance. She inspected my burrito to make sure I wasn't making it up, fumbled with the cash register for a few minutes, then handed me my cash with a "thank you" and walked away - all very huffy and like it was a huge burden for her to push a few buttons on the cash register. There is no shortage of burrito places in town, including other Chipotle locations, so I doubt I'll be motivated to come back to this particular location ever again.*sniff* I can't believe I was made to cry (on the inside) no less on New Year's Eve. My hubby and I came here thinking we would split a burrito since I know how big the burritos can be at Chipotle.  We waited in line. I watched the two guys in front of me each get 2 tortillas each for their burrito and the girl behind the line really piled on the rice, beans, and their choice of meat. I was thinking, wow, these burritos are even bigger than what I remembered. Then when it came my turn for my burrito, the girl behind the counter took one look at petite me and took out one tortilla and gave me a skimpy serving of rice, beans, and seriously like 5 pieces of meat. I felt so crest fallen.  I looked at the measly portion that was going to be my burrito, I looked at the girl behind the counter and asked why the two guys in front of me got such massive burritos but not me. She just rolled her eyes at me and went on to the next costumer. Boy, was I disappointed. And I checked too with those two young guys in case they paid extra for their mega massive burritos. Nope, same price as what I paid. I seriously wanted to take a photo of my burrito next to theirs cause mine would look like the runt of the litter. It was so pathetically so much smaller in size. I thought maybe it was an off night but from reading the other reviews, many other customers have received the same uneven service. Chipotle corporate, you should take note since as corporate you take such pride in providing a good product and service- that is the Chipotle brand and signature. Well, this particular location is not making the grade. And *sniff* now I know what being an unwanted stepchild feels like. *sniff*.
Contigo Peru=I'd say 4.5 stars. I'm definitely a fan but I don't have enough experience with Peruvian cuisine to know if it's as good as it gets. : )I was first introduced to Peruvian food a week ago and have now been to Contigo Peru 3 times. From what I have come to learn, it is a natural fusion cuisine. There are large populations of different ethnic groups (some major ones being Chinese, Japanese and Italian) in Peru and those influences have all spilled over into the food of Peru. From what I understand, the cuisine of Peru is quite varied and the food served at Contigo Peru is primarily that of Lima.The restaurant itself is great. It's clean and casual and the staff is amazingly nice. They were super helpful on every visit. I can't say enough about them. Over the course of our visits, we had:Lomo Saltado - tender loin beef strips stir fried with onions, tomatoes & french fries served with rice. I understand this is a classic dish. I completely loved it. The stir fry is Chinese influence with tastes of soy sauce. It seemed like total comfort food, even bringing back memories of "chips & gravy" for the Oz folk and maybe even brings poutine to mind? It's kind of a carb fest but it's great. Easily accessible and super tasty. Not spicy at all. The kids loved it too. If you're new to Peruvian food, definitely a good place to start.Saltado Contigo Peru - basically the same as loom saltado with shrimp. Also great.Yuca con frita huancaina - slices of deep fried yucca root with a cheese and aji sauce.First of all, aji here refers to peppers. This term is used all over the place. We enjoyed this but I don't know that we get the huancaina sauce yet. We ended up eating the yucca with aji (in this case referring to the spicy sauces/salsas on the table - more on that later). Ceviche de pescado / camarones - ceviche with fish and/or shrimp,  shaved onion, lettuce, yam, corn on the cob & dried corn kernels (called ganchas?). I loved these dishes. Sour and tasty but the thing that stood out most to me was the amazing contrast of textures. Causa - layers of mashed potatoes seasoned with lime juice & aji and a chicken salad layer in between.Kind of a crazy dish. Surprising texture (soft all the way through) but I really liked it. I liked the hint of spice and the taste of lime with the potatoes.Chaufa Contigo Peru - beef, chicken and shrimp fried rice.Enjoyed this well though I didn't really see a great deviation from typical Chinese fried rice.Pescado a lo Macho - fish fillet fried and covered with a spicy seafood sauce containing shrimp, scallops, calamari, mussels. Also some fried yucca slices.This is a great dish. Super tasty with a bit of spice. One of the Heather's favorites.Aji de Gallina - creamy yellow, spicy sauce, made with shredded chicken, ají amarillo (yellow chilis), cheese, milk, bread, and walnuts served with rice.This was another great dish. It's actually not on the menu but I think they have it most Friday, Saturday, Sundays. Heather called it pure comfort food. Loved it, especially the subtle hint of spice. Think this will be a staple order. Anticuchos - skewers of beef heart marinated in Peruvian spices and grilled. Also comes with it's own spiciy sauce.This is another special dish. It's not on the menu and only there on occasion. Since they had it, I had to try it and definitely enjoyed it. Not spicy without the sauce. The kids also liked it quite well.Rotisserie chicken - killer rotisserie chicken.I loved this especially with the aji (spicy sauces) on the table. There were two of these, red & green, with the red being a bit spicier and the green having more of a cilantro flavor. I became a huge fan of these immediately. The first visit, I was using pieces of bread as a vehicle for the sauce. For the 2nd & 3rd visits, we ordered the chicken which just went perfectly with the aji. We also used it quite liberally in many other ways (on the yucca, over the chaufa, etc.).If there were a good Peruvian restaurant close to the house, the rotisserie chicken and aji would be a definite staple. Felt healthyish and so tasty.Chica Morada - Peruvian purple corn drink made with pineapple rind, cinnamon, and clove and then mixed with sugar and lemon.I had this every visit and will probably always do. I actually liked a bit diluted. Light and clean. You can also order it by the pitcher which seems the best deal if you have at least a couple people drinking it.All in all, I'd say we didn't have a bad dish. Looking at the menu, it can seem like french fry overload but with a bit of consideration, it definitely doesn't have to be that.I'm a big fan and will be back often.
The Cider Mill=I ran and I ran and I ran...but still I couldn't escape:)Oh well, at least I worked up a nice sweat after my meeting with the legal eagles this morning:)After 6 miles of detoxing, the first thing I like to do (after a shower of course:) is go for a walk:-)I know, but when you get to be my age, you're so damn pleased that your body still works at all, that you use it every chance you get...it could be the last time that particular part works...you never know:-)Seriously...That's what I did...I went for a walk through Old Town in search of a light retoxing:)And I found my retox in an unlikely spot...that little alleyway off Main St., in Old Town!You know...the one where the homeless guys would park their bikes and sleep late on Sunday...the one with the temporary chain-link fence to keep said late sleepers out...the one that looked like an over sized trash barrel:)Well, the alley isn't for those sleepy heads any longer:-)It's called "The Frontier Shops"...I'll think of something humorous to say about that later:)The whole place has been cleaned up, remodeled and a slew (you heard me...slew!) of new business have opened or are opening up in there...and not just native american art and tee shirts, either:)New businesses (small businesses) are the backbone of America and it is nice to see some things opening up again:)The Cider Mill is a nice little addition to the noon time restaurant selection in Old Town...not too pricey, decent food, clean and bright:)Nice people running it, too!I was headed for David's to get a burger, walked by and looked down the alley at all the hustle and bustle and decided "I'd better see what this is all about"...those exact words!They had a sign out front advertising "Coney Island Special":-)If you know anything about me at all, you know they had me at "Coney":)Pretty good Coney Island, too... a big 1/4 lb. all beef dog, plenty of sauce, potato chips and a refreshing beverage, all for under $8.00 (US money) and enjoyed at the communal table in the middle of the restaurant:-)The decor is nice, the service is a still a little uneven (but consider they've only been open 2 1/2 weeks...the place still smells like wood stain for pete's sake:) and the menu is just right for the lunch crowd (big Ruben sandwich or a big Chef salad for $6.95...it's a pretty good deal:)I think they will get better with a little time, 3 1/2 stars for now (and I don't round up, so 3 stars out of the gate is no knock on them:)Finally, after lunch, I browsed for bit and came out of there with a little jar of Queen Creek Olive tapenade and a jar of Sanders Hot Fudge (these people are from Detroit and you Detroiter's will know what a treat Sander's is:)Swing by and support the new business going into this part of Scottsdale:)It's a patriotic, tasty and inexpensive way to "Hooray" for small business in America:-)Growing up in Michigan, Cider Mills bring back so many fond memories... nothing compares to picking your own apples at an orchard and then grabbing cider and donuts and enjoying in the fresh, crisp, Michigan air.  So as soon as I saw the name of this place, i was sold.  I bookmarked it but with all of the traveling I've been doing lately, I didn't get a chance to visit until just last week.I chose The Cider Mill Gourmet Market & Sandwich Shop as the destination for a casual lunch meeting.  There were three of us there.  Upon entering, I really liked the feel of the place.  It's hiding a bit but find the Rusty Spur and go directly across the street... while it's a new building, it's got charm.  It's clean and bright as well.  The ladies working were busy with a large order when we went up to the counter to order so they told us it may be about fifteen or twenty minutes.  I waited long enough to try this place, I wasn't going to let another fifteen or twenty minutes stop me, so we waited.  I'm hoping they were short staffed that day or that they plan on hiring more help during lunch because the shop was not crowded.Anyhoo, I went with the "Build Your Own Sandwich" (turkey, lettuce, tomato, onion, mustard on wheat)... I was actually pretty disappointed they didn't have avocado or multi-grain bread. (Their website shows a picture of big fat delicious looking multi-grain bread too.)  The others in my meeting went with the Tomato Mozz Sandwich, which they said was decent but nothing special.  We were all fans of the Pop Chips that came with our sandwiches though.Perhaps my expectations were high because of the name?  And call me out if I'm wrong, but I didn't even see 'cider' as a beverage choice on the menu!  This place was "A-OK" but probably will not be a regular on my rotating favorite lunch places in Old Town... go check it out if you're looking for a decent sandwich at a moderate price - just don't go with high expectations like i did!
Hash House A Go Go=After much hype from the Man Vs Food episode with Adam Richman, Hash House A Go Go  opened a 2nd location at the Imperial Palace on the STRIP.HHAGG is known for their Enormous portions of farm fresh food with a twist and we have been to the Sahara location several times including the Man v Food shooting so we were hoping to see the SAME food,service and atmosphere as the original.The entry/waiting area has a wall of photographs of celebrities who have visited. The dining room is typical with boothes along the walls and tables filling in between. A few TV's i n the center hanging from the the ceiling a small bar along one wall.When we arrived there was NO line so we were seated immediately but don't surprised if you have to wait 30-45 minutes when it gets busy. This place is well staffed so they keep it moving.We ordered drinks-coffee and soda then our meal-I got the fried pork tenderloin sandwich & fries and My son @milesdavisvegas got the Farmer's Daughter-French Toast w/bacon & eggs.It took awhile for the food to come out -I had 3 cups of coffee waiting but the place really got busy after we arrived and Our waiter was NEW,actually his 1st day on the job.The pork tenderloin was FANTAsTIC-thin & crispy-pickles onion and ketchup!!The french toast was great-thick cinnamony with strawberries and banana,the bacon was crisp and the eggs cooked PERFECTLY over-easy lots of yolk no runny whites!!I'm a little biased towards this place because its 1/2 places in Las Vegas that serve a tenderloin sandwich so I don't really explore the menu -just burgers,breakfast & the tenderloin BUT I see lots of people trying the chicken & waffles really killin them:)I see the Reviews on YELP really rip this location but that wasn't my experience. The service was good, the food was good and it has the same feel as the original location minus the long wait.My only knock on this place is the prices but that's just me-because-I mean the biggest thing about a midwest menu is that it's  simple & CHEAP!!!Man crushes. Guys have them. No man is immune to them. No matter how he likes to boast how hetero he is and that having man crushes aren't very manly. Odds are that he's a closet man-crusher. Man crushing does not entail an intimate coital relationship. These are just guys that you may want to go to a bar with and throw down some brews and play darts (not the of the butt variety). The focal point of said man crushes can be athletes, actors, comedians, office jerk, gynecologists.... To bring me closer to one of my man crushes (yes I'm not scared to say I have several....it's liberating), I decided to visit one of the places I've seen on a show I loosely base my life on. Man vs. Food (Adam Richaman). When I found out that I didn't have to drive off the Vegas strip in order to visit it's sister location, my heart skipped a beat and I'm pretty sure I behaved like a teenage girl about to come into close quarters with Justin Timberlake (wet). I went with the sage fried chicken and waffles. The chicken was void of any sage flavor. I don't even know what sage is supposed to taste like, but I'm sure this chicken was void of it. It was bland, but, I will admit, it was the best cooked fried chicken I've ever had. Crunchy batter and all moist and sh^t inside. Nothing that a little bit of salt and hot sauce didn't help. The waffles were dense. They'd give Rush Limbaugh a run for his money. And much like Rush, there was bacon inside of the waffles. There's enough food on the plate to feed everyone on the blackjack table. It's inside the Imperial Palace casino on the second floor. So if you're a cocksucker that likes to pretend to have more money than your Anchor Blue jeans is letting on to me and only like to be seen in Aria or Bellagio, stay out dickhead. Us regular people have more fun anyways.Before I call it a week, here's a small sample list of men you can gush over and man crush on.  Also a list of men you need to hate.Yes:Chuck NorrisSteven SegalJason StathamRyan ReynaldsJo KoyBJ PennNo:Dr. PhilBill O'ReillyMichael MooreJa RuleKany WestOprahWe decided to have a late breakfast here since it was across the street from our hotel.  I had already been to the one in San Diego, so I knew to expect huge portions.  My friends wanted to check it out to see what all the hype was about.I went with the corned beef hash, some people got the Hardwood smoked bacon, avocado, onion & Swiss farm scramble, and one person decided to tackle the ginormous Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict.  My dish was pretty good.  It had just the right amount of corned beef, potatoes and scrambled eggs.  I've had the Sage Fried Chicken before, and that was way too much food for one person.  You will pretty much lapse into a food coma right after you eat it.  That is definitely a dish two people can share.The restaurant was pretty busy, and it took forever for us to order and get our food.  I felt like we spent more time waiting than eating.  If it wasn't for the slow service, I would've given it 4 stars.Warning: Another reason why I miss San Diego!I like this Hash House a go-go conveniently located on the Las Vegas Blvd strip on the second-floor of the Imperial Palace Hotel and Casino. I like the bigger venue of this HH Las Vegas location with no wait in the morning. I like the later closing hours at 11pm.There is a full-service bar. There is Keno and a big screen television for sporting events.  But the food tasted like any other casino's diner. If not, worst than the San Diego's Hillcrest location. For $16.95, I had the Crispy Hammered Pork Tenderloin. The dish had a long piece of a crispy Pork cutlet on top of a biscuit, BBQ cream sauce, scrambled eggs, tomato and spinach. My meal: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f4x1YBxkLrZg652xt2KR5g?select=FRWIO4KonJv9o279SsyKagThis is a very big dish, but the dish's taste-wise was just ok. Like I aforementioned, it tasted like an overpriced casino food. I also had $6.00 glass of Mimosa. At least, they used freshly squeezed OJ along with champagne in this drink. My drink: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f4x1YBxkLrZg652xt2KR5g?select=TH5sj4h8eY8RxZPgzzphIQI still love San Diego's location and food much better. But Las Vegas has two other locations. Unfortunately, this touristy part of LV is not my favorite. On the bright side, I might return again and maybe redeem myself and try something else instead.One thing I truly love is a spectacle. Doesn't matter of what, just as long as it provides me with some visual entertainment. With food, I love seeing the large and outlandish, quality is secondary and not expected but is always welcome. During my Vegas research, Hash House seemed the perfect spot for just that.Organizing a party of 10 for breakfast in Vegas can be quite challenge, but luckily, everyone was late at about the same time. We actually didn't even have to wait that long for a table once our entire party was there. Once seated, the drink menu led me to my first show; a BLT Bloody Mary;http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f4x1YBxkLrZg652xt2KR5g?select=_-fQlooq5QREsociXJU7YwCrisp toast, bacon, lettuce, and a tomato wedge all garnished this liquid meal. My first instinct was to smash all the solids into a pulp and mix them into my drink so I could suck down the slurry through the oversized straw. Luckily reason found me and I simply made a mini sandwich to munch on while sipping the well-made drink. I pondered ordering the famed tower of chicken and waffles, but I had a hankering for gravy that only gravy could satisfy. I ordered the biscuits and gravy at the recommendation of our server, based on my request of something large covered in gravy. After an expectedly long wait, our food began to pile in. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f4x1YBxkLrZg652xt2KR5g?select=bPvsgg04sxgX91PJmswpQQThe biscuits were surprisingly light and fluffy and the gravy had about a pound of diced sausages in it. It was definitely something that would stick to your ribs. I also tried a bite of the "stuffed" burger and was very let down. We were expecting the ingredients to be cooked in the meat, not just placed between two over-cooked patties. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f4x1YBxkLrZg652xt2KR5g?select=xjtwgwuEKBkjvO0-k80eKwOverall though it was a fun meal with food better than I expected. Service was attentive to our huge party and I think everyone had a good time. I'd go back.I didn't waste any time going to Hash House A Go Go right when I got off the plane.  I was HUNGRY!!  And I wanted a big meal that wasn't a buffet.  Plus, it was one meal that I really wanted to get it over with since it basically kicked off what was my Food Tour through the Vegas Strip and was the biggest and most intimidating meal that I would encounter.Since I've already had their Sage Fried Chicken & Waffles and Sage Fried Chicken Benedict, I went with a change of pace and tried their Hand Hammered Pork Tenderloin Benedict.  And just like the other two dishes, once I saw my waitress bringing it to my table, I immediately started cracking up because it was so enormous (http://bit.ly/1KIcQLz).   It's a loaded plate - Crispy Hand Hammered Pork Tenderloin w/ market Yellow Tomato, Spinach, BBQ Cream, topped w/ Scrambled Eggs all over two Biscuits and a Griddled Mashed Potatoes.  The Pork Tenderloin was good. If you've ever had Tonkatsu at a Japanese restaurant, it's pretty much the same deal, only 10x's bigger.  And I did pretty well, managed to kill the Pork Tenderloin and left one Biscuit behind.Washed it all down with their house special Kiwi Watermelon Lemonade (http://bit.ly/1YwCGrU).  A friend of mine recommended it and even my waitress said it went well with everything on the menu.  They were right!  Very refreshing and colorful too!!This experience was a lot better than my last visit 9 months ago.  Probably because this time I opted for a table and not a seat at the bar.  The service was definitely better as my waitress was very enthusiastic.  Also the $10 Restaurant.com coupon helped make it a good experience too!  So good service, big food, and full stomach.  It was a great way to start off my Food Tour on the Strip.When I saw their signature Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles platter on a Las Vegas television show one night I knew I had to try this.  As my buddies stopped into the Imperial Palace casino to throw away a little more cash I decided a mid day feast was in order.  I imagined this place would get pretty crowded, but at 4:30 in the afternoon on a weekend this restaurant was surprisingly empty.My buddies later told me they were concerned that a huge meal a day before the marathon would hamper their performance.  I'm a slower runner than they are though so my only concern was to finish the race and have fun doing it.Back to the restaurant I was greeted and offered a seat at the bar or a table.  I noticed an attractive vixen sitting alone at the bar so I decided I was going to go there and offer her a bit of companionship.  As I sat comfortably into my seat I couldn't help but notice this dainty young lady was eating from two giant platters of food.  She acknowledged my presence, turned to me, smiled, greeted me and told me she's a dancer and hadn't eaten all day.  Don't mind my stare, lady!  I'm not checking out your perfect physique, but I do have an eye on the humongous burger on your plate.  Wait!  Do all showgirls eat like this?I finally picked up my menu.  They offer fresh squeezed fruit juices in 10 ounce and 20 ounce glasses so I went with a fresh tangerine juice, but I'm sitting at a bar, and how does one not have a beer when they're sitting at a bar?  I selected a Pyramid Apricot Wheat Ale (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f4x1YBxkLrZg652xt2KR5g?select=I1ZZCzT_lKHJ_YthVtc-Cw) and ice water knowing all to well I needed to stay hydrated for the run ahead.I took a quick glance at the food menu although I knew exactly what I wanted to try the minute I walked into the restaurant.  I selected the Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles.  The service here was outstanding.  Every time the bartender left his station he'd return and give me an update on my food.I had a crappy camera with me at the time, but this is what I had (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f4x1YBxkLrZg652xt2KR5g?select=BagiL1VmvJTeDz_CIsty3w).  It's two huge chicken breasts partial bone attached battered and fried and sitting on an angle atop four squares of bacon-stuffed Belgian waffles drizzled in hot maple syrup.  That's right.  The waffles are stuffed with crispy bacon (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f4x1YBxkLrZg652xt2KR5g?select=t2IoUrYE-c7cIHRBxkk6ow)!The weight of the two chicken pieces quickly gave way to gravity as they fell onto the plate.  The chicken breast was amazingly juicy and the crispy batter was well seasoned.  The waffles were fluffy and chewy and I hadn't even gotten to the crispy bacon yet.  This signature dish definitely lived up to its hype.  This was outstanding.  I had to sit awhile after nearly finishing that entire platter.The dancer did better than I did taking what little food she left in a to-go box.  As she turned, smiled and bid me farewell I couldn't help but notice how gracefully she walked out the door.  I was so stuffed you might have been able to tip me over on my side and rolled me out the door!Las Vegas dancer or not, this time next year at 4:30 in the afternoon I will be back!Unlike Café Bellagio, Hash House definitely knows how to make a hash (it is part of their name, after all)!  Delicious food and giant servings?  Talk about a tasty (and filling) way to start the day.  People working on the Strip definitely know what's up:Cosmo Taxi Stand Guy:  Where are we going this morning, sir?Me:  Imperial Palace, please.Cosmo Taxi Stand Guy:  Ahhh...good ole Hash House!Me:  Yup, you got it.Cosmo Taxi Stand Guy (to cab driver): The Imperial!Cab Driver:  Ahh...he means Hash House!Me:  Man, how do you guys know?Cab Driver:  Well, it's a Sunday morning and since it looks like you're staying at Cosmo, really no other reason why you would want to go to the Imperial.  Me:  Haha...ouch.Even though a lot of the dishes that passed by our table looked great, I stayed true to my original craving - the Chorizo Hash.  Man, talk about a massive serving of food!  My photo may not do it justice, but the cast iron skillet they brought out was huge, and the hash alone took up about half of it.  The other half?  Choice of eggs (scrambled), fruit, and a biscuit.  Not that it mattered in the end though since I barely cleared half of my order.Sitting on top of soft and perfectly cooked chunks of potatoes was a tasty pile of ground chorizo.  YUM.  The "taco meat"-like consistency was a little unexpected, but the seasoning of the ground chorizo and melted cheese was great.  Just a slight kick while the jalapenos gave it that extra heat.  All in all - deliciousness.While I've heard of stories about the long waits at Hash House, we lucked into a short 5-10 minute wait for a table of five.  Since we were there on Easter Sunday though, I imagine it might have been a little quieter than normal.  Still, knowing how good (and generous) the food is though, I wouldn't mind having to wait (a little).I'm so glad I got a chance to try this place out!  After 1 week, I'm still thinking about the breakfast here!  Of the 4 of us, we shared 2 of the Andy's Sage fried chicken benedict, perfect portion & it was delish!!  Do not try to eat one on your own!  It's huge!!  I loved all the fresh flavors of the benedict, its a great twist on the usual benedict flavors and textures.  I loved more of the veggies & biscuits instead of muffins.  Everything went so well together.  The chipotle cream that topped the huge mound was yummilicious!!  I wanted a jacuzi size pot to jump in!  The menu states this plate is a Man vs. Food Fave.  I concur!!The location is on the 2nd floor of the casino inside Imperial Palace (currently getting a total makeover).  The service was good for the most part, but our server was inconsisant where he would be so friendly one moment, and kinda grouchy the next.I would definitely come again and again to try out the other items.  Next on the list is the chicken & waffles!!  That thing is huge!!!  The prices here are very reasonable for the portion and flavors.In the land of the dinosaurs, or at least those of us who eat like one, Hash House would probably reign supreme. This city is overflowing with buffets designed to make your waist, well, overflow, and Hash House can easily provide that feeling with a single item. The fact that very few things on their menu even exceed the $15 mark is pretty impressive, but maybe that's why everything presented looks ostentatious but winds up just rather banal... an embodiment of Las Vegas as a whole, perhaps.Style over substance certainly seems to be the modus operandi for Hash House, delivering mammoth sized meals you can't help but go "wow!" over, and yet very few people leave with empty plates, more likely because they simply got tired of eating surprisingly bland food, rather than being simply outmatched in the stomach capacity department. I watched multiple diners get up from the bar stools next to me leaving half or even three-quarters of a plate full of food behind. I guess when the prices are this low, in Vegas, you figure that the minimal investment isn't really worth the excessive calories.That's all in retrospect though... I came to Hash House because I had heard tales of monolithic food combinations so loaded with flavor that they had attracted multiple food related television shows to their establishments, including a chicken and waffle dish stacked so high that it approached eye level. Without going on too much of a rant about how these shows often lead so many people astray, I'll just say that the size (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f4x1YBxkLrZg652xt2KR5g?select=vdzuQYUETEvJLxak4rwB2w#vdzuQYUETEvJLxak4rwB2w) is definitely impressive, but we all know it's what you do with it that counts. Somewhat ironically I had actually used their sage fried chicken and bacon loaded waffles as inspiration for a recent brunch party I hosted, and I can honestly say that I put Hash House to shame. What absolutely makes fried chicken is the skin, and if you've got limp, soggy skin, then your size doesn't much matter. This chicken could have been baked for all I know, as there was zero crispness to it. Add to that waffles that, aside from the bacon slices inside, are generally bland, and one tiny ramekin of syrup to assist, and I can see why people literally just got tired of eating this. I also gave their BLT Bloody Mary a try, thinking the ingredients would be well infused into the drink, considering that it was by far the most expensive on the menu, but instead I wound up with what essentially amounts to a sandwich shoved into a drink (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f4x1YBxkLrZg652xt2KR5g?select=vdzuQYUETEvJLxak4rwB2w#SBNu2x4ogGJkvRJ5spQLRA), with no clear way on the best way to either eat or drink it. I wound up having to sip and nibble like a freaking rabbit on what has to be the clumsiest cocktail idea I've ever seen executed. After having the variations prepared by Brian, Nicole, and Gregg at my Bloody Mary Battle, this seemed outright amateurish. I should have stuck with my original intuition, passed on the alcohol, and gave the S'Mores latte a go... although if this was any indication it would have been the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man shoved into a teacup with a box of Graham Crackers on the side and someone who comes along and projectile vomits Hershey's chocolate syrup in my face.After our $60 breakfast here I can safely say this place isn't worth the hype!When we arrived at 9:30AM there was no wait. When we left, maybe an hour later, there were so many people waiting it had to have been over an hour wait. Let me tell you, I would have been PISSED if I had waited more than 15 minutes for this breakfast!Drinks - I ordered a Watermelon Lemonade and BF ordered a Pistachio Iced Mocha. The drinks were awesome! Mine was slightly sour but had enough watermelon flavor that it wasn't too much. His Pistachio Mocha was sooo good! I was mad that I didn't order it. For breakfast both my BF and my BFF ordered the Tractor Driver Combo which is two eggs, bacon or sausage, and a pancake, or you can substitute a waffle or french toast for one extra dollar. BFF got the pancake (that thing was bigger than the plate it was served on!!) and BF got the Vanilla Waffle. Their eggs (scrambled) were nice and fluffy, the bacon was alright. His waffle was good, but didn't taste like vanilla, and her pancake she liked, but couldn't even eat half of it.My order - okay you know when you read the description for something and then it arrives and you realize you read the description all wrong? This is what happened to me. I ordered the HH Original Benedict. Eggs Benedict - I expect hollandaise and some poached eggs. Whatever else happens is fine, but those are the things I need. I read that I would get a biscuit instead of an english muffin and there was mention of mashed potatoes, although I didn't know how that would fit in. I read about the red pepper cream, but I thought that would be along with my hollandaise. I read basted eggs, and I honestly didn't know what that meant. So I received this massive red mess with sprigs of rosemary and what look like pine needles shooting out the side of my food. I get trying to make a plate look nice, but this was a bit much.The taste? Eh. The top layers are alright. The basted egg is overcooked, no runny yolk at all, but the sauce was okay and the tomato was fine. The bottom layers though, a dry ass biscuit on top of dry mashed potatoes. Not a good combo. They really have no business calling this any sort of benedict since they strayed away from every traditional benedict characteristic possible, aside from stacking everything on top of each other.There are many better places to drop $60 on breakfast at in Vegas - this is not one I would revisit. Also, apparently there was an episode of Man vs Food filmed here? That must be their claim to fame because our waiter mentioned it at least 5 times. Wow, I am so impressed.You know when all your friends and their friends' friends have been to a cool joint and you're the only one that's never been? Well such as the case with Hash House A Go Go. My ears were burning for days when my friends were mouthing off about this place....the ginormous portions, the food coma afterwards and how their leftovers would last them for days back home....blah blah blah. Then they said Adam Richman from Man V Food went there. Say no more. We are going to Hash House A Go Go.My friends warned me that service was non-existent at this place. Well luck was on our side because our waiter was pretty attentive during our entire stay. The menu was extensive and their breakfast menu in particular was impressive. I never made it past the House Hashes. I was really tempted to try the Sage Fried Chicken (cause it was Adam's favorite). My friend ordered it and honestly it didn't look as appetizing.....as my Corned Beef House Hash (came with crispy potatoes). The verdict for the corned beef order after the initial taste test was just okay. I personally like my corned beef minced (not hand shredded). Then I had a bite of my other friend's Chorizo House Hash. Let me tell you that is the winner. I would probably order that again my next visit. The portions were big but the waiter did warn us all the House Hashes were "normal" size. The biggest portion I saw was the Sage Fried Chicken. Even that dish I expected to be even more behemouth in size based on what my friends were raving about. Sometimes it's better not to hear the hype and you can make your own conclusions. *I was really angry that they don't have any restrooms in the restaurant. I had to run downstairs back into the casino.Big yummy breakfast food. AKA comfort food overload deluxe.My x-brother-in-law told me about The Hash House A Go Go several years ago while we were fishing in Mexico. He said "dude you are gonna love this place, we're going when we hit the docks tomorow, the breakfast there is off the hook."  But it wasn't in the cards as we got thick in the fish and opted for some fresh bluefin sashimi instead.So fast forward several years, that Hash House place is still ingrained in the back of my mind and what do ya know, while taking a breather from the Venetian's casino I go for a walkabout and stumble on a sign that tells me there is a HHAGG in the Imperial Palace Hotel. So I go thru this construction maze of an entry to the IPH and into the hottest (like 90 degrees) casino on the planet. I go pass the performing blues brothers  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/9wjTzw8bEYOTQJk41V8WQw?select=TZSIV-_ypvbTuH7mh_f8cg#TZSIV-_ypvbTuH7mh_f8cg blackjack dealers and up an escalater to find that they are closed! Damn, so I make plans for the next days breakfast.Wake up at zero dark thirty (6:30) so I can have B-fast before going to the Fabtech trade show. I get there NO LINE! Yes the casino gods are favoring me today. I asked to be seated at the bar for quicker service. This was the first time I ever ordered a glass of milk at a bar, it felt wierd. I then ordered up a Andy's Sage Fried Chicken.  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=W3BT2l3t-ifYfCtQ_Q2vbQ&userid=EMMzx-gGDKsU4enmbae6dwFOOD: Andys Sage Fried Chicken ... This was a giant breakfast, the chicken and eggs atop a couple of biskets piled onto a heap of country style mashed potatoes loaded with bacon bits all covered up with a benedictish gravy with diced bell peppers. This was some good stuff a solid 4 **** Star for me. But less bisket and more of that yummy gravy and it would have been 5 Stars.  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=VDLsrE-gNdkh8N82jlEo5A&userid=EMMzx-gGDKsU4enmbae6dwSERVICE: From the hostess taking my picture http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=Eo1U2kj6OyU_a_Kr9pC-6A&userid=EMMzx-gGDKsU4enmbae6dw and quickly seating me, to the bar (milk) tender who was way cool and friendly, the service was great, fast and polite. 5*****StarsI'll be back.I finally got a chance to eat at the place that supposedly serves "twisted farm food." It had been on my radar ever since I first saw it on Man v. Food. Staying at Imperial made it all the more tempting to just go there for each meal. In a rare showing of mercy to my wallet, I didn't do that.Before going inside the dining area, you'll see a number of autographed portraits and menus. Adam Richman's is one of them. I decided to do takeout for dinner. While it was very tempting to just get the popular sage fried chicken and waffles, I was in a 1-pound stuffed burger mood. Oh, that'd be one pound of meat. The entire burger was probably closer to 2 lbs., although not quite there.The mushroom and Swiss stuffed burger ($12.95) was amazing. Extremely juicy and gargantuan. Everything cooked perfectly. It was heaven just to see the melted Swiss and sauteed mushrooms. It's served with the cold fresh veggies on one bun half and the stuffed patty on the other half. Two big dill pickle slices in the burger. While the lettuce looked a bit wilted, that's probably only because everything stayed in the same closed takeout box for a few minutes.I'm guessing they used a brioche bun. Very soft and inviting. I personally think it could have been better with a slight toasting on the flattop. This just felt like the Juicy Lucy I had in Minnesota a couple years back, just in steroidal form. I think the burger could be too greasy and too imposing for some people. Fork and knife might be required. I for one needed a larger mouth.Burgers come with one side item of your choice. I got the basil pesto tossed crispy potatoes and enjoyed every bite. Great job on the crispy potatoes. It also had some broken-down diced tomatoes in there. The olive oil from the pesto collected a bit at the bottom of the plastic takeout container.Dessert is served all day here, and one of the servers mentioned that some items (like the bread pudding) are for in-house dining only. Might expect up to a 15-minute wait on that bread pudding.Breakfast includes french toast, flapjacks, and the Fried Chicken Benedict, all featured on the Man v. Food episode. I hope to get back there for some of those dishes.I saw the plating of the sage fried chicken and waffles I spoke of earlier, and it's literally a tower of food. Three or four waffles for the base, some fried chicken on top of that, and a large knife to hold it all in place.Even with all the inflated prices on the Vegas strip, I think it's well worth the price to come here. Check this elite spot out the next time you're in the area.I had heard so much good stuff about Hash House A Go Go and couldn't wait to try here.  Unfortunately my first experience did not live up to the hype.  The service was great, but what I ordered was not.  I was really excited seeing everyone else in the place getting their big plates of food.  My mouth was actually salivating waiting to get my meal.  What I discovered is that I ordered the wrong thing on the menu.  My entrée looked terrible compared to everything else I saw.  I had ordered the Reuben sandwich with fries, and it was one of the funkiest tasting sandwiches I have ever eaten.  It tasted like bad pot roast on toasted, buttered slices of bread.  It was so inedible that I could only stomach about half of it.  I was super hungry when I got here, but I lost my appetite eating the sandwich.  The fries were okay, and were mainly what I filled up on.I heard the waiter tell someone that everything on the menu is good.  Not true!  The Reuben sucks!  Don't get it!  However, everything else looks good and I still want to give Hash House A Go Go another shot to see if it is really worthy of the hype.This breakfast is gonna last you alllllll day in Vegas because it's supersized! I mean, holy crap is it a large portion. I realize they have a "man vs food" item, but honestly, it could all be "stomach vs food" entrees. But the real test is, is it good? And I can happily say it is! Honestly, the only reason I'm not giving it five stars is because my main entree wasn't my favorite. But let me explain. Not realizing how large the portions were, I ordered the salmon and cream cheese hash, with me and my mom splitting the brown sugar and banana pancakes. To be honest, I really wanted the pancake, but I always feel guilty not getting a little protein in my meal. So I went with the "healthy" (I know, it's laughable) salmon dish. The salmon was a bit dry and I didn't really like the whole mix of salmon, cream cheese and hash. My mom ordered the mushroom hash, which I, of course, tried. It was much better! But the pancake was AWESOME! I should have just sucked up my pride and just ordered that. It's honestly one massive pancake, that would have equaled three medium sized ones. It was one of the best I've ever had! I liked the fact that while you waited they have a sole bar dedicated to bloody mary's! And they are gooooood! I swear, I'd come up there just to get a bloody mary and head back down and go about my day. It was one of the best I've ever had, packed with olives, pickles and a bean! Plus, it was the right amount of spice. Speaking of waiting. You will wait. And wait. And Wait. We waited an hour to sit and then another hour for food. We came around 10am on a Sunday, which I'm sure is prime brunch time. I'd highly suggest going in later, but you'll probably always have a wait here. It was worth it though!OK...I like to eat. I eat a lot. I like to eat good food. So far, I haven't experienced that here. Sure, the portions are humongous and it's dressed up all pretty and nice, but that's just about it - It's all style...no substance. Yes, there's all kind of celebrity pictures complete with their signatures on the wall endorsing this place as the best place to eat. So did Planet Hollywood. We all know what happened there. I'll have to agree that it's the best place to pig out, only if you can shove all of that mountain of food into your mouth. I wanted to like it this time around hoping for a better experience, but it just fell flat again leaving me wanting more and unsatisfied. Yes I was stuffed, but I was still hungry. Does that make sense? How is that even possible?They give you a mountain of food, but it lacks flavor and heart. A good example is their Chicken N Waffles. How can you mess up Chicken n Waffles?Well....they use breast meat and deep fry the living sh*t out of it and what you're left with is a dry piece of meat that is hardly edible. In this case, looks is very deceiving. Again, all style and no substance just like some of the stuff you see in Vegas. I have to also mention that we had the creepiest server ever. He lurks around with his big bugged eyes, who reminded me of Smeagle on Lord of the Rings. My precious....I also made the mistake of ordering their Mint Coffee. The only real mint they had on this was the garnish they placed on top. The mint they used to have that minty flavor is mint syrup which gives it that artificial flavor. It's overly sweet and undrinkable after a couple of sips. Yeah, I gave it another chance and it's time for me to move one.Even though the quad (formerly imperial palace) is unimpressive and their rooms are quite gross, they do have this one diamond in the rough. It is actually inside the casino and up an escalator so don't bother looking for it from the strip. You'll just get lost. I came here with about 20 people (yea. 20.) and knew about the long waits but we were all willing to eat here. The hostess quoted us a 45 minute wait but surprisingly we were seated in ~25 mins despite the large amount of people in the lobby. I felt bad for the waitress though as she had to yell across the three connected tables to all twenty of us to explain the menu. She sounded like she was losing her voice but she had a very cheerful attitude nonetheless. Portions are ginormous so just share; I recommend it. I split the sage fried chicken Benedict with my gf and it was way more than enough. We also split the snickers pancake with another couple with us. The Benedict was very tasty and stacked high, about 7 inches in height, 12 inches if you include the rosemary sprigs sticking out of it. It could've been that we were starving and getting over our hangovers but it was an amazing combination eggs potatoes fried chicken gravy spinach and bacon. I'm glad we shared the pancake because it was huge as well, probably at 12-13 inches in diameter with chunks of snickers everywhere. Also very sweet so I only ate about 3-4 bites of it and had to stop.Very affordable assuming you split the dish with another person. Fyi the bathroom is downstairs in the casino area.  Definitely worth stopping to try it out unless you've been to the original one in sd.After years of wanting to try this place out, I finally did this past Sunday before heading home from Vegas. For the 2 of us to be seated, we waited 30 minutes but it seems like the wait time is typically longer. Our waiter was really friendly, and explained a bit about the menu to us since it was our first time. He checked in frequently as we decided what we wanted to eat and drink. We were never waiting for him to show up at the table. My sister and I split the chicken and rosemary hash with scrambled eggs and were both filled up. The potatoes were the best part of the dish, so flavorful and perfectly cooked. Besides beer they also have some fun mixed drinks available such as spiked kiwi watermelon lemonade. Other offerings include scrambles, giant salads, and stuffed burgers. Come here for some heavy food if you need to cure that Vegas hangover!Seriously the best brunch spot in Las Vegas! This is such a popular spot that you almost always have to wait 30+ minutes for a table, but it's so worth it :) My favorite item from here is the sage chicken and waffles. The waffles have BACON in them! And the chicken is just phenomenal! As you may have read from other reviews, these come in a HUGE portion. It's literally 3 meals for me, no joke! I've also tried the blueberry flapjack. The flapjack is the size of a pizza!! It tastes like just your ordinary pan cake, so nothing special there. Something else I've tried is their French toast. They should rename this "French bricks" because that's the size of these toasts!! I also love ordering the watermelon lemonade! So yummy! Overall, I LOVE dining at Hash House A Go Go :)We walked like 2 miles to get here because we heard it was the best breakfast to get nearby the strip.  It's not in the nicest hotel/casino on the prettiest part of the strip (I think it's actually on the old strip) but don't let that deter you.We got in on a Sunday at about 1:30, and it was PAH-ACKED with people.  They told us the wait would be 45-60 minutes so three of us sat in the waiting room, and the other two went to the bar for coffee.  They came back a minute later and said there was enough room for 5 of us to eat at the bar, which was probably the best seat in the house - great service. Kye and Tiffany at the bar are awesome. We had drinks, friendly convo with the bartenders, and our food was delivered quickly. ..and BOY was it HUGE!!  Every plate could have been shared by 2-3 people and the banana pancake (singular) that the guy next to us got was literally *hanging* off the edges of the plate. I got the Roast Chicken Potato hash: chicken, mushrooms, red peppers and asparagus on top of roasted potatoes. Over medium well egg (?) and large biscuit on the side.  Oh and don't forget the wedge of watermelon!  Those things were also cocktail ornaments. I am not kidding.The best thing about any place in Vegas, I sadly only took advantage of here, was the to-go alcohol cups. Wacky... especially coming from GA (aka the Bible Belt).  I felt like I was being really bad, but I liked it. The only bad thing?  The whole place was really warm.. maybe because it's on the top floor, and we were sitting at the bar (by the kitchen door.)  Bar is still worth it!HOW I GOT STARTED WRITING YELP REVIEWSIn the spring of 2012 I went to my cousin's bachelor party in San Diego. Prior to that I had only written one Yelp review. Since the San Diego trip was going to be pretty expensive, due to the itinerary, I decided to write Yelp reviews of the places that I visited. At that time I didn't think I would constantly write Yelp reviews during these last two years? One of the places I ate in San Diego was Hash House A Go Go. I ordered a salmon omelet. The one regret I made was that I didn't order the sage fried chicken and waffles after seeing some of the customers eating this dish.Yesterday morning I ate here. Despite the item that was featured on Man vs. Food, I knew what I wanted - the sage chicken fried and waffles. As I remembered in San Diego the portions were huge. To my surprise there were small slices of bacon inside the waffles. As the saying goes everything is better with bacon. I couldn't give this rating a perfect 5-star because of the fried chicken. Despite its crunchy skin the breast meat was slightly dry. Overall I liked the dish because you get what you pay for due to the huge portions. Unlike the last time I went to San Diego location I had no regrets.Everything the world needs to know about us fat Americans can be found at the Hash House A Go Go.  Vegas is a city of sin and this is Gluttony at it's finest.  Hash House describes their concept as Twisted Farm Food.  It's American comfort food taken out of it's overalls and dressed up.  I came here for one thing.....The Sage Fried Chicken Benedict.  I saw it on Man vs Food and knew someday it would have to be mine.So many times when a place "creates" a tower of food all combined together on a gargantuan plate, it's not well thought out.  This is different and the key here is each ingredient is great on it's own.  From the bottom up we have mashed potatoes, nicely seasoned and thrown on a griddle to get them slightly browned.  Then why stop with one starch when you can have two?  The mashed potatoes are topped with a couple of fluffy buttermilk biscuits that are some of the most tasty I've ever had.  Followed by fresh spinach (it's great that they don't cook it so it doesn't get mushy) and slices of Red Beefsteak Tomato.  This is topped with a couple of slices of hickory smoked bacon and then it's namesake....A half pound well seasoned fried chicken breast.  Corn flakes are used as the batter and it keeps it's crunch well.  Top this with scrambled eggs and cheese.  The cheese is fried up on the griddle so it's melted prior to going on everything else.  This also creates a nice browned skin to the melted cheese.  I forgot to ask what cheese they were using, but it wasn't too strong.  It seemed it's main job was bond itself to the chipotle cream sauce that is poured on top and create one cheesy gooey chipotle sauce that seals everything in.  Winner Winner Chicken Dinner!  I hope they never open a Hash House near me because I could see myself craving one of these life ending creations often.  5 Stars all the way.The masterpiece... http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hash-house-a-go-go-las-vegas-5?select=8oW8c6E4IWay0MhURzQn_Q#4MG6MmBLXIl1kwp_ucw3kgAnd here's a nice cross section of it to fully appreciate all it's glory...  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hash-house-a-go-go-las-vegas-5?select=8oW8c6E4IWay0MhURzQn_Q#50iLIS2poMhauloTh8so2wI also got a chance to try the Big O' Crispy Hand Hammered Pork Tenderloin Sandwich.  We all agreed while impressive to look at, it wasn't on the same level as Sage Fried Chicken Benedict.  It was a tasty deep fried pork cutlet but I found it needing more than just the sprinkling of ketchup on it as it got a little dry.  I did love the pickles as the vinegar flavor worked well with the pork.  Perhaps some kind of creamy BBQ sauce would have been better.  The bun was a whole wheat bun, but was a throw away here.  Why whole wheat?  I have no idea.  3.5 stars http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hash-house-a-go-go-las-vegas-5?select=8oW8c6E4IWay0MhURzQn_Q#sMJihbRjw3f9nOLeumyMPQMy wife for some reason got the most boring burger on the menu.  As such I found myself saying....just a burger.  Their burgers are two half pound patties stuffed with a few different options.  Well it doesn't seem that they are really "stuffed" just things are put between the 2 burgers.  She got bacon, cheddar, and avocado.  So to me it was just how they layered everything, big deal the bacon, cheddar, and avocado was between two separate patties.  There was also no sauce?  Just ketchup.  We asked for some mayo, so it wasn't so dry, but this place should really come up with their own sauce.  If you want a burger, there are better more creative options in Vegas, such as Burger Bar or Bachi Burger.  3.5 stars. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hash-house-a-go-go-las-vegas-5?select=8oW8c6E4IWay0MhURzQn_Q#hjjZMDOZjlfQE0GSgrp17AI'm sure there are other 5 star dishes here as I saw a lot of amazing looking things.  My daughter's plain pancake was one of the best I've ever tasted.  They do them all kinds of ways here.  Of course the pancake was the size of a medium pizza and a good 3/4 inch thick.  For sure I'm trying one of their hash dishes next time.  After all they are called Hash House.  The Meatloaf and Smoked Mozzarella Hash sounds great with a couple of over easy eggs on top.  I can recommend the banana latte.  It was excellent. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hash-house-a-go-go-las-vegas-5?select=8oW8c6E4IWay0MhURzQn_Q#V1jbFFDhdWldAaGeyBHHWgExpect at least a 20-30 minute wait as the word is out on this place.  They told us 45, but we were in in 20.  It's a huge restaurant and they move them in and out fairly well.  Open 24 hours!!!!Warning: Portions here are humongous! I ordered a Sage Fried Chicken Linguine to share with two other drunken people and that was way more than enough food for all three of us. The mushroom cream was ok. Wasn't too overwhelming but it wasn't the best either. There was a good amount of it which came in handy when we tasted the sage fried chicken. The sage fried chicken wasn't hot to temperature and it was also super duper dry. I only ate a few bites of it and I had to dip it in the sauce with my pasta to be able to enjoy. I did like the crispy green beans that were in the pasta. Our waiter was very difficult to find. Find to place the order, find to get a water refill, find to ask where the restroom is at, and to find to get the check. The place is pretty big but wasn't very crowded that night so I don't know how that works. (Bathrooms our outside by Fat Tuesdays)What we thought would be a quick bite ended up being pretty long. Service is slow, food is ok. Decent place to go for diner food and large portions to share with a lot of people.We have a Hash House in San Diego and the wait is always over 2 hours. I did it once, and swore I'd never do it again. Because I refuse to do the wait, when we were in town visiting, my fiancé wanted to give Hash House a try since he's never been. We came in on a Friday around 12 PM for brunch. We were quoted about 25 minutes before we could be sat. What's awesome about this location is that they have a bartender by the hostess who can make you drinks while you wait for  your table so you don't have to go up to the bar. I liked this idea!Since there was open seating at the bar, we decided to just hop up there and opt out of waiting for a table. I warned him that the portions are HUGE and since I didn't feel like walking out of there in a food coma, we should just share a plate. Judging by the two men seated next to us who looked like they were struggling to get another bite down, he decided to take my advice (smart guy lol).We both ordered up Bloody Mary's- which were perfect- not too much horseradish ( I hate horseradish so the fact that it was in there and I couldn't taste it, was awesome), and perfectly spicy. Of course my fiancé opted to "man" up his Bloody Mary and ordered the BLT Bloody Mary.We decided to share the chicken and waffles. The waffles had a strip of bacon in the center, another bonus for all you bacon lovers out there. The sage fried chicken was good, but the sage was WAY too over powering. Overall, it was decent- nothing crazy. The portion sizes are what draws people in but the taste is meh. I probably won't be back unless I'm with a group of people who absolutely insist on coming and even then- I'd probably just order a bloody marry.Oh, a plus is the bartenders kicked ass! Great energy, great customer service!Over hyped. There I said it. Don't be hating, I just wasn't blown away and after seeing words like ''amazing'', ''exceptional'' and ''spectacular'' appearing in so many reviews I did expect more than the very average tasting Chicken and Waffles I had. Ok, portions are huge but that is the exact reason why America has an obesity problem. Half the portions, increase the quality and you're onto a winner Hash House.Located inside The Quad this place is a bitch to find. It's on the 2nd floor and accessible from an escalator in a dark corner of the ground floor, you really have to be paying attention to the signs and directions.Once inside the place is large and the staff inviting. The menu consists of Breakfast, Brunch, Lunch and Dinner with your usual American fare. Knowing from the Yelp pictures before we came the portions were big we decided to order just one Entree to share and see how we go with that before ordering more.- Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hash-house-a-go-go-las-vegas-5?select=WMlwV0h4FJ210s5htktfYg#qbOfWBSEnFvS3S5Kvu9uBA) The Waffles have Bacon cooked into them and comes with Leeks. The presentation was great, piled high and held together with a huge steak knife, truly a beast of a meal.My Husband and I found the Chicken to be a little dry and the coating oily. It also had a strong flour taste where too much had been used before the egg wash and crumb coating. The Waffles and Syrup were good if you took out the Bacon (consisted of more fat than meat) and the Leeks really added nothing to the dish, do people even eat them?The portion was large enough for Breakfast between two of us though as we didn't even manage to finish it, how one person could eat that much in one sitting is beyond me.Bottom line? Disappointing experience, I'm glad I did come here after wanting to for so long but am not likely to return. I guess it's the kind of place you come once just to say you have been. Probably more 2.5 / 5. I'm too generous...Awwww Man!!!!! This place totally ROCK!!!!Great food, Great Service and reasonable prices for Vegas!!!!! Large Portions.  Long wait!If you're wowed by over the top presentation and foods that will make you instantly gain 10lbs at the table, Hash Hash is for you! If not, take your belly elsewhere. BIG portion is an understatement. I'm sure the phrase quantity over quality was epitomized at this place. And there's nothing wrong with it. I was oooing and ahhing as well but when it came down to flavors, they were pretty average. Instead of paying $17 for my average chicken and waffles that I would have to eat over the course of 3 days, I rather pay $12 for a normal plate. Just sayin...1:30am leaving Harrah's casino extremely tired yet extremely hungry. Those two together is a bad combination! Why?! because while you are sitting and waiting for your meal to come, you end up looking like a "bobble head" to the other diners. I mean my head was just ah "bobbing and weaving"- couldn't keep my eyes open for sh*t. Thankfully I was with a group of gals celebrating my good friend's bachelorette weekend, so in between conversations and silence, I was getting some shut eye lol.To sum up the food: delish! The French Toast meal (dang, can't remember the exact name but it's one of their most popular dishes) was slamming! It was way too much food. We all concurred that we probably could have shared (2 people share one french toast meal). As far as service, it wasn't that many people so why was service so freaking slow. I don't know, maybe less cooks or one waiter. I don't think I fully enjoyed my meal because if the long wait. By the time my meal came, I was too tired to even eat half of it.Next time I will have to come with a full appetite and a nap under my belt!Massive portions.  Food was good enough.  Went with my boy and he's a big eater.  Even he couldn't finish.Prices reasonable. Vegas used to have great late night options, but they're dwindling as casinos turn to fast food mall-style eateries for after hours.   I hate it. But this place is a bit of the good old days.Please don't review this business if you received a freebie for writing this review, or if you're connected in any way to the owner or employees.Honestly, I am not a breakfast person. Never liked pancakes because every time I eat them I feel like I am chewing Styrofoamey nothingness that sucks so fucking bad that you must add Aunt Jemima and butter to it to make them somewhat edible.  However, the dilemma is that my better half loves breakfast and so, we compromise and usually have brunch... with bottomless mimosas and/or Bloody Mary's  to wash that Styrofoam down. So, when we were in Vegas recently and she suggested that we eat at Hash House a Go Go (HHAGG) at The LINQ before leaving Las Vegas like Nick Cage, I was like, "of course honey" because you know, happy wife... yadda yadda yadda. When we showed up at high noon like clueless morons that get shot by stray gunfire at a shootout, we were totally ambushed by the 45-minute wait. We should have thought it through that a lot of people would be grabbing a bite to eat before heading back to their not-so-sinful cities... Damn that hangover...  speaking of Hangover, if you get to the end of my review, I have a treat for you...Anyways, I gave the server my name and after receiving a plastic laminated number card, we headed out to kill some time by exploring the stores at The LINQ Promenade, which felt a lot like The Grove in Los Angeles sans a trolley and actual worthwhile stores to spend money at. This place looks much better at night, kind of like that girl/guy from Drai's or Hakkasan that you somehow end up waking up next to. By the time we got back to HHAGG, we waited another 5 minutes and then our number was called. Then they do this weird fucking thing where they make you stand on a red rug in the middle of the restaurant. All I can say is that, it was weird just standing there. After a few minutes we were seated and our awesome hipster-bearded server, Andrew, served us. We ended up sharing the most popular dish that was purported to be a New York Times favorite on the menu... the Sage Fried Chicken & Waffles. Let me repeat - we SHARED this shit. This thing was humongous. It came with two Jurassic-sized fried chicken breasts with waffles that had hardwood smoked bacon cooked into them that was then topped with a hot maple reduction, and fried leeks... all this stuff was stacked into a giant tower that was all skewered together with a rosemary spear and a freaking steak knife. Truly amazing... All for less than $20! We ended up getting the tractor iced coffee for around $3 and this was always refilled promptly by Andrew and he even gave us a to-go cup for our 4th helping of iced coffee when we were leaving. I've had chicken and waffles elsewhere. I've done the fancy at Bouchon and of course the not-so-fancy at Roscoe's. But honestly, I have never enjoyed chicken and waffles to the point that I literally sounded like I was having an orgasm as I ate and after I ate because I was moaning so much from the tasty food and from being so full. Oooooh! Ohhhhhhhhhh! Oh gawd! Everything was tasty. The batter of the sage fried chicken was perfect and adding bacon to the waffles made a world of a difference. And the leeks! Holy smokes were they fucking delicious!Look, people that give HHAGG a bad review are "hhaggs" that ended up not getting the Sage Fried Chicken & Waffles. Stick to what they are good at. That is like going to Lawry's Prime Rib and complaining that their spinning salad sucks. Of course it's going to fucking suck dipshit, that's why they spin it. Look, this place is open 24/7 so take a break from drinking, macking, gambling, bringing-your-homies-down-because-you-lost-all-your-wages-on-the-1st-night-like-a-chump-and-got-a-cash-advance-from-your-credt-card-with-28%-interest, and/or sucking-your-gut-in... and just go-go to Hash House a Go Go. It will be the best decision you make. Just anticipate a wait if you go during peak hours.* So I referenced the Hangover earlier... the following is a true story. I went to the Roscoe's Chicken & Waffles in South Los Angeles off Manchester and a brother came up to me and literally said, "hey I saw your hairy ass penis in that movie! Too-da-loooooo..."  Damn that Ken Jeong. Damn you!This was one of the best meals I had while in Las Vegas, and believe me, I ate a lot! This is a southern, down home style of cooking. They're open 24/7, and were able to serve us quickly and efficiently at 4am. The food was presented in a beautiful manner, with fresh rosemary and thyme poking out of the food. The food came quickly, and was hot, and there was plenty of it. The decor was interesting. Sort of a 70's style steakhouse with all the celebrities who ate there  tacked up by the entrance. The service was friendly and efficient. They wished me "good luck" when I ordered the house specialty. The prices were a bit higher than what I'm used to paying for down home cooking, but for the portions, it was actually a good deal. I challenge anyone to walk away from this place hungry. It can't happen. I got the dish that was featured on Man vs Food, the fried chicken benedict. I didn't see it as that big of a challenge, but it was a lot of food. My buddy got the hamburger, which he raved about. Our other buddy ordered some sort of chicken dish, but had to leave suddenly when all the free booze from the casinos caught up with him. We attempted to eat his dish, but we couldn't make it. The food was filling and delicious, and the fresh herbs were certainly appreciated. Out of the entire trip to Vegas, this was probably the culinary highlight of the whole trip. It can be a bit difficult to find this place, as it's tucked in the rear of the Linq Casino, but ask enough slot jockeys, and they'll point you in the right direction. I encourage you to check this place out.I had no choice but to try Hash House A Go Go.  My co-worker highly recommended this place and it had pretty good reviews from my Yelp friends.  The family and I arrived at noontime on a Saturday where we were met by a long wait. We waited along with the masses in the front of the restaurant listening to the woman call out garbled sounding numbers over their PA system until it seemed close to our turn.  When it seemed close to our turn, I had to go up to the front to ask her what number she just called.  Tired of seeing my face, they finally called out my number and sat the family and I in the back corner of the restaurant.We sat there perusing the menu.  Google Hangout messages were sent by my friends who told me that I needed order their Corned Beef Hash and their Chicken and waffles.  We were all ready to order.  Missing was our waiter.  We kept looking at the wait staff, but, none of them stopped at our table.  We didn't know if we had a waiter or a waitress.  Then I saw a nicely dressed man getting drinks for a table that was close to ours, and I heard the table behind me grumbling about the waiter not being there to deliver their check so that they could leave.  We were already seated for 20 minutes.  We needed to go home, back to Los Angeles.  So, I flagged down the nicely dressed man and asked him about our nonexistent waiter.  After a little bit of chit chat, we gave the nicely dressed man our order.  It wasn't until half an hour later that our waiter finally showed up and introduced himself.  Too late...your manager had already taken our order.  The food was good.  The portions were big and could have been easily shared by two people.  The Corned Beef Hash came on a skillet with lots of cheese, corned beef on top of potatoes, an egg, and a biscuit.  It was good.  Even my daughter who doesn't like to eat meat liked it.  The Chicken and waffles was impressive.  The fried chicken came in a tower held in place by a knife. The chicken was flavorful and moist.  It was a winner.The nicely dressed man, the manager came back to check on us.  Like the tables around us, he gave us a 25% discount.  The waiter finally showed up at the end, perhaps he was expecting some kind of tip.  Good food, but, nonexistent waiter.  I might've given them more stars if the waiter showed up.Their food here is massive! The service here is superb! The food is good just a lottttt, you have to come really hungry and share share share. We seriously over ordered the food we couldn't finish it all.We came here early for breakfast there was about a 20 minute wait which wasn't too bad. We were seated and served by a very pleasant woman I wish I knew her name because she was just the most patient and wonderful server I have come across.I had to order their famous sage chicken, let's just say this bad boy was just too much I couldn't see myself ordering this again but it was good don't get me wrong. It had butter milk biscuits, bacon, spinach, tomatoes, sage fried chicken, scrambled eggs, mozarella cheese and chipotle creme on top. It was really good but we weren't able to finish it between the 2 of us it just was a lot of food and the bacon was a little overkill for me.  This was featured on Man Vs. Food. Let's just say it won. :) We also ordered the brown sugar pancakes which were really good they had bananas also. Their kids menu their french toast portion is so big too, they brought out 2 big pieces of french toast topped with banana, butter and powdered sugar. Their french toast is really good. I really enjoyed their french toast.All in all a wonderful experience, you definitely must try and like I said before Come Hungry!I specifically chose this location over the one inside Rio because of their 4 star reviews over 3 stars at Rio... Unfortunately, I'm only giving this place 3 stars because the service was pretty bad. 3 stars for their great menu with unique offerings (lots of breakfast items), huge portions, and ample seating. Value: since their portions are hugenormous, you can understand why they charge so much. However, $5.99 for hot chocolate, it's a bit overpriced. Taste: I only ordered the chicken and waffles. The chicken was crispy on the outside and tender meat inside- great! The taste- well, it's just ok. It can have a bit more flavor. The waffle is bacon infused. And since bacon makes everything better, I had no complaints there. The chicken is a bit over battered for my liking... Leaving fried batter all over the plate so on top of the thick bacon waffles, you have all this breading from the chicken--- carbs anyone???Service: here's why i deducted 2 points... The bf ordered espresso... Accidentally, upon setting the cup on the table, the server spilled the espresso on the table, my seat, pants, and sleeves. We all know how small an espresso is so with half of it gone, he barely had any. You would think he would offer to replace it, nope! Fine. We realized our server clearly do not care about beverage because we already had our food and the water never came. Tending to our hydration needs seemed such an abhorrent task for him. The server gave no apologies, no f*ck, nor two sh!ts Finale: this place is overrated. Their food presentation is impressive however the taste does not match its aesthetics. What can I say, I'm a professional complainer and an emotional eater. Eating is an experience for me. To me, this was not a good one.
Petite Maison=I LOVE French food.. in fact when we travel abroad, me and the Mr always make a point to visit a Frenchie place in another city. So when I got wind of a new French place right here in our own backyard I was stoked! The best part, its owned by chef James Porter, who did amazing job over at the now closed Tapino, so my excitement turned to elation when our reservation was confirmed!So now that I'm home from my dinner with the Mr, I guess I'm slightly indifferent. While they had a strong opening night, it wasn't the service or food per-se but more like the other diners. The dining room is small and extremely intimate with an amazing looking patio, we chose to sit on the inside. The interior is covered in wood, really, the floors, ceiling, walls but nicely contrasted by very stylish crystal chandeliers. I do have to say that I'm sure glad that they chose larger tables for the diners, since you can never have enough space. So there is plenty of room at the table to simply spread out and relax.Service is pretty shiny and have no complaints, in fact our server was outgoing, attractive and knowledgeable. The bar staff was also very competent since both of our cocktails, Bohemian Sidecar ($9) and the Le Matador de Nimes ($9) were mixed perfectly and tasted great, putting us both into great moods until... a 6 top was sat down right next to us.. I know the old saying, you can't choose your family and in this case, you cant choose your dining neighbors either. They were so loud the Mr and I just looked at each other then decided to check email and stuff on our phones. We couldn't even talk which was a real bummer since this was going to be a romantic evening out. Anyway, the food will make up for it, right?Of course I have high expectations.. new Foodiebear rule of life, never have expectations of anyone, or anything or you're going to set yourself up for irritation, heartache and misery. With that being said they were out of f*cking Pate! Can you believe that?! Out of the one thing that Ive been looking forward to this entire week. Opening night, first thing on the menu, first table in the place, out of something. I know, I know, things happen but come on, this is opening night!!!! *Sigh* Ended up ordering the Steak Tartar ($8) and the Mr ordered the Foie Gras ($10). Both were excellent both in presentation, quality and taste. While my tartar wasn't pate, it was still excellent with its fried egg on top and crispy potato crisps. The foie was much like the tartar, deliciously perfect and for the price, major value. In fact all of the food that we ordered was really big, surprising for the price points. Let me tell you what, the Onion Soup ($6) was prefect. In fact Ive never had onion soup that was that good! Perfectly sweet, savory and the right amount of cheese crouton to compliment the soup, not over power it. The Mr liked his Vichyssoise ($6) with it smooth creamy texture and a quenelle of salmon mousse in the center which added a smokey complexity to the soup. Again, the servings were quite large and could have been halved pretty easily. Entrees were a kind of hit and miss. The Mr had the Steak Frites ($17) which was well cooked but came covered in compound butter thaqt had anchovy in it. First bite I was immediately turned off to the slight fishy undertone. Thank goodness neither of us have fish allergies, very unexpected. The frites were nicely crisp and well seasoned. However the side of sauce for dipping was just strange. Was made from vinegar and had a decent texture but just tasted odd with the fries and the meat all together. Would have preferred something a little more basic, again a preference. I ordered the Porc et Lardon ($16) as my entree and Im pretty happy with the result. Grilled bacon wrapped pork tenderloin with roasted pork gratin which was made with roast pork shoulder, shaved fennel and celery root. The contrast in the flavors and textures was right up my alley aside from the tenderloin being a tad over cooked, it is again opening night.Desserts were limited to three choices, Chocolate Brulee, Biegnets and Grande Marnier Souffle. We went with the Biegnets de Nutella ($6) and the Souffle ($6). The biegnets had a filling of Nutella which was alright but wasn't a fan until, I took some of the Mr's creme anglaise and dunked them into that. Delish. The souffle was so light and and was just brown enough to caramelize the sugar. You cant go wrong with either dessert. All in all Petite Maison is an excellent value and with Chef James Porter at the helm expect solid French fare nightly with breakfast and lunch being added soon. Looking forward to back soon but this time Ill go with no expectations.When Jared suggested we try Petite Maison last night (Tuesday), I immediately approved... he tends to get stuck at his regular places and it's rare he wants to try somewhere new - so when the adventurous feeling strikes, I have to jump on it!  So we headed over there around 7pm, and we had a wonderful dinner.  The restaurant is beautiful and although I never made it in when it was "Buckets," Jared says they did a fantastic job with the renovations... I absolutely love the chandeliers!Since it was a beautiful night, we opted to sit outside.  The patio is comfortable and now that the weather is cooling down, I'm sure it will become a local favorite for hot spot outdoor dining.  Jerry, our server, took great care of us.  As we perused the menu, we noticed that everything is reasonably priced, and although I'm typically not a huge fan of French cuisine, there were a handful of items that were appealing to me.  Jerry brought us fresh warm rolls that had tasty herbs baked into them.  I usually skip the bread basket but I make exceptions for 'special' occasions and this was one of them - each bite was delightful!Just as we finished up our rolls, our Salade Maison was served (we ordered one to share).  Described as crispy chevre, lardons, candied walnuts, peppery greens and roasted shallot vinaigrette, (and I noticed it also had dill in it which I love); the salad was delicious and perfectly balanced with sweet and salty flavors and just the right amount of dressing. It was large enough to share, and priced right at $7.Next, I had the Coquille Saint-Jacques (sea scallops appetizer priced at a moderate $8) and a side of asparagus and Jared enjoyed the Poulet Roti (roasted stuffed chicken entree - $15).  We both cleaned our plates after admiring the beautiful presentations.Adding to the ambiance was the spot on French music (including French renditions of songs we all know) - props to Wendy for that! I'm totally in wedding mode at the moment so perhaps I fell hard for Petite Maison because of that alone; it was a memorable romantic meal that I shared with my fiance afterall...  but I'm pretty sure that Petite Maison will become a regular in our rotation - can't wait to try it for breakfast, brunch, and lunch too!Really, really enjoyed Petite Maison last night.First of all, I love the space. It's small, which I think adds charm. The patio is great and with weather like we've been having, it was amazing out there. I also love the restaurant interior itself. I love the space, the wood walls, the chandeliers, the bar... Very cool look and vibe.We also had excellent service. Both the bartender and our server were great - total pros. As far as our meal, we sampled a variety of things and really enjoyed most everything.We ordered and shared the escargots, steak tartare, foie gras, Coquille Saint-Jacques (scallops), vichyssoise and onion soup. Highlights for me were the escargots, steak tartare, foie gras and onion soup. The dishes were excellent. They even reminded me of the food my dad's old place (The Glass Door) served years ago, and not too far away. While we didn't have the puff pastry, the escargots with the pernod garlic butter were quite similar.  They were great. We definitely took full use of the good bread provided to soak up the garlic butter. The onion soup was also similar. It was fantastic, one of the best I've had in years. I will definitely be ordering that again. And while I may still be a bit partial to my dad's steak tartare, I'd also say that was excellent. I really liked the playfulness of the dish with the fried egg and homemade potato chips. The foie was great too.We also had great drinks. They have a nice selection of spirits and the bartender made a very tasty chartreuse concoction that I didn't get the name of. I had a Dogfish Head 90 minute IPA that was served in a large very cold, snifter. Was a great way to present it and of course a great beer.While they have a full menu, it's nice to see the option to go and get a variety of great appetizers. I also really like the idea of their late night staff meals.It helps that it's just down the street too!My favorite thing about eating at French places is cheese plates and wine so naturally this is what I ordered at Petite Maison. And it definitely did not disappoint. Four types of cheese ranging from blue to soft and creamy came with an assortment of sides such as mini-pickles (gherkins?), sauces and breads. Delicious! I also had a satisfying salad and a French press coffee. While normally I love French press this one left something to be desired, but it did the job and fueled me through the night with its caffeine content.The space is smallish and quaint with a nice bar as well as a cute patio area. Their beer list is surprisingly well done, as is the wine list, of course. Take a date here or have a business lunch with a potential client to impress. Perhaps you'll seal the deal in either case.So glad Gabi chose this place for Lunch, but damn the rain for ruining our chance at the lovely patio dining. Such cozy cuteness, I was beside myself. I just adored the pretty patio with all it's flowers, umbrellaed tables, heaters and even a roaring fireplace. Inside was more CC, chandeliers over each table, dark wood, and my favorite part was the beautifully framed window, literally framed, but instead of a picture you look out the window to the lattice and creeping vines, so cool! Wish I would have taken a pic of that. Several things on the menu wanted me to order them but I went with the Salmon Nicoise (see pics) It was not only beautiful but also delicious. Other guests ordered the Quiche and the Onion Soup (see pics) Both looked wonderful and I was told they were. I have only one complaint and it's really just more of a disappointment than anything. On such a rainy cold day I was hoping they would have some decadent hot chocolate to warm me up but they did not......Maybe soon? I went with hot tea instead and was pleasantly satisfied. I will definitely return to try some more of the very reasonably priced French Fare.I've been avoiding writing this review as this place holds bittersweet memories for me, but my unwritten reviews are stacking up, and I hate being a procrastinator, so here goes...Loved the atmosphere!  Alison and I decided to come here to try their "staff meals," which are served from 10p till closing.  The restaurant usually serves two to three dishes, labeled as such, at discounted prices.  We thought it was a great way to sample menu fare w/out losing our wallets (although, in retrospect, the very small portions necessitated our ordering more, so, really, I didn't find the staff meals to offer such great savings, but I digress).  It was such a nice evening that we decided we'd dine outside.  New friends would join us at a later time that evening.  (We were lucky enough to score a table by the crackling fireplace.  So romantic- take note, guys!)Alison was hungry, so she started off w/ a bowl of onion soup.  I wished I could've had a taste- it looked so good!- but it contained an ingredient or two to which I'm still allergic, so I passed.  We both had a glass of wine each.  Friends later joined us, and so we placed an order of the frog legs ($8) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/petite-maison-scottsdale?select=WRlCnJLkxSKMeIBd-p5EiA#WRlCnJLkxSKMeIBd-p5EiA and an order of the turkey bruschetta ($10). http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/petite-maison-scottsdale?select=XKgUUPNc5BtbWBATWY_2Ug#XKgUUPNc5BtbWBATWY_2Ug  When both appetizer plates arrived, I immediately placed a second order since 2 frog legs (although these were GIGANTIC frog legs- I'd hate to encounter these frogs in some Amazonian forest, that's for sure!) and two bruschetta slices just weren't going to cut it for the four of us!The general consensus was that I was the only one in the bunch who would gladly order the frog legs again.  I did notice that the first order of frog legs was much crispier, and therefore better received, at least by moi, than the second plate.  We all loved the turkey bruschetta (pronounced w/ an "sh" instead of the hard "sk," but no worries- both pronunciations are correct, depending on the regions you find yourself in Italy, but wait, aren't we supposed to be in France??).  This app was basically a turkey salad (ala chicken salad) atop a mustard aioli and then garnished w/ fresh cranberry relish/compote.  I adored this dish!So why the bittersweet memories?  Ah, well... a couple of things, really.  First, while I loved the romantic table we had by the fireplace outside, it did get chilly at the end, and I think that made Alison want to go home early.  I also had a chance to check out Petite Maison's all-wood interiors... very nice!  A few nestled-tables surrounding a beautiful and polished bar-counter.  Petite Maison is certainly a petite, and pretty, dining facility.And what's my second bittersweet point?  Why, it's the wait till the next time I visit Petite Maison, of course!  I'll need to sock away a lot more francs before visiting again, though.  What?  You weren't expecting a juicy confession, now, were you?  ;)  Hope you enjoy the photos!Love it. Petite Maison rocks, the end. The design is cozy and refined and sexy, the staff are friendly and attentive, the service is super fast even when they are packed and the food is delicious. I've only been there late at night and hear great things about the brunch, but let me tell you, the escargot is fabulous, the salade maison is the perfect size and refreshing, and I tried a port-poached pear and creme fraiche dessert the last time I was there that was incredibly lively and light. The parking is kind of tough because of competition from nearby bars and clubs, but there's always valet if you're impatient.At last...my love has come along.When chef James Porter's "Tapino" closed in May of last year, it was a sad day indeed.  It had been one of the first tapas style restaurants in the valley and  I would miss his bold and inventive dishes.  Now, there would be one less place for tantalizing international cuisine.Back then, he said, "This phoenician will rise again."  And he has, with something that the town of Scottsdale was in dire need of.  A cozy french eatery.With only 33 seats inside, but ample pation seating, it is ideal to book a table in advance.  The place has the feel of a French country cottage, with its wooden walls, tiny chandeliers, and brocade fabrics.  French music ranging from Brigit Bardot to Jacques Brel pipes in from speakers above.My guest and I came here on a Sunday afternoon for brunch.  We were seated at the only remaining table in the place. I started off with the "Mimosa maison" with champagne, lychee, and fresh squeezed orange.  Following that came the Nutella beignets with powdered sugar.  I am a sucker for beignets, but nothing beats Jackson Square in New Orleans.My main dish was the Croque Monsieur" with shaved ham, gruyere, and sauce mornay on croissant.  I felt like I was in Paris again.  The only thing missing was a cappuccino and a cigarette.  It was amazing!Our server said "As you Wish" after every request, so we both felt like the Princess Bride and appreciated the attentiveness and care of the staff here.From what I gathered, the menu is ever-changing, but I hope that French favorites such as escargot, mussels, steak tartare,and onion soup will forever remain on the menu.  I would recommend this cozy spot for breakfast, lunch, dinner, or a romantic date.  I look forward to returning there soon for dinner, myself.I had such a good time at Petite Maison that I went there twice in one day! Who would have thought a genuine slice of Paris could be found in Scottsdale?Each dish I tried was a tasteful pleasure, from the escargot to the onion soup. A highlight for me was their preparation of steak tartare, where just a drop of hot sauce acts as a secret ingredient in bringing out the flavor. Complementing the food is a well-thought out wine list, and at very reasonable prices. If only I had more time, I'd be back for their hamburger.But perhaps the true mark of an exceptional restaurant is the customer service. I left knowing Wendy, James and Chad on a first name basis, almost as if we were old friends, in fact. I can't wait to return to Arizona, if only to come to Petite Maison one more time.The first time I visited Petite Maison, it was for lunch on a cold and rainy afternoon. As I rushed past the wet outdoor seating, I promised myself I would come back in better weather and enjoy an evening on the patio. One should never break promises, especially the ones you make to yourself. So, I was more than happy to return recently for wine and appetizers under the stars! No rain here - just a beautiful night for dining alfresco. The patio, complete with lit fireplace, was like a garden party surrounded by plants and flowers. I couldn't have asked for better atmosphere. Sitting back and sipping a nice glass of Latour Domaine de Valmoisinne Pinot Noir I thought "this is as good as it gets". What was I thinking? Of course it could get better - I hadn't even eaten yet! We weren't "full meal" hungry, so my friend and I decided on a few appetizers to enjoy along with our wine: Escargots en Croûte - this was my first experience with escargot, and I will admit that due to an unfortunate childhood snail incident I was a bit hesitant. My bravery was rewarded by the perfect combination of garlic, herbs, pernod and butter, all capped off by puffed pastry. Yes, I dipped my bread in the segments of the serving dish to absorb more garlicky goodness. Moules Maison - I am a huge fan of mussels and these didn't disappoint. They were nicely sized, and served in a white wine and thyme broth. More bread-dipping ensued... Soup à l'onion - I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE onion soup and this was among the best I have tasted. The broth was rich and flavorful, with just the right amount of caramelized onions. It was topped with bubbling gruyere cheese that made each and every bite so very good. Our server was attentive and informative - she really knew the menu! Extra points for keeping us stocked with warm herb rolls. When asked about one of the after dinner drinks on the menu, she even produced a sample of Armagnac Samalens. While I didn't try it, my friend wanted to "bathe in it" so I am assuming it was very good! I can't wait to go back...I've been to this restaurant several times for lunch - it's close to the office. The burger is good and Nicoise salad is also a personal favorite. Well it was... In fact I was put off the restaurant as a whole due to a recent experience. The last time I ordered the Nicoise salad with Salmon the potatoes were stale! And by stale I mean noticably shriveled and inside/to taste 100% stale. Given they are a main component of the salad I mentioned it to the waiter when he asked how my meal was. He seemed surprised that I would say anything other than, 'yes it's good thanks' and my response literally caught him off balance... 'I'll mention it to the chef', he said. A few minutes later the waiter returned and thanked me. Erm for what? Telling you the potatoes were stale? There was no offer to replace or sub the  potatoes. In all honesty I didn't really care - I was on a lunch break and it was more important for me to eat within the time I had available... About 5 minutes passed and a lady sitting at the bar ordered the same Nicoise salad. I watched with interest as it was placed in front of her curious as to whether they had subbed the stale potatoes. A few minutes later on a return run to the kitchen I overheard the waiter remark to the chef, 'we've got to dump those potatoes, she's the third person we've had today picking them out and leaving them aside...' So they knew about the issue before I reported it and served me, then after I complained they served them to another customer. My check arrive - there was no mention of the potatoes or any adjustment to the check. I'm done going to Petite Mason - but I'm not done telling this story to everyone I meet!!!Petite Maison, you may earn the title of petite in the size of your little Maison but your food earns the title of grande! The appearance of Petite Maison earns a point because it's this adorable little cottage situated in the middle of the hustle and bustle of Old Town. True to its French roots, the stucco exterior is full of greenery and flowers and resembles a cottage straight out of a french children's book. It's just as dainty inside. When you first walk in, it's similar to walking into an enchanted cottage with a bar on the left and intimate dining on the right. The patio is hidden and covered with plants. While petite, it really is the perfect size for the concept. The food is tres bon. I've tried their two specialties: the salmon braconne and the burger Maison. My goal is to try everything on the menu but for now I think I've gotten le creme of the crop in the cuisine department! Normally more of a sandwich girl myself, I heard that the salmon salad was pretty spectacular so I had to give it a go. The reviews don't lie my friends. It's delicious. It's buttery, delectable, refreshing and literally melts in your mouth. The poached salmon is cooked to perfection and I wish I had the entire salad and not just half! However, the burger was just as spectacular as I hoped as well. With the brioche bun and gooey cheese, it also melted in your mouth and the bread was as soft as can be. Next on my list is to try the Croque Monsieur because if it's anything like the food I've already tried, then I know my taste buds are in for a treat! All in all, Petite Maison lends for an adorable experience and I think this would be a good restaurant to go with friends, your Mom or even on a date. Or all of the above! The staff is incredibly friendly and I wish they would place petite maisons all over the valley! We need more french dining like this.Besides the fact that I stopped here for lunch during a quick break from work I felt like a "lady who lunches" in this adorable cottage.  It's so adorable that I figured there would be a large lunch crowd, but we were able to easily grab a table outside.  And oh how I love to eat outside in March...something I don't ever get to do this time of year in Chicago.I did what most ladies who lunch would do and ordered a glass of iced tea. After a few sips I remembered that I don't actually like iced tea and wish I had ordered a glass of refreshing lemonade instead. Next time!I picked better when it came to my entree. The jardin sandwich was a perfect combo of veggies and brie cheese (my fave!).  It was a nice size and quite filling as well.There was no leisurely lunch for this lady since I had to be back at work...so I appreciated that our waiter had us in and outta there within 45 min. I'd definitely lunch here again and may even go back for some wine after work hours!This past Saturday night was the pinnacle of my entire fine-dining life! I'm not joking and I'm not exaggerating, it was that damn good! Thanks to a Yelp event and Petite Maison's generosity, I was fortunate to win a 10 course meal with wine pairings for four people. I have to say, my hopes were very high and I went into the evening expecting to write a five star review. By the end of the night I was left wishing I could give a 10 star rating. Let's see if this review can do any justice to our night. Our reservation was for 7pm and I was accompanied by my fiancee and another couple.First off, our waiter/sommelier was Dustin. He was an outstanding server and a friendly young man. Dustin was unbelievably informative on each and every dish and wine served. I highly recommend requesting him when you make a reservation. Dustin gave the background and history of each wine along with how you should drink the wine with the food.We started the night with a Bordeaux Sauvignon Blanc to accompany our first two dishes: bread puffs and a chilled Sweet Corn Soup with Truffle Oil. The bread puffs were freshly baked and delicious, but the soup was especially phenomenal! A great way to start the night.Next we had a Chardonnay to go along with a Beet, Radish and Multicolored Cauliflower Salad and then a caviar dish. The salad was light and delicious. The caviar was on top of a creamy scrambled egg with truffle I believe. By itself, the caviar was a bit too fishy for me, but when combined with the egg it was very good.   I appreciated this dish even though it wasn't my favorite since it was my first time trying caviar.A Pinot Noir was the third wine and the first red of the evening. This wine was paired first with pan seared loup de mer, which literally means "wolf of the sea" in French. The fish was incredible! Definitely one of the highlights of the night! You may know it by its Italian name, branzino. We were then served an excellent soft shelled crab dish. It was fried to perfection and served atop a delectable sauce.The fourth wine of the night blew us all away! We were served a wine by Domaine Faillenc Sainte Marie winery. It was made with a Cinsault grape (pronounced "sinso", or close to that) and it provided the most unique scents and tastes that any of us at the table had experienced. I'll never forget this wine and I am determined to find it somewhere. Thank you Dustin for exposing me to its greatness! My fellow Yelpers, you have to check it out. The Cinsault was paired with duck and lamb dishes. Both meats were out of this world and prepared perfectly, just like every other dish we experienced.Lastly, the two dessert dishes were accompanied by a port. Not a big port guy, but I guess it's the wine to have when eating dessert. For a port I actually enjoyed this one. The first desert was a slice of baguette served with cheese and fruit. The second were mini chocolate doughnuts with a heavenly cream dipping sauce. Perfect ending to a perfect meal.Each dish was spaced out perfectly from each other. I was shocked to discover that the Petite Maison culinary masterpiece took four hours. The time absolutely flew by. I ate every single bite and drank every single drop. Thank you Chef James Porter, Dustin, and Yelp for what was the most incredible and memorable dining experience of my life. Seriously, wow! Great food, great company, great memories. It's what life is all about.I've recently fell in love with French Cuisine and had the chance to endure great flavors from a cozy, cottage-like, French restaurant in the heart of downtown Scottsdale, Arizona.I had made rezzies at Petite Maison via Open Table on Yelp. Parking is on the street or their nearby parking lot. As we walked up to the hostess' table, she was able to show us to our seats. Although the restaurant offers outdoor patio dining, we opted to dine inside to experience dining in this cute, kitschy restaurant.*ESCARGOT ($11 for 6 pieces, **3.5 STARS**)I was expecting to shell out the escargot from it's shell! But actually, the escargot was already pulled from it's casing and baked within an individual baking dish full of melted butter and seasonings. The dish was served piping hot (especially the plate itself) along with two slices of warm, toasted baguette. The escargot was delightful, rich and tender. The warm buttery sauce it was baked in, encapsulated every crevice and gave a lot of oomph to the escargot itself. Definitely a dish worth trying! I kinda wish though I had the fun of shelling out the escargot from it's shell, but at the same time I'm kinda glad I didn't have to get down and dirty for it! *FOIE GRAS ($18, **4 STARS**)Was OMG! Mouth-watering, delicious and worth every penny! For those of you who are unfamiliar with foie, it's duck liver fat. The French would feed the ducks corn (in this case we knew the ducks were free-range and came from a decent place). The foie gras was seared and tasted like it was a piece of steak! As you cut into a piece of the seared foie, you got a piece of fat, which glistened within the light. Add a piece of the paired cranberry chutney, cider glaze and savory donut, this dish was mesmerizing! I do concur that it's worth ordering as this dish is what the restaurant is known for! GET 'EM!!!! *BOULLIABAISE ($33, **3 STARS**)A saffron base sauce was made with fresh mussels, clams, shrimp, scallops and halibut. The seafood was cooked quite well and everything was tender. The seafood was fresh! The base of the sauce was simple and not too salty. Not the best nor the worst, but pretty decent in my humble opinion.*POISSON ($28, **1 STAR**)A seared piece of halibut was cooked well. I liked that there was a nice "sear" within the fish and it was light and flaky. The only downfall to this dish is that the lobster risotto was not executed correctly. First and foremost, the risotto was so soupy that it wasn't thick in consistency as risotto should be. In addition, after one bite of the risotto, it was quite grainy - as if the rice was not yet cooked!!!!! After flagging down our waitress, she apologized for the mistake and was embarrassed for such a thing happening. The dish was sent back to the kitchen to be corrected. After several minutes, the risotto was served. Not only did it taste slightly better, BUT it was still grainy because the risotto was not cooked well..... AND it was still soupy! Unfortunately, it was the risotto that had made the halibut a lackluster as it was not paired well together. I didn't want to embarrass the waitress again and send back the dish, but accepted it as what it was. Service (**5 STARS**) was phenomenal from our waitress. I liked the fact that she shared recommendations of what to devour since it was our first time visiting the restaurant. She even shared a few corny jokes, which made our evening fun despite the risotto fail. She apologized sincerely for the mistake and was happily to correct the error. Overall, Petite Maison is a decent French restaurant in Scottsdale, Arizona. But I've had better French food in Portland, that this place doesn't really compare! If I were to come back to Petite Maison, I would probably only order the FOIS GRAS again. I had heard their dessert is good as well. Maybe my taste buds are spoiled by Portlandia, BUT for what it's worth, Petite Maison is A-OK in my book!Yelp 2013 100 for 100 Challenge - Review #27I am far from a french food expert but I had a great experience here. The staff are over the top friendly and accommodating. I love the cozy atmosphere inside and on the patio. They have an interesting cocktail menu and a choice selection of french wine and champagne to kick off your evening. We started with the escargot which was so decadent. I had the Lamb Chops which were the best I've ever had. The Scallops my friend ordered were perfectly prepared and succulent. I highly recommend you try Petite Maison very soon it is one of the best values in Scottsdale (dinner for two minus drinks was under $80).05/18/13AZ Restaurant dinner #1 started out fair enough:  Received a voicemail from Sarah in the afternoon asking to confirm my reservation for later that evening.  Called to say I was indeed coming, but may arrive earlier and was told I would be accommodated for patio dining.  I checked in around 8:15p amidst a bustling patio setting and was relegated to the bar with a waiting time of around 15 minutes.  While looking through the wine menu, I decided I'd just eat at the bar.  Bartender Matthew was my server and obliged me with tastes of sauvignon and pinot blancs so that I may decide on a glass ($9) to accompany my three-course meal ($40).  After I'd ordered the pinot, and my prix fixe of soft shell crab, sea bass, and lemon curd tartelette, my complimentary cheese puff arrived. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/petite-maison-scottsdale?select=gX_2BIP2yqskNyxU9ugNmA#gX_2BIP2yqskNyxU9ugNmA  It was delicious, but not as great as I remembered it to be during the Julia Childs' dinner of Aug. '12.What drew me in to include Petite Maison as one of my four dinners during AZ Restaurant Week, besides having eaten here many times before, was the menu's presentation.  Each course reflected a French fusion theme: the appetizer course had a French Asian twist (char sui pork jowls, or the soft shell crab tempura); the main was French Morroccan (sea bass, or roasted lamb leg), and dessert was French italian (nutella raviolis, or lemon curd tartelette).  A "French French" supplement of foie gras was also available for $14.  One of the advantages of Restaurant Week is the opportunity to try new restaurants that I haven't been able to visit before.  I also tend NOT to have dinner at a new place without first trying out the happy hour, and my daily routines and work schedule keep me from venturing out to places I've bookmarked for years, so when RW rolls around twice a year, I earmark new places, but upon seeing PM's menu, I decided to make it my first stop.  To say I was excited about my upcoming meal was putting it very mildly!The soft shell crab was a beauty. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/petite-maison-scottsdale?select=mjKPAlDj_Y00AGQKnz_QdQ#mjKPAlDj_Y00AGQKnz_QdQ  In fact, it was such a sight to behold, that a PM regular (Todd from Savannah, GA) sitting to my right also wanted to take a photo of it!  The dish smelled fantastic!  I ate this all up in a couple of minutes-- loved the yuzu aioli, which went well with the carrot-ginger slaw.  The ginger was divine!  The dish was well-balanced and not greasy at all.Gaps between the courses were well-paced and soon, the sea bass arrived.  Matthew placed it down in front of me, hot and still wrapped in the parchment paper casing it was cooked in, and was about to cut and present it, when I asked him to pause for a moment so that I may take a "before" photo. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/petite-maison-scottsdale?select=K28gtY8lGIG2qRQ3PNzY3Q#K28gtY8lGIG2qRQ3PNzY3Q  When he finally broke the seal, the aromas that wafted out were enticing! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/petite-maison-scottsdale?select=hCVa6u5-AQBTrTxUOoZZTQ#hCVa6u5-AQBTrTxUOoZZTQ  However, after the necessary pics were taken and I had a couple of bites, I found the flavor of the fish very mild, and the cous cous, which was what made me want to order the dish, was also a bit bland to my liking.  The fish was cooked perfectly- and the veggies and cous cous were al dente.  The couple of twists of braised lemon I did in hopes to add more flavor didn't change the overall taste profile, but I finished the course anyway, since it was a small serving.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/petite-maison-scottsdale?select=tZt7FlNlSb0PAKpcGy5pJg#tZt7FlNlSb0PAKpcGy5pJgThe lemon curd tartelette wrapped up the prix fixe meal, but not before Matthew brought me a surprise- a short glass of muscat.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/petite-maison-scottsdale?select=SZPQ1zcCm84ITBJVIjCJ9A#SZPQ1zcCm84ITBJVIjCJ9A  Overall, I liked this pastry, even though I had a hard time cutting through the pastry shell each and every time.  The curd was very tangy and sweet, made sweeter by the honey drizzle, but the dollop of goat cheese did well to temper the sweet dish.  The nice glass of pinot blanc and tempura app were by far my faves tonight, and Matt obliging me with samples of wine before I ordered was appreciated, and I would've walked away with a 3.5 star experience until Matthew bade me goodbye saying "See you again next year on your once-a-year trip to Petite Maison."  He and Todd laughed, and I laughed along (I was buzzed), but what a very rude thing  to say!  By implying that I, or anyone for that matter, came to dine here only during RW to save money, Matt effectively wiped away everything that was satisfactory and made me wish I never went in the first place!It takes only ONE person to ruin a guest's otherwise terrific experience, Chef Porter.  I hope you address this!RW menu, wine, and tax $53.39 + $10 tip= $63.39What else can be said about the wonderful little restaurant that hasn't been said already?We were able to make reservations on Open Table for 7:30 on a Saturday night. We arrived on time, and the restaurant was full. The host was very apologetic and asked us if we minded waiting at the bar for a few minutes until the table was ready. We didn't mind at all. The bartender was engaging and make a mean French cocktail. Once the table freed up, they brought us over and gave us two complimentary glasses of champagne - classy touch.For apps we got the escargot and steak tartar. Little disappointed the escargot had already been removed from their shells, but they tasted amazing none the less. The tartar was served with a perfectly cooked duck's egg.For entrées OH ordered the scallop special and boy were they big and tasty! Unusually for me I did not order the steak frites, having been persuaded by the waiter that the lamb chops were to die for. He was not wrong, they were quite possibly the biggest lamb chops I have ever seen, obviously from some mutant, but super tasty, sheep.Dessert had to be the soufflé - top tip: order when you get your entrées as this baked delight takes a little while. But again, our waiter was on top of it for us.The patio looked very romantic, but obviously too hot in July. I'll be sure to come back when the weather cools off and ask to sit outside.
Pho Old Saigon Vietnamese Cuisine=This place is a dive, a dump, in a shady strip mall off an industrial part of West Grand Avenue, on the west side of the Valley of the Sun. But it has excellent Pho!It is only fitting that my 900th review on Yelp! is a review of a Vietnamese Pho Restaurant. This is the 77th DIFFERENT Pho restaurant I have eaten Pho noodles in over the past 2.5 years on Yelp. That's about 31 new Pho restaurants a year I have been averaging. More than one new Pho Restaurant  every other week! Troi Oi!Also, over 20%, or 1 out of every 5 of my reviews are for places that have never been reviewed on Yelp before. FTRs as seasoned Yelpers would call it. So suffice it to say, I don't mind venturing out and trying new places. And once in awhile, I find a little gem. Pho Old Saigon, like I said, is a classic Viet dive. Grungy strip mall, simple tables and chairs, no fancy decor, and gruff service. But when I ordered my current favorite beef noodle combination, Pho Tai Nam (rare and brisket of beef), a large bowl for only $5.95 (small is only $5.50), I was pleasantly surprised!The bowl was placed in front of me, and I could smell the deep, rich aroma of Star Anise in the broth! This is the essential smell (and flavor) of Pho! And the broth wasn't too muddy, so I knew that the broth was cooked with the flavor coaxed out of the beef bones and ox tails to create the rich aroma with plenty of Star Anise adde. It was heavenly to inhale!The beef was decent cuts of meat, and the Nam was tasty. They gave me a full plate of condiments, and something I rarely see outside of only a few places in the Little Saigons in Westminster and San Jose:Ngo Gai!Ngo Gai is the long, green, saw-toothed basil like veggie to add with the 2 stems of basil leaves they gave me to veggie up my noodle soup. Plenty of bean sprouts, green chilis slices, and a large wedge of lime were available, too!Perfect!I took a small condiment dish, filled it half with Sriracha and half with Hoi Sin sauce, and was ready to go!I tasted the broth first, all by itself, nothing floating in the soup, no added condiments yet, no sauces. Just beef broth! This is how I taste the the quality of the broth before I eat. Mmmmm. It was the best broth I have tasted in a Pho soup in many months! It equaled in flavor to the best places out of the 77 places I have eaten Pho. I sat down and watched the SBTN (Saigon Broadcast Television Network) that was playing on the TV, and started slurping! Dipped my meat into my half/half sauce, ate it, then chased it with a good slurp of noodles and broth. It was good stuff! That bowl of Pho filled my tummy from lunch time to well into the late evening, too!I had a Vietnamese Coffee with condensed milk to go with it. The place was nearly empty, only a gathering group of Vietnamese local men converging into the early afternoon to talk and eat. This is the best Pho broth I have tasted in the Valley, and in many other areas up and down the coast. The place isn't for everyone. It is hard to understand the staff, the place is dumpy, and it isn't in the greatest neighborhood. But if you don't mind a good Dive Diner atmosphere with excellent Pho broth and bargain prices, come here, breath in the broth, sip it, then start slurping!
Zizis Vegan Take-Out=Zizi's! Tucked away in the Gold Hill plaza just north of Ikea on Tryon. Storefront. Tiny. Lots of green paint. Super sweet (and talented) owner/chef Mer. Pro-veg and health paraphanalia lined walls and bulletin boards. Formerly a Mexican joint. Just behind them, one of those weird strip mall churches. A soul food place next door.But most importantly: The huge menu full of vegan-i-fied diner food, plus the ubiquitous smoothies, salads. I want to yell from the rooftops. Not only delicious, were my soy buffalo wings (the best I've ever had, if we're keeping score)... not only low sodium, my fried "fish" sammich... but relatively healthy. Not raw food healthy (lets face it - soy meat ain't the most natural substance around) but A-OK. Of course, we had to order fries to go with all of that - and even THEY were unique, slightly curried and spiced.This place is vegan start to finish but Mer pulls it off with panache - everything was super tasty and distinctly, carefully flavored. I haven't had a meal like this since leaving NYC and to be honest, some things (wings, chili) blew Kate's or even Curly's away. Take out only (but they deliver up to 18 miles out) and limited hours (12-8 daily, 'cept Sun and Mon) be damned, Zizi's is now on permanent rotation.Lawd! I've died and gone to vegan heaven. It's a shame that there aren't more vegan friendly places around Charlotte but that's what makes places like Zizis stand out. I'm still exploring their menu but so far some of my favorites are there "fish" and chips, "meat loaf" and "chickn parm". Man o man! The flavor of this food is amazing and I'd be cheating you if I didn't tell you to order the fries with the "special" seasoning. Normal fries just won't do! Biggest tip of all is to CALL YOUR ORDER IN. It'll save you some precious wait time because it takes longer than a minute to make amazing vegan food! Thumbs Up!Sincerely,One Happy Vegan!
Pizza Bellino=I am slightly confused by the reviews for Pizza Bellino, as they range from thrilled to enraged.  Pizza Bellino is one of the closer pizza places to my apartment, but I just made it here recently.  I stopped in because I was starving, and they sell single slices for $2.  I got a great slice of cheese pizza!  One slice was enough for a small meal, and the sauce is very nicely spiced.  The cheese quality is good too.The service is pretty fast when you eat in, unlike Aiello's and Mineo's.  I have always had good customer service here as well.  There are crazy good lunch specials, and they always have deals in the Squirrel Hill Pennysaver.As one of the only places that delivers in Squirrel Hill, I can imagine it can be pretty slow and tense.  I would stick to eat-in.Good for a quick slice of pizza!
Smiling Banana Leaf=Our Garmin lead us through a very sketchy neighborhood to get here.  We were just about to turn back when we noticed the area got a bit more hipster.  Figuring that I could beat the plaid & mustache out of anyone who tried to do anything ironic to my car, we decided to go in.So glad we did!  This was the best Thai food I've ever had.  The seafood was tender, the peanut chicken curry was well balanced and the summer rolls were tender and delicious.A word of caution.  Order a little less spicy than you think you should.  They are judging heat by Thai standards, not by my pallid tongue.THERE'S A VERY GOOD REASON OTHER REVIEWS FOR THIS PLACE START IN ALL CAPS!It's because this place is de-freaking-licious!If you read my other reviews on Thai places, you'll see I always get the Pad Thai as my point of comparison.  This place served me the best Pad Thai I've ever had!  My wife was pissed at me because I was too busy stuffing my face to talk to her.  The dish struck the perfect balance of deliciousness with the sweet Pad Thai sauce, scrumptious chicken, peanuts, and green onions.  The sauce was incredible.  Pad Thai I've had elsewhere is usually too bland or overpoweringly sweet and fake.  Instead, Smiling Banana Leaf has cemented itself in my mind as the gold standard for Pad Thai.In the midst of stuffing my face with noodles, I managed to set aside some time to breathe and take in the atmosphere.  I'm glad I called ahead for a reservation because there were only a dozen or so tables in the restaurant--and it was packed.  The lighting was low and the setting was intimate.  I would definitely recommend this place for a date night--if you can control how fast you eat...  Remember to get a bottle of wine beforehand (unlike me).  It's BYOB.This place is delicious!Definitely make a reservation. I was skeptical when the hostess recommended making a reservation for a Tuesday night, but I'm so glad we did. The restaurant was packed! Granted, the place is small, but business was definitely booming. My husband and I ordered the chicken satay as an appetizer and the red curry and pad thai as our entrees. All of it was amazing. Loved the sauce that came with the chicken satay. I ordered my curry mild (level 3 on the spiciness scale) and it was perfect. I've noticed other people have mentioned the dishes weren't spicy enough - I guess I'm just a woos! My husband's pad thai was also tasty, probably some of the best pad thai I've had! Our server was attentive and friendly. They were the only server for the entire restaurant, but I never felt like we got lost in the crowd. My only complaint was not at the restaurant itself, but at my husband, haha! He forgot that it was BYOB and so we were left sipping on water. I don't think we'll forget a bottle of wine next time though! This place also does take out, which I'm sure we'll take advantage of one of these days.This place is so so highly rated and talked about I was surprised at how small it actually is!  I can't imagine what the wait would be for a dinner, let alone a weekday lunch, where every table was full still.  But it's super cute and intimate with the benches lined in cozy pillows.  My Pad Thai was good, but oh so small.  I think I received the lunch portion.  I didn't specify, so it was my bad.  But I gobbled my dish up in about 5.5 seconds and I wanted more because it was so good!  The shrimp was plump and the sauce was sweet, just how I like it.  Maybe it's my big American appetite, but I definitely left hungry.  Just a little taste of magic!Very good Pad Thai, yes.  But here's the thing... This place is SO highly rated I feel like I need to go back and be adventurous!  Next time, adventure's on!I can get down with the Smiling Banana Leaf. The dining room is cozy,  gorgeous and ornate from the jade green glass table tops to the celestial mural painted on the ceiling. Each table had it's own glass vase filled with vibrant yellow tulips too.This was a truly relishable dining experience. My waiter had the face of a Calvin Klein model and I detected a Western European accent, was it Austrian, or German? I dunno but he had it going on! Any who I had the shrimp tempura , pork dumplings and pineapple curry with shrimp.  The shrimp tempura was cooked too hard and was dark not light. That is the one and only complaint I have for SBL. The shrimp tempura was served with a peanut dipping sauce that was both sweet and tangy and full of peanuts.  The was a very nice touch.  Thai food has me spellbound.  I cannot seem to get enough , I blissfully devoured every spoonful of my pineapple curry with shrimp. SBL is BYOB so I brought along a four pack of wine coolers.  Day drinking at it's finest.  Is BYOB just a dinner thing,  I am still new to the BYOB game.
Lazy Joe's Fish & Chips=A locals' place specializing in Fish & Chips is always a welcome addition to the neighborhood!A quick look at the menu and with some help from the older gentleman working the counter and fryer - we put our orders in and took a seat.* 2 Cod Fillets ($8.89)* 2 Haddock Fillets ($8.89)Both orders came with fries, coleslaw, tartar sauce, and hush puppies.  I personally like the cod fillets over the haddock, while the Husband enjoyed the haddock over the cod.  The fish had a nice batter to it and we ate it all up.It's a simple restaurant with no frills that serves up some decent fish and chips on red and white checked paper in baskets.Other things on their menu worth checking out include fried catfish, popcorn shrimp, fried shrimp, calamari, soft shell crab, steamers, fried clams, fried oysters, and chicken fingers.Came back to redeem our second Groupon. Love this place. Chatted with Lazy Joe for quite some time. He told us to keep an eye out for another Groupon available in the near future. YAY! Although I'll come back without one any time. They're that good and cheap.The food was just as great as the last time. My fella got the AYCE shrimp, which is a steal at $11.99. I ordered the softshell crab sandwich which was also delightful. I haven't had one thing I don't like here yet! Which is rare for me, since I'm not usually a big fan of deep fried food. Everything's cooked to order, so you might have a bit of a wait, but it's worth it.Friendly owners and staff, great food and convenient location and hours. What's not to love about this place.Glowing recommendation from me! I'll be back - soon.Gluten free fried goodness! This is what I think every time I eat here. They have gluten free fried fish & chips and also onion rings. Their prices are super reasonable too! Located on rainbow & 215 area it's a great location. Also the employees are super nice. I suggest everyone to try this hidden gem!Dear Lazy Joe and family and friends and employees of Lazy Joe's Fish and Chips and all reading this review, I am glad Lazy Joe's Fish and Chips is open 6 days a week (everyday except Sunday). I have tasted the cod, the haddock, and the catfish which I liked very much for its simplicity and texture and I like the counter-order, neighborhood come-as-you-are atmosphere. I really liked the seasoned fries, Cole Slaw and tartar sauce. I especially like the price (all you can eat on Friday and Saturday all day). I really, really like that your staff seems to be treated like family, and your customers are too.To those people who don't like your batter, who don't like that you are closed on Sunday, who have no appreciation for the hard work you and your staff put into every meal... To those people, Lazy Joe, I say "forget about it" and I say you should "forget about them"!Lazy Joe, your restaurant is an anchor of the neighborhood. Your staff deserve respect. Your food is legit. And that's why this review is 5-stars. Because, Lazy Joe, you deserve 5-star reviews for the hard work and decency you and your staff put into each and every single meal.And the rest of 'em can K1CK R0CKS!
Las Lupitas=Las Lupitas follows the 3 "B"s that we always look for in Spanish: Bueno, Bonito, y Barato. Translation: "Good, Pretty (In this case appealing to the eye), and cheap!"These are some of the best tacos you'll have in Charlotte, but all food is to go. Order 1 lb. of meat, either the Carnitas or Barbacoa, 1 lb. of Fresh Cheese, and 1 lb. of tortillas. The tortillas are practically free, $1/lb, and you can see the ladies making them from scratch in the back. When I went they had 3 sauces for sale at the register and I bought the 2 spiciest ones, the spiciest one was way to spicy for my taste and I love spice. This is a great spot to hit up before a picnic or before having people over for "make your own taco" night. Best deal in town!I am not sure if they speak English or not, but since everything is out for you to see it would be very easy to order by pointing, please do not be intimidated, everyone who works there is SUPER nice. If you need a translator, I translate for tacos!Once you enter, head to the deli line or straight ahead to the lady with baskets on the counter. Someone will take your tortilla and/or meat order. Once you have your order head back to the front of store to pay at register. Add on salsa, avocado, or bag of cilantro/onion at the register. Those condiments need to be paid with cash. Everything else can be paid with credit/debit.The tortillas are absolutely amazing fresh and the real deal. Love their salsa verde too! Their carnitas are are okay...a bit greasy. The cheapest dinner you'll get for sure. Regardless, you can't beat homemade fresh tortillas. A must stop when in Charlotte.
Maryln's Fish & Chips=Just happened to be working in the area and clicked on my Yelp nearby button. It was a Friday and what more could you ask for other than some tasty Fish.This is one of those restaurants that you would not typically go to unless you are in the vicinity or knew about it before coming here. The building is pretty old and they are located in an older part of PHX.They have an interesting menu with all sorts of fried critters as well as burgers, pastrami sandwiches and even the famous Philly cheese steak. Nice!Ordered the 3 pc Catfish / 4 pc Shrimp dinner and a side of Jalapeno Poppers. The poppers were stuffed with cream cheese and came with a side of ranch. The fish dish came with french fries and a side of tartar and cocktail sauce.Really enjoyed everything that showed up on my plate. The meals were simply prepared with a very casual eating area to enjoy yourself. Both the catfish and shrimp were tasty and I'm looking forward to coming back again in the future.This is not one of those high end eating establishments and you can even hit their drive thru when you're in a hurry. Just kick back and enjoy a cool mom and pop restaurant where you can actually see the family hard at work.See ya there next time when I'm in the area. Who doesn't like a big basket of fish and chips when you are hungry and just can't resist the craving. FISH FRY TIME!4.25 STARS
Chili's Grill & Bar=I've had way too much Chili's in my life. I keep coming back though, because my husband really likes Chili's. *sigh* The Chili's located off the Decatur and 215 is our most frequented Chili's seeing that it's closest to home. I'm a fan of the improvements Chili's has been making - they've really been stepping up their game. The restaurant here has been remodeled and looks more trendy, the presentation of the food has also been upgraded, a rewards system has been introduced, and a tablet at each table allows diners to order drinks and desserts and even pay their check. Chili's used to email coupons out like crazy but has ceased the coupon disbursement ever since the rewards system was launched. :( I pretty much get the same thing every time I come to Chili's. You guessed it, it's the black bean vegetarian burger! I get the Guacamole burger and customize the hell out of it, i. e., annoy the shit of our waitress. The fries are always awesome at Chili's. Dessert is meh.Service is mostly good here and we always eat in the bar area at a booth.PRO TIP: Come on Sundays for all day Happy Hour and eat in the bar to get FREE chips and salsa! Worth a Return Visit?It's inevitable. My guy loves Chili's.YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #142
Showmars Restaurant=11/25/11Decided to grab a quick bite to eat while the rest of the family went shopping, so I popped over to the food court to see what I could find.  Among the national food chains, such as Chick Fil-A, The Great Steak & Potato Co., Sbarro, Orange Julius, and Subway, I spotted Showmars and recalled reading a few good reviews on it, so I made a beeline and checked out the menu, which proved to be quite extensive: gyros, souvlakis, burgers, pita burgers, seafood platters, including fried flounder, hot dogs, and even baklava by the silce ($1.99, fyi)!  Service seemed very friendly and eager to help.  After a few minutes and a few questions, I decided to go w/ an Old-fashion Jr. pita burger (chili, cheese, coleslaw, onions, and mustard), hold the mustard, and a side of fries, for a grand total of $6.  (FYI, Jr. burgers feature one patty, regular has two.)  Combo plates were available, but I didn't want anything from the soda fountain.  Paid for the meal and was given a receipt and a buzzer.  Thought I'd check out the buffet spread at Maki of Japan (right across from Showmars) in the meantime, but I hadn't even crossed the path of chairs and tables to get to the other side of the room when my buzzer started to vibrate-- that was fast!  My platter looked very nice, but I lamented that my pita burger lacked surface veggies, not even lettuce (!), and the manager told me that only the original burgers had lettuce and tomato.  However, he offered to add lettuce for me- very nice!  I enjoyed the chili-burger-coleslaw combo; however, I did find the whole sandwich a bit sweeter than I'd prefer-- most likely from the sugar in the coleslaw.  Also, I would've eaten more of the pita had it been crisped/toasted.  No matter, as eating less of the pita allowed me to enjoy more of the crinkle-cut fries- the best part of the entire meal!  Those who like saltier fries may want to grab a salt packet or two, as my fries were a bit under-salted, even for my taste.Was happy to find something local in this mall's food court, and I wouldn't mind coming back to try other items on the menu!
Albo Pizza=Ok so we were at Dino's bar and were a bit hungry deciding what we were going to do to fill our tummy's as we had not had dinner. We were drinking and needed something on our stomach as to prevent the psycho drunk after effect as well.Albo's pizza is located behind Dino's bar and has a nice indoor seating option if you choose to dine in.We opted to place an order for take out in which they actually walked it over and delivered to us at Dino's so we did not have to wait :) Yay!We ordered a large Albo Special:pepperoni, sausage, ground beef, ham, onions, mushrooms, black olives, green peppers Pizza was good, and plenty cheesy which is a bonus as they are a pizza shop that does not skimp on the cheese! That is something that drives me nuts when you have to add cheese as an extra topping just to get a decent amount, not here!Pizza is good and the friendly personal service is even better :)My next trip to Dino's we may just have to order another pizza from Albo's :)They also had several pasta dishes that looked yummy as well! They have a wide and varied menu to choose from and not limited to pizza.
Blue Dust=Short version: Cheap, delicious, friendly, unique. Get the crab curry soup.Longer version: Oh sweet, loving, though possibly non-existent God; this place is unfortunately hidden yet wonderfully comforting. I wish I could try everything. My only option, obviously, is to go back in order to try everything.I went with a few friends on  Tuesday night after having to go to the Verizon store at the Waterfront and not really wanting to eat at Red Robin (nothing wrong with Red Robin, though). They had 25 cent pierogies on special--obviously, we had 25 of them. They were perfectly browned, crisp on the edges, and after a little searching we managed to find the pile of onions that they were cooked with. The spinach artichoke dip was equally delicious, leading me to have faith in the other appetizers as well.For our main course, we all ended up splitting crab curry soup, fried zucchini, and the surf'n'turf (half of a crabcake sandwich and half of a house-smoked brisket sandwich). They had a sweet collection of craft beers on tap and the dude who served us was probably the nicest person I've ever met within the food industry. The crab curry soup was simple and exactly the dish I'd go back for.I can't wait to go back and explore the rest of what Blue Dust has to offer.You know the little dive bar, right by the tracks on your way to the Waterfront?  The place you have driven by 20K times and never thought to actually stop in cause it's a dive bar?  Hold on to your seats, folks, cause this isn't a dive bar. It's actually a freaking fantastic watering hole and surprisingly healthy and inventive pub.  One of my friends stopped by here and wrote something on facebook about it that made me think it was worth my while and it was way better than even expected. The hubby and I decided to split everything after ordering some beers - cranberry ale for me (not nearly cranberry-ish enough) and a Bell's Christmas White for him (excellent choice).  Their menu is a mix of reasonably healthy and nice and awesomely naughty - perfect for the holidays.  We started with the fried zucchini which we use as a bit of a guide as we eat our way around Pittsburgh.  Almost everyone has it, almost everyone does it horribly, horribly wrong.  Blue Dust was a fabulous exception.  The zucchini appeared to have been picked that day, it was sliced super thin and breaded and deep-fried to perfection.  It was served on a bed of lettuce which did pretty-up the plate, but also served to soak up the grease.  We then asked to split the lamb chili.  I assumed we would be given two spoons and a "go for it" kind of attitude, but they actually split the order in two and gave us two orders of the delicious garlic bread that accompanied it.  It was amazing!  Seriously amazing.  It was just lamb-y enough that you knew that you were eating lamb, but not so lamb-y that you were wondering if you were on the farm.  It was slightly spicy and really just a perfect winter meal.  We also split the sliders - crab, smoked turkey and brisket.  They were all amazing.  Very different and very tasty.  They came with local-made chips and a fantastic smoked tomato salsa that I really could have had a massive jar of to take home. Unfortunately, between the 2 and 3 course, I discovered the liquor menu.  Infused root beer bourbon?  Infused chai vodka?  A mixed drink with Crabbie's ginger beer?  Why didn't I look at you earlier???We will be back.  Many, many, many times.  A must stop on your way to the Waterfront.I stopped by last night before seeing a movie at the Waterfront, due to the convenience of the location and having a City Dining Card for this place.  Given the high ratings, I was expecting a solid meal here. Unfortunately, however, this place failed to deliver on several counts.Our visit got off to a shaky start when CM and I walked in and seated ourselves, per the instructions of the sign at the host stand. We sat at a table close to the front, and after perusing the menu for several minutes, nobody came to greet us.  We eventually approached to the bar to order, and the bartender apologized and said he hadn't seen us come in, and someone finally came to provide us with another menu and table service. When our waiter came to take our order, we ordered the red bean dip to share, my dining partner ordered the brisket tacos, and I ordered the lobster roll, which came to $34. Thankfully, the food came out pretty quickly after ordering.  In my opinion, the bean dip, which was thick and savory, and came with tortilla chips, was the best thing we ordered.  Although I didn't try CM's tacos since I don't eat beef, he mentioned they had so much meat that they were difficult to eat.  Despite this, he enjoyed them, however.As for the lobster roll, one bite revealed that the toast was burnt.  Despite habitually taking photos, I'm not in the habit of inspecting my food closely before eating it, since I've never been served something burnt before, and the lighting wasn't the best.  Because the toast on the other half of the sandwich wasn't burnt as badly, I was famished, and service wasn't the most attentive, I ate it.  The lobster seemed a bit tough, and the ingredients weren't super-flavorful, but it was okay.  Both entrees came with tortilla chips, as well as a oniony salsa that I wasn't a fan of.  After about 10 min., our server returned to check on us, and I pointed out the burnt bread, and he offered to rectify it by either making anther sandwich or bringing fresh bread.  Because I was halfway through the sandwich, I chose the latter.  While he should never have served me a sandwich with burnt bread, I do give him credit for fixing the situation.During the time that we were there, a weekly stand up comedy show that occurs during this time (8-10pm) was going on.  Although I had noticed that this would be the case, I forgot to mention it to CM.  Neither of us are huge stand up comedy fans, but one of the comedians was funny--the others were varying degrees of awkward.  The show is free, though.  It's possible that the presence of the show may have detracted from our service, but I can't say for sure.Overall, I was disappointed in my experience at Blue Dust, although I do give them credit for correcting the burnt toast issue.  Perhaps the food tastes better once you've had a few beers, but for my part, I wasn't super-impressed. I'd be willing to give this place a second chance, but it'll probably be awhile before I do so.
Pho Thanh=I've been a Da Vang devotee for years and wanted to try a new Vietnamese place tonight and Pho Thanh didn't fall short. In fact, I think I might like this place a little better than Da Vang, but I'll rotate between the two since they're both so good.First off, the portions are gigantic! The Bun bowl could easily serve two and I had tons of leftovers for lunch tomorrow. They use the fat rice noodles instead of the vermicelli, but I think it made the dish a little heartier and certainly easier to eat with chopsticks.Hubby had the Pho and the broth was amazing! Savory, a little salty, and the spices were perfect. Perfect to warm your bones on a rainy day.The restaurant was more of a cafe style than family sit down, but exceptionally clean and the service was great. There was quite a diverse crowd in there for a Sunday night and everyone's dishes looked fantastic.Is it?  Can it be?  A Vietnamese spot I like better than Da Vang?Yes...Since my Vietnamese food loving friend introduced me to Pho Thanh a few weeks ago (thank you!!), I have already enjoyed multiple visits.  It is that good.  They are open early, too (8:30am!) so it is a good choice for a post-hike late breakfast/early lunch.A typical visit starts off with the #1 spring rolls.  They are huge - rice paper stuffed with shrimp, pork, lettuce, mint and sprouts and (yay!) served with peanut sauce.  Sometimes a Bahn Mi (sandwich) gets thrown into the mix - fresh soft bread and ample portions of warm pork.  On to the Main Event... Pho.  Their take-out menu states on the front "The Best Beef Noodle Soup In Town" - believe it.  They are not kidding.  I am a creature of habit, and always have the #113 - beef noodle soup with filet mignon tenderloin beef.  I like to have the raw beef served on the side, so I can "cook" it myself in the hot broth.  I am tempted to ask for extra beef the next time I am there.I don't know how long I can last until I need to go back.PhoIt's pronounced "/feu/"...does that help anybody?Okay...sounds like "fun" only without the "n", and "Thành" sounds like "tang", minus the "g".If you run "Pho Thành" through a translator, it translates as either "Cheese Bar" or "The Streets"...or, as they say in Ho Chi Minh City (nee Saigon)..."Cheese Bar".I couldn't say what a cheese bar has to do with this delightful little place...I didn't see any cheese on the menu, nor is there anything cheesy about the place...just straight ahead, well made, tasty (and although Dr. Andrew Weill shudders when he hears me say it)...healthy Vietnamese food!And while I'm on the subject of Dr. Weill...since when did a sweaty 350 pound recluse (with the remains of the entire turkey dinner with all the "trimmin's" that he evidently had for breakfast floating around in his beard), become the "healthy living" guru for a generation?I'm puzzled...not that I don't want his lifestyle...I do!Still, it's a mystery!There's no mystery at Pho Thành...just unpronounceable menu selections and great Pho!I've learned over the years to make my selections either by pointing at the menu and smiling or by saying things like "I'll have a number 2 and number 38, with a diet Coke, please".Back when I was very young and still had my swagger on, I would stroll into one of the great Vietnamese joints in Portland, sit down and say "Pho Me"!So funny!...At least to me.That phrase led to several misunderstandings, "incidents"  and police reports, as well as a lengthy stint of child support payments for little Nguyen Dat S. (although he really looks nothing like me...but I do get a Christmas card from him and his family every year...nice!).But that's the dimly remembered past!Yesterday, I met a couple of my buddies in the Mekong Delta (you know, the West Side vortex of great Pho...the triangle between Maxim, Da Vang and Pho Thành) and we had a great time at lunch!My buddies are both attorneys, suckling at the supple twin teats of misery and money and the stories they tell at lunch would make most people writhe in despair...but not us...we are made of sterner stuff!We split an order of Goi Cuon and Cha Gio and dug into our respective bowls of Pho...delicious, delicious Pho ...no question!All of the standard high quality Pho prep tools are there to perfect your soup...sawtooth herb, basil, bean sprouts, and enough hot chili in several different forms to cause you severe pain the next morning...it lets you know you're alive...important at my age!This particular Mekong Delta doesn't require a Ghe Nang or a Swift Boat to navigate, just hop on the light rail or risk your life in Camelback traffic and drop on by.Just don't say "Pho Me"...I had some really, really good Vietnamese food in this nondescript restaurant in the mini shopping strip at the northwest corner of Camelback and 17th Av. I came here with my friend and fellow yelper John M. around 3 PM on a Saturday to avoid the lunch rush, and it turned out to be a good idea. With fewer people in the restaurant at that time, service was relatively fast. The food was great ... and for the quantity and quality you get, it was unbelievably cheap! This is probably one of the best food bargains in the city. Why won't I give it 5 stars? Well, I wish they would be more conscientious about cleaning the floor. It wasn't really filthy, just littered with some napkins and drinking straws from the lunch rush when we were there. But I'll definitely be back again and again, because the food is so darn good and so inexpensive!Tonight was my second visit to Pho Thanh and again, I left with a very full belly (and not just because I'm pregnant!).  This place offers consistent, affordable Vietnamese food in large portions.Highlights for me include the fresh young coconut, the shrimp spring rolls, and the stir fry noodle dishes.  Although, everyone who I've seen go with the pho seems pretty happy as well.  The atmosphere is nothing special, but the company you go with will hopefully make up for that!  I went with my brother the first time and for the International Supper Club kick-off tonight, so needless to say, I was entertained during both visits.  Service is attentive although I did have to ask for my water to be refilled a couple of times.  They were great with our large group and were fine doing separate bills as well.  Oh, and they can do vegetarian entrees and pho upon request.Bottom line: Pho Thanh is a pho-nomenal choice for affordable Vietnamese in Pho-enix!For a year, I passed by Pho Thanh every day on my way to work. For a year, I never thought once to step inside. For a year, I had no idea how much I was missing out! This visit was a visit of firsts. My first time at this restaurant and my first time eating Vietnamese food. Both were spectacular! This restaurant isn't much to look at on the outside, but it's got everything it needs on the inside including friendly staff, cheap prices and delicious dishes. I will admit that the menu is completely overwhelming for a newbie like me. I had no idea what I wanted, but luckily I was dining with pros so they guided me in the right direction. I started with the spring rolls and opted for a pork bun. The spring rolls were really refreshing and I enjoyed the peanut sauce to accompany it. I wasn't a huge fan of the basil and/or cilantro that came inside, so next time I would ask for them to leave the herbs out. The bun was delicious and huge! I snuck some of my remaining peanut sauce in there and poured in the sauce that came with it. I had no idea that it was fish sauce but I'm glad I didn't because I gave it a chance and really liked it! The bun had pork, noodles and eggs rolls. I only ate about half of it and was completely stuffed but not in a bad way. It was the perfect amount of food with the right spices and heartiness. As I enjoyed my meal and company, I looked around and noticed how crowded this place gets with every walk of life!Guess how much my bill was for spring rolls, bun and a diet coke? Around $8-$10. I'm serious! For the price alone, I will return, but for the food and friendly service, I will return sooner.I am little late to review this, but better now than never.   I had a fun time attending the first Yelp AZ International Supper Club at Pho Thanh.   It was a perfect pick by Gabi as I was really craving for Vietnamese food that night.  I had ordered the Bun Bi Cha Gio (vermicelli with eggrolls, seasoned shredded pork, vegetables, crushed peanuts and fish sauce).  This is the best noodle dish especially when outside is so hot!   It will definitely cool you off.   I also had the whole young coconut.  The coconut juice and the meat were so fresh.  You might need to have some serious elbow grease to remove the meat inside the coconut.  I would warn the people sitting around in case you hit them.  Sorry to be so critical but I was so excited to have a "Vietnamese" restaurant in the 'hood.First off, I would like to humbly say, I eat Pho monthly, if not weekly.  Whether that be homemade or at a sit down, I slurp it frequently.Ironically, as the business name might suggest, I actually do not come here for the Pho.  My food instinct tells me the root problem lies in the broth.  Not enough beefy, meaty flavors.  You can throw as much cooked meat into a bowl of Pho but that doesn't make the broth better, in addition to the excess oily content.  There's definitely room to improve!Aside that, there are plenty of other dishes here that are very satisfying and evidently keeps me coming back. ** BBQ Pork Banh Mi (Bun Me): If you ever had a Chinese Char Siu Bun, it's basically the same thing but in a baguette with fresh vegetables.  The bun is slightly toasted and served warm.  Definitely, a winner in my book.  ($2.50) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gQMAcDm8kv8ev7x2BshMwg?select=ruAAr86Q1SOeE8ovHHUhRA** Beef Stew with Banh Mi: The stew broth is fantastic! Lots of flavor from the beef!  Just exactly how I would like it! Take a piece of bread, dip, soak in the broth, and eat away! Yum! (Under $6)** Bun Bo Hue: Besides Pho, this is typically one of the other go-to soup bowls.  Don't let the redness in the soup or the pork blood scare you, its the reason why its good! Ha, ha! The best part is eating the bone-in pig skin and meat. (Under $6)http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gQMAcDm8kv8ev7x2BshMwg?select=aHJ6RhEArYbl4194Z6c-Sg** Luc Lac w/ a side of White Rice: French inspired pan seared steak and salad.  The awesome flavors that is fused with the caramelized onions paired with fresh, crisped salad drenched in special, citrus vinaigrette.  Caveat: a tad oily, but it's fine!  When you hear it SIZZLING on a hot, stoned plate is when you know it's good! ($9)http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gQMAcDm8kv8ev7x2BshMwg?select=dxw6_gLECBo-fOFNvQImng** Ca Ri Ga (Chicken Curry and Potato): If you like curry, you will most definitely enjoy this.  It's basically a soup bowl of brothy chicken with yellow curry and potato.  Similar to the Beef Stew, you can order it with a Banh Mi (baguette), OR have it with Vermicelli noodles or White Rice.  I would go with a warm, toasted baguette, so you can dip, soak the curry and eat it in small parts. (Under $6)http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gQMAcDm8kv8ev7x2BshMwg?select=ok5oYmXE3cIQ3vfJl8gRXQThese are just some of my favorites that I get here, but you can certainly order much more on their extensive menu.  I stick with what I know and like, typically.The most important element of this place is the pricing! For lunch, its hard to beat!  The service is okay, they always start you off with a cold, ice water with lemon and then take your order after a few minutes of being seated.  Lastly, if you crave desserts, they are refrigerated and visible as you come up to pay for your meal. If you are lucky enough to work around or twelve minutes away (like I do), I highly recommend getting your Viet fix here.My pants get tight when I think about Pho Thanh.There is little else that I can say that would more accurately convey my love for this restaurant.We ate here on Friday night.  The food was good, but our server and the location sucks ass.As soon as we pulled into the parking lot (we got the last parking spot in the whole lot) we were accosted by some cracked out, black dude looking for a couple of bucks.  We told him we had ONE dollar and he looked annoyed that we didn't have more.  I scrounged around in my purse for the dollar as he peppered my husband (who was halfway in the car unbuckling the baby from her carseat) with questions about if we also had some change we could give him too, my husband repeatedly said NO we had ONE dollar.  After I slipped the dollar to my husband he offered it to Mr. Crack Head who promptly snatched it up and started across the parking lot to hit up the other people pulling in, and my husband was so pissed that he didn't even have the decency to say "thanks" that he started yelling after him about learning some manners.  Ugh!!   Anyway, we get inside and I have half a mind to complain to the restaurant management that they have someone outside harassing all their patrons, but the cold stare from the less than friendly server we had, a young Vietnamese dude with a neck tattoo, dissuaded me from attempting anything more than giving him my order number.  I can understand that a young man in his mid-twenties (?) probably doesn't want to be working tables in (presumably) his family's restaurant at 7:30 on a Friday night, and I can even imagine that maybe, just maybe, his English isn't that good (but I kinda doubt it, he was probably born and raised in the US, unlike the older man at the register), but I simply can't understand why he couldn't fake a smile for us and make us feel slightly less like annoyances, and more like valued guests here to spend their hard cash and enjoy dinner??     Okay rant over, sorry.So we both ordered the beef Pho with brisket and the food arrived within a blazingly fast 5 minutes.  The soup was hot, hearty and delicious!  No complaints there.  At the same time we ordered the food we each also ordered the sweet young, whole coconut for drinks and, unfortunately, it took another 10 minutes for the coconuts to arrive.  But when they did arrive they were delicious.We were never checked on after we had our food and our drinks were dropped off at our table, but I guess that's okay since we didn't need anything else and we were able to make due without our server's cold stare and indifferent attitude.  Anyway, the food is fast, cheap and delicious.  The bill was only $16 for Pho and coconut drinks for 2 adults.  You can't beat that price with a stick. Minus a star for the awful location.  Minus a star for the crappy server.  Aside from that the food is worth braving the location and service.I think that if the management could tell 'Neck Tattoo' to smile and pretend to be friendly, and to check on the guests at least once, it'd do A LOT to help with the customer service perception.Oh, and maybe also invest in a security guard to chase the panhandling, crack head out of the parking lot too...  ;)I'm definitely a Big Fan of this place and all the yummy items that they serve. The menu here is very large and the prices are very reasonable. The hardest part may be deciding what to order if you are not familiar with Vietnamese food.Been waiting a long time to visit this place. Seen a lot of great and happy reviews. Just happened to be in the area and had to check them out.Both inside and outside are very simple and basic. This could be how they keep the cost down and still deliver great quantity and quality. I was surprised how large the inside eating area was and the large amount of slurping customers enjoying their meals. Nice!Usually get the Pho with everything and in the largest bowl they serve. Here it is the #11 and it is huge. Decided to try out the Spring Rolls as well. This is always a good test to compare against other similar places.Both the Pho and the Spring Rolls were good. Really liked the soup and can't wait to come back and try some of their other tasty choices. Got my eyeballs and taste buds set for some spicy Bun Bo Hue next. Service is friendly and you may need to wave one of them down to get seated. When you are done you simply get up and pay at the register. This is pretty much the normal routine in these type of restaurants.Bring a hearty appetite and get ready to leave feeling full. I was able to get out of here with a crisp $10 bill and was concerned that I might explode. DYN-O-MITE!4.5 STARSLove the new improvements! They've taken over the adjacent store space so the restaurant is now bigger than ever. Service is always fast and the food is excellent and inexpensive, as always. This place is now the standard by which I judge all other Vietnamese restaurants in the Valley.
Cabo Wabo Cantina=If i could rate Cabo Wabo a negative score I would. We arrive just in time for Karaoke, which I would give 5 Stars.  But that's where the good ends. We were not actually sat by the hostess just pointed toward the tables. No menus, so I'm assuming the frat boy waiter assumed we didn't want service. When I asked for menus he looked at me like I was nuts. Then 5 seconds after getting the menus he asked us, "so are you gonna order something?" Really?He never asked us if wanted drinks, I went up to the Bar to get mine. For a weak 8 oz margarita it was TWENTY DOLLARS!!!! For a pre-made Slurpee with house alcohol!!   I would never go back there again. They treated us like trash and we did nothing to deserve it. And to top it off I accidentally left an expensive souvenir behind, when I returned they didn't have a lost n found they said "we just throw it away". I tried to express the whole experience to the manager, his response was "oh well". WOW - worst service EVER!After missing out on trying the Bacchanal buffet with my friends (I got in a few hours later than they did), I was determined to try something new so that I would still have something else to write about.  Fortunately/unfortunately, that "something new" ended up being Cabo Wabo...which always seemed like more of a drinking spot than as a place to eat at.  Now I know why!Although Cabo Wabo isn't a mainstream type of chain restaurant, it's still pretty much a chain, and the food really reflected that.  I kept expectations to a minimum for my CARNITAS TACOS, and what I got was pretty mediocre...and overpriced.  Two tacos, Spanish rice, and beans for $15?  I know it's The Strip and all, but damn (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cabo-wabo-cantina-las-vegas?select=vguZqf4mTUutzMe9wgw8Sw#J9PUAWgzOp0UnrzmnXG4bg).  The taste of the carnitas was driven heavily by their generic sauce rather than the savory, seasoned flavors you'd get from something authentic, but at least the tacos were fairly full...so yay?As far as our drinks went, my friends seemed mostly satisfied with what they had.  I ordered the CHUPA CHUPA cocktail, which was kind of fun to drink but not particularly amazing.  Essentially, they flip a mini Corona into a regular margarita at your table, and you have to quickly drink it before it all overflows (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cabo-wabo-cantina-las-vegas?select=vguZqf4mTUutzMe9wgw8Sw#RV-cRSWcsgg5ITs4n6OcAQ).  Creative and unique, but pricey considering it wasn't that heavy on the alcohol. Amazingly though, what hurt more than overpaying for generic and medicore food was my lack of reception stopping me from checking in on Yelp when we first sat down.  As petty and trivial as that sounds, I would have seen the "Free margarita with the purchase of an entrée" deal before I ordered, and I could have saved myself $12 on that Chupa Chupa!  Ugh...A rating on Yelp is just an average, and after 300 plus reviews I think 2&1/2 stars is a little harsh.  After Yelp filters some reviews its up to us to decipher  the reviews that are left.  I've noticed several bad reviews recently for Cabo Wabo's & I must say I am surprised.  We arrived on a Thursday night & knew we would probably have to kill some time drinking while we waited for a seat, tough life I know.  We were pleasantly surprised when we were sat immediately at the outdoor bar over looking the strip with a clear view of the fountains shooting off across the street @ Bellagio.  When the wind blew just right we could feel  the mist from the fountains, which felt so good in the dry Vegas heat.  Cabo Wabo's was crazy packed but the bar back grabbed us some menus & took initiative getting us our first round of drinks (frozen margaritas & red bull vodkas) while we waited for our server to machete her way threw the weeds she was knee deep in.  It was a gorgeous night to catch up with my Pops & his wife who live here in Las Vegas & we could not have had a better time.   I can't stress enough how if you go into a restaurant with a chip on your shoulder anticipating bad service your gonna have a shitty experience.  You live in and or you are visiting a great city to party and have fun.   Raise your glass, have a drink, do a shot.... and chill out!  I thought the the food came out in a reasonable time and had no complaints with my service.   The guacamole & chips were money, the chicken chimichangas were as good as it gets (especially after kicking back several margaritas).   I thought my fish tacos with beans & rice were the bomb & devoured every bite.   I was so happy I got my dad to to eat some Mexican fare that night it could not have gotten any better.  This was one bill I had no problem picking up & we will be back on our next visit to Las Vegas.I know the reviews are mixed but I would roll the dice & check it out!YOU'LL BE SORRY IF YOU DINE HERE.I ended up at this beer joint because I was herded into it by a group of friends, who were starving and just wanted to sit down and eat.THE FOOD: Is commercial at best and expensive. A better dinning experience can be had by buying a Swanson Mexican TV dinner and taking it to your room. To make things worse, the service was slow. The waitress acted bothered when someone from the party made a request.THE BILL: They added an 18% gratuity and some other mystery charge( check your receipt for it)  When my friend confronted the waitress about this other fee, she was told that all places in Vegas charge this fee. Well, we ate at many other restaurants and never saw that added charge anywhere; CROOKS.Lastly, when we paid our bill, in cash, the waitress never brought our change? When my friend asked where our change was she said, "We always keep the change." LOL! AS IF! We made her give us our change back. She reached into her apron pocket, grabbed an uncounted amount of coins and said, "Here." (the rest of that was, "Now go away!")Go to Mon Ami Gabi, if you want superior food and a classy dining experience; it is only down the street, in front of The Paris hotel, and less expensive!Originally my friend and I were craving burgers and fries and didn't feel like walking inside Planet Hollywood to look for Gordon Ramsey burgers. She spotted Cabo Wabo Cantina outside of Planet Hollywood, across from where we were standing in front of the Cosmopolitan. We head over to Cabo Wabo we were immediately seated on the patio facing the strip (choice of indoor or outdoor seating). We enjoyed people watching, some in their costumes collecting tips for a pic. Some were very creative like Olaf whom looked like a Cholaf, a Mickey Mouse regect, 2 minions and a couple Egyptian guys. Our server comes by and takes our order. I ordered the carne asada plate and my friend orders the carnitas burritos. While waiting we're snap chatting away and I check in on YELP --- 1 FREE MARGARITA woot woot!Then 2 old men get seated next to us - and they were the same old men that wanted to take photos with us when we were at Bellagio. LOL it was funny... we should have gotten a tip for pic.Any ways, our food arrives and we killed it!! Not cz we were super  hungry cz it was delicious!!! Yummm... the rice, beans and carne asada (3) were just perfect. I've started to appreciate avocados and my carne asada tacos had a slice on each one... made me super happy!They had a live band playing behind us (more like a solo band). He was really good. He played his guitar maybe it was a Ukele and he was singing live robin thicke, Bruno mars, flo-rida, etc. He sang his version of the songs added a hint of Hawaiian island beat to it. I loved it! Our server was ok ((less the one star)) She was nice to my friend and I but rude to the old guys sitting next to us. They would call her and say "excuse me, excuse me" she looks at them and keeps walking. RUDE! I felt so bad cz all he wanted was a cup of coffee. - Maybe cz he was smoking in the patio and no smoking was allowed. He probably didn't know, there wasn't a sign or anything. Well this place is good for entertainment, food was good, vibe was great!
Corner Thai Kitchen=3.5 stars.It was dead on a Saturday night but they must have had a lot of takeout/delivery orders because they had run out of green curry by 7:30pm.  Kinda crazy!  The menu was set up well since there were photos for everything which made it much easier to know exactly what was coming. We started with the "Duck Spicy Salad" since this was something I'd never seen before.  The salad consisted of duck with pineapple, raisin, tomato, red onion, cilantro, green onion and spicy lime sauce.  That was 360 degrees of flavor although I would've preferred a little less duck skin. I checked out Dan "Thai Food Addict" P's review on my phone and he got the Khao Soi.  I'd never tried Khao Soi and it's not offered in a lot of Thai spots so what the heck.  The only way I could explain it would be imagine if Thailand had ramen.  It had a really good curry broth with 3 kinds of beef (sliced, tendon and chunks) with soft egg noodles along with crispy egg noodles.  I also agree with Dan that there should have been more noodles but maybe it's because I liked it a lot.  My wife got the tofu red curry which was fine.  Corner Thai has a big sign out front saying they serve the best Thai food in Vegas.  That's a pretty bold statement that they don't live up to, but it's a fine neighborhood spot.
Brad's Place=I LOVE this place! It is a small bar owned by a guy named Brad. The best part is, it is a Vikings bar! Go Vikes! I first experienced this place when I lived in Ahwatukee. My friends and I were looking for a good bar to eat at and watch a baseball game. Brad's has a huge menu that can be overwhelming but I always enjoy having a lot of options. I remember ordering the Grilled Cheeseburger. It was two grilled cheese sandwiched with a burger in the middle. It was to die for. I have been back a few more times since then and every time, I have had a pleasant experience. I will recommend this place to people new in the area because I like it so much. I attended the Football UYE this past Sunday and, unfortunately, watch the Vikings lose but had a great time anyway because the bartender/server was great and kept our refills coming. I ordered the biscuits and gravy meal that comes with eggs and breakfast potatoes. It was delicious. Another person ordered the Pork Loin sandwich and it was bigger than the bun. I will continue coming here when I have the chance.Heads up, it is hidden in the Safeway parking lot on Elliott and 48th Street so make sure you are on the lookout because it is a small place.
Rustic Cafe=It started out promising enough.  We were pleasantly greeted and seated promptly.  Reviewing the menu, many of the dishes looked good.  Our waitress seemed nice (despite the really long red sparkly fingernails - maybe not appropriate for food service?) - she brought water and took our order.  Then things went sideways...What we ordered:  Eggs Benedict with well-done hash browns, and the Arizona Burrito.  What we received:  Barely warm undercooked hash browns and poached eggs that were left sitting too long - the yolks were rock hard!  How long did those poor things sit before being served?  Ick.  The Arizona Burrito was supposed to contain eggs, sausage, bacon, potatoes & cheese.  While it was large and impressive to look at on the plate, where was the meat?  A few paltry pieces could be identified amidst the egg/potato filling.I would have liked to be able to ask to have my hash browns cooked a bit longer, or for my eggs to be cooked correctly, but our waitress DISAPPEARED.  Gone.  Where did she go?  Busy staff came and went (walking right by empty water glasses time and time again), but she was nowhere to be found.  She never came back to check on us, refill water or even give us our bill.  Another waitress passing by took pity on us, and went to find someone to bring our check.Breakfast is supposed to be a good start to the day, not an exercise in frustration.One more note - please remove the Christmas decor - it is the end of January.
La Santisima=La Condesa Gourmet Taco Shop After a long break from Yelp, I knew that eventually I would find myself in a situation where I could no longer hold my tongue, and my need to share would overpower my desire to remain silent. La Condesa GTS created just that situation. I entered this space wound tighter than a spring ready to pop. Surely there could be no way that it could meet the lofty expectations set forth by my fellow yelper's reviews. But there is something very pure about this place, and as I stepped through the over-sized wood door, I knew this southwest girl was home. The best way I can describe the atmosphere is Southwestern Minimalist. Monique H was dead on with her praises for the artwork - The Blue Demon (long live Alejandro Muñoz Moreno) proudly intermingles with Diego and Frida and the acid treated floors feel natural. I also liked that this is clearly a community effort, with the art work provided by two exceptional Mexican artists (Manuel Gilavalos y Garcia and Ricardo Ramirez) and the furniture/décor provided by Bellas Artes de Mexico. I love that there is already a partnership, holding this little gem up until it can take flight. The food is clean. The flavors crisp. The portions more than adequate, and the prices less than I would expect to pay for such quality. Most selections can come in the form of a taco, a quesadilla, or a burro, although there are one or two additional options under both the quesadilla and burro menus. Each flavor combination is clearly described and in a handful of situations, there are salsa suggestions outlined on the out of this world salsa bar. The best way I can describe this is to think of a wine pairing with a food that will make flavors pop... in other words, just try it because the sum of the parts is way better than the individual components! The Mayan Conchita Pibil and the Oaxacan Black Mole Chicken are two of the finest examples I've had of either. Both are mouth wateringly moist and fairly melt. I would suggest the Peanut or Mexican salsa as additional choices for the MCP for the spicy recommended habanera. The guacamole and cilantro salsas were both mild choices and if the mole were not already a mouthful of perfection, might be the additional layer of flavors that bring you to the tipping point. Personally, I found the pickled onions severed atop with some of the Jicama salsa, tossed in for a little crunch, just enough to make my eyes roll back in to my head. I mean seriously, if I could wiggle around naked in this stuff, it would be a really good night! The Aztec Tinga is deceptively simple. Your first bite may seem relatively ordinary, but then start the countdown. Within a few seconds, the flavors hit you like a wall of emotion. Your lips and tongue begin to tingle with the heat of the perfectly balanced peppers. My BIL has tried the Sonoran Carne Asada and was unusually quiet as he made his way through his plate, so I have to assume that was good as well. Finish things up with those out of the world beans, or some of the grilled Mexican Calabacitas and a meal just can't get much better. So much has already been said about the iconic salsa bar, there really isn't much I can add, except to say, try them all! You will find two or three that send you to your happy place. The staff was super friendly and more than ready to answer questions or make suggestions. It's an order at the counter and take-a-number kind of place, but you can generally expect several service passes through the dining room. My only cautions / suggestions would be to grab a takeout menu so you don't have to stand and look at the wall menu with your mouth gaping like a cod fish and be prepared to park along Palm if the street inset parking area is full. This is my new love. I will definitely be adding this in to the regular rotation. At a dinner plate with drink running you between 8 and 9 dollars (with enough food to make two decent sized meals) this is one indulgence I can fit in to my life with little or no rationalizing. Please take the time to check this place out and support yet another wonderful family owned business. Look around when you come in, because I may be joining Joel L on one of his weekly visits. : )Not sure how to follow Julie P.'s epic review, but I thought I'd show some support.La Condesa is a fantastic addition to Central Phoenix. Casual, nice people, amazing food.Like other reviewers, I'm partial to the Oaxaca black mole chicken and the cochinita pibil. Everything is delicious in any delivery system -- taco, burro, or (gooey and vaguely depraved) quesa.The salsa bar really gets me, though. Experiencing it is to suffer total cognitive arrest and disorganization; it's like love at first sight or stumbling upon a work of great art. Peanut, cilantro, de arbol... bring a sharpie so you can mark the little plastic cups and remember your favorites.Bonus points: The server remembered that I'd asked for strawberry salsa (they were out) on my last visit eight days prior, and offered a totally above-and-beyond apology. Must be something in the mole that sharpens the memory. Great place -- a gem.Really awesome tacos here. I ordered the black mole and the conchinita pibil tacos. One of each and a steak queso. I didn't expect everything to be so big so I really over did myself. The queso I figured was like a quesadilla but it really isn't anything like that. Closest description is a calzone sized gordita. And not the taco bell version. The cheese was gooey and the undercooked parts of the masa were delicious. It was awesome. I broke out the plastic utensils and went to town. Daunting none the less. But I managed to put down half of it before the coma kicked in The mole taco was delicious. The chicken was sliced and covered in red onion. The sauce was spicy and not sweet at all. And the whole thing melted in my mouth. The corn taco shells are soft and made to order. The conchinita pibil taco was full of flavor and dripped juices all over the basket. Delicious. The horchata is unbelievable. Full of fruit and pecans as well as cinnimon and nutmeg.the salsa bar is epic. there was at least 12 different salsas to try. the cilantro was really good. and i normally hate raw cilantro because i burp it. but this was excellent and really brought out the flavor of my food. also the strawberry salsa was hot with a hint of sweet and freshness. and the salsa peanut was very tasty. very. very.I'm buying a bike just to ride here.  A lowerider bike with two 20's in a trailer. So I can rock all the way there.for now condesa....you are in my top 10.This place is HOT on Yelp for a reason. We couldn't wait any longer and had to go try it after reading so many awesome reviews this past month; and now we must personally thank every person who recommended this place to us:Thank you my fellow Yelpers... if it weren't for you there is zero chance we ever would have stopped at this unassuming storefront in a pretty rough area of Central Phoenix. This place has a very 'hole in the wall' sort of vibe... when we first pulled up we kind of had an "Oh... this is it!" sort of reaction. We got scared at first because there was a big 'public notice' sign on the front window; we thought it might have been shut down, but luckily it was just a 'liquor license pending' sign. Whew, that was close. It's a pretty small and cozy place inside. The walls are decorated with some really interesting and fun to look at Mexican paintings and the whole inside just feels authentic; like you just walked into a taco shop in a nice quaint Mexican village. The lady behind the counter and the cook that night were very welcoming and fun to talk to. Upon pondering one of the paintings on the wall she even explained to us the meaning behind it. First things first... the chips and salsa were flippin great! Thin and crispy with a slightly salted flavor; but even better than the chips are the salsas. I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say that La Condessa has got the best salsa in town; and the biggest variety too. Out off all the salsa's we tried a few standouts were the peanut, cilantro, and avocado variations. For our main dish we got one of each taco on the menu... in the spirit of brevity I won't get into each specific taco; but I will say that we loved every single one of them. They each had very unique flavors with a sense of freshness to them, and pretty much zero grease. Each taco was also brim full with meat... they don't skimp on the product here; they give you your money's worth! Next time it might even be tempting to separate the two corn tortillas the tacos come in, and just divvy up the meat to make two tacos out of one! Last thing that must must must be mentioned is the Horchata. Generally this mysterious white drink is very hit and miss, well here it's a big time hit. It's unique and has all sorts of fresh fruits and spices floating in it... it tasted like some Super-Horchata or something; it was just absolutely to die for and is easily the best I've had. I highly recommend giving it a shot even if you usually don't like the stuff. La Condessa gets a 4.5/5... rounded down to a 4 for now, just because we want to go back and try the rest of their menu; which at that time if it's anywhere near as good as our first visit this'll be bumped up to a solid 5 stars. Hooray for another great Mexican place in AZ!The Countess, she is beautiful, she is talented, she is delightful and she is bountiful, she is saucy (in the "salsa" sense of the word, not the "descarado" sense of the word:)...she's also cheap:)But then again, so am I:)It's Taco Tuesday (as I write this...who knows when I'll finish it and post it...maybe next Taco Tuesday...maybe not:)But today, I needed to retox after my run along the mighty Scottsdale River (or the Crosscut Canal as the flatlanders refer to it:)I was going to wander over to Cien Agave, when my buddy called and said he'd gotten done with an open heart surgery early (usually, that's a very bad sign, but not today...he said everything went "swimmingly":) but after 12 hours of holding someone's life in his hands, he too was in need of a retox:)We agreed that it was time to go see The Countess:)I've seen a bunch of glowing reviews on good ol' Yelp and as I always do when I read the praise heaped on a particular place by my Yelp brethren and sistren, I thought "I'll be the judge of that!":)Not that I don't trust the reviews...I do, or I wouldn't have jumped in the rig, pulled the belts tight and lit the turbocharger in order to get my retox going:)No..."trust, but verify"...those words were given to all of us during an episode of Death Valley Days by a nearly washed up actor (whose name escapes me at the moment)... http://tinyurl.com/yfg9e39Well, it's all true enough...the black mole chicken is subtle but spicy...the cochinita is saucy and inviting...the dog shark taco may be made with the only fish that travels well to the desert (no, don't get too excited...not the best fish taco I ever had...but very good:)And more than enough to eat from an inexpensive platter of softball sized tacos (I know, I called The Countess "cheap" a few paragraphs ago, but what I meant was a solid value:)...Two big, round, tumescent taco's with rice and frijoles'...$7.59, USD:)And plenty of salsa...oh yes...lots and lots of salsa...saucy, saucy salsa:)None of the legendary "strawberry salsa" today (probably like the Yeti...plenty of sightings, but no actual evidence:)...but I didn't care...they still had a dozen salsas to choose from:)And all the salsas seemed to complement my taco's...how is it even possible that Peanut Salsa and Smokey Chipotle Salsa BOTH taste exquisite with the moles and the pork shoulder?I don't know...I asked my buddy...he's a trained physician and he didn't know either (so what good is he?...unless I need a heart transplant and then, you know...he's a god:)As I contemplated all of the fresh and interesting selections available at the salsa bar, I thought to myself "well, it's a bar, why don't I just pull up a chair and make a day of it?" :-)After The Countess herself came out and asked me to please eat at my own table and quit embarrassing myself and my lunch buddies, I remembered that this kind of thing is what got me banned from the Top of the Mark in San Francisco (although I will tell you what I told the SFPD...having a Caviar Bar with bar stools in close proximity is just asking for it:)We finished our delightful lunch without further incident and agreed that this place should be much closer to our respective homes and open 24/7 so we can walk over and grab a burro or a platter of tacos whenever we feel like it...which would be pretty much every day, for at least 2 meals:)Do you think The Countess will go for that?Life is all about creating a balance. This idea translates to a restaurant with its elements of food, service and decor.The gourmet taco shop La Condesa is still trying to find its own equilibrium, but the line of customers nearly out the door isn't giving the new establishment much of a chance.La Condesa is located on 16th Street, just north of McDowell, in a neighborhood that's no stranger to tasty Mexican food, including Tortas El Guero and the popular Barrio Cafe.With no shortage of good Mexican food, how does a new place stand out? They do things their own way.You'll notice striking artwork on the walls. The art is beautifully lit, and from a visual standpoint it's hard to look away, that's until you see the salsa bar.Once you place your order at the counter, you're given a number. Then have a seat and a staffer will deliver a basket of crunchy chips. This is when the fun begins, tapping that salsa bar.On each of my visits, the salsa line up was never quite the same, with at least six to choose from. Standouts include an Avocado Salsa that was vibrant and flavorful, the chunky salsa Mexicano and the Creamy Cilantro Salsa.If you run out of chips they will refill your basket, but try not to fill up on chips while you wait for your food, because you will indeed wait, and wait, and wait... On each of my visits the kitchen took from 15 to 45 minutes to deliver my order. But don't let this discourage you because some things are worth waiting for.The tacos are served on two 6-inch corn tortillas. You can order tacos ala carte ($2.99 each) or as a two taco plate ($6.99) with rice and beans.The beer battered Cabo Shrimp version was hot and fresh, yet perfectly crunchy while leaving the shrimp moist and tender. The Sonoran Carne Asada had a great flavor but was more like jerky, tough and dry.Burritos were mostly a miss, while paying a premium ($7.29). You can choose shrimp or mahi mahi. Mine were filled with too much rice and not enough seafood.However the Mayan Cochinita Pibil Burro ($6.99) was an absolute killer. Filled with luscious roasted pork shoulder, it was so tender you don't need teeth to eat it.The handmade Corn-Quesa is going to bring me back. They take fluffy corn masa and fold it around your selection of fillings, then use their deep frying to create a unique and substantial alternative to tacos and burritos.Being a purist, the Traditional Quesa ($5.49) was one of my favorites, simply filled with gooey Oaxaca cheese.The same Oaxaca cheese is paired with the earthy flavors of mushrooms in the Maria Sabina Quesa ($6.99).For me, the thing to order is the Azteca Tinga Quesa ($7.29). Stuffed with shredded chicken, tomato, onion and chipotle sauce, the flavors were complex and each bite was sheer bliss.Service is friendly and on some nights you might even see the owner's kids helping out.After two consecutive, relishing visits, I have declared La Condesa as my numero uno taco joint in the valley of the "Bertos". The obscure and hoody street it resides on has always kept me hesistating until one day! Before I immersed myself into the unknown, I had to do some Yelp investigation.  I wanted to know which taco(s) in particular people were raving about.  Coincidintally, the ones people tipped about were the ones I also adored! I kept seeing Yelpers talk about them dogfish shark tacos, so I knew I had to order those first along with the can't-go-wrong carne asada! First thing that happens upon entering the cool, wooden door, you place your order at the counter and find an open seat once a number is assigned to you. Being that they specialize in tacos, I focused on just that (for now)! They do have burritos and other things but its all about the tacos!  Here are your options:1 Taco: $2.99, will not fill you up, but it is still a decent size.2 Taco Plate: $6.99, you get 2 tacos of the same core ingredient (ie. Carne Asada, Fish) plus 2 sides (refried beans and rice)2 Mix Taco Plate: $8.29, you get to choose any 2 tacos from the menu, plus the sides I mentioned.Beverage is additional.What I have tried thus far:1. Dogfish Shark Taco:  Killer! What makes these so awesome is in the beer batter!  They are super crispy, hot and the fish itself is still soft and moist!  2. Shrimp: Again, Killer! Comes out very similar to the shark tacos, except it is shrimp!3. Carne Asasada: Holy cannoli folks! Some might argue that America's Taco Shop are better but I would say the quality and taste is near even!  Condesa might edge them with its overall composition and various salsas!  It had that mesquitte, charred off the grill kind of taste and cut perfectly to fit into a taco!4. Cochinita Pibil (Pork): The first three tacos I mentioned were pretty darn good! But this one stood out quite well on its own.  It was savory and packed with excellent flavors!  As the menu stated, it was slow-cooked, fork tender!The 2 sides-Refried Beans: Excellent! Rice: Excellent! perfectly cooked!The cool part about dining here is enjoying their Salsa Bar! If I recall correctly , there were about 10 different salsas to choose from!  The tricky part is pairing it with the taco you just ordered! Experiment, I say! As part of every order they bring you a basket of warm, house chips!From the outside, you would never assume that such a great taco place existed, but once you step inside you know something good is about to happen!  Every wall has some sort of hip and contemporary Mexican art, from flowers to people.  The overall decor is very tasteful and upbeat!Staff members are very friendly and courteous!I took my office colleagues out during my second visit and they have nothing but positive responses and is begging to come back for more!Whether you are a connoiseur of Mexican cuisine, tacos or just love eating good food, I highly advise you stop by!  For the overall great taste and value, its hard to beat this cool taco spot that will please all your senses!I really do think that I could live off their chicken mole tacos and the salsa bar! The service was wonderful, the food was above and beyond, and I am addicted to their cilantro salsa. The chicken mole tacos were overflowing with meat and topped with just a bit of pickled onions, perfection. Their quesadillas .....as delicious as they are, are not figure friendly. They are homemade corn tortillas stuffed with various meats, cheeses and veggies and then deep fried. I had the Oaxaca cheese & char-broiled Arrachera steak, which was ooozing out on delivery. Waaay more than I bargained for, good thing I was sharing. These are very indulgent and intensely tasty.Once I got a little into trying all their salsas, I decided to mix the cilantro salsa and the chipotle salsa...WOW!!  This was my husband's idea, have to give him credit. If you haven't been here already...go...if you have been here...go back, I know I will.Jim W was in town and that was all the reason needed to party, well at least have dinner.  Heather C and Ryan C also were able to show up.  This was my first visit here.  I arrived last and there were chips, guacamole (thanks Ryan) and several salsas already on the table.  About half way through the second basket of chips we placed our orders.  Most of the table got tacos and I got the Oaxacan Black Mole Chicken Quesa.  I also ordered the Horchata which was very tasty with the addition of nuts and fruit but when done left a pile of stuff in the bottom.  The Quesa was delicious, quite filling and actually made two meals for me.  Just a note: mole does not do any better in a microwave on high than gravy, but it still tasted fine.  Service was fine and she split the checks after she had already given us a single one.  We were dining fairly early but as the evening wore on it got pretty busy on a Thursday even with a major Haboob going on.  Definitely a place worth checking out!La Condesa, you stole my heart.  Gourmet Taco Shop indeed.  Your saucy molé put me over the top.You really know how to spice up a relationship with your many wonderful salsas.I loved your warm decor and warmer service.I can't wait to come back to sample your salsas and try more tacos.I finally made my way here to meet some friends on a trip to Phoenix about a month ago, then I met another friend here on my most recent trip.$3.99 gourmet street tacos.  Filling.  20 or so salsas.  Delicious.went into the dark bathroomflipped on the lightsscurrying ROACHES, as in plural, ran into hidingi squealedwe leftMy parents taught me, "when you don't have something nice to say, then don't say anything at all."Yelp has taught me, "when you don't have something nice to say, tell it like it is."Sorry mom and dad, Yelp FTW!I like my restaurants how I like my style, un-cramped; unfortunately, this place is packed full with wall to wall tables and chairs leaving about 3 inches in between you and the guy at the table next to you. Don't plan to come here during the lunch rush with a big group, you're lucky if you can fit one or two people through the door. The parking isn't that appealing either, you are practically parked in the middle of 16th street traffic. :-/La Condesa makes a pretty good taco, and their salsa ain't bad either. To their benefit, they do have some fairly unique salsa's to choose from, such as strawberry, peanut, and pecan; but in my opinion, unique doesn't necessarily = awesome. Any of their tacos will do you right, but my favorite is their pork.  In my opinion, and lets face it, if you're reading my review, that's exactly what you're looking for right? La Condesa over stated when they went with Gourmet in the name. Sure, everybody likes their taco's but who wants to pay $9 for two tacos and leave feeling like they were packed in like sardines in the middle of a seedy neighborhood? If it isn't obvious yet, I don't plan on coming back soon, I can take or leave their salsas and tacos and wouldn't be bothered either way.Happy Yelping Phoenix, hope you find that hidden taco gem you've always been searching for.The salsa bar is "all that and a bag of chips!" "Since when do you go to a salsa bar, where the salsas are actually really full of flavor, thick (not watered down), and unique?!" as my friends put it so well! It's sounds strange, but the pecan salsa was delicious! The peanut salsa was still spicy but had a hint of peanut in it, so it wasn't overwhelmingly "peanuty." There was a strawberry rhubarb pepper type of salsa. This may sound a little too strange for most, but it was almost like a spicy dessert type sauce. Don't forget to order some margaritas to wash those salsa and chips down. I would say you could get filled up on salsa, chips and margaritas alone here and be more than satisfied, but I'm not sure the owners would be too happy about that! The salsa variety was nothing less than astounding! And don't worry your precious little heart. There are traditional ones too: green tomatillo, chipotle red pepper, jicama, and cilantro... just to name a few!Slow roasted cochinitas pibil (pork) tacos, slow cooked chicken mole tacos, beer battered Dogfish shark tacos, battered shrimp tacos, el gaucho steak in chimchurri sauce tacos with guacamole. Oh gawd, yes! And affirmative... these were all eaten in one sitting.... well, with a little help from Bryan too. He's so thoughtful for that too. I might have died from eating too much. We live so far from here that I just wanted to "stock up," and I came oh so close to having to be rolled out of the place like that "blueberry girl" from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory!They claimed to have mighty good horchata!!The Horchata was indeed great!! :) I liked It! But not the best in my opinion, no place like Mexico could ever offer amazing Horchata to me thus far, nothing like the one's you'll find at street taco stands late at night in places like Cuernavaca, Chihuahua, Mexico city and or Acapulco! _ Anyways, coming back to La Condesa this place is super tiny, and should consider expanding to make it a bit more comfy, just my opinion! The taco platter I had included the Carne Asada , Pacific Fish and Cochinita Pibil taco. All three were okay, and just okay. The rice and bean were also A-ok, nothing too extravagant nor elaborate. I really think this taco shop could do better, they have the potential to, like their amazing salsa bar is a huge kudos to consider, and the staff too so you got that down Condesa, Keep up the good work and plenty of room for improvement if you care to know!Delicioso! This is a neighborhood hole in the wall that serves some pretty great mole. I am a mole fiend. Love the stuff. Can't get enough. Their's is dark, rich, spicy, and the right amount of sweet. (Also how I like my men, hey-o). (Just kidding.) Also, who doesn't love a salsa bar? I've never even heard of most of them: pecan salsa? peanut salsa? Um, why are you only giving me 4 lids for the to-go cups? Like I'm not going to try them all ...Yes, my 3 year old spilled salsa not once not twice but 3 times. Our sever happily cleaned it up all 3 times. Probably only 1 or 2 salsas that are mild enough for kids. Ours enjoyed the cliantro one and the Pico de gallo. She tried a few others but immediately downed water and her face turned a little red. She may have grown a little hair on her chest. Our favorite salsas were the peanut and guacamole. I had the street tacos. Carne Asada taco was on point. Ranking the 3 I had1. Carne Asada2. Al Pastor3. ChickenWish I could tell you about the rice but the girl ate it all, so if she ate it I'm sure you will enjoy it too. Next time I need multiple margaritas. Happy hour, anyone?!?!Came in on a Friday 5-ish for an early dinner with my friends. The place is cute, few tables, it's got a bar and 2 bathrooms. Salsa bar was awesome! There's tons to choose from.. My favorite was the salsa picante, jicama and the cilantro.. Ahhh soo good. I got the fried fish taco plate, the shark taco on the side and I also tried their horchata! The tacos were great! I love the rice it's got flavor to it and the horchata was very delicious! It's got fruit, cinnamon and nuts on top. Ok, so I didn't know it was big! I think the cup was 32oz, it's good for 2-3 people!!! The down side was the service..I don't know if the lady was stressed out because there's a lot of people and there's only 2 of them serving.. But they need to add more server/waiter during peak hours.. The guy was doing 3 jobs, at the bar, cashier and serving as well. I feel bad for them. We were waiting for our food for a long time, probably 30-40mins. When we got out of the restaurant, there was a lot of people waiting.. I will definitely come back again, just not peak hours.La Santisima Gourmet Taco Shop is my favorite place in Phoenix to get fish tacos and Mexican seafood.  The ingredients are really fresh, and everything tastes yummy.Service can be a bit slow and seating is limited.  So, I recommend calling and placing to-go orders.  If you try to eat inside the restaurant during peak hours, prepare to wait 30 minutes.I usually get the Baja Sur Dogfish Shark Tacos, but I also like the Cabo Shrimp Tacos.My boyfriend prefers beef, pork, and chicken dishes.  So, he usually gets the Sonoran Carne Asada Tacos or the Mayan Cochinita Pibil Tacos.  He also likes the Aztec Tinga Tacos.I have heard so many great things about this place (It was on Diner's Drive-Ins & Dives!) and we finally decided to get our taco-loving booties over there to try it! Ohhh my goodness, I am so happy that we did!! They have the most amazing fresh salsa bar with at least 10 different salsas made daily. Being a sauce lover, this was a complete dream come true. I recommend getting the two taco plate with rice and beans. I got the Aztec Tinga Taco (Shredded Chicken, Tomato, Onion & Aztec chipotle sauce) and it was SO juicy with the perfect combination of spices. I also got a Carne Asada taco that was delish! The restaurant is small and I hear it gets busy so I would recommend dining here during off days/times. We went on a Thursday night at 7:30 PM and it was perfect!!! We will for sure be back, i've been daydreaming of their fabulous salsa bar ever since we left!For our Sunday lunch we were in the mood for some truly authentic tacos and thought we'd give this place a try.Location & Aesthetics - located on N 16th Street in Phoenix which I noticed can be a little busy with traffic even though it was Sunday.Parking is a little poor (-1) with a few stalls located outside the restaurant, and some of these parking spots are shared with another business on the corner.  I did notice some other available parking in the vicinity but believed they were for other businesses.Unfortunately N 16th Street was busy, at the time of our visit, so you can't really stop alongside the parking spots to wait for someone to leave as that might cause some traffic on the busy street.  Thankfully there's a side street on the right that you can turn into to turn around.The facade of the restaurant cannot be missed with its brightly green colored painting and large saint figure adorning the front of the restaurant.  Another drawback the restaurant had going for it, in my opinion, is the small interior size (-1).  As soon as you open the door, you will immediately notice how small it is as you will see diners siting at their tables right at the door as you enter.  I can see this could be a little bothersome if you've been seated close to the front door, and with it opening and closing, doesn't bode well for a nice dining experience for some.There is a bench outside of the restaurant for you to wait for seating if the inside is full, and with no real shade and I didn't see any misters, that can be uncomfortable, I guess, during the summer months.Menus - provided to us as soon as we were shown where to sit and were pretty self-explanatory.   Service - We were warmly greeted by staff upon entering.  It might've been nice if we were asked if we've been here before but no problem as any questions we had, was answered promptly.Food - Once seated, you are provided with a bowl of tortilla chips, and there's an available salsa bar with a large variety of salsa dips to choose from.  The dips all sit on ice being chilled and have varying degrees of hotness.  From the 5-6 dips that I chose from, they all tasted freshly made and was enough to open the appetite.Prior to ordering, I was in the mood for some libations and ordered myself a mojito which in my opinion was perfectly concocted as you could taste the lime juice (tasted fresh), rum, right amount of sugar, and contained enough leaves of mint.For food, I ordered the -- Baja Sur Dogfish Shark Taco, Mayan Cochinita Pibil Taco, and the Oaxaca Black Mole Chicken Shark Taco with a side of rice and beans.  All three tacos tasted absolutely great and delicious.  There were all flavorful, seasoned well, fresh, not too spicy, and cooked just right.Definitely a place I wouldn't mind returning to.How can I not like this place? It has my name written all over it!My hubby took me here on a Saturday night because he wanted to get my take on this popular gourmet taco shop. We stepped into the dark interior which had a Day of the Dead décor and filled with ten tables for hungry diners.The menu is divided into five sections:Gourmet Tacos or Gourmet TaquetzinStreet TacosGourmet Burros or Cazuela Bowl Gourmet Corn - QuesadillasLonchesI ordered the Al Pastor Burro (spicy pork, salsa, pineapple, veggies) $9 and Daniel got the Tlaloc Vegan Burro (mesquite grilled cactus, caramelize onion, veggies and cheese) $9. Both of them did not have rice or bean inside (a.k.a. fillers) and still kept it hardy but not overstuffed. My Al Pastor had the spiciness and sweetness which you typically find but what made this burro special, was it was grilled on the top and bottom and the fillings were made from high quality ingredients. And for you cheese lovers, you won't find it inside but I'm sure you can request it. Daniel's burro was a healthy alternative and the cactus had a nice texture. My only complaint was it needed additional salsa to add to the flavor. Be warned ... take a Beano before this meal!All meals came with a basket of tortilla chips and unlimited trips to the salsa bar which had at least ten different types of homemade salsa to experiment. Most of them had a kick of spice to it and you can pick from chunky vs. smooth salsas. My favorite was mixing the Salsa Mexicana and Avocado Salsa. Talk about double dippin'! The Salsa Chipotle was also another favorite for us.Personally, the lighting was a little darker than I preferred during dinner. I wouldn't call it romantic but rather adventurous!Since it was a busy night, the two servers were on their toes and the wait for the food was reasonable. They had an extensive cocktail list with many of the diners enjoying their margaritas and homemade horchatas. I hope to return with Daniel to try the mole street tacos and say I ate at "Santisima"!
Teriyaki Madness=Ended up here since Poke Express is to go only. Easy parking access and killer AC made this fast food joint a relaxing place for lunch.I went with the double protein combo - beef & chicken teriyaki and stir fried veggies. The portion was large and  the beef tasted marinated - nom nom! Even the veggies were cooked just right and yummy over the steamed rice. BTW they offer a brown rice option.I'll be returning here for sure.
My Corner Chinese Restaurant=Stopped in here for lunch the other day. Quiet little independent Chinese restaurant that also has a Hawaiian style menu.Not many options for vegetarians, no tofu dishes to be found. Didn't really dig my noodles + veggies + pineapple dish, hence the 2 star rating.I tried this place for three reasons. 1)  I've been searching for a better Chinese food restaurant than where we go now. 2) Several weeks ago someone dropped off a menu at our house. 3) Decided to try something new. Delivery took only 25 minutets and the food arrived very hot. My wife ordered the beef with broccoli. I ordered the shrimp with lobster sauce. My wife took one bite and said the beef was tough and the broccoli was hard (it wasn't coooked enough). She also said her dish smelt weird. At that point I dug into my shrimp & lobster sauce. It was more like egg drop soup than any shrimp and lobster sauce dishe I have ever tried anywhere. I also paid extra and got fried rice instead of white rice. It was so bland it was inedible. Everything went  immediately in the trashWe  also ordered  Wor Wonton Soup and got a free entree which we were planning on having for lunch or dinner tomorrow. Since we put the entrees in the trash nd were hungry we decided to give the soup a try. There was large chunks of pork in the soup which looked good but after trying a piece I was sure that was not how the meat was supposed to taste. My wife agreed and we ended pouring it down the drain. We then tried the free almond chicken entree.  Again the dish was nothing short of  disgusting! so it went directly into the trash as well.FOOD: wanted to really enjoy it, but honestly, the food was detestable. We both  nearly gagged just after tasting it. To say our food was dissatisfactory is an understatement. STAY AWAY!!!! PRICE: Wasn't worth the price even if it was free.. SERVICE: Fast delivery.  CONCLUSION:  I have rarely been this disappointed with a restaurant . If I could give this place 0 stars I would. This is the worst chinese restaurant ever!Dinner cost $28.37 and it ALL went down the drain or in the trash. I will never order from this establishment again. STAY AWAY!!!!
Hong Kong Kitchen II=Argh.The first time I ordered takeaway food here it was not ready when I arrived.  I arrived 5 minutes after it was supposed to be ready and ended up waiting for 50 minutes longer.  The food took 70 minutes rather than the 15 they quoted on the phone.Argh.But the food was really good.Argh.I would have just left but we were having a conversation with someone else in line.  The line of people waiting to pick-up was all the way through the restaurant.Argh.Good business practices would have been to offer everyone a discount or something, maybe even serve up some munchies and drinks for the crowd waiting and growing irritable.  But no.Argh.But the food was really good.Argh.The food was so good we decided to order from Hong Kong Kitchen II again.Argh.This time they said 20 minutes.  I arrived 30 minutes later.  And waited an additional 15 minutes.Argh.And one of the two entrees was beef and not chicken.Argh.I may go back to Hong Kong Kitchen II but only if I'm in a patient mood.  If I had caught the mistake in my order I have to wonder, would I be there another 30 minutes or more waiting for them to get the right food?Argh.Serious organizational challenges here.  Tasty food, reasonable prices and a possible good location for an episode of "Kitchen Disasters."Argh.
Greenland Supermarket=This place is the ultimate ASIAN KINGDOM!  You get an ultimate shopping experience with samples and music.  Now how cool is that?  I really, really, REALLY LOVE how this place gives you pre-marinated meat.  I love to shop for all my Korean food addictions here, and I get it all in one sweep.  Kal-bi, bugolgi, kimchi, and pork belly! All crossed out in one area.  I also love their various choice of ramen, I could stand in the aisle for hours reading every single one and putting them into my cart.  And get this, THEY EVEN HAVE MY CHILDHOOD DRINK! Milkis = YUMMMMMMM!Going to Greenland gets me excited.  What do you do when you go to a grocery store?  Buy food.  What do you do at a Korean grocery store?  Buy Korean food!  And I love me some Korean food.  Whether you're satisfying your current hunger at the food court or bringing home some food for later, Greenland's got you covered.The biggest reason I go to Greenland is for their BBQ.  They have several meats already marinated and ready to take home.  Buying your kalbi/bulgogi/etc. by the pound here and grilling at home is so much cheaper than eating out!  That wouldn't mean much if the meat and marinade isn't good, but luckily that isn't a problem.  Potluck coming up?  Pool party coming up?  Greenland's BBQ is my go to spot for bringing a dish.The other thing I've come to buy a lot of is the banchan they carry.  Gotta have the banchan with the BBQ!  Kimchi, bean sprouts, cucumber, fish cake...more banchan than I can remember!  Everything has been decent and consistent.  For someone that's never made banchan at home, this is my only option!Another nice thing is that it's no problem if you head to Greenland with an appetite.  No need to go grocery shopping while you're hungry, just stop by the food court!  Obviously the biggest reason to go to Greenland is for Korean food.  Me being a fan of Korean food makes me a fan of Greenland.After 8pm you can get discounted kimbap (beef and vegetable rolls) or chapchae (stir fried sweet potato noodles with vegetables) for 50% off if any are still available. I had some chapchae for around 2.14 for my dinner, good eats! The kimbap goes fast so try to get there before 9, you can get that for around 2.25 for 2 big rolls.This large marketplace also has some of the most hardest to find korean items you will find anywhere. Whether it's a brand name korean soju, red pepper paste, or candy, this supermarket has it all. There are also stalls inside the center that sell freshly made breads and pastries from the Lepidor bakery, and another one that sells fresh rice cakes. Along the outside, there are stores that sell electronics, travel tickets, as well as clothing.For a one-of-a-kind experience into a whole different world, Greenland is the place to go.I love Greenland market! It is an excellent Korean-owned asian grocery store and carries a lot of varied products. Their fresh meat selection is awesome. Everytime my Mom is in town I always make a trip to Greenland to stock up on Korean-style short ribs so that she can marinate them (and so that I can have a freezer full of Mom's delicious bulgogi short ribs nom nom nommm).The prepared foods section is very good too. I have had jobchae, kimchee, kimbop and seaweed salad from there.The food court is perfect for when you need a quick bite before grocery shopping, knowing that if you walk in to Greenland hungry you will end up buying everything in the store. My favorite food court item is the mussel champong (spicy seafood and noodle soup) from the stand in the corner, the name escapes me. So yummy.Be sure to get your Greenland Market rewards from the cashier. For every $500 you spend, you get a $10 coupon/voucher to use towards future purchases.Since no one has really listed all of the food court shoppes, here they are, from the closet vendor to the entrance inward: MIRAKTypical Korean food here. Meat dishes and soups. I've never tried this one. See photos for menu. SONG'S FAMILYThey have Kim chi fried rice, ramen for $3 or $4 although I think it's instant or about $6 with rice cakes. Haven't gotten a chance to try this either.  SAKURA SUSHITypical sushi rolls (Philadelphia, sunset, spicy albacore, tempura.) Cheap California rolls for $4. Also Haedukbibimbap (which is pretty much a Korean poke bowl) for $8 and katsu for $9. RED GATE WOKMore of a Korean/Chinese fusion. Lots of chicken options here like orange chicken. Also jjangmyeon, which are a good portion of noodles with a thick black sauce. Always served with pickled radish. HOT TOFUI've eaten at this place the most. I've had soondubu which a tofu soup served bubbling hot. Ask for an egg to be cracked in it as its bubbling. Served with a side of rice and fish and lots of banchan. Good price and really fills you up. I've also had the spicy noodles and pickled radish with cold noodle soup. These use thin rice noodles. The cold soup (it had ice in it!! :o) was delightfully surprising and really refreshing on a warm day. PHO THIEN HUONGThis one isn't Korean. It's Vietnamese. Extremely large menu. Pho, rice dishes, mi (egg noodles), bun (vermicelli noodles), egg rolls, banh cuon if you come early. My boyfriend tried the pho and he described it as very watery. Meat wasn't too fresh and you're better off going to the pho restaurant next door. Can't speak for the other menu items here though. So many choices and good food. Can't complain.Feeling like Korean food but not feeling like K-POP blasting at Soyo? You're in luck! Greenland Supermarket has a ton of offerings within the food court and a great assortment of items you can buy in the grocery store itself. I usually make it out here to by some pre-marinated meats that I grill at home and my favorite banchan (boiled peanuts, beansprouts, spicy anchovies, seaweed salad and fish cakes). They also sell raw shrimp unfrozen with heads intact, which is really hard to find at your local Smith's or Albertsons. They're not as big as the other grocery stories further down in Chinatown, but they also carry a lot of Asian staples (Japanese curry, variety of sauces, candies, noodles, tea, etc.). Pro TIp: Watch out for the expiration dates on the banchan, some fall quite sooner than others.
Acapulco Mexican Grill=Great lil spot for a breakfast burrito. Nothing over the top or fancy. Sturdy furniture and some TVs. Oh they have a cool orange juicer thingy.::Disclaimer:: i started this review on the iPhone app. :)now that i'm home to "finish" my review..i just want to point out..this place is kinda like a very chill taquiria but super clean...i think you know what i mean.get on it..
Olive Garden Italian Restaurant=I drive by this Olive Garden countless times a day and I always think to myself "one of these days I am going to try it." After all, I always hear about the bottomless salad and breadsticks.  So, yesterday, along with the lovely Farrah A, I decided to do just that... we went to a late lunch at Olive Garden and guess what?  I'm here to tell you about it!Yes, it is a chain, and yes - I had low expectations... but I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised.  The service was fabulous thanks to the hostess that opened the door for us when we entered and exited, and of course thanks to Tony, our waiter.  The bathrooms were clean and although the atmosphere is a bit on the sterile side, I'd rather have that than a dirty restaurant!I went with the soup and salad - minestrone soup, and Farrah went with soup and salad - a creamy chicken and gnocci soup.  We also shared a mussels appetizer... I didn't love the breadsticks, and the mussels were a tad on the buttery side, but the soup and salad were both fresh and flavorful!  I had just one bowl of soup but several helpings of salad... and Tony didn't even flinch.  Farrah informed me that the Olive Garden chefs go to Italy for training and upon checking out their website, I see she is correct!  Here's what it says on their site: "Olive Garden's Culinary Institute of Tuscany is located in the 11th century village of Riserva di Fizzano. Every year Olive Garden chefs travel to our Culinary Institute to learn authentic cooking secrets from Italian Chef Romana Neri and Chef Paolo Lafata."Impressive, huh?I still prefer to support local, but I have to say... I would have no qualms about returning to Olive Garden again!Yes, folks, during my short stay in Phoenix, I somehow convinced Gabi K to come to Olive Garden for "endless soup, salad and breadsticks."  It's been a while since I've been, and they seem to have added a few soups to their menu, one, the chicken gnocchi. Very rich and probably fattening, but still recommended. So it was two soup, salad and breadstick combos ($6.95 each) and steaming hot mussels di Napoli ($9.25). Totaling out to $24.99 for lunch for two. And this location has a great staff, particularly our server Tony. Right on top of the water and salad refills. Gratzi, Anotonio!
Sweet Tea's Restaurant & Catering=I was honored enough to attend the "Restaurant Impossible" reveal dinner here last week & was really pleased with what the restaurant had to offer. I had never been here prior, as I don't get down to the Ballantyne area much.FIrst off, the decor is fantastic; however, it doesn't look like it belongs in a strip mall restaurant. :) Lovely IKEA wooden kitchen utensils hang from the lights & gorgeous stone fireplace in the middle of the dining area...Props to Taniya Nayak (from HGTV) & her team for making it look so nice! Dion L., Katie M., & Simone M., & myself ordered several different appetizers to try: fried green tomatoes, crawfish mac 'n cheese, black eyed peas hushpuppies, & shrimp & grits.  The taste & temperature of every item was perfect. The presentation was nice, as well. Oh & the sweet tea...absolutely southern sweet tea!For our meal, we all chose something different & had every intention of sharing, but after the meal arrived, we couldn't bear to share. :D  I chose a hamburger (it has a "special" name, but I can't remember it) with fries. The hamburger came with lettuce, tomato, which were fresh. The hamburger was thick & juicy. There was about a handful & a half of fries, which after eating the hamburger (& sampling all the appetizers), I couldn't finish the fries.Our waitress Amy, was a real sweetheart & talked with us quite a bit.  The owners were there of course & they came around & spoke with everyone.  Such a nice & humble couple!The restaurant isn't that big, they do have booths & table seating.  You do feel comfortable being here.Good Luck, Sweet Tea's! I hope you will continue serving the south Charlotte area for a long time!This place started bad and ended worse. My two friends and I have been wanting to try this place since they reopened. We all work in the industry and are big fans of the show so we were excited to try a restaurant they redid. We gave it a few weeks for them to work out the kinks. Needless to say it was quite disappointing.We arrived around 8:00pm on a Saturday night. When we walked in, a young girl dressed in street clothes with a messy hairdo like she just roller out of bed came up to greet us.The table was already set with silverware and menus. Right off the bat I noticed that the menus were different. One of the menus had additional side dishes listed and a couple changes on the entree side. I also noticed this place was a little empty for a Saturday night. They close at 9pm so maybe they are busier in the early evening.For how slow it was, it took our server way too long to greet us and take our drink orders. When she finally came over we all ordered sweet teas. They have a variety of different fruit flavors to choose from. I ordered the strawberry and my two friends ordered peach and regular sweet. The sweet tea cost $.99 and the flavored teas cost $2.99. She brought back a red colored tea, a peach colored tea, and a regular sweet tea. We paid $2.00 for fruit syrup?! You would think paying $2.00 extra would get you some sort of muddled fruit and simple syrup concoction. I mean the place is called Sweet Teas right?After she dropped off the teas we ordered some apps: the Augusta grilled cheese and the black eyed pea hush puppies. When the apps came out, we noticed that the Augusta grilled cheese had no pimento cheese or spiced Dijon mayo like it said in the description on the menu. It was literally a normal grilled cheese sandwich with a few American cheese slices. The hush puppies were ok. They had a really dark color on them like if they were cooked in old burnt oil. The buffalo ranch sauce, I thought was tasty but my friends did not like. For entrees, I ordered the chicken and waffles, and my friends ordered country fried steak and shrimp and grits. My chicken and waffles and my friend's shrimp and grits was the only reason I gave this place two stars. Both dishes were cooked well and tasted good. My chicken did have that same color as the hush puppies so I could only conclude that they needed to change their fryer oil. The country fried steak was a real disappointment. It was tough, over cooked, and under seasoned. The white pepper gravy was tasteless and gelatinous. The mashed potatoes were stiff, like they had been sitting in a hot well since that afternoon and 'sizzled' collards were a joke. I can understand frying collards as a garnish like you do for the appetizer but you expect someone to eat that as a side dish? Why not re-purpose the collards and actually make good collards? And if you do, put that as the side, not the 'sizzled' ones. After dinner we decided to try dessert. You can't screw up fried Oreos or sweet potato pie right? Wrong! The fried Oreos were burnt to crisp in the old fryer oil and they gave us one tiny scoop of ice cream. We asked the server for another scoop and they gave us a huge scoop but added a dollar to our bill (not that I'm complaining about a dollar). Sweet potato pie is suppose to by creamy and smooth right? This was some sort of cake like dense pie with marshmallow fluff and something else we couldn't figure out. It did seem like they put thyme into the batter or whatever it is they made. Good idea, bad execution. After dinner, we were told we pay at the register. We got up to pay and the same street clothes messy haired girl got up after the owner?? told her to ring us up since she was busy talking with a table. Not to mention, this girl left while we were eating, went to buy clothes and brought it back to the restaurant to show the other two servers. How do I know this? Because she stood at the front of the restaurant showing them off item by item. A bit unprofessional if you ask me.Anyways, everything is handwritten with no PoS system. We were splitting the check so we just had to tell the girl what items we had and she punched it into the cash register. Sounds simple right? Wrong again! She tried to charge my friend $58 after she told her she had an app, flavored tea, entree and dessert. There's no way all that cost $58 with an $11 average entree price. We were standing there an extra 5 minutes because she did not know how to work a cash register.As you can read, this place is just not good. I didn't know the Sweet Teas previous to this one but I'll say it couldn't be much further off. The food, service , and overall restaurant were bad. You could say maybe we went in too late, but if that's the case, this place won't make it long without having consistent food and serviceA coworker and I decided to give this place a-go after hearing they were taken over by Restaurant: Impossible.I never saw the inside prior to the RI makeover, but it looks very nice inside now compared to your standard dirty strip mall eateries.  It was an "okay" experience.  I ordered the stuffed burger and bacon with cheddar were my victims of choice for stuffage.  I was indeed highly disappointed.  I don't honestly know what I was expecting in the bacon - oh yeah, it to be cooked. I'm not a fan of the "floppy" seemingly undone chewy bacon, and that was "tough to swallow." With that said, the fresh cut fries were the best part of lunch. And that's a good thing for a spud fan.The service wasn't much to write home about either.One benefit in stopping by for lunch is - if sweet tea is your beverage of choice - it is complimentary with the order of a lunch menu item.Another disappointment was a Yelp "check-in" offer for a free dessert item was not accepted, as I was looking to forward to nibble upon some highly rated deep fried oreos.Finishing up the lunch hour, ready to pay the bill and head back to the workplace is when I came upon a big pet peeve I have in restaurants... standing at the register to pay the bill. I'm not at a fast food joint, so I expect the wait staff to handle my bill. This instance it's just kind of awkward waiting around for someone to show up to the register and waiting for everyone in line to be cashed out. Especially more awkward when there isn't a lot of room near the register for a cashing out crowd to gather and a new patrons to enter.I definitely would like to make it back and try something other than the aforementioned disappointing stuffed burger.With the news Sweet Tea's will be on an upcoming episode of Restaurant Impossible, I had to check it out. Unfortunately I was highly disappointed. I arrived @ 12:30 and was seated pretty quickly, as the place was somewhat quiet. I ordered the fried green tomatoes to start and all I will say is grease! From the greasy breading to the greasy collards, I pushed them aware with disappointed. I ordered the rosemary chicken with mashed potatoes, or should I say mashed potatoes with a side of chicken. The chicken was almost rare and greasy. The mashed potatoes took up the entire plate and the gravy, or at least what they called gravy, was diluted and watered down around the plate. In addition, they were partially cooked with an overwhelming amount of garlic. The decor was nice, but I found it quite strange that my waitress sat me, served me, and rang me up at the counter. She was very polite, but there seems to be a disconnect b/t the service. One server sat at the back table laughing and telling stories to the other servers as they walked by and yelled to her Dad a few times in the back of the house. Unfortunately it hurts to write this because I had high hopes, but I will definitely not be back.Where to start...I'm from Raleigh,NC and spending the weekend out here, so of course I want to check out any restaurant featured on the famous Restaurant Impossible. I'm visiting a few days after the "revisit" from R.I. So I figured they'd be on their "A-game" after this but boy was I wrong. This review is based off my observations of waiting inside the place for 30 minutes.      I saw everything from empty tables; just waiting to be used, non-bused tables the whole time I was waiting, there were people that got sat when we arrived who, when we left, had still not been seen by anyone yet. Also there was a group of four paying for their ticket on the old and outdated ticketing service. This was unbearable to watch, I just felt embarrassed for the workers using it and the customers waiting as the staff fumbled around asking who had what. I did notice that the red hat society was there and even they had issues with service. Another issue I saw was a table had been waiting for a prime rib entree and after waiting they were informed that there was an issue with the food and out of something else now. This whole experience was at 1230pm...How are you out of anything that early in the day?! So this was all while waiting. So when we left I waited behind and spoke to the girl ringing people out. I asked to speak to a manager and she said that the wife was cooking and not able to come out and talk with me. She informed me that the manager said not to sit anyone because they were short staffed. I was just flabbergasted at her response and just careless attitude. She did offer to take my name and number but I declined to provide such information to a business that can't even correctly and efficiently ring out their paying customers. It's just amazing how this place was on a great show yet service suck so bad. I mean...words can't describe my disappointment in this place. I will not be returning anytime to this place. Oh! The only positive mark I will give this place is the decor. They really did a fantastic job on the decor, it was very nice and clean. The IKEA kitchen utensils hanging off the light fixtures looks great in person. I had high hopes for this place but I just couldn't believe l experienced and witnessed before even sat in my 30 minutes there...Not my cup of tea. I went in with some friends for an early dinner. The place wasn't too busy when we arrived and it's seat yourself so we grabbed a table and sat down. Our waitress was super friendly but the food just didn't do it or me. I'm not an ice tea drinker (I know...I know) so I can't comment on that but here goes:For our appetizer we ordered the deviled eggs which come topped with chicken and bacon. How could you mess that up??? Well, the presentation was just bad. It looked like they just threw the eggs and toppings on the plate. To make matters worse, the flavors just were not good. It was like the chicken came out a can...ugh! No thank you.For my meal, I ordered the chicken and waffles. I knew based on previous reviews, to ask for my syrup on the side...to avoid syrupy chicken. But let's just say, again that the textures and flavors were a huge miss. I expected the waffle to be light and fluffy...nope. Instead it was dry and crumbled with each bite. That's not a good thing...the saving grace was the tabasco butter. Now, that was yummy.The chicken was not crispy and I wasn't a fan of the skin...See I am not one of those girls that takes the skin off and only eats the chicken meat...Nooooo....normally I eat it all. But not here...the skin nor the chicken were good for me. So pretty much Sweet Tea's just wasn't for me.We saw this place featured on the Food Network on "Restaurant Impossible" like many other people and figured we had to give it a shot!The look and feel of the restaurant is nice.  Clean, cozy, warm with nice decor and more of an upscale, brunch looking place.  You would not be able to tell that from the outside.The selection of food is a combination of traditional American and Southern comfort food.  It's nice that all entrees come with a free sweet tea.  Unfortunately, I did not realize this and got a flavored sweet tea for a little extra, which turned out too be a little too artificial tasting, but not a big deal.I naturally had to try the chicken and waffles, and it wasn't the best I've ever had, but not the worst either.  It was just OK.  My husband got a cuban sandwich though, and that was pretty tasty!We were able to cash in on our free dessert for having checked-in using Yelp and went for the bread pudding which was VERY tasty.  I am a huge sweet tooth, so this was right up my alley.Overall, I'd come back since I frequent that area often, but wouldn't go out of my way for it.
Feast Buffet=If you want the BEST buffet in Las Vegas, do yourself a favor, hop in the car and drive 9 miles to come here.  They have the best Alaska King Crab and best Prime Rib of all buffets I've had.  And trust me I've had many.  The unique thing about this Feast Buffet is that they will stir fry your king crab with butter, onion, garlic, tomato, and cilantro.  You can also request it spicy like I did.  It smells wonderfully and tastes even more heavenly.  I am not kidding.  None of that ice cold crab leg crap!  The crab legs here are fresh, big, sweet.  One word - PERFECT!!!  I come here and chow down 2 huge plates of king crabs.  My hands get all greasy and I had to use 20 paper napkins, but I don't care!  The carve station serves the most tender prime rib I've ever had.  They also serve turkey, rotisserie chicken.  Oh, the fried chicken is also great.  Like all buffets, they have Chinese (best egg rolls and fried pot stickers), Mongolia Beef station, Mexican, Italian, dessert, soft serve and ice creams.  This by far is my favorite buffet in Vegas.  OK, it's in Henderson.  The price is very reasonable, around $20 for dinner.  I haven't had to pay since I get coupon from them (which was why I first tried it).  But I'd drive here and pay to eat even if I don't have the coupon.My personal pledge to reserve Vegas buffet outings for out of town guests only went out the door this past Friday as the Husband and I checked out Green Valley Ranch Casino's Feast Buffet.Friday and Saturday nights are Surf and Turf nights from 3:30 pm to 10 pm, which ultimately means AYCE crab legs and whole roasted pigs.  It's normally $21.99/pp or $19.99/pp with a Stations Boarding Pass.  But for the month of November, an additional $3 is discounted - making dinner $16.99/pp!  (And with my coupon in the mail for BOGO free buffet - that meant $16.99 for two people!  What a deal!)The line was already long when we approached the restaurant a bit after 4 pm.  It didn't take too long for the line to get moving though.  There were hoardes of people in line for the crab - specifically the steamed crab legs.  But then there was this other line - you can have them stir-fry your crab legs however you'd like.  Ultimately, you grab your crab legs (or other food items), and then tell them what sauce you like and how spicy.  You can skip the wait and get cold crab legs and it's all the same.  This is what everyone swears by and the reason the Feast Buffet at GVR does well!  Other unique items at this buffet worth mentioning were the clams on the half shell, something I couldn't indulge in sadly enough.  But they do have milkshakes to order, which I was more than happy to help myself to! Other useful buffet info:Breakfast:Monday - Friday: 8am - 11am$7.99 per person or $6.99 with Boarding Pass CardBrunch:Saturday - Sunday: 8am - 3:30pm$20.99 per person or $18.99 with Boarding Pass CardAYCE crab legsLunch:Monday - Friday: 11am - 2:30pm$10.99 per person or $9.99 with Boarding Pass CardDinner:Sunday - Thursday: 3:30pm - 10pm$20.99 per person or $18.99 with Boarding Pass CardAYCE crab legsThe Buffet King says....This is one of my trust worthy lunch spots off the strip when I'm hungry for a buffet but not wanting to pay the high prices of the strip buffets...BTW.. Not all station feast buffets are created equal..... trust me....Why do I like this place?  Let me tell you...1)  Awesome Asian cuisine selection...   Love their Eggplants, Mabo Tofu, and most of all, Chinese BBQ pork!  (Be sure to get those ones that has a little bit of fat on it!)  So good!!! 2)  Pretty tasty Italian section... meatball were my favorites and the Alfredo sauce was pretty creamy too!3)  Pretty good selections from Mexican, American, and pizzas!  But I never get to try those because I'm so addicted to the eggplants and the BBQ pork....4)  Nice salad bar!  Caesar salad here is soooo much better than souplantation's5)  Nice Dessert Section with various pies and cookies..  (And NSA choices as well)  Cold goodies are gelatos in 6-7 flavors....Weekday lunch is only $9.99.. the most expensive meal is the Friday night Seafood running at $27.99 (but as expected because it's seafood)  All other times are less than $15 bucks easy even dinner.....Here is a great tip for you all!Before leaving...  Be sure to stop by the gelato, ask for your favorite flavor shake!  YES!! Pick your favorite gelato and the nice staff will make you a delicious ice cream shake in no time!  We love our espresso and Pistachio flavor shakes!This is a hidden secret of sorts... but don't say I never share any goodies with you all!
The Fillmore Charlotte=Another sold-out show at The Fillmore and another brutal disappointment.  This place cannot, I repeat, cannot manage a big crowd.  Period.  I tried to go into it with an open mind since my last review apparently ruffled a few feathers, but I'm sad to report that nothing has changed or improved since my last visit in August.  This place is a cluster fuck and that's putting it nicely.  The poor, poor design of locating the bathrooms all the way  in the back on the right side basically resulted in a total bottle neck of people pushing and shoving their way down the two stairs that lead from the bar at the top to the bathrooms and smoking area down below.  The security staff, instead of helping people get through and easing the crowded mass, decided to shine their flashlights in everyone's faces while standing against the rail, arms crossed over their chests, looking like a bunch of worthless thugs.  Any attempt to get into the actual bathroom area was often quickly thwarted by someone yelling at you to stay out of the fire lane even though you are simply attempting to get out of the way to help everyone else actually be able to move.  The staff here is the WORST EVER.  That ranges from security to bartenders and everywhere in between.  I've been to smaller venues all over the country that have had bigger crowds and managed them more efficiently.  I made the mistake of giving it another try and I definitely will not be back again after this nightmare.  Sorry Dave.I've experienced the Fillmore in two ways: private events and concerts. This review isn't about the former; the Fillmore is just fine for private events, and the success of such an event depends on the event organizers rather than the venue management.  As for the latter...Well, the Fillmore sucks. I apologize to its fans, but it does. My most recent visit totally destroyed whatever respect I had left for the place.We saw the Flaming Lips, and being the Flaming Lips, they were awesome. The Fillmore management, however, was so awful that we ended up leaving with at least 30 more minutes of Lips left.  I shall try to break it down for you:1) Staff.  The staff at the Fillmore is consistently, outrageously rude.  The one pleasant person we met was in the will-call box. It was downhill from there. Entry security treats everyone as though he or she is a suspected terrorist, and the bar staff consists mostly of snotty twenty-something girls who don't seem to realize they should at least try not to directly insult customers, since they are working for tips, after all.  Speaking of bars...2) Drink prices are ridiculous. I paid 7 dollars for a Dixie-cup of watered-down Miller.  A more reasonable portion would have set me back nearly 10.  I expect to pay higher-than-usual prices at concerts and such, but that is truly ridiculous. The Fillmore knows it, too: there's a strict no re-entry policy so you can't go next door for a drink while you wait for the main act.I could have lived with the above things. The music is what's important, right? Bear with me while I explain the breaking straw.3) Crowd control. The Fillmore is a small space, with no dividers of any kind on the floor.  Combine that with what I suspect is the management's habit of overselling tickets, and things can get quite unpleasant as a bunch of drunk people try to cram as close to the stage as possible.I'm almost 6' 8", and people seemed to view me as an obstacle to be overcome.  My feet were stepped on constantly; I was shoved more than once, and someone actually put her hand on my shoulder and tried to push me downward so she could get video with her iPhone.  All this is beside the fact that everyone around us was smoking, and given the no re-entry policy, it's impossible to step outside for some fresh air if this causes you to start sneezing.So, one might ask, why wasn't security keeping people from more or less stabbing each other in the back to touch the hem of the Lips' robes?  Well, security was back in the VIP section, chatting it up and making sure no commoners violated the sanctity of that space.  Useless, they were.I understand shows can be messy, and shows like the Flaming Lips even more so.  But the Fillmore ruined this experience.  I will think twice before I ever spend money on tickets there again.I'm a live music junkie and the Fillmore is a great venue to get my fix.  It's big, has great sound and is multi-leveled to help out the little guys.  The tickets are on the pricier side due to the live nation partnership, but that means it also attracts the biggest names in the business.  Try your best to pre-game beforehand if you're trying to catch a nice buzz for the show because drinks are $10~ a pop.  I always grab a few drinks and food at VBGB before every show, it never disappoints.  The bathrooms are large and always clean as well, you definitely can't say that for many music venues.  The only thing that keeps this place from 5-star status is drink prices, but I always make sure I have a few drinks ahead of time so it's not too big of an issue for me.
Spice 9 Indian Cuisine=On the advice of a friend I tried out Spice 9.  It being the first visit, we just went for the lunch buffet to try out a selection of items.  We could smell spices from the parking lot, in a good way.  The buffet provided a great quick lunch with lots of choices.   There were several tasty chutneys, including tamarind and a more unusual coconut.  The buffet selection included the Mughal staples:  rice, naan, tandoori chicken, butter chicken, and vegetable curries, but there were also more homey Indian dishes like a yellow dal with green peppers, lamb curry, sambar and rasam, an eggplant dish,  and dry curries (just veg and spice without a heavy sauce).   The spicing seemed very authentic, and the level of heat was definitely higher than in the average Charlotte Indian restaurant.   It isn't "take your face off" hot -- if you're one of those people that think every meal is a chili pepper eating contest you might be disappointed.   The spice blends come out nicely and aren't dominated by the heat, and dishes that are supposed to taste different from each other and use different spice blends, actually do taste different.  I lived for a few months in India when I was younger, so I'm pretty picky about Indian restaurants.  This is one I'll go back to.  The restaurant is located right across the road from Concord Mills just south of Lowe's.   The interior is nicely decorated and definitely has an upscale vibe, not like the usual strip-mall place.   Note:  disappointingly, the name of the restaurant is not a Vonnegut reference, although that does not affect the deliciousness of the food.This is actually a 4 1/2 star review.We had originally intended to have dinner at Carrabba's, but there was a misunderstanding about their call ahead seating, and their wait was too long.  (A second experience with Carrabba's can be found here http://www.yelp.com/biz/carrabbas-italian-grill-concord#hrid:q8auN9lts15ggk5MPTa9oQ)  Instead, we chose Spice 9 for my husband's birthday dinner, and I'm glad we did.  Upon entering the restaurant, we were greeted by a delicious aroma of mixed Indian spices.  We were seated right away.  I noticed that the decor was contemporary and understated, but quite attractive.  They hit a nice balance with the lighting between a light on your table (so you can actually see the menu and what you are eating) and enough dimness to create a more intimate atmosphere.  This would make a nice date restaurant (nice enough to be special, but not overly fancy or fussy).The menu contained a very nice selection of proteins and preparations.  I liked that the descriptions were detailed enough to give me an idea of what to order, but I wish that there had been some sort of indicator as to level of spice (only the VERY spicy items were marked as such).In every Indian restaurant I have previously eaten, both naan and rice have been included in the dinner, but this was not the case here.  This fact and the desserts are the reason that I would have deducted 1/2 star.As an appetizer, we ordered the Assorted Vegetarian Platter (6) and the Assorted Bread Basket (6).  The vegetarian platter included maybe 10 pieces of various vegetables dipped in a chickpea batter and fried, and included 2 delicious dipping sauces (one containing cilantro, and the other perhaps tamarind).  The bread basket included naan (good) and onion kulcha (FABULOUS).For our entrees, we chose the: -Khazana Tandoor (18) which had chicken, lamb, and shrimp.  I sampled the lamb and chicken, and both were quite tasty.  There was easily enough food here that it could be shared, particularly if you also ordered bread and rice.-Chicken Tikka Masala (13) which was UNREAL.  SO so so so good.  I was going to order something else, and chickened out at the last minute.  I'm glad I did!  Chicken was tender, sauce was perfectly seasoned, with a great mouth feel.  A couple of hours later, I am still thinking, "MAN, that was good!  How can I sneak over there for some tomorrow? lol"-Prawn Pepper Fry (18) Contained both black pepper and spicy peppers (with seeds left in).  I sampled one shrimp before any of the other dishes came, and my lips were still burning 30 minutes later.  I'm kind of a spice weenie, though.  Before it set my mouth on fire, though, I was surprised and impressed by the complexity of flavors in the shrimp.  It was one of those dishes where you taste different levels of flavor, one after the other.  Really good, and I would order it again, if it were not for the heat level.-Some goat thing.  I don't know what it was.  The idea of eating goat creeped me out, and dh ordered it super spicy anyway.  He did say, though, that it did not have a lot of meat, and was mostly bones.  He liked the flavor, but I can't say anything else about it without getting a little weirded out.For dessert, we decided to order 3 different items (which we had NO idea about taste or presentation), and all sample them:-Gulab Jamoon (3) OK.  Kind of like denser doughnut holes with a thin cardamom syrup.  DH took one bite and said it tasted like dish soap, but I didn't mind the flavor as much as the squishiness.  I was thinking that they would be drizzled with the syrup, but they were soaked thoroughly.  -Rasmalai (3) Sort of a denser-than-ricotta cheese square, with cream and nuts on top.  EWWW  It was a grainy, strange texture (2 people mentioned spackle), and the flavor did not agree with any of us.-Qubani Ka Meetha (5) sort of an apricot jam served on vanilla ice cream and topped with nuts-Pretty decent, but not a very large serving for the price, and not very specialRemember that we had never had these dishes.  For all we know, this is exactly how they were supposed to be.  The service was prompt, and our drinks were never long before someone came along to refill them.Overall, we were very happy with the dinners we were served, and agreed that we would eat here again without hesitation.
Two Hippies Breakfast Joint=FINALLY!!!!!!!i had a 30 minute break during work this morning and on my drive down 7th ave i noticed two hippies breakfast joint was officially in business. walked in and the place is HUGE, and unlike their other locations they have places to sit down and eat inside, plus little stools all along the outside.their menu is HUGE and they serve breakfast all day, plus burgers and chicken sandwiches and such.  their breakfast bowls can be made as burritos which is what i did. you can choose up to 6 add-ins including chorizo, bacon, green chile, an assortment of cheeses, garlic, onions, peppers, the list goes on...and it comes with a side of potatoes.  i think they're lacking (besides chorizo and sausage) some kind of shredded meat (like machaca) or chicken for their breakfast burritos..and good hot sauce (the ones on the tables were blah). great friendly service and one free refill on your coffee. place is cash only, and the ATM takes forever. this place is going to be very successful in the future...breakfast all day and bomb breakfast at that.I debated on this rating for awhile, but ultimately decided that I can't bump it up to a three star.  There were just way too many things here that disappointed me.  From the outside, the place is adorable and I love the bright color, it's really inviting.  However, I hate the place inside.  Had the decor been overkill hippie like in the burger place, I could sorta dig it, but this was all just halfway and I don't like a pair of pointy boobies staring down at me from a poster.  I HATED the rolling chairs that bumped into everyone and everything.  The place is entirely too cramped.  A lot of people get their food to go, so there is no reason to have that many tables.  There are just too many obstacles to make this even a semi-comfortable dining experience.False advertising makes me angry and had I come here after 11:30 on the premise that breakfast is served all day, like they advertise, I would have been fuming.  Why call yourself a breakfast joint if I can get a burger all day but not some scrambled eggs?There is way too much crap on the menu and I think that this place could really be much much better if they pared it down to just breakfast bowls and sides.  Practically everyone got one anyway, why slow the line down with messy pancakes and waffles?  Like Glenn said, there should also be little order forms that people can fill out while waiting in line.  Things would go so much smoother from there.Aside from the many many things that irritated me, the food was only okay.  I got the breakfast "bowl" which is a great value, but was left a bit disappointed.  I love being able to choose my own ingredients, so that was cool, but the distribution of ingredients is sporadic.  Some parts of my egg were covered in cheese and bacon, while the mushrooms and sausage were sparsely sprinkled.  I would rather have it even all the way around.  The potatoes tasted okay, but were really greasy and ultimately made me not feel good later in the day.  That brings back the same feeling I got from the uber-greasy magic mushroom burger a while back.  Not good.I probably won't be back unless some dramatic changes are made.  I don't mind waiting in line for food, but I hate waiting a long time after I have ordered.  I also don't understand how a "hippie" place that boasts of using organic ingredients could go and use inefficient, very expensive, not to mention environmentally unfriendly plastic and styrofoam containers.  That's a big boo from me.I am a Two Hippies groupie.  The owner and I are from Buffalo, so it's nice to see the Flutie jersey and memorablia from back home.Starving, after being sick for 4 days, I texted Tony A (@lightrailblog) to meet me for breakfast.  We toyed for a few momets, via text, on where to go.  I hadn't tried this place yet.  I used to live across the street from it and waited, with much anticipation, for it to open.  I waited for three months and finally got to go.Same type of ordering structure as the Beach House and Mushroom Burger places.I chose the bread pudding, fried pickles and of course a breakfast bowl.  You get 3 scrambled eggs and up to 6 toppings of your choice.  All is served over potatoes.  I chose sun-dried tomatoes, spinach, green onions, roasted garlic and monterey jack cheese.Our drinks and bread pudding were ready right away, so we dug in.   The bread pudding was really good, moist, and came with a side of icing.  Perfect starter (or dessert) for breakfast!Our bowls took about 15 minutes.  I knew there would be a wait, because everything was cooked to order.  The place was packed, but at least I had my bread pudding to munch on.  When the dill pickles and bowls were ready, we pigged the F out!  The toast was butter and chewy.  You could tell it was grilled.  Asked for ranch for my pickles and you could tell it was homemade ranch.  This wasn't Hidden Valley Ranch, no siree bob!I'm stuffed.  I have the leftovers in my fridge and can't wait to dig in later.Minus one star for the potatoes.  Not the best; not the worst.  I will definitely be back again, especially since there were hot firemen to stare at during my meal.Two Hippies Breakfast Joint FTW!!!two hippies finally jumped the sharkbandwagoners, please disembarkserve "breakfast" now  (quotation marks)at Two Hippies Breakfast Jointi can tolerate their burgersand I hate to be the baggerwielding keyboard as my daggerbut I need to make my pointbranding brains, have set the barbut kitsch can only go so farand i can only give two starsthough some yelpers still anointhippies as the second comingbut must say, that I was bummingwhen my breakfast burro, runnyegged me past my brekkie point even though you're pretty cheapwould rather pay much more to eatgood food, bisquits & gravy's, beathippies, you disappointlike fonzie, on his water skisjumps shark, a link, so you can seehttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpraJYnbVtEeven ron howard, as richie, c'sthe demarcation pointstick with your burgers, pluck the eggsyour pizza? toss.  also the dregsmore concepts? dudes, i humbly begno! (exclamation point)I went to Two Hippies Breakfast Joint open-minded the other day... I was in the area and jonesing for some healthy but filling breakfast food.  Conveniently located just off 7th Ave between Indian School and Camelback, I pulled in when I saw the place and joined just a handful of other peeps inside.First of all, the ambiance of this place is right on with their name... very hippy like.  Adorning the walls are all kinds of posters including the likes of Grateful Dead, Animal House, Rocky Horror Picture Show, Led Zeppelin, and even one of Bob Marley smoking a big fat jizzoint.  There are also license plates from all over the country, an old school pinball machine, and some bicycles.The staff was super friendly - it's the type of place where you order at the counter and they call your name when your food is ready.  I looked at the menu and debated between doing a breakfast bowl and a bowl of oatmeal with a side of scrambled egg whites.  My decision was made when I was told that indeed the oatmeal is not the instant kind.  And they even served it with soy milk and blueberries per my request.  My dining companion went with a breakfast bowl burrito style and was happy with his order too...The only negative (which I now see is in some of the previous reviews) is that it was disappointing to eat in and have our meals served on styrofoam... not only is it not so enjoyable to eat on styrofoam, but it's very un-hippylike!  It's worth noting that this place has more than just breakfast - they also have burgers, hot dogs, sandwiches, and salads... and they have free soup daily!This place was better than the reviews reflect, especially for the price.  I would definitely return but since it's a bit out of my 3 mile radius, it may not be for awhile.  That should give them enough time to switch out the styrofoam!
Taste=I love Taste! It's like my official weekday breakfast spot. I mean where else in uptown can you have a made to order egg white omelet with spinach, mushrooms, tomato's, turkey sausage and Parmesan cheese.....cooked in olive oil?? Absolutely nowhere else folks! Yesiree, this is my spot! My only wish would be that they offer salsa as a condiment because I'm tired of having to walk over to Salsarita's to complete my omelet experience:-) They also offer the real deal steel cut oatmeal with your choice of fruit, walnuts, raisins, cranberries, granola, or brown sugar.......talk about cholesterol friendly........man please!  In my honest opinion, for breakfast it just doesn't get any better than this. Yes, I miss Spratt's dearly, but I have a huge crush on Taste right about now. I won't comment on lunch because I've had hit or miss experiences as it changes often. My review would not be complete without recommending the cupcake area for those stressful days....my favorite is the red velvet with a whipped topping.........to die for!  5 stars for breakfast without a doubt!
12th Fairway Bar & Grill=Stopped here to grab a bite before my return flight to Vegas.  After browsing the menu for a minute, I decided on the Chicken Philly Sandwich w/Fries and a Blue Moon.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/B1jlDEUrVyPgR4vOMnaiKQ?select=q-ml8IWsnNgvx1CeL1SKGwThe Sandwich came out in a decent amount of time....If I was in a hurry to catch a flight, I would have made it, but I was in no hurry, so I was able to enjoy my food without rushing.  The Chicken had a nice flavor to it, but it was a bit dry for my tastes.  The proportion of Peppers/Onions/Mushrooms/Cheese was appropriate and the flavors complimented each other well.The Fries were excellent.  Cooked just right, they weren't soggy  but slightly crispy, which is how I like it.Overall, it wasn't a bad meal for an Airport joint.  It is a 3.5 Star place rounded down.Return Factor - 65%
18 Asian and Sushi Bar=18 had been on my sushi radar for quite some time as my wife and I would pass by on Rea Rd. I'm a HUGE sushi fan and am rarely disappointed with the fare just about anywhere. Guess we caught these guys on an off day...We made it in on a Sunday afternoon for lunch. They open at 12:30pm for lunch on Sundays, so a little later than usual for some. We were one of the first couples to make it in and there were only a few warm bodies working the kitchen. The hostess, whom decided that nonverbal communication would suffice, sat us and then stormed away. I'm not too picky with hostesses, but she didn't event greet us? A simple hello and feigned smile would be acceptable. Not the end of the world. Once seated, our server was quick and gave us menus, filled drinks and took our order. Started with tempura veggies and shrimp. All came out very swiftly and were tasty. The soy/hoisin sauce was delightful. Here's were the meal went downhill....Other couples and families started to file in and took up about 8 tables inside and outside. There was only ONE server and the manager. This is a bit unacceptable if you're opening for a 12:30pm lunch. I would understand if it were an earlier lunch, but you should expect a lunch rush....around lunchtime. Just a bit odd. Our drinks remained empty for a good 10 minutes and our sushi took more than 25 minutes to land on our table. I actually watched my sushi plate sit on the counter for a a good 10 minutes before our server picked it up. Once my sushi order was delivered, our server came back and asked if we needed anything...He had completely forgot to enter my wife's sushi order. Not the end of the world, but if the sushi order sheet has two sides, you just have to check both sides. It took an extra 10 minutes for my wife's sushi to arrive. All of the sushi was flavorful and well executed. Just a little put off by the service. I would definitely give 18 Asian another chance. These are just a few problems that can be easily fixed. As a huge sushi fan, and these guys delivered on the flavor front, I look forward to a more memorable visit in the future!
Cajun Crawfish=I'm all for a little competition in the crawfish world - but Cajun Crawfish is definitely not up for the challenge.  I was super hesitant with all the negative reviews, but still kept in open mind.It's a large restaurant space with additional seating in the back around the corner with TVs abound  However, it's a pretty sterile environment, blame it on the high ceilings.We started out with two pounds of Crawfish ($9.99/lb) with their House Special seasoning and Medium spice level.  (They have a warning that says their "spicy level is two levels higher than normal".)  The Husband did ask ahead of time if the crawfish was big and fresh, and the waitress said it was.  She also pointed out the tank in the back so we could have a look.  (I did walk over there to take a peek and noticed they had lobster and clams in the tanks too.)  You also get one side of corn and potato for order two pounds or more of crawfish.When our order arrived in a silver bowl, we noticed a difference right away.  This wasn't the way we wanted our crawfish, and that was our mistake.  The Husband asked for some lime, salt and pepper to make a dipping sauce, but that couldn't help this crawfish.  Sure, they were large, but they were also dried out.  There was no head juice to suck out at all.  When you break the head off, you can tell there's something wrong immediately.  And the sauce in the bottom of the bowl is this watered down concoction of something or other.  I don't think it's as fresh as they say it is, the ones in the tank are just for show I think!    The staff were friendly, and really anxious to refill our beverages.  But it couldn't make up for the sad crawfish.  We left after our two pounds and headed up Spring Mountain for Hot N Juicy Crawfish instead.  We didn't order the famous shrimp that gets all the ravings, but did see some on someone else's table, and they were large indeed.  But then again, this restaurant is called Cajun Crawfish, not Cajun Shrimp. I did ask if they had any grand opening specials (especially since other yelpers mentioned it), but we were told they weren't offering them anymore.  However, I did notice an ad offering a discount on beverages just the other day.   Oh well.Overall, Cajun Crawfish doesn't measure up for good crawfish the way I like it.  Sorry.06.07.10 Update!  In a recent magazine article, they are changing their name from Cajun Crawfish to The Crawdaddy Crab House.  Hope that helps with business!
Roadrunner Saloon=My wife and I came here to use a Groupon we purchased.  We used to come here periodically but haven't been back in years with the proliferation of new restaurants in the area. We were brought iced tea quickly and a basket with some corn muffins and butter.  Our server, Desiree, took our order promptly.  I got a cup of baked potato soup with bacon and chive topping.  It had a lot of cheese mixed in and it was excellent.  It didn't help with my cold much but it was worth the try!For our mains, we each got the 6 ounce filet served with large potato wedges and a ramekin with creamed spinach and some browned cheese on top.  The seasonings on the potato wedges and the steaks were very tasty and the steaks were good like we ordered.  We had the smaller steaks so there was room for dessert.  We should have shared.  They were very large.  My wife got the brownie with ice cream and I got the pecan and chocolate pie.  Both were very good.A few things about the service.  Evidently there's only one person serving at the time we were there and we waited several minutes for someone to come to seat us.  Later, Desiree had to take care of all the tables and our wait for things was longer than need be.  A very pleasant meal in nice surroundings.
The String Bean=Good food. HORRIBLE service! We were a larger party, so they sat us at the little craft table or whatever it was in the market. That's fine. We wanted dinner, so we were okay with that.What wasn't fine was they didn't even clear it off. They left a price gun and a bunch of paperwork on the table. Strike one.We have three different people approach us in the time we placed a drink order, and received our drinks. One member of our party ordered a beer on draft, and they brought him a bottle. I ordered a diet coke, and they brought me a canned diet coke. Not in the mood to pay for multiple cokes, I switched and ordered sweet tea. After waiting FOREVER to get our drinks, we had a different person approach us to take our orders. This time it was a woman, and she did a great job of explaining the specials to us, but when I said I'd like one of them, she told me they were out of it. Okay, so why bother telling me about it? Strike two.Some of us ordered appetizers, and about twenty minutes after we ordered them they arrived. My husband and I had the hummus, and it was delicious. What wasn't awesome is that they give you a decent sized bowl of hummus and like 6 small wedges of pita bread to dip in it. I guess we were supposed to scoop the rest out and eat it with a spoon. Anyways. About 45 minutes AFTER our appetizers, we finally received our meals. Everything was fantastic. I had a delicious mediterranean pizza and my husband's steak was delicious. But this is the part that outraged me. Our waitress was God awful at filling our drinks. Two of us had sweet tea. We asked FOUR times for refills, and we never got them. She kept saying they were brewing fresh tea and she'd bring us some out, but she never did. After they took our plates, we waited about another 30 minutes for the check. Finally, I was at my wits end and asked for a manager. The slow service, I can handle. The crap on the table they sat us at, I can handle. The bringing out a bottled beer when my friend specifically ordered draft, I can handle. But having to ask FOUR times for a refill is outrageous and unacceptable.
Bernards Bistro=My friends and I stopped by Bernard's Bistro for some brunch yesterday. It was a beautiful day out in Lake Las Vegas, so we opted to eat on their patio. The waiter was very nice and even made sure our table stopped wobbling. That was much appreciated. My friend and I couldn't make up our minds between the Marinated Grilled Chicken Breast open faced sandwich, Caesar salad or French onion soup, so we ordered it all and shared. It was so much food! We couldn't even finish half of the sandwich between the two of us. Everything was delicious and the ingredients were very fresh. The sandwich was on sliced French baguette and had grilled chicken breast, cilantro pesto, tomato, avocado and a slice of green olive. I'm not an olive fan, so that went to my friend. I should mention that the sandwich is generally served with their house petite salad, but I asked for Caesar and they were kind enough to substitute it at no additional charge. We both really enjoyed the soup and salad. I'm not a big onion fan, but their version of French onion soup was amazing. It was slightly sweeter than others I've tried, but it was perfect. There was a generous amount of onions, bread and cheese. They even top it with fried onions which added a nice crunchy texture. I highly recommend it! The salad was very fresh and had the perfect amount of dressing. I don't like too much dressing on my salad, so if you do, you may want to ask for extra.  My two other friends shared the Gazpacho and a Tuna Salad sandwich. I tried both and they were also very good! I'm very picky when it comes to tuna salad, so I was pleasantly surprised by theirs. They add balsamic vinaigrette, so that made it taste surprisingly delicious. The Gazpacho was served with avocado and tasted great as well.All in all, this was a great experience. I would definitely stop by again!The smell of fresh bread, The pretty plates, nice painting on the wall.  Escargot was delicious!  Dipped the fresh bread in the escargot sauce so yummy!  Wasn't sure what to order but I chose the salmon. Very light but filling. Food was enjoyable and we had a great date that evening.
Thai Spices=Came here with my family for lunch.  It's average.  The Pad Thai ($7.95) was so/so.  It lacked flavor and the noodles had a "spongy" texture.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/s5TJlFtdXcx_tXC4tlttlw?select=OCCiEEum8v0DRHQScPUURwThe Fried Rice was pretty good.  Fresh Veggies and just the right amount of Egg.The Egg Rolls ($2.95) were above average.  Not too oily, crispy, had good flavor.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/s5TJlFtdXcx_tXC4tlttlw?select=kflj_odI0WlvqxVylF1I8QEverything else was just OK.Not worth the drive from Scottsdale to Mesa.Return Factor - 30%My Friday night plans fell through and wound up with my son and his boyfriend and we were starving I asked them if they were up to trying out a new Thai place that we haven't been to yet and they answered back quickly with a yes, let's go!We got their around 8:45pm and the place was sort of emptied out, but it was perfect for us. I also noticed that I got a free Thai Tea for checking in on Yelp! How sweet is that!  For starters we ordered the chicken satay, the chicken was delish and full of flavors, the peanut sauce was amazing! My son and I at the same time said we could bath in the peanut sauce it was that good! Apple doesn't fall far from the tree I guess. But that sauce is amazing! Love it! One ordered the Massaman Curry, mild and that dish looked so very yummy! He said it was delish too! The other one ordered the Chicken Pad Thai mild without bean sprouts and he loved it too!I ordered the Chicken Pad Thai as well, but had my Thai hot baby, bring on the heat I say! I enjoyed the Pad Thai, the noodles where perfectly cooked, the chicken was very tender and so tasty! The pad Thai did come with tofu, which next time I know to have it without tofu but since it was already on my plate I went ahead and tried it out, and well it was flavorless and blubbery, like you would imagine a whale to be. It's not my thing, but I tried :) .My son and I have a favorite little Thai place on the other end of Mesa that we love, but I think Thai Spices just might have knocked them out, can't wait to come back and try the pineapple fried rice of course with chicken!Probably the best Pad See Ew I've ever had, but let's start from the beginning...Immediately upon walking in, I was given... bar none... the most hospitable reception in my short history of dining.  It was comprised of a greeting (including being called by name) and a hug from the cutest little thing, who I had just met.We started off with a chicken satay app, which was accompanied by a creamy peanut sauce and cucumber salad.  Removing the delicious skewered meat from the wooden spears brought me back to days of yore, when I would covertly poke my little sister in the closest appendage, with the sole purpose of evoking a squeal, all the while under the auspices of my no-nonsense parents.My go-to Thai dish is Pad See Ew.  I've seen it spelled differently, but I'm hip.  This dish was one to be savored.... no, to be fawned over and then savored.  Using my meticulous chop-stick skills, I pampered each delicate noodle into my quivering mouth... which evoked blissful visions of lazily floating down the Chao Phraya river... and mind you, I've never even been to Thailand.I'm not saying the dish was laced with opium, but at some point, I do recall fancying a ride atop an Asian Elephant passing through the seven levels of the Candy Cane forest.My lunch companion, Chris, ordered the basil fried rice, which was more akin to an architectural wonder than an entree.  Using his meticulous spoon skills, I witnessed him moving mountains... of succulent rice and fixins... never to be seen again, for at least eight hours.And just when I thought our culinary journey was disembarking, the same vision of loveliness appeared to my right, presenting a showpiece comprised of cake, cream and maraschino cherry.Knowing my chop-sticks would only make a mess of things, I grabbed a spoon.  It had been so long... but it felt good in my hand.  A little cold.  I raised that utensil to the sky, and with an intense bellow, I cried "By the power of GreySkull, I shall have you as my own".  As I started my initial swipe, I noticed Chris had already gotten 2 or 3 bites in during the fanfare.BAM!  The cake was bursting with coconut gusto, or maybe it was the ice cream.  I'm embarrassed to think of what I probably looked like as I descended into that dessert feeding frenzy.I'd like to offer apologies to any staff and/or patron within line of sight.  I don't get out much, and unfortunately whenever my taste buds are stirred up like that, its plain and simple mob mentality.  I cant get in their way!  I wont!After paying the tab, I bid a fond adieu to the huddled kitchen crew, and noticed their horror stricken faces.  The audible syllables "Mujumbo hielan friacah" lilted through the air as I passed... which I believe meant: "Great manly warrior"... no, my bad, wrong dialect... it actually means: "Portly destroyer with awkward shirt cleavage".I look forward to my return visit, where I will exercise self control... or maybe just exerciseHad a pumpkin tofu curry ($7.95) and tried some roaring tiger and Thai boat noodle soup. The pumpkin curry had a thick red curry with perfectly cooked veggies and silken tofu. It was flavorful and just the right amount of spice (I requested medium). The roaring tiger came out in a sizzling platter. The sizzle and smell was amazing! The beef was marinated well. The Thai boat noodle soup was a large portion, with tender beef, rice noodles, and a lovely tasting broth. Service was uneven as we had attentive service initially, but then the waiter forgot to refill drinks and check up on us as the meal progressed. The prices are very reasonable for the quality and quantity of food you get. If you're in the Mekong Plaza area this is a tasty option for Thai!
La Banquise=Question 1. How the hell do people in Montreal stay as thin and svelte as they do with places like Resto La Banquise perpetually having a line?Question 2: How the hell can you have a menu with only about 25 different types of poutine and a few hot dog and hamburger options and perpetually have a line?Question 3: Why hasn't the poutine crazed infested NYC (I know it has been tried in the LES but, really, that's it?).Questions I pondered after waiting in line in the freezing Montreal winter cold for 25 minutes, being cramped at a table for 2 and eating 2 small orders of poutine: one, the classique, the other, the smoked meat with pepper sauce.Surrounded by Quebecoise families (all skinny and French speaking may I add) and tourists alike, this poutinnerie has been deemed best poutine in Montreal. Hmmmm. I wouldn't say that. But, it was solidly good and there is definitely a poutine wow factor with the amazing long list of varieties from Mexican Poutine topped with guac and sour cream to the pizza topped with pepperoni, mushrooms and peppers.I preferred the classique version over the smoked meat and pepper sauce version though having the combo was definitely a smart move. Too much of the same taste would have been old and definitely not worth the calories. The smoked meat however wasn't filled with flavor and was a bit of a let down.In and out in like 30 minutes filled to the brim with delicious gravy covered fries with cheese curds = 4 stars. Worth the wait for the poutine? Hmm, I don't think so. Worth the wait for the tourist factor and feeling part of the local scene and being able to say you've dined here to locals? Yep.So we had to try poutine while in Canada. I already bookmarked this place before getting here and true enough this was one of the places our concierge at the hotel suggested to get some in the city.Before even walking in, I could already smell the thick aroma of grease in the air. What was I thinking, right? Fried food galore! Very hip and casual atmosphere. The place was loud and packed with a younger crowd mostly in groups. Tables are tightly situated right next to each other. We could hear conversations to our left and to our right but that didn't bother us. It was rather amusing. After perusing the menu, I decided to get their POUTINE LA SAVOYARDE: bacon, onions, Swiss cheese, sour cream atop a bed of fries covered in "gravy". Yes, Americans call it that but I hear Canadians prefer to call it "brown sauce". Ok, so it's delicious, but not out of this world amazing. In fact, it's quite overwhelming. Halfway through, I was already forcing it down my throat. It's heavy! No wonder we had people stare at our table when they saw our food. The poutine was only a side dish for my friend and I, while everyone else had it as their main order. And yes, we each had our own poutine! I got the HAMBURGER STEAK as my main entree. This, too was fried and oozing with the goodness of its juices. The patty was well-seasoned...very yummy! I enjoyed this so much more than the poutine.Friendly staff and service. Only complaint was the wait for our food. Others who came after us got their orders before we did. Maybe because we had main entrees and they all got poutines only? I guess... Cash only here with an ATM machine inside but they also accept USD. So thankful for that.Oh and they're open 24/7! Probably because this is good drunk food. Hah!
The Loco Lime=For my 500th review it had to be good and friends helped me find a great Mexican place that fit the bill.  The chips are hot and the salsa is fresh.   Corn tortillas are the norm!  Chicken tacos are meaty.  The bulls eye for me was the ground beef tacos - lots of flavor!  Simple, no-frills, good food.Plus we had the drink of the day, a cucumber margarita.  I've never tasted anything like it and can't wait to come back.  And to top it all off, the price is right!  Just one more reason to drive through Central Ave more often.
Tverskaya Russian Restaurant=I'm mad now.We've been to Tverskaya three times now, and the food has been excellent each time. The prices are reasonable. On our most recent visit, my fiance and i treated our friends to dinner (see Crystal V.'s review). However, we used a restaurant.com gift certificate, and apparently this was a mistake.Near the end of our meal, our waiter informed us that the mandatory 18% gratuity specified on the gift certificate went directly to restaurant.com instead of the waiter's pocket. In fact, he further explained that this was how restaurant.com was able to offer such steep discounts on their certificates. I conferred with my fiancee, and we both understood this statement to mean that the waiter would be receiving no gratuity unless we left extra. Naturally, we left extra - another $25 on top of the 18%. We received good service and had a lovely meal, so why not?Everything was fine until we got home and my fiancee sent off an email to restaurant.com, who promptly informed us that the waiter receives every penny of the 18% mandatory gratuity. In other words, we just left our waiter a 38% tip because he lied to us.Frankly, I feel a little violated. We have never been shy about tipping, and we were already intending to leave a few extra bucks to make up the difference (we normally calculate 20% and then round up). It is a shame, because I truly enjoy their food and I had a wonderful evening dining with friends. But I can't shake the feeling of being lied to, of being scammed. If you do go to Tverskaya, don't bring a restaurant.com certificate. If you do bring a certificate, be aware that the 18% is going to the waiter, not the website.After this, I'm not sure I'll be going back. There are plenty of other restaurants in town that value my business enough not to try and scam me.
Ginseng 3=All I asked for was some Asian flavors.  And with Chinese, Korean, and Japanese menu items, I would have assumed this wouldn't be too hard.But I've had better home cooked meals for a ton cheaper.Lettuce wraps-meat was tasty, but it was just plain chicken in plain lettuce...no garnish, or dipping sauce...nothing...most boring wraps ever.Dumpling Soup-Huge portion, flavorless dumplings, flavorless broth.  Simple can be beautiful.  This was not.Seafood Noodle Soup-For being neon red, it was not spicy or particularly flavorful.  The "noodles" were actually cheap spaghetti....really? Were actual Asian noodles of any kind too expensive?  The seafood in it was over cooked and also flavorless.Looks like Asian food, Smells like Asian food.....why doesn't it taste like Asian food?
Mellow Mushroom=Well. This is it, Mellow Mushroom. I am breaking up with you. For whatever reason, we just can't seem to hit it off. We started eating in the Happy Valley location but after a long string of back luck we decided to try the take out route.On one occasion eating in, our server went home after taking our order and never brought our food. On another, we waited over an hour after taking our order to get our pizza but when it arrived it was burnt to a crisp (and had the wrong toppings) on several occasions we were seated and it took 20 minutes for someone to even acknowledge us. Call it bad luck or whatever but dining in has never really worked out for whatever reason.Sigh, but now, "take out" isn't even "working out". We've had two incidents of driving to the restaurant at the time we were told to pick up our order and then we had to wait another 20 minutes because it wasn't ready. And on top of that our orders are consistently coming out wrong - and for the prices I'm paying, I deserve better. Originally, what I liked about Mellow Mushroom was that it was a little bit different than other pizza places. Unique pizza and sandwiches, sort of on the expensive side but a nice change of pace. Not outstanding but different. Generally, I have a problem with the service. I've probably visited this location about ten times (and as a former server myself) I have to admit, I've never been to a restaurant in recent memory where the staff is so unprepared or uninterested in what they're doing. From greeters who don't greet, to servers who disappear to food that arrives late (and often wrong) to getting the wrong check from a table of 8 (there were three of us at lunch) - we've just had so much bad luck with this place.Working in a restaurant for years, I know that things happen and I'm willing to forgive and forget. And for Mellow Mushroom, that doesn't seem to matter much. On the last incident where we got the wrong order, no one even apologized. I can forgive mediocre food if the service is excellent but after so many chances, the only consistency I've found here is frustration. I tried. I really tried. But we have to break up. I need to find someone who appreciates me as a customer. If you are interested in the gluten-free pizza or if you enjoy a nice selection of beers, Mellow Mushroom is probably a good option. But at this price range, there are a lot of better options close-by that are less frustrating. I really don't like leaving negative reviews (the last restaurant I wrote one for is now out of business) but I hope Mellow Mushroom can improve and give others a better experience.
Firefly=Budget conscious tapas As per Many other peoples' suggestion My brother and his friends wanted something lite, tasty, and relatively inexpensive; Firefly fit the bill.  Though we intended on going to the smaller late night location, somehow the wrong Yelp click, give me directions led us here.  I have to say I was thrilled with my misclick; the view was spectacular. I haven't had the opportunity to see Downtown with the covered lights and people bustling about; this was definitely the way to do it.Great french fries, my salad was okay, beers were inexpensive, the meatballs looked good, nice empanadas, and a happy full set of tummies for all.Friendly staff, beautiful lofted glass ceiling, separate dimly lit bar, full drink menu, plenty of cozy booths with views, what more could a girl ask for?Date Rating: 4Pick up Scale: N/A (almost empty when we came, it was closing time, great space though has potential).Strong Suggestion: Don't confuse this location with the nearby smaller cozy one; but if it's early and you don't want to wait it's pretty much the same menu.==Vegas Birthday weekend continued==Feb 18th-Feb 21stThe first to arrive in Vegas were the three Chris'. Christian (christiang.yelp.com) Cebo (cbooz.yelp.com) and myself. After getting settled in our room and having a few drinks to start off the trip, we decided to grab a bite to eat here at Firefly. Christian has been here before so he suggested it. Great pick my friend!GOOD:- Various items to choose from. Great menu.- Bar. While waiting for a table, decided to grab a few jack and cokes.-Firefly fries (parmesan, herbs, aioli) Who doesn't love fries!? - Terra y Mare skewers (grilled shrimp, filet mignon, chorizo sausage, salsa verde) Came with 3 skewers. Another good choice.- Fried calamari (spicy gribiche dipping sauce) One of my faves. I mean who can resist deep fried rings that resemble foreskin!? Squeeze some lemon all over and you're set.BAD:- Right when the waiter comes up and asks what we want to drink, this is how the conversation starts:Waiter: "what can I get you fellas to drink?"Dude: "Oh, I like your hair!" (he had an awesome mohawk with designs shaved on the side)Waiter: "oh thank you, I like yours too!"Dude: *looks at his friends* (they are already clowning) "what!? it was the first thing i noticed!"What an awkward way to start the dinner. Nothing wrong with complimenting a guy on his hair. The compliment from the waiter talking about how he likes my hair set up a whole night of ridicule. Yes the "dude" was me and yes the waiter liked my bald head, big deal. UGLY:- Firefly. The name of the place. Had us singing this song all night. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psuRGfAaju4But instead our version sounded like this.You would not believe your eyesIf 100 real buff guyswas the last thing you saw as you fell asleepWhy did we stop and stare? These buff guys are everywhereAre we at excalibur?Oh wells, We don't really careI'd like to make myself believeThat one guy danced slowlyIt's hard to say that I'd rather stayAwake when I'm asleepCause everytime he dances you get weak!'Cause we'd give a thousand hugsHugs from these SD thugsOur hugs are equivalent to turbuLANCEWhy is this in our heads?Maybe we should go to bedPlease don't jump on yelp and start a threadI'd like to make myself believeThat this room is turning slowlyIt's hard to say that I'd rather stayAwake when I'm asleep'Cause everything is never as it seemsWe should go to sleep!!Why did that song come out that way?? After a few drinks, ok maybe after A LOT of drinks and always seeing THUNDER FROM DOWN UNDER ads you know why that came out that way!When you do Vegas with us, be prepared for some great laughs. That's how we do!!Firefly has the coolest dome in part of the restaurant that looks out onto Freemont Street. You can see pretty much the whole thing, and while inside you can also watch the giant TV canopy thing if it's time for the show.Misti Y took me here for dinner on my last night in town and I really enjoyed it. They serve up tapas style foods so we got a ton of small plates to share including the manchego mac and cheese, artichokes hearts on little toasts, lentils and veggies, bacon wrapped dates, and spicy shrimp. All of it was pretty good, but my favorite actually turned out to be the artichoke hearts. I know, I know! Who would have thought compared to manchego macaroni and bacon wrapped anything, artichoke hearts would win, but they did and they were damn good.Firefly also has a pretty decent drink menu including a sparkling sangria cocktail that I ordered. Yes, it's sangria made with sparkling wine. It was chock full of fruit, too and fairly sweet so it you don't like sweet drinks you may want to try something else.
Illegal Jack's=It pains me to lower my rating for Illegal Jack's but it has to be done.I returned here last week for a friends birthday and while I do enjoy the relaxed surroundings, I came away very disappointed.Since my last visit, Jack's have done something which puts them in the same boat as companies like Ryanair. They have started doing 'add on's.' So you look at the menu and think yum, I think I will have a Burrito! That is £6.50. Oh wait, you have to add an extra 75p on to that to put beef in your Burrito. That translates as paying £6.50 for a tortilla with some rice and beans. Not cool. Why can't you just buy a Burrito for £6.50? Why not include the beef in the price? I really don't think a tortilla, rice and beans is worth £6.50. Then the sneaky assistant behind the counter asks if you want sour cream and jalapenos, in the same way that they ask what type of salsa and beans you want. There is no mention at the extra cost. Your £6.50 Burrito quickly turns into costing you £10.10 with a cup of coke. The Burrito is huge, but you quickly realize it is made up of mostly rice and beans with very little beef. It is all rather tasteless and bland and the realization that it cost over a tenner makes it worse. I want to love this place because the idea is brilliant, but I think the prices do not reflect the quality or flavour of the food.Maybe some outrageously good Tex-Mex experiences have made me a little jaded or maybe all the reviews on here made me hope for too much, but this was simply not all that great. Sure, the burritos and quesadillas (the two dishes my wife and I tried) are huge, but the fillings are bland and mushy and adding extra toppings to fix the taste issue will quickly make things even more overpriced.This simply isn't good Tex-Mex. Kudos for trying - the guacamole wasn't bad - but right now, all you'll find here are some lifeless rice, beans, and tortillas wishing for a bit of spice and a whole lot less mush.
Winchell's Pub & Grill=The BF and I were driving around trying to find a late night meal somewhere new. There's only a handful of places we rotate past midnight and sometimes you just want to find something else. He remembered from a different Winchells that the garlic mushrooms were good. I love fried mushrooms and indeed these were solid, good flavor and crispy. They normally are on the menu in a appetizer platter, but you can order it solo for $5.99 I think. BF wanted breakfast so he grabbed the chicken fried steak and eggs. The CFS was nice, crunchy and had a decent gravy. The BF said that the home fries was the best he's ever had. Indeed they were nice.  They were perfectly crunchy outside, but inside was fluffy and soft. Sometimes great comes in doing something simple right.I wanted to get a hearty salad so I opted for the Cuvee (spring mix w/ apples, grapes, candied walnuts, smoke gouda, hearts of palm, broiled chicken, champagne vinegrette). It was a really tasty salad that had a bunch of stuff I love. It's the kinda of salad I would put together for myself, but it's like I'd never have all those things on hand to make a hearty salad at home. The chicken was juicy and it was crusted with garlic and herb, ingredients were fresh and it wasn't overtly dressed. Service was decent and friendly. On a random note, sitting by the fish tank was nice since I do like watching stupid fish chase each other around. I've been to two Winchells now. I liked this Winchells better than the one further east on Craig. I think they cooked everything much better at this one so I think I'll come back to this one.
Eggs-R-Us=I felt like I was walking into an old man's club. Basically because it was all old men and us four ladies eating breakfast. Apparently old men appreciate a bountiful breakfast, because that's what you get! The servings are incredible! They're massive, so get ready to eat and maybe not eat again that day! I really wanted just a basic breakfast with all the fixins, so I ordered the Bountiful Breakfast: two eggs, home fries, and sweet sausage. I opted to order a chocolate chip pancake instead of having the Italian toast the breakfast came with because you know... I didn't already have enough food!Everything was as expected for a greasy spoon diner. Greasy and good. i thought the pancake was delicious with tons of chocolate chips! And at around $8ish bucks this was a steal!I visited Eggs-R-Us for Sun. brunch this past weekend.  My friend and I were in this part of town to hit Antney's, but we wanted to put some real food in our stomachs before indulging in ice cream.  Eggs-R-Us was the closest place I had bookmarked, so we decided to check it out.  Note that it's a bit hard to find--it's right next to the liquor store in the shopping plaza.Upon walking in, most of the tables were occupied, and the ones that weren't needed to be cleared.  Since nobody greeted us, we went to seat ourselves at a table that was being cleared.  At that point, we were given menus and our order was taken fairly quickly.  However, our order took longer than I expected to prepare (about 30 min.)--to the point that I asked the waitstaff after 20 min. if the cooks had our order.When our food finally came out, my order was incorrect.  I ordered the almost famous breakfast sandwich with home fries ($5.79), but it came with hash browns, instead.  I pointed this out to the waitress, and, fortunately, she quickly rectified it.  The breakfast sandwich was about what I'd expect at a diner, which is fine--except that the eggs were folded unevenly so that part of the sandwich was full of them and part of it had almost none.  The home fries were underseasoned and underwhelming, but the mistaken order of hash browns was much better, so be sure to get hash browns when given the choice.  My friend ordered the bountiful breakfast with hash browns minus the toast ($5.99), and was satisfied with its quality.Overall, my visit to Eggs-R-Us was so-so.  The food, for the most part, was fine, but I was underwhelmed by the service.  In addition to the slowness of order fulfillment and the dirty tables, I had to ask another waitress to refill my water.  I get that Sun. afternoon is a busy time, but getting food out in a reasonable time frame and filling waters a couple of times are basic service expectations.  I wouldn't go out of my way to return, esp. given that I live in the city near the Bloomfield Sandwich Shop, which offers similar food and ambiance with *way* better service.  It is a convenient stop if you need a meal before hitting Antney's, though.
Modern Steak=When Jared asked me what I wanted to do for my birthday, my reply was "dinner at Modern Steak."  So, that's exactly what we did... and I couldn't have asked for anything more!We walked in and were immediately impressed with the extremely glamorous atmosphere.  Like, over the top, swanky, cool, but not quite overdone - almost like Vegas decor.  Ruthie was our server and she was fabulous!  I knew exactly what I wanted when I walked in... Jared took awhile longer.  But Ruthie was patient and sweet.  I started with a dirty martini.  Jared ordered a glass of Cabernet a little while later.  We ended up ordering a bunch of stuff and sharing.  Yes, I was the birthday girl, but I did manage to snag a copy of our receipt.  This is what it looked like:-Meris King Crab App - $24-Asparagus - $9-Rst Mushrooms - $10-Ketel One Martini $13-Chopped Salad - $9-Chilean Sea Bass - $$35-G_Manifesto (J's glass of wine) - $12-12 ox Meyers NY Strip - $30----------------------------------------Total before tip - $152.21I loved loved loved the chopped salad... lots of chopped up veggies and the perfect amount of Champagne vinaigrette.  And the beautiful thing about sharing at Modern Steak is that they split everything in the kitchen... and the portion sizes were still quite generous.  The king crab app is served warm and is melt in your mouth delicious but it literally comes in a jar full of a butter sauce so be forewarned.  The mushroom and asparagus sides were amazing also.  I honestly enjoyed every bite! In addition to what is listed on the bill, we enjoyed fresh baked potato and parmesan herb bread... delicious!  And the sea bass was fantastic and the steak was perfectly done per our request.  We skipped desert but ended up having another drink in the bar with friends.What a perfect way to celebrate my birthday!This will for sure be a go-to place for special occasions in the future.  Oh, and if you go, make sure to pay a visit to the rest room - it's adorable!  Lastly, a hidden Yelp tip, courtesy of my dude: "if you buy $100 worth of FRC gift cards, you'll receive $120 worth in return. That is a pretty good immediate return on your money; much better than my stock portfolio... enjoy!"Not just a fan.  A huge fan.  A large Kobe Burger fan.I started my night here, on the dazzling patio, infront of a fireplace, with the game playing on an overheard plasma screen.I was lounging back against the cushioned seats, a pillow providing the ultimate in comfort on each side of me.  And I held a "Jalisco flower" (hornitos anejo tequila, grapefruit, st.Germaine elderdlower, sparkling wine) in hand.Then my entree arrived.  A gorgeous, succulent, flavorful Kobe burger with Parmesan truffle fries, and blue cheese fondue to dip it in.  My tastebuds, my heart, my very soul, melted as I took that first bite.  I was in love by the time I dipped my first fry into the divine bleu cheese fondue.I don't regret my decision to eat a burger this night.  Despite the melange of fabulous and priced to pain steaks such as midwest prime beef, all natural American raised beef, and many seafood entrees.  It was one of the best I had savored in the valley.For the discerning beef eater, there is a featured heart brand akaushi filet for $78, or snake river farms qagyu rib eye for $62. Seafood specialties include maple bacon glazed Scottish salmon, miso glazed Chilean sea bass, and day boat scallops.A la carte sides include mascarpone creamed corn, cauliflower gratin, roasted brussel sprouts, sweet potato purée with burnt marshallows, baked potatoes, and classic man n cheese.My burger was more than enough to satisfy my cravings, but so overjoyed that I had the sweet potato puree.  It was like thanksgiving around a campfire, with s'mores.And if it had not been for my most wonderful dinner partner, I never would have sampled the Incredible lobster chowder.  A seafood party in my mouth.This definitely goes on my list of places to impress your palate, and/or your date.To note:  Perhaps the modern steak craze will die down once it has worn off its nouveau, but currently the place is packed to the rafters with diners, drinkers, and singles on the weekends.  Reservations are a must, four stomachs an even larger imperative.I was very impressed, I must say. This might sound a bit nerdy, but I was pretty excited all weekend to write this review. :-) From what I know of the Fox Restaurants I figured Sam would not fail with this new concept. I heard that the concept behind this one was to create an atmosphere for a steak house that women would feel comfortable in. Thinking about other steak houses they all feel a bit dark and uncomfortable. Anyone can feel comfortable and invited into Modern Steak. It has a very clean, bright and cushy feel. The patio is apparently climate controlled, I was unable to test out this rumor myself, but I believe it. So.... we sit down, the server greeted us in a timely manor, I ordered a black tea and my friend ordered the green tea. Probably some of the best iced tea I have had in a long time. Come to find out that this tea was specially blended for Modern Steak, woot woot, Sam Fox is kind of a big deal I guess. haha Point being, get the black tea, way good! We then checked out the menu, lunch menu as were out and about shopping after recovering from our New Year's hangover from hell, and came to find the prices really weren't all that crazy; $15 for a Kobe beef burger with fries or slaw, $11 for a huge Cobb salad, $11 for a club samy, $23 for a steak, you get the picture. We ended up getting the Cobb salad and the Kobe burger to split. Without us having to ask they split both entrees on to separate plates and bowls for us, AND didn't try to squeeze unnecessary money out of us by charging us a "split plate charge." That made me happy. Both items were fantastic and way more food than the two of us could finish. I will quote my friend (who works at one of the better burger joints in town) as saying "This burger si way better then ours." We were even too full to try any of the desserts that I am sure would have been amazing, speaking from experience at other Fox Restaurants (i.e. the amazing chocolate banana crepes at North). I cannot wait to go back for dinner... at which point I am sure I will need to find a rich date to take me, as the dinner prices/entrees are a bit more than lunch, but that is to be expected. Go check out Modern Steak if you get the chance, it's well worth it!5/13/10Simply amazing!!  Came in, and zeroed in on the two sliders up for sale at $2 each during happy hour.  These were the most-flavorful sliders, offering up the best mouth-feel (due to the aiolis and the focaccia bread they're sandwiched in), I've had in a very long time, possibly ever!  I'm kicking myself as I type this review for not ordering more (I had only one of each)!  The only complaint I had was that service was a complete opposite of what I experienced the first time around (when I had Clayton as my server).  I'd say that the whole time I was at the bar, I probably only spoke to my server (and I mean to say that she only visited and spoke to me) maybe three times- the first to greet and ask me what I wanted (I asked for water and also her suggestions for well drinks, and she didn't have many ideas to give); the second for my order and ticket in a glass ready to close; and the third for other possible selections I might want before closing the ticket.  A total 180 degrees from the excellent service showered on me by Clayton (props to you!).  If I haven't been back to have more of these terrific sliders, I'd have to say it was bec. of the lukewarm service I experienced this afternoon.What initially was a five-star review I must drop down to four.  Maybe next time, I'll be lucky enough to spot Clayton tending bar...Modern Steak screams cool. It just does. The exterior, the interior, the vibe, the colors...everything screams cool. Food: I've tried a variety of food options here yet surprisingly, never the steak.Their burgers are amazing. I know what you're thinking. What's so different about the Modern Steak burger? Well...it's on a sweet and soft roll, it has some great special sauce and the meat is great quality. Their fries are salty and delicious. And how do I even subscribe the chopped salad? Well, chopped it is but it's full of every great veggie on this planet...including avocado. Decor: I could probably hang out at Modern Steak all night and be completely happy. The white and blue accents and the atmosphere makes you feel so fresh and so clean. I heard the decor is copied after the Marie Antoinette movie and I think she'd be very proud. From the lighting to the trendy furniture, it's got an awesome vibe. And the bathrooms. Well gentlemen....when your girl is MIA, before you call the cops, check the bathrooms. Fully equipped with couches, this is the bathroom I wish I could copy and place in my own house. I actually wish I could copy the entire Modern Steak decor for my home. Happy Hour: I don't know how long this is lasting, but right now they are having the most amazing happy hour! $5 drinks and $2 food items. Yes, I said it correctly....two dollars!! An awesome meal and drinks for $10? Yep, that's what you can do at Modern Steak right now! So in summary, this is a great location for a night out with friends, a nice date, if you want to grab some drinks at the trendy bar or you want to relax and lounge of the comfortable patio...you've got to check out Modern Steak!I love the juxtaposition of Modern Steak. A straight forward, steak house type menu in an Elton John over the top decorated space. My goal, one day, is to swing from chandelier to chandelier while chowing on my Kobe burger. Our service was swift, friendly and well...practically perfect. The soft sour cream and chive butter with the foccaccia style bread is a total knockout. I was smearing it on my lips like Carmex. We started with the lobster chowder which was served in these hot metal bowls. Chowder was ok. Not amazing and definitely could have used some seasoning (nutmeg, allspice!?)...lobster was adequate, if not a little chewy. Mac n cheese was also good, but nothing to make me do my Meg Ryan from When Harry Meets Sally impersonation. The Kobe Burger? Total home run! Outstanding. Perfectly cooked. Love the homemade 1,000 island, the applewood bacon...all yummy yummy. As were the fries which were served with a side of ketchup. Missing was the trendy aioli that so many other restaurants seems to offer now. Modern Steak gets a solid 3.5 stars Love the textures and colors and am looking forward to swinging by again soon.not a fan.i truly believe people are tricked by the decor. it really does make you feel cute and happy, but it's like a wolf in sheeps clothing bc the food and service suck. this applies to every fox concept, i've decided. our waiter was a diva, and not in a good way. he rolled his eyes at me several times and all i did was ask for lemon with my water. then i asked for vinegar and oil on the side instead of on my salad. it came on my salad so i asked politley if i could have a new side salad. he got so pissed and grabbed my plate without saying anything. when he returned he just slammed it down in my face. i would have walked out if i wasn't with people. i hate rude servers. then i ordered the kobe burger and it was burnt on the outside.  and it had no flavor. i had to salt and pepper the crap out of it.  last time i pay $17 for a gross burger and rude service, i don't care how effing cute your patio is.Tonight I ate in the dining room of Modern Steak and got another taste of the delicious menu offerings. For the feast we started with a chopped salad, grilled artichoke and roasted winter squash. Each item was delicious and a great way to get our taste buds warmed up for the meal. At first I was hesitant to try the squash since I'm typically not a huge squash fan, but one bite and I lost all former memories! The squash melted in my mouth and was seasoned with a butter and cinnamon spread. I probably could have eaten the entire dish and been satisfied, but on to entrees we went! While my willpower fought between the salmon and burger, I decided to let the salmon part win that night (even though the burger looked so good). The salmon was bacon glazed and placed upon round sweet potatoes. The portion was huge but I found a way to consume half of it which was plenty for me! I did manage to eat all of the sweet potatoes though which were too good to pass up! The waiter was friendly and kept the meal flowing. Bravo Modern Steak![Happy Hour Review]+ 3-6:30PM+ $2 or $2.50 [What??! you ask!] I know, right.+ THE Catch: PRICE PER ITEMWhat has been ORDERED:+ Parmesan Fries with Aioli - $2, Very share-able, comes in a basket, seasoned well and crispy+ Oyster - $2, fresh fresh fresh, comes with lemon, cocktail sauce and hot sauce+ White Shrimp - $2.50 each, more-less mediocre+ Half Market Soup - $2, the great thing about their soup is its really simple yet excellent in taste, had Onion Soup and Mushroom Soup on 2 separate occasions+ Roast Beef Slider - $2, thinly sliced meat, cooked nicely with soft buns and delicious sauce+ Regular Slider - $2, nicely cooked patty, with soft bunsWine - Red, White, Bubbles - $5 per glassThere's a handful of cocktail drinks for $5I recommend sitting at the bar if you want quicker service.  The Happy Hour specials are offered in the Patio area as well.  Just about every time I stop by, there's always room to sit.  Bartenders are friendly and attentive.  For the elegant and vintage-style that offers cheap bites, its a no brainer that Modern Steak does it the BEST.This restaurant is so "pretty."  Reminds me of Vegas restaurants...My boyfriend and I came here for happy hour a couple of times (3-6:30 PM) and we loved it!!  We ordered:-Parmesan fries w/ aioli-$2, large portion, tastes so good and seasoning is on point. Sauce complements the fries great.-Roast beef slider -$2/each, best of the picks for Happy hour, so good and the horseradish is amazing.  Meat was soft and the sweet bread was perfect.-Curry soup - $2/bowl, this was amazing!! We shared this the first time and wanted it again our second visit, but the soup changed.  But the flavors meshed well and tasted like curry in a soup form.  All happy hour food items and drinks were $5 or less, a bargain!!  Wines include reds, whites, and bubbly.  They also have liquor such as Skyy vodka, Cruzan rum, Jim Beam bourbon.Chairs in the patio are red with marble white table tops.  A beautiful design in the ceiling cut out in the patio frames the very hip and trendy outdoor area.  Inside, they have cushioned orange seats and glass, glass, glass everywhere.  It was like I stepped into a design from Architectural Digest.  This restaurant is gorgeous and a great place to have happy hour in Scottsdale.Definitely a must try in my book!
Baguette Cafe=The Skinny: better than your average sandwich shop with a nicer ambience but not much more than that (3), service: we apparently hit the cafe around 1:00 but it still took 10 minutes for us to get our orders down... and we were the first ones in line (2) value: it's not bad - around $6-7 for a decent sandwich however it's not worth the drive to come here and eat. (3).This place obviously caters to the office buildings nearby given it's remote location hidden by the towering adjacent structures. We wandered in while the suits were getting their fix of illy coffee with lunch.First of all, despite it's moniker, this place has nothing to do with baguettes. We ordered two sandwiches - one ham and cheese and one pressed panini with a curry chicken filling.The bread is more of a ciabatta-type affair - a 6 inch loaf with a dense texture and a little mildy unpleasant hard chewy crust. This is not the light centered loaves with the pleasant crust that I was anticipating.The ingredients inside the sandwich were very good - the slices of chicken in the curry sandwich was sufficiently moist and tender while the sauce was pleasant. The ham and cheese sandwich was made with fresh ingredients albeit the bread was only okay for me. I was a little struck by how disorganized the people in the back were - there were three sandwich makers/servers in the back that were looking for direction from the cashier who I believe is the owner. This unfortunately was sufficiently distracting enough (plus he took a phone order in the interim) that it took about 10 minutes for us to place our orders.Yeah - this place serves a better sandwich than your average place but is it something to go back for or drive across town? I'm not so sure. 3 stars.I'm a true night owl at heart and I was so looking forward in trying this place that I literally set my alarm clock to wake up super early to beat the lunch crowd here.The location may seem like a scavenger hunt... if you're coming from Rainbow Blvd., making a right onto W. Sunset Rd., you'll drive up and when you see tall office buildings and shiny reflective windows, you'll know you're almost there.. make a left as soon as you see an entry to go in... stay on the left side of the whole complex and when you see the office building number 8337, it's behind that building and you'll be making a slight right passing it. Baguette Cafe will be next to Bank of America. Hope these directions help in your hunt if you decide to give this cafe a try.I walked in and was greeted right away with a friendly, sweet smile from a gentleman named Olivier. He asked me my name and if I worked in one of the offices nearby and I told him no, but that I stopped by because I wanted to try this cafe. He was happy that I came here and started to passionately talk about what's the specials are today and specifically told me each ingredient that were in those dishes. He was very informative as if he knew everything by heart to the very last seasoning. I love it when you can tell when someone has the "fire" for flavor and food... He enjoyed telling me everything as if he was sharing his favorite recipe with me. All this, while I don't have any makeup on... I know scary right??!?!? It's not even Halloween yet!! Yikes! And he still treated me as if I was his #1 guest. I ended up trying the Prosciutto Baguette which consist of: mixed greens, tomato, prosciutto, salami, blue cheese, walnut, and celery spread. My sandwich and a handful portion of mixed green salad that had a tangy dressing on top of it was plated on a rectangular white glass dish. Olivier brought me some utensils and hope I enjoy my meal. From the first look at this Baguette.. I was afraid the bread would be tougher than leather to chew and harder than rock to break glass.. BUT it wasn't at all the case. It was tough on the outside, since most baguette are made that way and soft in the inside... almost spongy. The bread was good, but I was chewing way more than I ever did when eating a sandwich. I actually woke up the next day with a slight sore jaw, but I remember Olivier mentioning that I can order it Panini- style instead of Baguette. There wasn't anything wrong with the Baguette, as a matter of fact the whole sandwich was satisfying and all the ingredients complimented each other. The celery spread tasted light and fresh with a touch of tartness... it kept me guessing what's in it, but it was a delicious spread that softened the saltiness of the freshly cut prosciutto. The walnuts even made it mellow, in a sense giving it a smooth flavor. The blue cheese wasn't so profound, but you can taste it was there. Overall, I did enjoyed this meal. I washed my palate down with some Green Tea Pomegranate Iced Tea that they served there. It was the bitter kind without having any sugar, but I like it sometimes like that. I bought two muffins on my way out: the Pumpkin and Strawberry. I recall Olivier bringing out a fresh batch of muffins when I first walked in the cafe... they ran out of the Banana Nut Muffin, which I wanted to try, but the Pumpkin Muffin was out of this world delicious! I originally was only going to one bite and start my errands, but it so happens that before I knew it... I did my own magical act and the Pumpkin Muffin disappeared in thin air into my tummy. I know I didn't know I had such talent, but I was still in disbelief that I ate it all in a few seconds. Poof!! Abbra Cudabbra give me another Pumpkin muffin!! :( Sadly I couldn't make it happen and my muffin bag was still empty... darn. I saved the Strawberry Muffin for my date and he asked me if it was still good?!??! Ooo I wanted to hit him upside his head, but no no I'm not a violent person so I told him.. of course it's still good, they made it today!!! What?!? Is he crazy to think I'm going to give him a rotten, spoiled muffin??! Come on! He later told me he ate it for breakfast the next day and it was good. This cafe isn't a fast food order and BAM it comes out in a flash... no siree bob... they make it after you order and use the freshest ingredients. If you have time to relax, then you'll enjoy this place... but if you want something quick... maybe a salad or muffin doesn't take that long... they have a good selection of salads if that's something you are looking for. Fraps, hot chocolate, smoothies too! They have outside seating as well and bring out the food for you when it's ready. They even play catchy, fun even romantic french music.. nice listening pleasure while you grab a bite to eat or wanting to relax over some tea or coffee. Even though it might be challenging to find this cafe, you'll be happy you took the journey to find it.So, this place is pretty much amazing. Everything lives up to par. The food, coffee, and service. It's a small little place hidden in a business complex, but if you're smart enough to find it - then you deserve to eat there !! Think of it as a treasure hunt. If you take the time to find it, you'll be rewarded in the end. The owner, Olivier, is a very friendly man. If it's your first time, he gladly explains almost everything he has on his menu. And what I liked most, is that he takes the time to find out your name and shake your hand. Not many establishments do that. Although he does have a set menu, the soups, quiches, & tarts seem to change almost every day. Plus, I do believe he just has other random food items available each day, so be sure to ask him what he has for the day [though, I'm sure he'll tell you before you get the chance to ask]. I had the chicken curry sandwich, an item not regularly available on his menu. Damn, it was delicious. Good flavored curry, tender chicken, great baguette, plus some fresh herbs and such. I hope he has this on a more regular basis. For you vegetarian and/or vegan folk, he has quite a few options on his menu, and he said he was looking to add more. The croissants there are supposed to be really great. I wish I could confirm this, but unfortunately I'm not a big fan of croissants. They're just too buttery and flaky for my taste [a lot of people judge me for this, but it's OK. =p]. But, I will comment that they did LOOK good. Overall, a great place to meet a friend for lunch. Or get some studying done [ free wifi !]. Plus, with an always changing selection of food, you'll always have a chance to try something new. When you go, be sure and eat a croissant for me.This place is legiznit!It's usually tough for a business to live up to the hype, but I've been on a lucky run lately. Baguette Cafe recently popped up on my radar thanks to some stellar ratings. I'm glad to report that Olivier's humble little joint in an unassuming business park next to the freeway... is all that and a baguette (of chips?).I went there for lunch today. I had read about some amazing soups, so I decided to get a half sandwich and soup combo. For the sandwich, I chose their curry chicken on a baguette. Are you kidding? How could that not be good? But the thing that blew me away was the soup. It was some sort of sweet potato concoction with puréed carrots and some curry spice. It was pretty incredible. In hindsight, that soup was the perfect thing to pair with my sandwich.If there was one thing to complain about, the portions are kind of small. But that's just my American brainwashing speaking. Honestly, the meal satisfied me completely. I will definitely return.Olivier at Baguette is one of the nicest people I've come across in a long time. Seriously, stepping into this casual coffee shop/cafe is like stepping into a friend's welcoming kitchen. Provided of course that you have friends who know how to seriously handle themselves in a kitchen.Misti Y brought me here for a quick lunch and some work time. Free wi-fi is always a plus and Baguette Cafe provides that. But, they also provide a nice, simple meal as well. I tried a combination of the veggie soup and a crunch salad. Each portion was half sized which meant they were perfect together to provide a whole meal.The soup was a cream instead of what I expected (I expected more of a broth with whole vegetables cooled in there), but it was a fantastic flavor. The crunch salad was simple and simply delightful - chock full of jicama, carrots, and other such crunchy veggies.The prices were more than reasonable and if I'm not mistaken you can get a baked good made fresh that day to round out your meal. One note - this is strictly a morning and afternoon spot as I'm fairly certain they close at 5 pm on the weekdays and aren't open on weekends at all.I've had this place on my radar screen for a very long time.  I finally decided to give it a try when I was in the area recently.  The name is kind of misleading.....I was expecting a sit-down restaurant with table service, what I found was a Coffee Shop (a la Starbucks), except it's locally owned.  I was a little disappointed because I had built up a huge appetite and the menu was very limited.After a few minutes I decided to get their Cheese Pannini.  When I arrived, there was only 1 person in front of me, so I thought the service was going to be fast.....it wasn't.  It took almost 15 minutes to make my Paninni.....which for a sit-down restaurant wouldn't be bad, but for an order at the counter type place, it's kind of a long time.  I arrived just before the lunch rush (11:30 am)....while I was waiting, it got very busy with 10 people in line or so.  They are single threaded here with their food preparation, so I can't imagine how long they will have to wait for their food.Anyway, when my food came out, it looked great.  I couldn't wait to take a bite of the Paninni.  It was as good as it looked, very good!http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA?select=iM-bmUJgFX3I3lpLT57uTQhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA?select=E2YbzDiWAomUXZQu3VtjSwThe Tomato Sauce in the Paninni was great and full of flavor.  The Bread was very tasty too.  The Paninni came with a very small side of greens which also went well with the dish.  I wish there were more greens.Overall, it was a good experience.  However, for those with large appetites, I wouldn't suggest it....the portions are too small and ordering two Paninnis wouldn't be cost effective.  The joint is situated between a bunch of office buildings and is suited more for that crowd than a casual diner.  The staff is very nice here and makes a sincere attempt and getting to know their guests.  They asked me what my name was and where I was from, where I heard about the place, etc.....and they knew several of the people who stopped by for lunch by their 1st name....I'm guessing by the way they were dressed that they worked in one of the buildings nearby.Return Factor - 30%If my office was closer I'd eat here nearly everyday (as it is I make the trek 1-2x a week!). Olivier is a fabulous host and seems genuine and passionate about the quality of his food. Yup, it's just a sandwich shop, but I cannot think of a better soup/salad/sandwich spot in town. His food reminds me of eating in a cute cafe in Paris without the price tag! I typically get the Proscuitto salad and one of his yummy soups. They change daily and have yet to disappoint. The cream of mushroom was the best cream of mushroom I've ever had. I look forward to trying more of them every time I go. My favorite new addition to the menu is the FRESH Thai coconuts !! I adore coconut water so getting the chance to drink out of a fresh coconut from Thailand on my lunch break is a major treat.I won't deduct any stars for this, but it's a major bummer there is never any quiche when I go at lunch. Apparently it sells out at breakfast. I keep crossing my fingers and hoping he'll have some at lunch time someday!!  The selection of baked type things is relatively limited in general, but I appreciate that they make the baked good fresh so it's hard to have a huge variety on hand at a small restaurant. I adore Baguette Cafe because there is decidedly nothing Vegas about it. Fresh healthy DELICIOUS foods served by a charming owner - I've found my favorite lunch spot in Vegas.Wow!  Yelp comes through again!  I've driven past this place on the 215 quite a few times but couldn't be bothered to figure out how to get to it.  Then I had a meeting in a very confusing office complex off of West Sunset and, viola, there it is!  I had to try it.It was breakfast time so I got the omelet sandwich in a freshly baked croissant and a funky monkey blended drink, which is a mocha drink with banana.  They even did it decaf!  The funky monkey was delicious and the omelet was a nice surprise.  Spinach, a variety of flavorful cheeses, extremely yummy.I love that the owners speak to each other in French.  Gives the place a certain je nais se quoi, you know what I mean?  I'll definitely be going out of my way to visit this place again.Before I write this review, I have to mention that Paolo D. said this place was "legiznit"I have to say that I agree with most of the Yelpers, this place is pretty awesome.  I'm not going to go on about the food, because everyone has pretty much summed it up.  But one thing that I am surprised that no one has mentioned are the prices.  I had been complaining a lot lately that I couldn't get a decent sandwich without spending over 10 bucks.  This place is different, you can get one for around 6 bucks, which is great.  And if you're afraid like me that you won't get full, get a decent sized salad or soup for another 3ish bucks.  But this is a perfect lunch spot on a work day.  The food is legiznit (did I just say that??)  The portions aren't huge where you're going to be in a food coma, and you're not going to spend your life savings.  What a deal huh?if you're staying near the strip, baguette cafe can be a little bit of a drive...especially bc there's a lot of construction going on and you WILL get lost...even with a nav...give yourself about 45 minutes or so to get to the restaurant...that being said, you will not be disappointed...chicken panini, celery root soup, and toasted baguettehttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA?select=N_KsuGRY32M3FQg9f3ToGAchicken panini with chipotle saucehttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA?select=REXaEwWwSSxtp44mGvmNMQcelery root souphttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA?select=VfiJkKgaJL9cTLgEf5oFMAthe sandwich and soup were delicious...the only reason baguette cafe doesn't get a fifth star is bc the service can be a bit slow even when they are not that busy...it probably took at least 30 minutes for everything to come out..i would still go back for the food...and to hear olivier (the owner) talk in his french accent...Merci BC!I finally got to visit BC now that I live 4 miles away! :) My bestie Jenny C and I really enjoyed our visit here.I had the breakfast combo and paid extra to change it to a carmel macchiato and croissant. I paid a total of $8 :)))Oliver was nice--- asked for my name-- brought out my food and even water for my puppy.We sat outside with our dogs and I enjoyed free wifi!I'm excited to come back and try out more things on the menu!I love Paris... french food... and cafes... so Baguette Cafe really hit my yummy spot!Love it here!-Miss Yelp 2012WHO: Anyone you want to take on a lunch date ;) *nudge nudgeWHEN: Monday through Friday from 7am-5pm.WHERE: On Sunset & Durango, close to the corporate buildings.WHY: For their tasty French baguettes.WHAT: My best friend and I decided we needed to have lunch. And since I had heard such great reviews about this place, we decided to go and try it out.First thing's first, I love Olivier!! Anything he said, I believed! And because he said the Yellow Curry baguette was one I should try, TRY is what I did. And yes, Olivier does it again! Such a great sandwich, with a touch of spice, and a cup of tomato basil soup... This had to be the best lunch I've ever had!Olivier charmed my friend into trying the Moroccan baguette (which I will have to try next time), and she also fell in love with how well-made the sandwich was.For dessert, we tried the newly made Peach Tart, which was UHHMAAYYYZIINNNGGGG! It was not too sweet, and just the right amount for both of us.I'd love to go back and try some of their other baguettes and pastries SOONER THAN LATER. In the meantime, check it out for brunch & tell me how much you LOVE the yellow curry baguette 8).This is the best find I have found on YELP. I LOVE this place and can't wait to go back! I was bummed it's closed on the weekend because I wanted to take friends that can't get out during a weekday. Their (working friends) loss. The location is obscure but the food is INCREDIBLE. I love the diverse delicious menu options. I especially love knowing it's locally owned and operated by family. I can't wait to try different things. I had the Eggplant panini w/ prosciutto ~ toasted. It was so good I knew I would be back after the first bite. PROS:Eggplant panini with prosciuttoChicken Pesto sandwich (black board special)Velouté of mushroom soupCHOCOLATE TWISTFresh innovative foodLocally owned and operatedPrices are lowCONS:Only open on the weekdays.I've had BG bookmarked for a long time and now that I've been I am a big fan.  One of the first things I noticed was the very enthusiastic owner who seemed so excited about his food and everything.  That is one of my favorite traits of an owner, when they are excited about their food and excited about the people are going eat their food. The line was almost out the door and I could hear the excitement from right at the door.  Which is always a good sign.  I think we all ordered the Bosc!? Bosk!? Bosq!? however you spelt it it's all sounds at least 6 of us maybe 10 just because how he explained what went inside.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/baguette-cafe-las-vegas-2?select=5LkJ582csgxifnT_0pTL1A#5LkJ582csgxifnT_0pTL1A It wasn't on the menu but ask for it you're going to enjoy it. It was delicious.  I also picked up a green tea frappe.  Just trying to stay cool.Everything they made looked and smelt so good. I wanted everything.  They made sandwiches, pastries, soups, salads, frappes, and coffee drinks.  Items are reasonably prices. It was very busy during a mid week lunch and the seats filled up.  There are more seats outside in front and if you're lucky some in the shade of a tree. I was fine with eating outside even though it was hot there was a nice breeze. I have their quiche and their other sandwiches on my radar.  I'm just going to work my way through everyone's pictures. I'll be here more often.I had heard so many good things about this place I was excited to finally get the opportunity to try it! The menu is small but don't be discouraged, I heard a lot about the Chicken Curry Sandwich but it was no where to be found on the menu. We asked and we received. My husband got the Bleu and Brie Panini, had chicken, Brie, blue cheese, walnuts, celery, and mustard spread. It was good, he loved it. But I thought my Chicken Curry Sandwich was better. I can't wait it get it again. The baguettes the sandwiches are made with are perfect. The cafe is small and at 3pm it was almost full. The staff was friendly and tried to get to know everyone that came in. Prices are worthy of the quality.I'm looking forward to try one of their soups and dessert!Tucked into the corner of a business complex, Baguette Cafe may be a little difficult to find (even with the maps posted on Yelp)  but well worth the search. It is a small, cozy spot that gets rather busy during the lunch hour. I met Christie O. for lunch recently, at 11 am there was ample seating to choose from but within the hour, every seat inside was taken and there were even some patrons seated outside. Baguette Cafe is owned by an amazingly friendly and highly skilled chef named Olivier. He was in back when we arrived, but we received very friendly service from the sweet employee manning the counter... and Olivier came out a little later to say hello and ensure everything was to our liking. What a charmer that man is!Baguette Cafe is serving up BIG time taste at really inexpensive prices... My lunch was a half a sandwich (tuna salad), a cup of soup (cream of sweet potato) and a large iced tea, and it cost under $10! The soup was lick-the-cup delicious and the baguette that the sandwich came on was perfectly chewy without being hard. The portions are not huge, but for me it was the perfect amount of food. While I am not vegan, it is always nice to see places that care enough to offer up vegan selections for those that are. Most menu items can be altered to accommodate different dietary requests. I definitely look forward to another lunch at Baguette Cafe, and I think the next time I go in, I will have to try some of the baked desserts Christie and others have raved about!I've had this bookmarked for a while and realized it was closed weekends. Now that our days off are weekdays and our friends who have the same day off as us live in the SW, it was time to finally check something off my list that has been sitting there, patiently, for years. We were gonna order off the menu until we were told the two specialty sandwiches. There was a yellow curry chicken sandwich and a moroccan sandwich that had north african spices, goat cheese, red bellpepper, etc. Both sandwiches were great sounding so we chose those. I liked the moroccan a bit more, but only because Im a sucker for those flavors combos. The bread was nice, good balance of crusty and softer bready center. Got the ice tea of the day - green tea citrus gingko which was refreshing. I like places the brew fresh, and brew something a bit more unique that plain black. The service was really friendly - it was the owner of the place at the counter. He was super enthusiastic and caring of his place. They brought out our food outside and came to check on everyone outside which I didn't expect. It is always a nice touch for counter service places to still have some sort of service. I think the price to quality ratio was very good. It seems they use better products with an emphasis on natural, healthy choices and nice to have places not charge a arm to get fresh choices.I can see why people like this as their casual lunch spot. I think there are other similar sandwich and coffee type cafes like these you can compare it to, and this I think this probably ranks top notch among them. I will be back to try more and try a specialty drink next time now that it's near places we frequent.I have had Baguette Cafe bookmarked to try for a while and finally stopped by on my lunch break to try out a sandwich. Baguette Cafe is a bit hard to find the first time. I had trouble locating it since it is nestled with other office buildings, but had the address thanks to yelp and soon found my way. I was impressed with how many tables and chairs there is outside. It was a glorious day out too and many people were eating out there.When it came time for my order, Olivier, one of the owners was glad to go over the different sandwiches with me. I ordered "The Prosciutto" priced at $6.95 and it came on a baguette. The sandwich had prosciutto, salami, mixed greens, tomato, walnuts, celery and blue cheese spread. The sandwich had a good taste, but the bread was tough to chew and rough on my gums. I have been told by other yelpers that getting the sandwich "panini" style isn't so rough on your jaw/mouth, but wanted to try it how it came on the baguette the first time. I also didn't taste any celery and only tasted one bite of blue cheese and felt the sandwich could have had more meat in it to match the rough texture of the bread, but did I did think what was in-between the bread tasted good.  I also kindly asked him if he would do the honor of choosing a dessert for me to have later. The reason I asked him to chose for me is because I would have went with the same ole thing and I'm sure that would have tasted great, but I wanted to try something different. Sure enough, what Olivier picked out was nothing I would have picked on my own and now after having it, I was left craving more.Should you want to cater breakfast or lunch for your office, Baguette Cafe can handle that for you. With the right amount of notice they can deliver and set up the food so call and ask for details. If you are feeling like an omelet, sandwich, wrap, soup, salad, fresh juice or even a latte, they have that too.Go for a sandwich...but don't overlook the soup, every one that I tried was delicious. (Butternut Squash with Ginger this time...amazing! ).And I can't leave without a muffin or 2 for later. My husband loves the real Ginger Soda.Staff is always friendly!  And they are in the process of putting up a better menu on the wall.Gotta love Baguette Cafe!!MLK Day, 2014.  After having just finished a lovely holiday bike ride, I met up with two of my favorite foodie kiddos, Derek and Petra, and their moms since I knew they'd be off, too.  Long a Yelp bookmark, it was finally a great day to dine here since they're closed on the weekends.  After zig-zagging through the parking lot, I found the cafe.  Every table was taken and there was a short line at the register to order.  Thankfully, one party vacated while we were in line, so our party of five could sit down inside.  This place is very popular; after I checked in on Yelp, a plethora of recommendations were thrown my way in the comments section.  I was told to get the soup of the day, no matter what it was.  When I got to the register, Olivier, the friendly proprietor, told me the soups of the day were cream of zucchini with parmesan and cream of roasted pepper, but the latter wasn't ready just yet.  I chose a cup of the zucchini soup with a half of the 3 Cheese sandwich with added turkey for protein.  I spied the croissants behind Olivier and asked for one of those, too.  Petra ate the zucchini soup and Derek munched on a raisin croissant; these kids have good taste and that's why I eat with them a lot.  We all enjoyed our food, including the new acai bowl that's been added to the menu.  There was a steady stream of customers the whole time we were there and, in fact, the line was to the door by the time we left.  Word on the street is that Olivier is opening up another establishment and it will be open on weekends; if that's the case, I will certainly be back more often with the little partners in dine (and their moms).I have to give it to you Vegas Yelpersfor giving this completely hidden gem,that is hella off, off, off, off, the Strip cafe(break out the GPS)the accolades it deeply deserves.I know it's wrongthat I didn't want to post my reviewin order to preserve this secret spot for myself,but, in the end, it didn't matter since300 other Yelpers still found about and yelped it.Anyways,The food here is just absolutely delicious.And the vegan option simply makes it that more special.Sandwiches are made withfreshly baked bread and an eclectic selection of tasty ingredients.The soups are lovingly made from scratchand the freshness and qualityis pretty evident with each wonderful sip.Moreover,Oliver made our visit feel more like going to a friend's home than a cafe.He is warm and inviting, super amicable, and to hear him gush about the food, makes you realize how much love and pride goes into the cooking.I do not give out five stars lightlyand is more rare that I give such a high reviewafter a first visitbut Cafe Baguette is like no other place I've visited before.After reading Dyanna L.'s review of this place, I hit the Bookmark button faster than a fat kid runs to cake (I'm a fat kid and when I see cake, I run exponentially faster at even the whiff of cake). Gathering medical records from various hospitals for myself and my Gammy, she asked if there was a place to grab some food that didn't suck. Knowing that Dyanna and I have similar tastes and FINALLY being able to check it off the bookmark list, I arrived here at Baguette Cafe. I highly recommend using GPS to find this place. It's tucked in with a bunch of medical offices and business buildings.The place has a fast casual environment. A huge portion of the space is occupied by the food prep station, espresso bar, and the kitchen. The space was mostly empty and there were a few patrons enjoying the Spring day outside.The menu is huge and written on a chalkboard, there were a variety of sandwiches, soups, and salads. There were vegan/vegetarian/carnivore options. I talked to the owner, Olivier, and he was knowledgable, answered all my questions, and made me feel welcome.My vegan cream of veggie soup was amazing. A green mush color, but full of flavor and it wasn't overly salty. It was balanced and delicious. I ordered an eggplant sandwich in vegan glory and my grandma got the tuna salad. Both were nice potion sized and excellently prepared. I love when you can taste freshness and that's what was delivered.Baguette Cafe was all that I hoped for and all that I dreamed it to be. I can't wait to find myself in the SW area of town to dine her for a quick, comfy, casual lunch again.ce qui est-il à dire à propos de baguette café?Maybe that it is the greatest cafe in the WORLD!!! MuahahahahahahaAHEM! Anyway, I frequent this lovely cafe as often as I possibly can. My office is only about 4 minutes away. That's very dangerous. Luckily I have a bit of self control and a tight wallet. The owner greets everyone as they walk in and gives each and everyone the attention they deserve when you get to the counter. He will answer any and all questions and never rush you away for the next customer. He knows his regulars very well as each business should. It adds that extra touch of special. Only wish I would have is that they be open one day over the weekend, so that I may bring my family more often.So instead of going through what I have tried, I will just fill you in on my favorite. 99% of the time I go with The Turkey sandwich and I switch out the Swiss for mozzarella. Turkey is always moist and everything is fresh. Caramelized onions are also included on this sandwich. Along side every sandwich is a petite salad with the most delicious dressing. I have yet to figure out exactly what it is. All I know is my mother and I are addicted to it. ADDICTED!! It's like a delicious drug. We also go with a classic black tea which is always brewed to perfection. Occasionally we will do a muffin or cookie, but we have to be extremely hungry. Let me end it this way, I've never had a bad experience here nor have I had anything that was not delicious!Delicious is an understatement!!!!il ya beaucoup de choses merveilleuses à dire sur baguette café!Not every place lives up to the hype.  That said, I find it even rarer for a place to exceed expectations.  Baguette Café has done that for me!Baguette Café is one of the absolute best breakfast/brunch/lunch cafes you will find for the dollar!  Please know that I am way more into savory Items that sweet varieties.  I have a lot of friends that shell out 4 strong stars here for the pastries, but I am so into their savory items!  It's an easy 5 stars in my book.Chef Olivier is one of the nicest and more engaging owners you will meet.  Passionate about food, he takes time with any willing audience to impart a depth of knowledge about the products being used in your meal.  This may not change the way your meal tastes, but it certainly enhances the experience for anyone that remotely cares about what they ingest.  The quiches here might be the best I've had in Vegas...and if not the best, they are certainly in the conversation.  A light and buttery crust gives way to a balanced and scrumptious filling.  Their soups are equally enjoyable.  They change regularly, but are consistently wonderful!  I also have a lot of love for their grilled sandwiches--The Curry, Blue Brie, and Moroccan all worth trying out.  Limited hours prevent some from enjoying Baguette Café, so check out the days and hours of operation before you head over here...but do make a point to stop by and enjoy their offerings!As an insightful reviewer has pointed out, the best way to get there, if you are going west on 215, is to exit Buffalo and take Raphael Rivera.  That way you can avoid the Office Park maze.Owner/Chef Olivier is super friendly and introduced himself as I perused the menu- opted to get two sandwiches to share with my guy (the Eggplant and the Chipotle) along with a cup of the soup of the day (roasted red pepper). Sandwiches were made fresh to order, brought out wrapped up tight and hot to the touch. Wait time was a reasonable ten minutes.Chipotle was delish, with chipotle sauce, chicken, bacon, avocado, and pepper jack cheese- lots of flavor and a tiny bit of kick without too much spice.Eggplant sandwich was better than expected, with fresh-grilled veggie, mozzarella, and tomato pesto, served on a fresh and chewy baguette that held up despite the moisture of the sauces and the ample amount of stuffing in the sandwich itself.Soup was good and clearly homemade- flavorful and creamy without feeling heavy. Cup is a tiny portion, BF inhaled it and I barely got a taste. Didn't expect him to enjoy this flavor but it was gone so fast, he must have! ;)Wish hours were more convenient for early dinners or weekends to visit regularly. TIP: Location can be difficult to find. From Sunset, turn into the office park and wind your way to the very back (towards the highway). Yes, you can get here without being on the 215 access road.A real 4.5-star rating for lil' Baguette Cafe. If you're in the area (or work nearby), there's no better place to pick up a fresh 'wich, salad, or juice. The menu is small, so they don't spread themselves to thin here. That being said, theres something for everyone. Eggs all day, salads (with various greens and meats), pastries and hot & cold sandwiches are all represented. I've yet to hit the pressed sammies, but The Turkey, crispy greens and egg baguette panini (w/ ham added) are enough to have me hooked. Everything tasted fresh and the portion sizes were perfect for lunch.The real knocks here are the location (NOT easy to find from the road. Use the map in the Yelp app) and that the place is a bit small. When the queue reaches 4+ people, you might be waiting outside or right on someone who is eating. Avoid the lunch rush and you're money!I stopped at Baguette Cafe two years ago on a Saturday to find out they were closed on weekends.  With much of their business coming from the office buildings where, they're located, that's probably a goof idea because even though it's along the freeway, it's off the beaten path.There was no line and I ordered a Moroccan sandwich with chicken, one of their grilled sandwich options.  This sandwich can also be made with eggplant for a vegetarian option.  With it, I ordered an iced black tea.I sat at a high top table on the side so I could watch the people do their work at the grill and espresso machine.In a short time, my sandwich and tea were on my table.  The sandwich came with some mixed greens with a little dressing.  The Moroccan is made with goat cheese, roasted tomatoes, roasted red peppers, and is topped with a North African spiced aioli.  The sandwich was quite good and the mixed greens were a perfect amount for a lunch portion with sandwich.  I really liked the North African spiced aioli.  It gave the sandwich a very good flavor.The cafe has a nice area for outdoor eating between the two buildings or in front where it's shaded.  It looked very pleasant but the morning was still cool m so I stayed indoors.I would have tried a pastry but there wasn't much of a selection left.  It looked like the pastry people had come through and bought everything in sight.I do like this place but it really is inconvenient to get to from where I live.  It's a good option if you're in the area.  If you're coming west on the 215, I'd exit at Buffalo and take the frontage road from there to the business park. Going to Durango would involve some backtracking.Friday morning and wanted more than the usual Starbucks run, I finally found this hidden gem tucked in the back of a large business complex when you enter off Sunset.Baguette is a quaint breakfast/lunch spot that caters not just to the surrounding office community but to savvy locals who want good food and a great ambiance.Olivier is welcoming and greets every guest like an old friend. The pastry chef moves about the kitchen bringing out scrumptious treats like tarts, muffins and the fresh baked croissants. These croissants will completely spoil you forever. It would have been a sin not to have one. The warm buttery aroma wafts through the air like a warm blanket for your olfactory senses. Close your eyes, sit at a table bathed in morning sunlight, drink a fresh mango orange juice, then take a bite of heaven.The Croissant & egg omelette was incredible. The omelette is prepared to outstanding culinary standards, the croissant is light, flaky with a thin layer of buttery soft dough that almost melts in your mouth as you take a bite, there is a light tomato basil sauce that elevates it above all other breakfast croissants and it is served with a small house salad so you can have a serving of greens.I am elated to have finally experienced Baguette Cafe and will make this a regular morning ritual at least once a week. "Bon Appetite!"You can't go wrong with a place like this that bakes their own goods, especially a warm buttery croissant like I experienced on my morning visit. I was originally just have a croissant and espresso, but it soon turned into a buttery croissant filled with scrumptious fluffy scramble eggs, Swiss cheese, Black Forest Ham, and with garlic infused mild tomato spread served with a side salad for around $7. The croissant was absolutely heavenly with its flaky exterior and buttery moist center. It came with a filling amount of ham, and the eggs were very well prepared with a soft  fluffiness and spot on seasoning. The Swiss cheese was nicely melted and the tomato spread was just right. Its flavor let you know it was there, but did not overwhelm the croissant breakfast sandwich. A great way to start the day indeed.The side salad was fresh, crisp, and light dressed with a tasty balsamic creamy dressing. The espresso was very smooth but with a rich robust after taste. Best of all, my meal with the coffee was all for under $10. Also service was outstanding and very friendly. When in Vegas, I will be stopping in again.This is a great little cafe/sandwich shop that I discovered through Yelp. The location is a bit out of the way for me and it is located inside an office building complex. We weren't sure if it would be open on that Saturday morning, but I had it bookmarked for a while and it was on the way home back. We were pleasantly surprised to see that it was open, and although adequately filled, there was no unnecessary wait times. If you know me, you know that one of the things I abhor is waiting a ridiculous amount of time for a breakfast joint. They had both inside and outside seating.Upon walking in, we were warmly greeted by Oliver whom I assume is the owner. He was friendly and welcoming, but most importantly appeared extremely passionate about what he was doing. He went over several items that just finished baking and even made a couple of suggestions. Ultimately we settled on the pesto chicken panini and the brie panini with a white mocha coffee. The ingredients were fresh and quality while the portions were fair for the price. I enjoyed the pesto panini especially. The menu is extensive, offering many options for the vegetarian and non vegetarian lifestyles. They had a great selection of breakfast fare including quiche and various croissants.I am excited to come back and try more of their menu.
Augie's Sports Grill=I am not sure where to start......  After meeting some friends for a bbq my wife suggested that we stop for a few drinks at Augie's.  We arrived about 8:15 and the place was pretty busy.  We found a seat at the bar and ordered a couple of beers and cheese sticks.  I guess they didnt hear our order because we received Pretzels and cheese instead.  Not a big deal but WTF....  They had music playing and a customer who looked somewhat like Jabba the Hut (seriously) wasnt satisfied with the volume turned it up many times and the staff kept turning it down.  This was happening while many families were there trying to enjoy there meals.This bar came complete with a overweight drunk girl that was making her way around the bar and kissing multiple guys and trying to jam her tongue as far down their throat as possible.  She apparently was friends with the young female bartender who continued to watch her and give her shots.  I guess I expect this at other places such as Roman's Oasis but what a treat to see this while enjoying a few beers and Pretzels.  Dont stop reading......  We are just getting to the good part.   I noticed a drunk young guy sitting at the end of the bar.  He had a baseball cap on and his face was very red.  His eyes were closed from time to time while he was waiting for his friends to return.  I could tell he was trashed...  I told my wife to take and look and sure enough when she did, he threw up a little bit on the bar and his hand.  He cleaned it up a bit but just sat there.   I told both the bartenders and they did NOTHING....   A few minuted later he had major projectile vomit at the bar.    I told the manager (who apparently couldnt see what we were watcing) and he went to talk to the customer.  The manager asked him to leave but I guess in not a very forceful way because the customer finished his beer and then left.   The end of our incredible visit was capped off by the following event.  The bartender came and told me that "the guy at the end of the bar wants to buy you a drink".  I asked "does he want to buy me a drink or my wife?".  She stated that he wanted to buy us both a drink.  I told her "no thank you".  My wife went to the restroom shortly after this and "the guy at the end of the bar" followed her.  He returned before she did and came over to talk to me.  He explained that he was a regular at the bar and continued talking to me about a bunch of nonsense and soon I just ignored him until he left.  I am confused why a self proclaimed college student would want to buy us drinks. This place needs help...   I am not sure the owner knows this is going on.  If the owner is the manager I spoke to, then he is in way over his head.   It will not survive.....  If it does, it wont be from me spending money there.
The Midori Japanese Fusion Sushi=Serene ambiance found at Midori. I joined a few friends here for lunch.  The dining area is large and clean with seating around a sushi counter.  The decor combined with their music is very calming. Service here is great.  They are very polite and so attentive.  Our drinks were refilled often with quick preparation of our meals.  Since it was lunchtime, they offer 9 great bento box specials.  They are all served with miso soup, salad and steamed rice.  The box specials also include your choice of sushi roll.  I had the shrimp tempura (bento D).  This comes with chicken gyoza and my sushi election of shrimp tempura roll.  Delicious! The tempura was light and airy but didn't take anything away from the shrimp.  With a fantastic lunch deal, wonderful food and service, I would recommend stopping in to see why I enjoyed it so much.
Gleiberman's Kosher Mart & Restaurant=I'd always thought knishes were starchy piles, tough on the outside, doughy and potato-y on the inside and only to be eaten when thoroughly hung over. Today, I had my perspective broadened, thanks to Gleiberman's. Buttery potato, zucchini puree surrounded by toasty, light puff-pastry. Wow.This awesome little kosher enclave sits pretty far out off of Providence road, in the Providence Square shopping center. A diner-esque restaurant adjoins the store's space. A deli counter full of classics is to the left as you enter - egg salad, kugel, kosher meats, chopped liver (and today, a huge tray of zucchini-potato knishes. Yum). Aisles full of kosher products, canned, jarred, bagged, boxed. Things I had never seen nor heard of before. Rad.Fridge and freezers full-ish of kosher entrees, cheeses, tofutti, etc. Familiar brands like Tabatchnik and Ba Tampte but many, many others. Kosher wine. Shelves were a little bare- since I had stalked the place via their awesome webpage, I had expected to see more "bounty". Maybe Sunday was to blame.People were smiley to me as I wondered, poking and prodding various wares. The diner's menu, although not extremely veg-friendly, looks interesting enough. For Israeli imports and kosher products (there's a whole freezer full of weird, vegetarian "cutlets") this is the place. Hallah.Note: closed Saturday, open 'till 5 Mon-Thurs, late on Sunday.
Genaro's Rotisserie & Grill=As soon as we finished eating here, we drove home, I ran into the house, opened up my laptop to write this review.  That's how sublime this meal at Genaro's was! I have a new obsession...the chicken, plantains and tres leches cake.  Read on, fair Yelper.  Read on. On the outside, the restaurant didn't look too impressive.  Inside, it was super clean and diner-like, complete with a row of stools and a counter to eat at, and a cake case.  (More on the cake case later.) Oh, and the modern white light fixtures make the space look classy!Here's what we had: Passion Fruit Juice: Made in-house and delicious!  Pure passion fruit, no strange pink color.  Just the juice and what I guess is water and sugar.  Chicha Morada: Our server was so awesome, and after we sang the praises of the passion fruit, he brought us little samples of this Peruvian drink.  We were told it's fresh made from corn and fruits and cinnamon.  Sounds strange...looks like wine, but tastes like...a fruity, spiced fall drink.  Really refreshing over ice.  My husband ended up ordering the full-sized one. Shrimp and Avocado Appetizer: Think of a dreamy creamy shrimp salad, scooped into two avocado halves.  Really refreshing and fresh tasting. Served with a hard boiled egg. Peruvian Corn: This corn made me laugh...it looked like a puffed up mutant of a regular ear of corn!  The kernels were ginormous...about the size of a small marble, or Trident White gum. The corn itself is strange in that it doesn't taste like corn...more like a starchy potato.  But it was nice to scoop cheesy sauce over it, and have it as a side.  Genaro's Salad: What's cool about this salad, is the mix of veggies in this salad.  It's got some spring mix and iceberg lettuce, but then beets and some carrots and avocado and cucumber...I think I saw a green bean too.  It comes with this green, I think cilantro dressing, and comes in a taco shell bowl.  What a flavorful mix. Sample Platter (For 2, but could be for 4!): This was HUGE and fantastic.  Forgive me if I forget something, but it included half a rotisserie chicken, 8 ounces of steak, 10 ounces of pork, two different sausages, and two sauces.  The chimmichuri (sp?) is THE BOMB!  I mean fresh, savory flavor explosion!  The chicken is by far the best roast chicken preparation I've ever had.  Juicy and flavorful. My favorite meat.  The pork was very tender too, as was the steak. Cilantro Rice: Great side to go with meat!Plantains: I agree with Victoria S.  The plantains aren't cookie cutter looking, and are fried just right and caramelized.  My husband and friend took down the first order, and got a second plate, they were that yummy. The kicker.  THE TRES LECHES CAKE.  Holy cow.  I dream of this cake and want this as my birthday cake.  Every day.  Yes,  everyday shall be my birthday because of this cake.  My friend Keith was taking a spoonful, and I grabbed my spoon and knocked the cake out from under him and ate it!  (Half jokingly!) The cake is moist, and topped with, yes, a marshmallow like topping, and smothered in another milky condensed milk-like liquid.  It's so purely milky, it's like eating a carton of whole, sweetened, fresh milk.  I'm dying.  I'm dying right now.  The only thing I recommend doing...is ask your server which desserts are made in-house.  Obviously this cake.  However, the chocolate cake, I'm 90% positive looks from Costco.  Our server was great and said the tres leches is the best, so we went with that one.  Every server we encountered here was kind and helpful and made us Peruvian-food virgins feel comfortable and excited about coming back.  Next time, I'm picking up a whole chicken to bring home for dinner!
Dandelion Market=So, first of all, a couple of disclaimers:1. My only experience with Dandelion Market was on a Saturday night. 2. I am not from Charlotte, so therefore not familiar with the best places to go or neighborhoods to seek out my kind of scene. 3. I do not do well in homogeneous environments. So yeah, I didn't like this place. On the night I was there, it was disgustingly packed. As in, can't turn around, have to elbow people, feel really bad for the short people, feeling claustrophobic kind of crowded. It was insanely uncomfortable, especially because the crowd looked so... Stepford. If J. Crew doesn't make up the majority of your closet, don't expect to find your kind of crowd here. Just so you know. Nothing they can do about that, I feel like it pervades most of Charlotte, but they *can* control the crowds. Even when we went downstairs we found ourselves standing in the entryway just for a little bit of breathing room. They've got a fine beer list but when I asked for a second Two Hearted Ale they made a big deal about changing out the kegs and then proceeded to totally forget about me. I had to flag down another bartender after waiting for 10 minutes, and he poured me one straight up. Not sure what it is about this place that draws in such a large percentage of the city's population, but I think it's safe to say that I don't get it.It takes a lot to make an entire group of people happy. You know what I'm talking about here. We all have that friend that can find a reason to complain about something. Yet, every time I go here... my crew is always happy top to bottom.I have taken part in many a birthday, engagement party and even baby shower at Dandelion Market. Anything from 4 people to more than 30. The most recent: a going away party for a friend. We had a group of about 15 people... many who are very demanding and do not understand the science of service industry. You know the type... they run you to death. Our server was phenomenal. That's the way it is every time.I could write a novel on service. I'm impressed with each visit. Let's move on to food. I have had a little bit of everything on the menu. No complaints about any of it. Some better than others. Here are my pics: Grilled Lamb Lollipops, Sausage Stuffed Poblano Pepper (I get this EVERY time), Southern Caprese, Sweet & Spicy Green Beans, Brussel Sprouts and the Butter Sauteed Sea Scallops. The brunch menu is also pretty good. Bonus: Dando does a Bloody Mary bar.Great beer selection. Good bartenders. A lot of different specials throughout the week. The place is packed on weekend nights.That's Pretty Neat #1: the big wooden table upstairs is attached to a chain-conveyor type contraption. They pull it up to the ceiling after the dinner crowd. Pretty cool to watch.That's Pretty Neat #2: you can order the entire market menu for $275. I haven't had a chance to do this yet, but I think it's such a great concept for a large group.Dandelion is brought to you by the same bar masterminds behind Connolly's, Tyber Creek and Prohibition. Consistency and quality employees are the reasons behind all their success. Keep up the good work guys. Cheers!Great lunch spot. The best grilled cheese in charlotte. Love the tapas menu and the tea options.Very low key style and priced to please. Good lunch for around ten bucks and great service.Note: I recently emailed them about an incident I read about online and they replied with a very satisfactory statement and explanation.
B&G Café=A generous 1.5 stars unfortunately.  The service was good.  The atmosphere was very basic but I don't mind that.The food was just ok and the place had an odd smell that really impacted everything.  If I may depart from plainspoken English for a moment;  olfaction is such an integral part of a gustatory experience that any meal can be significantly negatively impacted by the presence of unpleasant aromas in the environment.As I was eating my eggs, bacon, potatoes and toast and being negatively impacted by the smells around me it occured to me that they are next to an animal hospital and I ate at another restaurant once that was similarly situated and I encountered a similar problem.Hence, note to self:  in the future, take a pass on any restaurant in proximity to an animal hospital.
Famous Dave's BBQ=It's not like I needed any persuasion to come here but KOMP 92.3 was giving away FREE bbq, NHRA race tickets, a $3K bbq grill ,concert,movie and comedy tickets plus  lots more.Entering the shopping center here you can smell the bbq and damn was I hungry. After signing up for the drawing I had to get a full meal.Even though they had a feast at their tent you could grub from. I wanted my own!!Suprisingly there was no wait to be seated and we got the table right next to the fireplace.My son & I decided on the 3 meat combo w/St Louis Ribs,Beef Brisket & Chopped pork. 2 sides come with it so we got their incredible Wilbur Beans & Drunkin Apples. Plus 2 drinks $21!!The service here is great, fast & friendly very helpful and quite entertaining too.So, no suprise the food came out quickly---The chopped pork is the BEST! Smoky,crunchy and so tender & moist. The ribs are great but I like mine dry-rubbed no sauce. The brisket is great but has no crunch and they sauced it too.The sides here are incredible bbq eats. The Wilbur beans are so good with brisket & chopped link in it. The drunkin apples are quite a delight too. Amaretto sauce over tender sliced apples sprinkled with cinnamon.The meal was great-no doggie bag needed here. The service was fun & friendly and the whole atmosphere takes you back to the county fair & bbq cook-offs. The trophies are impressive but the fact the nail it every time out is more impressive. I have tried over 40 bbq place s in Vegas and I still say Dave's is the BEST  !!
Pizza Place=I was so sad to see Sugar & Ice had been replaced by Pizza Place at the end of the Esplanade. Before thoroughly scouting the menu, I remember letting out a shrieking "NOOOOOOOO!" in fear I would not be getting my tomato bisque fix. Hungover, starving, and grumpy from a lack of sleep, my heart sunk. Whyyyy?? WHYYYYYYY?!That is...until my friend shook me back into reality, pointed at the menu, and said "SOUP!! TOMATO SOUP!" Hell. Freakin. Yes. A light at the end of a tunnel.$5 for a hearty bowl of blissful cure after a night of drunken debauchery is just what the doctor ordered. Throw on a couple of $2 meatball parmigiana sliders and you've got yourself quite a lunch. This must have been the cheapest lunch I've ever had in Vegas, especially considering this was the Wynn and you're surrounded by nothing but upscale and classy restaurants. It was a bit chilly that day, but I couldn't resist grabbing a seat on the outdoor patio in front of the majestic waterfall. Thank goodness for heating lamps. The food slowly came out (and by slowly, I mean slooooowlyyyy), but alas, everyone received their orders and we began stuffing our faces silly.The sliders were a hit! For $2 a piece, that's practically free in Vegas. Each bite melted into a mushy, meaty, cheesy surprise. I especially loved the bagel-like bread they used. The tomato soup was a generous portion, topped with bits of croutons. I even sprinkled a handful of parmesan cheese for that extra kick. I could die a happy woman after this meal.The pizza was a bit interesting. The Carne (which consisted of pepperoni, sausage, and ham) had one slither of sausage. That's right...a slither. Strange, no? Same with the Meatball pizza. Unless this is a new style of the thin-crusted Italian delicacy, I'd recommend skipping it. They still serve gelato like Sugar & Ice did, but the weather wasn't working in my favor to taste this sweet treat. If you want a comforting and tasteful bite for lunch without having to break your bank, definitely check this place out...and get the sliders! They're amazing. Don't forget to check out the gorgeous view on the patio.Nestled past Dior, Alexander McQueen, and all those Manolos is Pizza Place. Upon first look this place is spacious, clean, and looks like a place you can sit down and really have a great lunch which luckily is exactly what happened. Unfortunately it was a bit too cold out or I would have definitely sat on the patio overlooking the waterfall which obviously contains the best seats in the house on a warm summer day. When you walk in the counter is on the left side, sporting a refrigeration unit full of gelato (if I wasn't so full I would have gotten some!). They currently have a lunch deal where you can get a 12-inch pizza, a salad, and a side for $24.50. Kind of steep, but here's the best part: they have vegan cheese! And it's not Daiya, it's Teese. Now Daiya right now is the #1 vegan cheese since it's soy-free, easy to find, and tastes delicious but damn it if Teese isn't gunning for the top spot. If I could find it in grocery stores like I can with Daiya, it would be a very difficult decision to make. Anywho, we got a veggie vegan pizza (olives, red peppers, baby bella mushrooms, and onion), a house salad, and garlic knots sans cheese & butter. The garlic knots were good, but could stand to be a LOT more garlicky, and 4 of them instead of 3 would have been nice. The marinara that came with it was decent. The salad was alright but a bit small; I didn't like the vinaigrette all that much. But the pizza... oh the pizza. All the toppings tasted SO fresh, especially the mushrooms and the Teese is probably the best cheese substitute I have ever put in my mouth. All Matt could ask is where we could buy some! I wish I could have eaten more of the pizza but 2.5 slices was all I could do. $24.50 isn't so bad for two people to enjoy a meal in a nice environment. We both left pretty satiated. I will definitely be back to have more of that pizza, and maybe give Matt more pizza so I can try some vegan gelato ;)
Cheba Hut=I've only beeen here once, but the service was bad enough to write about, whether it was a fluke or per usual.Which sucks, because the food was pretty good and the atmoshpere 'like way phun, dude'.   It was neat to see Tommy Chong and his wife in photo on the wall, sitting at a crappy table, enjoying the grub.I also got to reminisce about all the clandestine times I had in this very building when it was a crappy, hole in the wall head shop instead of a crappy hole in the wall sandwich shop, and I was the longhaired leaping gnome tie dyed store manager with my '59 VW panel van parked out front.But all my daydreaming came to an end when I saw Dopey and Grumpy, the two painted and peirced up grrrls they had running the show, put the big Bogart on customer service skills.  (There was no GIVE in their puffpuffgive equation.)The lady that had the misfortune to arrive at the ordering counter a few minutes after I received my Aculpolco Gold BBQ chicken sandwhich was there a full 4 1/2 minutes before placing her order.  The whole time, Dopey was in the back area, doing dishes by the sound of it, while Grumpy stood out behind the counter near the grilling area on a personal cell phone call.  She was yelling, crying, dropping F-bombs, and just bleeding drama, while speaking, come to find out, to her mother.  Never a word or even glance at poor, mousey customer, who also said nothing.  Eventually Dopey came back up front and the order ensued, but while it was being made, everyone in the building got the irie joy of hearing Grumpy repeat back to Dopey everything we'd just heard from the phone call.The owners should put as much effort into having just the right Customer Service as they do into having just the right Look for their staff.   Instead of a Suicide Grrl with crusty hair serving it with bad attitude or indifference, I'd rather have a nerdy, ponytailed, hornrimmed glasses and cardigan wearing book-worm serve me my silly drug-named sandwich with a subtle smile and wink.  As a matter of fact, that sounds kind of sexy...
Sam's Gyros=Heads up, Guy Fieri, while this place shares its very small parking lot with a Shell station, it is no "gas station food"! I just had lunch with Sam. Literally. When I asked where he got his delicious dolmas (grape leaves stuffed with rice and herbs) and he said his wife makes them, the skepticism was on my face. They were perfectly formed and the flavor was intense. He backed it up by showing me his personal lunch from home and sharing it with me to the detriment of the fries in my combo which I was unable to finish after gorging on meat-filled dolmas, stuffed cabbage and squash (none of which are on the menu). And, for the record, his wife's cabbage rolls are AMAZING and should be added, at least , as a special! So, while dining with Sam he explained that he hails from Chicago where he owned and operated a similar establishment and has come to the Valley to join his sisters, one of which owns King Gyros (http://www.yelp.com/biz/king-gyros-phoenix#hrid:66ywkbFKsg_1IA03dK_JSg/src:search/query:king%20gyro) which boasts its own 4 star Yelp rating after 16 reviews. Besides the dolmas ($3.95 for 6) and some of Sam's lunch from home, I enjoyed a falafel pita combo ($5.99). A lot of times falafel, similar to meatballs but made from ground chickpeas, is dry and demands the accompanying tahini sauce and then tastes of nothing but sesame paste (blech!), but this falafel is moist and flavorful. Sam serves it with tzatziki sauce instead of tahini and since I can't stand tahini anyway, this is a bonus for me! I also tasted my friend's gyros which was ginormous! He ate half, if that, and was bringing the rest home -- the pita was overflowing with moist, well seasoned meat. I'm not a hot dog girl, as I've mentioned before, but Sam is very proud of his all beef Chicago dog ($1.99) which he cooks on the grill; still, an Italian sausage ($3.25) is more my speed. Without a doubt, I'll be back to Sam's!P.S. The fries were hot and delicious and had a yummy seasoning sprinkled on them. :)So this place is really good. Gyro, stuffed with meat, tender yummy meat, plenty of sauce, soft warm pita. Onion and tomato Frys, hot, fresh, seasoned and plenty of them. Service, as expected... Excellent. I love when people ask how it is. Location, next to NOT IN a gas station on the south east side of the road.
Rounders="Adios"I came here for the last time today. A shame really, since it's only a mile from my house. I've had ongoing bad service from one particular bartender who always seems to be there when I come in. Just when I think I have her shift schedule down pat so as to avoid her it changes.Today she messed up my margarita order and still insisted on charging me even though it was totally wrong. I didn't even drink a fourth of it. A time prior she called me a "degenerate gambler" after seeing me put money into a video poker machine for the first time ever in this place. I criticized her for something(can't remember what) and she told me I was overly sensitive. Then she mentioned to me later that her mother was sick and I gave her a blank stare and said: "Do you see me being sensitive now?"Sheesh.I used to come here two or three times a week since it's close and often ate here as well. On average, I would say I dropped over 300 bucks a month here. Apparently, that wasn't enough for politeness from her.Anyway, I'm not going to keep relearning her schedule. It's easier to just not go back.So a little while ago I left the last money I'll ever spend there in the hands of the barmaid who forced me to find another hangout. No matter, I thought. There are plenty of other places around.And out the door I went.
Tortilla Flat Superstition Saloon=Tortilla Flat is the kind of place you take out-of-towners when they're grating on your nerves and you threaten to leave them there unless they pull their act together. It's also a fun place to take out-of-towners and claim they have the best Mexican food in the state, only to see their disappointment when you get the Grande Nachos. Speaking of that restaurant, that's the best place to take MJB, hand her a red pen and their menu/newspaper and say "Go for it, baby. I found 14 grammatical errors above the fold." Okay. So that last one makes me appear to be an elitist, egotistical, insensitive prick. On a serious note, Tortilla Flat is a great place to take someone (or yourself) after Canyon Lake. It's only a few minutes away and is such a quaint locale. The dollars on the restaurant walls are enough for the trip. Walking along the river and seeing the power of water over stone is another reason. And feeling the sand that's been washed down is spectacular. (I have a sand collection of my travels and those of my friends, so sand in alcohol bottles means something deep to me...I just didn't have an empty bottle this time.) The food isn't great, but the staff are all characters and isn't that what a town of six permanent residents is all about??I don't know about anyone else, but to me, this place seems sort of doomed. Based on the history lesson we learned in the tiny museum shack, Tortilla Flat has burned down or been destroyed somehow about 3 or 4 times. Consider the fact that it was supposedly started by a no-good, ragamuffin, low-down dirty thief/murderer who lost his booty somewhere out in the desert, maybe it wasn't meant to last this long. But this is America! We can keep anything alive and running if it earns enough money! Hallelujah, praise the sweet Baby Jesus!According to some mathematical equation, they've estimated that the saloon/restaurant has over $80,000 in single dollar bills stapled to the walls, kindly donated by tourists and lookie-loo's from Round the World. The town itself was most recently purchased by some company for over 1.3 million dollars. It was originally purchased for $11,000. As of today in the Year of Our Lord 2013, the great attraction of Tortilla Flat is the burger in the restaurant, the live music in the saloon (only part of the year) and the Prickly Pear Gelato in the ice cream parlor (which you can't taste before you buy). It also doesn't hurt that the drive there is quite beautiful. We did it on a motorcycle and had a grand old time swooping around the curves and passing elderly out-of-towners in their comfortable SUVs. Might as well do it once if you live here, but I'm not sure I would recommend it to visiting Snow Birds.
Chart House=I really liked the ambiance of the Chart House.  From our comfortable, contemporary booth unusual looking fish swirled about before our eyes in a large and tall tube-type aquarium while we dined.  The place was sleek and modern, beginning with two 6-foot hostesses in black miniskirts, appearing much like human bookends, who confirmed our reservation and gave us a friendly greeting when we arrived.  The aqua floor upon entry looked like water, which added to the sea mystique.Our first dish was dramatic, with a nice presentation of true meaty jumbo shrimp that were shooting off steam from dry ice.  A complimentary bread basket was small, but it was ample for 2 diners, and contained good brown and white bread, as well as tasty rolls.  New England Clam Chowder was good but unusually crunchy from celery, while Diane dealt with a Lobster Bisque that was rather heavy on the brandy.  Sauteed Mushrooms were juicy, and this side was very large and lasted all the way to dessert, but the sauce on the sizzling skillet was not that tasty.  However, a lovely chopped Spinach Salad with egg, mushrooms, and red onion was.  What I particularly liked about this dish is that the various parts were presented in side by side fields of color: a column of yellow egg placed next to a column of green lettuce, and so forth.  Then it was left up to the diner to toss all ingredients and the fine dressing together as desired, which I found to be fun rather than an annoyance.I then enjoyed a good pan-fried pink Salmon enhanced by a blanket of crisp prosciutto, while Diane ultimately enjoyed  very tasty Stuffed Flounder.  I know, because I tried it too!  But, the Flounder that was originally brought to the table had to be sent back, because the first batch was too spicy for my spouse's delicate palate.  I appreciated that the request for a less spicy breaded Flounder was cheerfully accommodated, and although it took awhile for a new entree to be cooked, the manager personally brought out the replacement, and it was made just as requested.  We also shared a side of great Yukon Gold Mashed Potatoes, and I had fine Green Beans presented on my plate.Our dessert of a Chocolate Souffle that had properly risen was good but not what we expected to receive.  It was real airy--more like a tasty meringue than a sumptuous souffle.Service was impeccable!  It was attentive, and there was not one service error by our very competent female server.  In fact, the worst thing that occurred happened days after the meal when all photos of the food but one were lost in a failed effort to store them in a backup drive.  Hence, the single photo that appears with this review.  But at least that photo was taken just after a slew of dishes had been placed on the table.  This was the first and only time my photos for a Yelp review were totally lost before they were loaded on the restaurant's site.  May it be the last!Chart House was never on my radar.  I used Yelp to find a place to have dinner before the book club meeting and up popped Chart House.  It turns out that I've walked by it a number of times and never knew it was a restaurant.  I only thought it was a bar/lounge.  But, behind that large fish tank is another side and that's where the restaurant is.I was seated promptly right along the glass of the fish tank.  It's a great place to sit because you are almost constantly watching the fish swim when you're not eating--eating seafood even.  I wonder if anyone would like an enclosed, sealed calf range in a steak house.  My server was Haley and she was good.  She took my order after answering a few questions.  I was brought my iced tea (blackberry, bottled Republic of Tea) and a runner brought some bread and butter.  The bread was OK.  The rye roll was good.  It was brought warm.  The flat bread, soda wafers were quite dry and not as good.For a started, I ordered the ménage soup.  It's a trio of small cups of their three soups--lobster bisque, gazpacho, and clam chowder.  The gazpacho was hands down the best.  The clam chowder was good.  The lobster bisque was average.For the main course, I got their spicy yellowfin ahi served with a ginger soy sauce and wasabi cream and accompanied by wasabi mashed potatoes.  The ahi was cooked very rare--just seared and off the grill.  It was excellent and the wasabi sauce was very good.  The wasabi mashed potatoes were also very good.For dessert, I had ordered the hot chocolate lava cake.  The menu states to leave 30 minutes prep time for specialty desserts and when I was ordering dinner in the beginning, Haley asked me about this.  I ordered the cake then so there'd be plenty of time to make it at the correct time during my meal.The cake was excellent.  Chocolate goodness topped with Heath bar crunch and vanilla ice cream.The meal and service were very good and the fish tank is lots of fun.  It was a hoot watching the people watch the fish.  The tank is 75,000 gallons and has dozens of fish.  Haley told me that a diver is in the tank daily for cleaning and feeding.  The only drawback was that I was at the first table in from the lounge and some of the happy hour people were quite loud when they got some alcohol in them.Using the term "fine dining" here is a bit of stretch. The service here was lackluster to say the least, but the food was good enough to keep me in high spirits. I brought my family here for a little Valentine's Day late afternoon lunch. When we showed up, the place was empty. Literally, we were the only people sitting in the restaurant which was a little awkward. We were sat promptly and we immediately were in awe of the enormous fish tank. This floor to ceiling is an aquarium lovers wet dream is amazing, ha! It's placed right in the middle of the restaurant and gives diners a great place to rest their eyes and thoughts during lulls in dinner conversation.We ordered apps and drinks and so far so good. A bottle of wine for the table and I opted for Moscow Mule. It was ok, a little heavy on the ginger beer and light on the vodka. I prefer it the other way around. The apps were amazing; the Kim Chee Calamari was like crack, I would smoke it if allowed. The Kim Chee added that vinegar flavor that went great with lightly fried calamari. There fried veggies and a amazing sauce that accompanied this dish. I highly recommend ordering this dish, but be ready to share because this plate of food is huge! We also ordered the Coconut Crunchy Shrimp and these were great. A little outshined after the Kim Chee dish, but still very good. The shrimp was still juicy and not over cooked and the coconut breading was light and just a tad sweet. Yummers. At this point in the meal we were all talking, plates were licked clean, and starting to stack up. Just as the restaurant was just starting to get busy our soup and salads were arriving, so you'd think the server would remove the plates that were stacked up, but nope, they stayed on the table. After salads and soups were finished (BTW - Lobster Bisque was quite delicious) this new set of plates and bowls were now added to already decent pile of tableware. There were five of us, so lets do that math... 5 plates for apps + 2 bowls of soup + 2 large salad plates + 2 bread baskets + 5 bread plates +1 bottle of wine + 3 wine glasses + 2 cocktail glasses, and a partridge in a pear tree. That's about 23 items on a table, half of which were dirty and no longer being used. Now, in a normal fine dining restaurant, these items would be cleared immediately and the table would be re-dressed with silverware and napkins. This did not happen. The main course showed up and the food runners realized there was absolutely no space for anything on the table. They placed our food off to the side and cleared the table, this took about three minutes. This just shows the amount of stuff that had piled up. Finally, the table is cleared and the food is delivered. I'll mainly focus on my meal, but I did try a little bit of everyone's and it all was very good. I ordered the Stuffed Flounder: Crab-stuffed with lemon shallot butter and Yukon Gold mashed potatoes. This was delicious, the flounder was perfectly cooked. The tender fish was juicy and just flaked apart when cut into with my fork. The crab was a like an amazing edible surprise, that I had forgot about it until it poured out on to the plate. This plate was not only gorgeous, but a giant seafood flavor bomb. The carb lovers side dish was the beautiful golden mashed potatoes. Buttery, creamy goodness! To close out the meal we tried their dessert specials... Hot Chocolate Lava Cake and Chart House Souffle. These were both meh, but I'm not a sweet person. So don't take my word for it. Wow. I feel like I just had a brain baby with this review. Even though the service was weak, The Chart House's food is stellar and definitely worth the price.  FOODIE NOTE: The food prices here almost triple once the lunch menu is done being served. So, if you're a baller on budget you might want to lunch it up.Some people come to enjoy their huge aquarium. We came to escape the Downtown madness...oh, and the food!I frequented the Chart House on Oahu many times. I had fond memories of their happy hour, great view, and amazing food. I did learn that many of them are now Landry's, including the one here in Vegas. However, upon viewing the menu, I was happy to see it was similar to the Chart House menu I remember. I was very happy to have included a meal here during my Downtown staycation for Valentine's weekend this year. Here's what our table had to eat, devoured is more like it!Kim Chee CalamariSpanish Blues MusselsFilet MignonLobster TailTour de ShrimpChocolate Lava Cake. Ordered. Got full. Vowed to attempt next visit!The food was great. Kim Chee Calamari was recommended to us, it's very different than your typical calamari appetizer, but delicious! I would probably pass on the mussels, it was prepared well but nothing spectacular. My boyfriend enjoyed his perfectly cooked filet, but noted that the 4oz lobster tail add-on wasn't worth the price. My favorite shrimp preparation for my Tour de Shrimp entree was with the cedar plank chimichurri. As you can imagine, this was a classic case of "Your eyes are bigger than your stomachs." We had pre-ordered the Chocolate Lava Cake (takes about 30mins), however, we didn't come close to having room for it. Leaving with our doggy-bags, we promised to return for dessert another night!I'd have to say that Chart House is more casual than I anticipated. I wouldn't choose it for a romantic night, I'm not sure if it's kid-friendly, but definitely a great choice for dinner with friends and family. Last but not least, we had the pleasure of having one of the best servers ever, Valerie. She was amazing! She made great menu recommendations, timely and efficient, great personality, and at the same time, let us have our evening without hovering the table. We didn't think our entrees took a long time to arrive, but she said it had been delayed in the kitchen. The manager came by to apologize for the wait, and Valerie still checked up on us. As we apologized for cancelling our dessert, she was quick to say it was no problem and effortlessly sold it to her other table. We will definitely request Valerie for our next dinner there!Chart House, you fed us well. We will be back!
Nathan's Famous=What has happened to this Nathan's is really sad. A couple years ago it was a separate restaurant that had a New York delicatessen theme that celebrated the Nathan's legacy. Forget the World famous Nathan's hot dogs, because in my opinion their super cheeseburger with the crinkley cut fries was fast food taste up in the fast food stratosphere. The prices were ridiculously high. I accepted that I was on the Strip enjoying a treat that brought me back to being a kid enjoying Nathan's. Then the Nathan's curse took over this location. Bad management is a curse that has destroyed many Nathan's locations leaving them shuttered across the landscape. After they replaced the Nathan's restaurant in Bally's basement with a food court location it has taken a massive nosedive from 3.5 to 1 star.   In the past week, I dined in this Nathan's twice. Before my dad arrived from New York at Bally's for a family staycation, my brother and I dined here. I was disappointed to see the super cheeseburger go just like it did in Arby's years ago. So, I ordered a bacon Philly cheesesteak with the crinkley cut fries. It came out to $17 and change. Nathan's isn't true fast food. There is usually a delay between ordering and pickup. To make up for it, they give you a beeper that goes off when the order is ready.   The bacon Philly cheesesteak is the antithesis of the crinkley cut fries. Where the fries should be inducted into the Fast Food Hall of Fame, the bacon Philly cheese steak should be redesigned. The taste was dull and it appeared that the meat wasn't soft. The bacon was blah.   My dad loves Nathan's food and just like me believes they have a great product with many of the restaurants poorly managed. We would have no idea how bad. He ordered two hot dog with fries dinners and a Philly cheesesteak with fries dinner. And a diet coke and regular Coke. To make a long story short the guy that served us forgot the Coke and the third portion of fries. There are like six combination dinners and the guy fails to realize that the Philly cheesesteak with fries comes with fries. Duh! So, my dad walks up to the counter to explain the error. Instead of being polite and recognizing the order, he tells my dad to go to the back of the line. Obviously we don't want to spend a vacation night waiting on a line for fries and a Coke. I'd walk to the adjacent Subway concession to pick up a fountain drink. Another flaw of this Nathan's is there is an obvious lack of supervision. There were no managers and they obviously threw a Nathan's employee that wears a Pan Asian cap to the wolves. The employees wear a badge with the manager's number (supposedly) that you are to text to see how they are doing. My dad texted him and no response.    I don't like giving one star reviews. However there is a difference between a nice guy and a fool. Hopefully the same supervisor that doesn't read customer's text messages reads Yelp. This kind of service is killing Nathan's. Recently Nathan's has closed restaurants in the Venetian, Arizona Mills, and a couple on Long Island. If this service persists, I see this location going down the same path. As far me I am going down a different path that leads away from this Nathan's. One Star: Boo!
Hooters=Unfortunately we can't review anything but the horrible customer service. Having guys night out with my nine-year-old and they told us to sit anywhere then proceeded to ignore us for 10 minutes and we walked outWould not even acknowledge us and checked on the tables all around us Upsetting experience. We were ready to grub. Went to grimaldis instead
Hot Bagels and Deli=The name says it all. This is one hot bagel shop! This could be one of the best bagel shops I've found in Phoenix and I would have never expected to find it way up in North Scottsdale. This bagel shop is delicious. The bagels are large, hot, soft and extremely delicious. This local eatery has a line out the door on weekends and it's for a reason. The breakfast bagel sandwiches are to-die-for. The cheese, egg and bacon combo sandwiched between a hefty bagel makes it worth waking up early on a Sunday morning! I will be visiting again soon for the deli because I hear that it's a must to stop by and experience their lunch.
Viet Kitchen=- We were there for St. Patty's Day, March 17th     I was introduced to this nicely hidden spot by my best amiga Ly, she suggested their food for our St. Patty's celebration. We had for starters the rolls with the Romaine lettuce and they were pretty tasty after we added some of their hot sauce, and ultra hot as in temperature, both myself and Chris burnt ourselves, but that was our own fault, yes it was funny :) .     The Chicken Pho (Fauh) was great, hot, minty rich flavor and the noodles were well cooked too!!! Such BIG portions though, neither Ly nor myself finished our bowls. But they were OH SOO Delicious.      Thanks for the amazing meal and great time!!
Harbor Inn=This place has really improved over the last few years, and it's a staple with the folks at the neighboring offices.  I believe they brought in new management a few years ago and it's made a WORLD of difference in both service and quality of food.Unfortunately I'm a fan of fried (yah, I know) popcorn shrimp and Alaskan whitefish, and they prepare both beautifully here, in traditional "fish camp" style.  They really shine at lunch time, where daily specials are around FIVE BUCKS and you get dinner-size portions!  They do have broiled options, but those aren't available as lunch specials (however they're still priced reasonably).  One thing I like about them is that they're flexible.  This means that you don't HAVE to get fries with your meal; you can opt for a baked potato if you prefer and they don't say anything or get confused as some places do.  Or you can get double fries/no hush puppies...whatever works for YOU, not them.I think one of their star options is the "family pack" they offer.  This has got to be one of THE best deals in town, especially when trying to feed a family at dinner.  You get a TON of food for $27 & change (including tax!).   For under thirty dollars you get your choice of TWO seafood options (ie two lbs of baby shrimp and eight pieces of flounder), a very large box of hush puppies, and a very large box of fries or four baked potatoes.  You also get a TUB each of cocktail sauce, tarter sauce and cole slaw.  Plenty of food for a family of 2-4.  OH - you also get a half gallon of tea.Service here is always speedy and friendly as well, and that has a lot to do w/the change in management I believe.  I worked in the neighboring office for many years & for a while a few years ago we actually boycotted them for quite some time BECAUSE of their service.  But now they're wonderful!  Orders are always correct and on time (especially important when time is of the essence), and the employees are always super friendly and accommodating, and seem genuinely interested in making sure your experience is the best it can be.Harbor Inn - a great option for traditional seafood in the University City area.
Calistro California Bistro=I like it here!After hearing how great this place was, I had to see for myself.  Happy Hour?  I'm in!  Upon arrival, the first thing I noticed was the open and inviting decor - bamboo floors, high ceilings, a beautiful outdoor patio... what's not to like?  Oh, and ladies, the bar had purse hooks!While Calistro serves "healthy cuisine", please do not translate that to mean "cardboard-esque and tasteless".  Each item we tried was delicious, full of richness and flavor.  I learned that 80% of the ingredients used are organic, and most are from local vendors.  They even have organic vodka.  Did you know that organic vodka existed?  I didn't.  It was a very happy HH, indeed.Flatbread - a wood-fired combination of tomatoes, pesto, basil and fresh mozzarella.  It was much larger than I expected, and the flatbread crust was perfect - even the cheese-less edges which I usually don't eat...Wood Roasted Ravioli - from the Shared Plates section of the dinner menu.  I had never tried a "baked" ravioli and these, prepared in the wood-fired oven, were outstanding!  The filling was a sweet and savory combination that I really enjoyed.Short Rib Panini Sliders - were it not for the bread (which was toasted just right), you would not need to chew.  The braised short ribs are that tender.  Beautiful!Angeline Pinot Noir - a pleasant taste of California wine country (blend of Sonoma, Mendocino & Santa Barbara grapes).  I like Calistro's presentation - the wine is first poured into a small individual carafe and then a portion is poured into your glass - you pour the rest when you are ready.  Maybe it is for aeration, but visually this makes me think I am getting more than one glass - yum!I did make my typical mistake of not leaving any room for dessert (when, oh when will I learn?).  The Chocolate Soufflé Cake the couple next to me had looked amazing.  Darn!We were in North Scottsdale taking photographs of the desert, and ended up close to the Calistro Bistro.  So after all the glowing reviews, we decided to stop in for Happy Hour on a Sunday and give it a try.  Wow, were we impressed.  We were the only ones in the place (except for a bridal shower in the back room), and were asked where we would like to sit.  Being chilled from being outside in the rain, we opted to sit at the seating area where you could view the chef's working, and directly in front of the cooking fire.  We were offered drinks, and since my designated driver doesn't drink, was given a choice of a number of teas.  The one she selected was fabulous (according to her).  I saw that they had Anchor Steam Porter on tap, and I was in heaven,  They have a wide choice of  appetizers on their happy hour menu, and we tried several of them - the pork taco, the fish taco, the flatbread, and the short-rib Panini sliders.  All were delicious.  They were all so appetizing, we couldn't pick a favorite between the fish (salmon) taco, the pork taco, and the flatbread.  The meat in the sliders was fantastic, but the toasted panini  was slightly over browned.I might add that the waitress originally brought us an order of hummus that someone else ordered, and it looked so good, that I thought my wife was going to arm wrestle her  for  it.  She said that the next time we were there, that was going to be one of her choices.I do not give many places 5 stars, but I will on Calistro.  There were so many pluses - allowing us to sit where we wanted (I was impressed that the even allowed us in the way we were dressed), Anchor Steam Porter on tap, delicious food, interesting flavors, lovely décor, and wonderful servers.  All in all, a delightful experience on a cold, windy, rainy day.I had grand expectations for Calistro Bistro! I love farm-to-table. I love the fresh, local food movement. Sadly, it just didn't measure up. A nod to our server, as service was excellent and the "that spicy mango thingy" drink (a Serrano pepper & mango infused tequila margarita) is unique and will please those of you who like cocktails with a bite. But, that's about as good as it got. "Farm-to-table" inspires visions of entrees with crisp, fresh, complex and discernible flavors. Our food reminded me of standard hotel fare. We started with the crab cake and while the crab was very good there was way too much filler. To the extent that I would get whole bites of filler, disappointing my palate with a mealy bready effect. Next, one of each of the street tacos. Both were terribly -- like disgustingly -- greasy. Beware: hold these puppies right over your plate because as you angle them for a bite, a river of taco-seasoning -infused oil will stream out the back. And, the chili-powder flavor didn't do it for me. Finally, the Arctic Char entree: the vegetables and the fish were each overcooked. Though, there was some potential as the cut of fish seemed quality and the veggie selection showed good choices. Besides being overcooked, there was no flavor. None. Nada. :( So, all of this disappointment and $95 later (not including tip), I think it's safe to say I won't be making the trek to Calistro Bistro again.
Il Vinaio=I am so sorry that I have to write such a negative review of this new restaurant, because it's family owned and operated, and clearly trying hard to provide an upscale experience in a less-than-optimal atmosphere.  However, Il Vinaio missed the mark at every given opportunity.I came in for a group event that had been scheduled as a wine tasting with wine samples and a cheese/fruit/nut appetizer included for $15 a head.  When our party arrived, we were informed by our host that a different large party had also booked a wine tasting, and would be sitting in the semi-private area, and would be doing a wine tasting so we could not.  I have yet to receive an explanation on why we could not do our wine tasting simply because another party was doing one simultaneously.  Needless to say, this immediately dampened the mood.Our server, who I gather was the restaurant owner, was pushy with having us order two bottles straightaway, though our entire party had not arrived, instead of by the glass, and this theme continued through the evening.  He continually seemed irritated that we were not ordering as much as he would have liked us to, or that it took us time to decide which dishes to order, etc.  We all agreed that he was a bit snippy, and he didn't provide us much in the way of recommendations.The wine itself was fine, particularly the Schloss Riesling, and the food was decent, as well, with very generous portions.  The cheese plate was good, but it was not impressive that the female owner was not able to tell us what cheeses had been served to us when she came over to ask us how our experience had been.  The cheese plate was the one thing we all raved about and wanted more information on, and all she had to say was, "we serve lots of cheeses and mix it up. I think there was a blue cheese that was made in a cave."  That was disappointing, and I expected much more from an owner.As stated in other reviews, from the outside, it looks like an old Marie Callender's or Furr's Cafeteria or something of that ilk.  Even inside, you can tell that it was once a place that had a buffet, and was clearly built in the early 70's.  However, you can see that effort has gone into revamping it, and it's decent.  Not great, but decent.  At least it has its own parking lot.  It was so disappointing to have our plans changed for us and then to have less-than-stellar service as a result.  We all spent more per person than intended, and did not receive what we had reserved our table for.  The service by both owners did not seem very personalized or knowledgable, and that is the opposite of what I'm looking for when I visit a more upscale wine bistro.  I don't think I'll be back, and it's really too bad.
Casa Grande Restaurant=Hi, first time reviewer, long-time reader.  Yea.  You might be asking yourself what made me get up off my butt and begin to actively participate in this shenanigan we call web 2.0.  Well I'll tell you what.  It's tacos.  More specifically dollar tacos.  EVEN more specifically, the best tacos I've had since a street corner in Veracruz, Mexico.El Casa Grande is an extremely authentic quaint little restaurant on South Blvd.  I can't vouch for their whole menu, but what I can vouch for is there tacos.  Every Tues & Wed they have dollar taco night.  These are the best nights of the week.  The tacos are simple soft-shell tacos with the flour tortilla quickly fried in some butter on the grill so their edges get slightly crisp.  They are then filled with the most delicious, succulent meat possible; all of your choosing of course.  Options include al Pastor (pork), Carnitas (fried pork), Beef (steak), Barbeque Beef (BBQ steak), Chicken (chicken), and Ground beef (you guessed it).  They then get topped with cilantro and diced onion.  They are served with a warm jalapeno pepper, a grilled onion (scallion bulb) -- which are worth ordering as a full side, and a lime.  Furthermore, every table gets FREE chips / HOMEMADE salsa.In a nutshell, this place is as authentic as it gets and cheap as a handshake.  Tonight, I had 4 tacos and a Negra Modelo for $7.97 and left stuffed.This place is worth the visit to a part of town you probably avoid.  Go.  Go now.(also -- if you're worried about it being too authentic -- the kitchen received a 98.0 sanitation rating which is higher than the cafeteria for the hospital where I work.  :-P)
Bambini's Pizzeria Rotisserie=We get ready to walk in.  But a red faced, fiesty grandma stammers out and yells back to her husband" Why the hell were you such an a$$ in there?" Grandpa yells back " Because they were a$Se$ to me ! ".  So whoever "they" were, I'd like to say screaming old couples scare me. A senior fight that could result in both maybe having angina and needing CPR is no fun. They yell and cuss another 5 in the car, and thankfully drive off. Just another Friday night at Bambini's?  The host says "no" thankfully!Inside, it's friendly (Whew), bright, loud, and lively with lots of people, including kids, loud TV's, loud employees, and off key Happy Birthdays. An employee drops and breaks a wine glass and his co workers laugh before getting the mop and broom.  The two narrow dining areas are separated by a wine display rack. The lamps are bright and colorful. The strong smell of pizza and garlic match the noise levels.Our waitress brings our menus and some water. While looking at the menu, I read the yelp reviews, and it was obvious we'd have to order garlic knots appetizers.  Garlic has some awesome health benefits, and is so good on soft french rolls. It was awesome and somewhat greasy but really addicting. I had the baked ziti topped with cheese.  It was enough to feed 2 normal sized adults, but barely enough for my Samoan 6'2" 16 year old nephew who plays high school football. My brother ordered the baked lasagne, good but not anywhere as large as my ziti. TBoth dishes had a strong tomato, garlic, oregano taste with the right amount of sweet, salt, and tang. Both dishes were loaded with cheese, and came out piping hot. It took 20 minutes for out waitress to bring our order, as there was no pre-made stuff here. Both were about $13. and I took 2/3 of my order home. Abondanza for sure. This was authentic Italian, and reminded me of some of the casual places I'd eaten in NYC.  We come to find out that the owner is from the Big Apple, and came to North Vegas with his old world recipes from Italy.      To finish off the dinner, the gelato guy in the front said he was generous with his scoops.  The gelato is made by a local shop.  They had two of my favorite flavors - pistachio and mango.  Very creamy, dense, sweet, and rich in natural flavors.  Wow, I could only eat half of a large order.  All in all, an awesome dinner with no septagenarians in a mortal combat, yes!This is the best Italian eatery since Metro Pizza! The garlic knots are by far the best I have had since I was a little kid.I eat here on a regular basis and it really says something about the place when you see the same employees each time who seem to genuinely love working there. They always give me an honest opinion when I ask about a menu item which I truly appreciate. I always have a hard time deciding what to order it is ALL good! I live in Summerlin and make the drive over here just for Bambini's!The baked stuffed shells are simply to die for. The ricotta is spot on! I had it on a recent visit a couple days ago and really liked it.The subs are full of flavor and they do not skimp on what they put on themIf you are going for a sub I would recommend the "Our Famous Sub" it is just great! I like it both hot or cold it just depends on my mood. I do like mayo on it so I ask if I am getting it to-go for the mayo, oil & vinegar on the side so I can put it on myself. It it just easier that way so you don't have a sloppy mess by the time you get home.Ok, the pizza is the true *star* here. I have had the "white pizza" and again with the ricotta being so spot on it is just a win win.  If you are looking to share a pizza with others at your table I recommend the "mixed cold cuts pizza" it is THE best item on the menu. They have an area where kids can make there own mini pizzas. I have even seen schools bring there kids in to do it. There are TV's everywhere usually playing sports. If you wanted to host a large party they have 2 nice sized banquet rooms just for that. You can dine inside or outside on the beautiful patio. If you want to phone your order in for pick up that is as well an option. They have a nice case as you walk in of yummy desserts. On the door I have seen a sign requesting you not bring your own drinks inside. I would never think to bring my own drink to a restaurant I am going to sit down and eat at but apparently they have a problem so I wouldn't recommend bringing your own drinks. They are not open Monday's.FUCK. THIS. PLACE.FUCK EMThis is the worst pizza place in this city I have ever been to, and let me explain whyyyy:First off,  I've never been here before, but it was the closest pizza place that I came across on my way back from Nellis AFB to a friends house, and I wanted to surprise her with pizza.I walk in and place a takeout order for a large Margarita pizza. Simple enough right? No. No apparently this is the hardest fucking thing for a chef to accomplish, cause I wait 30 minutes before the guy at the front hands me a small box. What the hell is this? I ask. This is a small pizza box, I ordered a large.Indeed, they messed that up. But I understand mistakes are made sometimes, so I don't throw a bitch fit and the guy at the front apologizes, replaces the order, and offers me a complimentary scoop of gelato. Great, a cup of icecream for waiting an hour for a fucking pizza, seems legit to me! So I wait for another 20 minutes, and the cashier rushes back to me with my large pizza. I understand it's not his fault, but the fault of the incompetent chef in the back, so I graciously accept the pizza and leave. Phew! Glad that's over!So I get inside my car, and set the pizza in the passangers seat, I think to myself, gee, I should probably check the pizza to make sure it's the right kind. Cause chances are that chef is a moron. This is what I open up to:http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=4N-HU_T32hLENLntsNKNBgEDIT:So funny, I had a link to the picture, but apparently the company, or some grouchy loyal customer complained and Yelp took it down, but fear not my friends, it's all over facebook.I get a fucking pizza soup. Great. Just great. With an hour of my time wasted, I'm literally pulling my hair and way too pissed off to go back in there and complain, cause I probably would of threw this shit in the chefs face. This shit wasn't even cooked all the fucking way. What if me, my friend, and her little sister got sick from it? I try my best to go to local pizza shops here in town, but it's fucking places like these that make people stick to the corporate chain pizza places. Atleast they know how to cook a fucking pizza all the way through.This place needs to fire their dumbass ass chef and get a new one before they go out of business. Complete horseshit!I eat here if not every week, every other week. The owner takes great pride in putting out great food. I have eaten pretty much everything on the menu and never had a bad meal. I never leave hungry either. The portions here are very generous. Inside is clean and there are tables or booths. They have a couple huge banquet areas too if you want to host an event here.This week I ordered my usual Italian sub as well shared an Italian antipasto with my wife. The sub is just good. you can get it hot or cold. The sandwich has lettuce, tomatoes, onions, banana peppers, ham, salami, cappicollo, provolone & oil and vinegar. I have them put the oil and vinegar on the side since I have mayo added just make sure things don't slide around and I can add the amount I want. The salad was generous for being the small order. Very good and fresh. The shared sandwich and salad really hit the spot.The pizza is what you really should try first here. The deep dish is the best. When you order stuff like pizza or pasta it does take a while because it is made from scratch. Order some garlic knots while you wait because they are the best in town. There is a make your own pizza station for the kids. Bambini's is closed Monday's.The cashier, who's name is Angel stole $8 from me. I placed a togo order on Tues. Nov. 5 2013 at  exactly 6:00 PM from a server named Angel, this is according to my receipt that also shows a charge of $30.25 that was paid using my debit bank card, but after checking my bank statements today I noticed a charge for $38.25 to my bank card from bamstealurmoni! Now to be fair, I have not yet confronted Angel,  or his manager about this overcharge to my account as of yet, normally in a situation like this I would wait until after the problem was resolved,  giving the establishment time to investigate,  and offer a resolution before I would start publicly accusing them of being thieves, and make no mistakes about it, that is what I'm doing, I am accusing Bambinis of being a shady, dishonest, untrustworthy, thieving,  dirty, disgusting grease pit hole in the wall solely based on the employee's they choose to represent them, but the reason I am sounding off now is because Angel was a total jerk from the get go! This guy has a serious attitude problem!  Sorry, but I don't  tip somebody $8 for taking an order, I would however tip if he served me, even if he was still the snot nose little prick that he is, I would still reward him for his efforts,  assuming he wasn't thief of course! Tomorrow after they open for business,  I will inform them of this crime,  and I promise to either update this review,  or remove it based on the outcome,  but unfortunately they have lost me as a customer,  I believe in supporting locally run businesses,  and many times I have recommended this place which I now regret,  the I.A.P. who now hold there monthly meetings at this place being one of them,, I am not looking forward to telling them how wrong I was! Maybe this is just an isolated incident,  and this is just on bad employee giving the whole establishment a bad name, we will just have to wait a see, like I said, I will follow up on this review,  and if in a week from now Angel is still employed here being allowed to steal from their loyal, hard working unsuspecting customers,  then we will know just what kind of place this really is, but if he is dismissed from his duties of representing this company as being petty little crooks I will have no other choice but to spread the word far and wide warning people of this scam, I have many outlets to voice my concerns,  I am very involved in the community, and very rarely do I speak ill of an small business working hard to make it. but when you steal from me I get angry. I have no tolerance for scam artists in my town!  That is all for now,  but I will keep everyone posted.  Thank you.*first update,  when I posted this review a few minutes ago, a picture came up with it, a picture that I posted some time ago which I have forgotten about! When I see a  business on Yelp that does not have a picture, and I support the business,  I will post a picture for them to help advertise,  I'm only pointing this out to illustrate how hurt, betrayed,  and utterly sickened by what was done to me, for a measly $8 they lost a loyal customer, and now have their reputation at risk.
Urban Beans Cafe & Bar=This place is awesome. Because Phoenix isn't a walking city, I tend to not go to coffee shops to do a few hours of work, choosing instead to sit on my couch with laptop in hand, but Urban Beans is the kind of place that makes me want to spend a few hours being productive--or just surfing Facebook. (Isn't it funny how you can feel productive doing social networking when you're at a cafe surrounded by semi-urbanites?)So, what makes Urban Beans different from other local coffee spots? A few things: the staff is really nice, the plugs are plentiful (although watch your step when you're crossing an open area), and they have really good, affordable food options. (Try the pear flatbread or the quiche!). My biggest complaint is the music. I'm OK with emo but some sort of batshit-crazy guy doing spoken word over Enya-like strings is enough to throw me--the ultimate multitasker--into distraction land. Keep it simple, folks, and this place may just become good enough for the coveted five stars.Urban Beans is definitely a great find in Urban Phoenix. While this coffee shop makes its home on busy 7th street, the second I stepped foot inside, I forgot what was going on outside. Urban Beans has the perfect environment of independent coffee shop meets a clean and modern space with an eclectic touch. There's plenty of seating inside and out and they even have comfy chairs at the tables. Free Wii Fi and electrical outlets make this the perfect work space and the food and drink options make it the ideal one. The iced coffee here is delicious and I was happy to learn that they have sugar free chocolate syrup which is far and few between! It is pricey though and was $5.04 for a large iced coffee. I would definitely be in trouble if I worked here too long and too much! But the coffee is good and the environment is even better so I will most definitely be back.Me: What's the wifi password?Him: 'thankyou'" all lowercase.Me: Thank youHim: that's rightMe: No, I mean thanksHim: No, thank youMe: Right, I'm just to say thank YOU for giving me the passwordHim: Saying it to me won't help though, you'll have to type it into your laptopMe: You're funnyHim: thank youMe: ...is the password. Got it.Only at Urban Beans do you get a complementary Abbott and Costello routine with your coffee. One of my fav new spots. Love it.
Thai House=I've been a big fan of the other Thai House location for awhile now, so I was excited when I noticed this fairly new location was up and running and a lot closer to where my current home is located.  I've ordered take out from this location twice and both times I've been completely satisfied.Tonight I called in the following order for four of us:-2 orders of summer rolls-1 order pad Thai with chicken and shrimp - medium spice-1 order pad seu eu with shrimp and extra broccoli - medium spice-1 order eggplant with  mixed veggies-extra riceMy brother picked it up fifteen minutes later and it was delicious!  Each dish was filled with flavor and just enough kick.  Everyone enjoyed the meal... not only was it affordable, but it traveled well.Now if Thai House would only open another location in Old Town, or if they delivered, I'd be one happy camper!  But in the meantime, I highly recommend take out from Thai House.I am a big fan of Thai House here and the other one on Pima. I come here when I have a large group as the other one is smaller inside.As often as I come here, I never had anyone complaining about their food before. Everyone I came here was pleased with quality of food they serve.My ultimate favorite here is Mus-sa-mum. Always order with beef and spicy level 5. This curry is sweet, so the spicy level 5 is just perfect for someone like me, cannot handle too spicy food. I also love their Thai Fried Rice. Taste so much like Japanese fried rice (or fried rice in Japan).I ordered something new today, spicy eggplant. Surprised with rich flavor, I think this dish is going to be my regular item.  Pad thai, pineapple curry, yum woon sen, satay... they are some of my favorites too.Price is very reasonable, we had seven people at lunch today and ended up being only $65 before the tip. We couldn't even finish everything we ordered.  Food comes relatively quick, great place to eat lunch.  I may not check in on Yelp as often as I come here but I am a regular here and the one at the Pima road.I enjoy being accompanied by knowledgeable customers during my first time experiences at new restaurants, so I was quite pleased when Yuko suggested Thai House after our late afternoon hike at Camelback.I had read her review the day prior to coming, so I recall her photo of what appeared to be a peanut curry.  It's a name I am not familiar with: Mus-sa-mum... but its a taste I will crave until my descent into frontal lobe dementia is but a forgotten memory.  It was a delicious peanut curry sauce, with strips of beef and chunks of white potato.  Some sauteed button mushrooms would have been divine, but I'll keep that recipe in my pocket for now.  I think I'll call my version: Mush-sa-rum.I already have a twinsie, so I opted for their green curry over an "I'll take that as well".  It was every bit as delicious as my first green curry, so dont worry, Murray.  All arrived at the table with a large bowl of sticky rice.  After spooning both curries over my starch, my chop stick skills impressed my hiking partner so much, that she commented "Why dont you just use a fork"I would love to come back and try a noodle dish, or a Tom Kha, or some egg rolls.  The food was wonderful, portion sized generous, and the kids working didnt hassle us for hanging around and carrying on for an hour or so
Bice Bistro=I'm stunned at the hate towards Bice Bistro.  I've spent two evenings there this week and received superior service and excellent drinks and food.  Located in the Westgate section of Glendale, Bice Bistro is one of the only options for a relaxing meal in a classy setting.  Coming from the Philadelphia area, the last thing I expected was to eat pasta in the Midwest.  A two hour hike up and down Camelback Mountain yesterday morning changed my tune.  By dinner, I was ravenous for a meal that satisfied.  One look at the homemade pasta options on the menu had me ready to give it a try.  My fresh pappardelle tossed in tomato sauce with a touch of cream and topped with mozzarella was just as good as any pasta dish I've had in Philly's Italian restaurants.  My mom's angel hair pasta, with chunky tomatoes, garlic, basil and mozzarella was excellent.On both evenings we arrived early enough to take advantage of the happy hour specials, offered until 7 p.m.  Every drink we tried was perfectly made and with premium spirits.  My vodka martinis with blue cheese stuffed olives were wonderful, and despite arriving with only ten minutes left of happy hour time to spare, our bartender allowed us to pre-order our second round so that we could take advantage of the specials.  On our second visit, we received a warm welcome from the manager, who waved as soon as we walked through the door.  Every staff member we encountered was pleasant and engaging.  With price points in the $12 - $20 range (give or take a few selections), I find it hard to believe that anyone would complain about the cost.  Go to McFadden's or Yard House if you want fries with that sandwich.  Bice Bistro is a much needed dose of class in an area that is overpopulated with typical tourist trap destinations.
Lola's A Louisana Kitchen=I'm so excited there's some authentic New Orleans cooking now in Las Vegas! The place is cute and family owned-operated. My extended family all lives in New Orleans so I'm quite familiar with the cuisine. I'm also a very harsh critic! *$4.25 - cup of gumbo. She puts sausage, chicken AND seafood in her gumbo. I found it heavy on the chicken and light on the seafood. The flavor was great. Really took me back to NOLA! Basically was a chicken/sausage flavored gumbo with a couple shrimp thrown in.*$11.99 - 1/2 dozen charbroiled oysters. *sigh* I'm pretty spoiled here. I didn't find these nearly as good as real new orleans charbroiled oysters, but they were still enjoyable*$9.99 - Shrimp poboy with fries. The poboy was a little small compared to what I'm used to , but otherwise it was perfect. They fly their bread in from new orleans and the shrimp were so delish! The best poboy I've ever had outside of nola!Overall I'll be back. Their dessert menu looked incredible (bananas foster, bread pudding!). Prices weren't bad ($7.99-$12.99 per entree). Service was polite and speedy. Give them a try Yelp!Location: Everyone knows where it is but probably hasn't ever been there lol.Restaurant: ClassyService: Two Thumbs Up!Eats: Charbroiled Oysters, Shrimp Etoufee, 1lb of Crawfish, Oyster Po Boy.Drinks: Diet Sprite & Purple HazeWe're in LOVE!!!Location: We drove up and the first thing that I saw were the bright neon lights to the Holsum Bakery Sign and there she was, just after the eye piercing neons... Lola's.Restaurant: She wasn't hard to find, sits at the 15 & Charleston. It's a very quiet parking lot but as soon as your start walking towards the restaurant, you notice the people sitting outside and a faint sound of some Jazz music coming from the inside of the restaurant, which, um, we like, like a lot! Ok, Valley Girl moment gone.Our visit was on a late Friday night, 8:30ish, we had made reservations but we didn't really need them, this visit, as we were seated right away. The restaurant is still young and fresh, they just opened in October but I have a feeling that once people start finding out about them, reservations may be mandatory because they sure do put some yummies in your tummies! Our friend that was with us mentioned that a lot of his co-workers eat there for lunch and it does get pretty busy during that time, so, heads up, make a reservation.Fleur-de-lis. Saints. Mardi Gras Beads. Umbrellas on the ceiling.  Jazz music, I hearts. I've never been to NOLA, I've only been exposed to anything NOLA by my Uncle, either by telling us stories about and such but they sure are representing anything and everything New Orleans in there that it makes me feel like I'm there! Very welcoming. Atmosphere, A+++Service: Quentin was our server. Very sweet gal and on top of everything! Refills and everything without asking and very knowledable when it came to the menu. There's nothing worse than a server that's clueless about what they're serving and we did not have an experience close to resembling that, awesome job!The Yummies: We shared the Charbroiled Oysters, I had the Etoufee with Purple Haze and bites of the Hubster's food, the Po Boy and Crawfish with a Diet Sprite. There is not one complaint about the flavor of the food! Everything they brought out had great presentation and tasted great. I loved that with the Crawfish, they gave us a bucket, unlike a  local restaurant that has you throw it on your table just to have the juices spill all over your lap, yum. It was the first time that I tried Purple Haze beer, it's a wheat beer, the haze, with a hint of rasberry, the purple and it was quite yummy, so much so that I ordered 2 :). A friend of ours ordered the catfish and bread pudding and he enjoyed it. In fact, when the bread pudding came out, he took a bite and his eyes rolled to the back of his head,... I'm pretty sure he liked it :DAs we were eating dinner, we were approched by a woman with a pretty smile, a Fleur-de-lis hanging from each ear and introduced herself, it was Lola! She was so nice and we chit chatted for a little bit and even took a photo with her :)During dinner, my husband turned to me and said "This is the flavor that I've been looking for!" I completely agreed with him, everything was spot on. Yea, we'll be back.A great authentic American Cuisine.  I have to say , I am not a huge purveyor of Southern cooking, however, after reading yelper Michelle W review of the place, figured we had to give it a shot.  Had clients in town from Italy and France and one of my colleagues wanted to try Rhythm Kitchen and so I suggested Lola's.1.  Quaint - When you are traipsing around the Charleston area, me thinks the last thing you are going to think about is quaint, cute, cool.  This place is all that and has character. Small, few tables, small bar, and it has just enough of whatever it is to make it just right.2.  Service - Dominic was there when we entered waiting for our guests. Very nice, knowledgeable, gave us the scoop on the wine he preferred and also on the food.  They set up our table nicely and when we had to add one more, they were very accommodating. We had a party of 9 in here and they took care of us.  I think the place serves 20-25 total?3.  Food - I was looking to give our out of towners a unique experience to try something uniquely American.  So this is the place we chose.  Crab Cakes and Craw Puppies - The crab cakes were very substantial, flaky, moist and tender. I enjoyed it.  It was one per order, however, as they are decent size, we asked for each to be cut in two pieces and we ordered enough to share. Ordered craw puppies for the table, never having this before.  Deep fried seafood is the best I can describe this.  Not greasy and bite size tasty bits of seafood. Nice.  Each is the size of a small meatball, 5 per order, so we split two orders.  Jambalaya - to me, the right blend of spice, rice, seafood. I also ordered the shrimp as an addition and it was just right. Juicy and hits the spot.Salmon and Sweet potato fries - I think this was the only let down.  The fries had such great flavor yet the salmon was very dry  Dry fish is not too bueno, so this was  of a downer.Gumbo -Seafood soup like bouillabaisse or cioppino.  I did not have it but one of our friends did. It looked really, really good.Etoufee - I thought this was something a bald buy wore as he got older?  Perhaps I will need one soon.  Naw, this is a dish similar to the gumbo, just that it is thicker and more like a stew. Whereas the gumbo has seafood, this one here has either shrimp or something else, was the choice, but it was not  mixed like the gumbo.  Now I did not order this, but man did my friend enjoy it. Very nice.Sweet Potato Pecan Pie a la mode with ice cream - YOu have to come for the desserts.  This is what the wifey and I ordered, and it was really great. I am going to go back for their Banana Foster Bread Pudding.  Don't be shy, order the dessert!!!GK says, check this place out for sure! I enjoyed it as a unique dining place. Not sure if it is a frequent place for me yet, however, I am going back for other desserts, so I will let you all know.My husband and I had lunch at Lolas on 6/20th and were pretty disappointed. At first we were seated asked for our drink orders and shortly after we ordered our food but that is where the service ended. As we watched around us tables were getting bread it seemed at random and although we ordered entrees didn't see a crumb. It took 30 minutes for us to get our food and when we did it was cold. Not just the top of the food but all the way through like it had been sitting in a pot out back and they just slopped it on a plate. My husband had the Jambalya and it was cold all the way through, only the shrimp on top were hot. He said it had no flavor at all. I ordered the shrimp and grits and it too was cold like mushy paste with some hot shrimp on top. I liked the flavor but it was more like left overs I just got out of the fridge from the day before. My guess is they plated the rice and grits and forgot about it then 30 minutes later realized they didn't add the shrimp, topped it off and the waiter dumped it off on our table. If we were not on our way to a conference and hungry as all get out we would have complained and refused it. What made it worse is, no one came back to refill our drinks which were down to the ice the entire meal, the waiter just dropped off the food and walked off and we didn't see anyone again until we were done and ready to pay our check. It's a real shame because I had high hopes for this place. We love small mom & pop restaurants and this one unfortunately unless they shape up, train their staff and check their food quality before it leaves the kitchen will be seeing the doors close sooner than later.I am a road warrior.  I am used to eating alone, but I never get used to be treated poorly because I am eating alone.  I was really looking forward to eating here, but they would only seat me at a tiny 2 seat table with a total stranger...how awkward that would be.  They had 2 tables open, but they were being kept for party's of 2.  So, I walked.Came here after doing a google search of Diners, Drive Ins, and Dives for Las Vegas...  I've been craving cajun food, specifically jambalaya, so opted to try here.A Small divey restaurant with the interior adorned with lots of New Orleans memorabilia--paintings, ornaments, New Orleans Saints items, etc...  Along with the dim lighting, put me back in time to a setting in Louisiana...Service was fantastic.  The outgoing server helped me think aloud with my decision on what to order.  The pic of the crabcake looked interesting, but I didn't think I could finish it along with my entree.  I discussed their Po Boy which was featured on Triple D, but I had been craving good jambalaya for a long time.  Sooo ultimately, I went with jambalaya.Big mistake.The rice in the jambalaya was extremely mushy.  Killed the whole dish.  Obviously not freshly cooked and sitting in a huge pot of sauce for hours.  And where was the chicken and sausage?  Sparsely added... Why not 3 stars instead of 2?  Mushy riced jambalaya should never be served if you are charging people money to eat it...  Just my 2 cents...Triple D Stamped. Fried Oysters reeled me in. My aunt suggested this place and a fried oyster po'boy sounded good to me! Bun- super soft, lots of fried yumminess. I split a sandwich with my mom so i could have room for their famous bananas' fosters bread pudding. as i write this review, i just fcking realized that i didn't get their famous banana fosters BREAD PUDDING, but their plain banana's fosters. I guess i was still suffering from the 8 hour traffic jam we were stuck in earlier and maybe a bit hypnotized by the cutie server we had, but yeah, i ended up with a dessert i didn't order. I didn't love it either, but i'm sure i would have loved their bread pudding version Damn it!!! I guess i'll have to make my way back to get that dessert one day!When my father was in town we decided to pay homage to my hometown state of Louisiana and with the crisp, chilly weather ghosts of Gumbo past had me cravin' cajun. I've had Lola's bookmarked for a long time and based on Yelp reviews, it seemed legit. Walking in, I noticed a stack of King Cakes and Louisiana paraphernalia decorated the walls (beads, fleur de lys, Bourbon Street signs, and Saints flags). I felt like I had stepped into a restaurant in the French Quarter, it was small and quaint. Recommendations are strongly recommend. My father and I lucked out and were seated at a hi-top table near the bar. Our server came over and greeted us with a smile and warm, "Hey y'all! What can I get you to drink while y'all are lookin' over the menu?" authentic accent and all. (Seriously, it's a portal to Louisiana and Southern hospitality.) I ordered a sweet tea (which is SO hard to find West of the Mississippi - besides Texas) and our drinks were ordered promptly arrived with warm, freshly buttered and flashed grilled bread. We both ordered a cup of Gumbo and we're still narrowing down our choices.The Gumbo arrived with lightning speed & was on point. It was thick (a lot of people think it's a soup, but it's very much like a stew) and filled with chunks (not bits) of Andouille sausage, shrimp, chicken, and okra. Tasted like home; it was excellent.For entrees we ordered Crawfish Etouffee (my FAVORITE Cajun dish of all-time) and Shrimp Creole. The etouffee was amazing, the butter, garlic, and green pepper flavors well balanced and there was just the right amount of heat. The good times we're definitely being had by my mouth. Shrimp Creole was also amazing, tomato-y, peppery, garlicky, onion-y paradise. The shrimp were also huge (love me some oximorons). I found out that their shrimp, crawfish, and catfish were flown in from Louisiana. At this point we were way too full to try dessert. I am planning a second trip back to explore more of menu and to give that Banana's Foster Bread Pudding. I got to live the Louisiana state motto: "Come fall in Love with Louisiana all over again" on my trip to Lola's. It's great to know that there is great Creole & Cajun cuisine just around the corner. Excellent service. Standout, authentic food! A warm, friendly atmosphere. Laissez les bon temps roulezer in your mouth at Lola's!4 1/2 stars. NOLA cuisine  has got to be top of my list of favorite foods I enjoy so checking out Lola's for the first time during the week excited me. Private parking here so no issues. They offer outdoor dinning but I was dinning solo and opted to sit in the bar area since they were quite busy that evening.Started off with a bowl of NOLA gumbo which was full of yummy ingredients and had a kick to it which made my forehead break a sweat!  I followed with an entrée of crawfish entouffee which was delicious.  My friendly waitress suggested dessert and I didn't hesitate a second - chose the Fosters bread pudding which was topped with ice cream. It was awesome! Overall a great NOLA meal and the staff here was fabulous. I'm looking forward to returning here again and again!I'd been looking forward to coming to this spot since seeing it on Triple D and to also support my fellow New Orleanian.  The site was so cute & decorated with New Orleans fare throughout.  Tables were secure and it was clean.  There is also a grill in the front.  It is small but intimate. Servers were very nice.  Hence one star.If you enjoy cayenne pepper & a runny nose, this is your spot.  I am from New Orleans, born & raised & I was insulted.  This food had absolutely no flavor.  Not only did it not have flavor the gumbo was uneditable it had so much cayenne.  It tasted as if the only spice was cayenne and no base in any smoked meat or flavor enhancers like bay leaf, smoked necks as the base, and garlic powder, onion powder, granulated garlic or anything.  Nothing I had was from home.  I also had the crawfish.  Sadly cayenne was the star.  The potatoes that they added to the boil were not boiled with any kind of salt. Ever had a boiled or baked potatoe without salt?  Horrible.My table mate had the crawfish étouffée.  Cayenne abounded and no flavor.  She said the rice was fluffy.  Another table mate had the green beans & I'd ordered the greens.  Greens lacked anything & tasted like they came from a can.  Bacon pieces were obvious.  The green beans had a good crunch & a little flavor.  We also ordered the grilled oysters for our table.  They were seasoned with Italian dressing.  Different and average.I do not understand all the four & five stars here.  Palates are different but good food never changes and is consistent.  Lola's is a wanna be Louisiana kitchen.  We have a Lola's in New Orleans & I encourage every Yelper to eat there if ever in town.  This Las Vegas Lola is an imposter in the highest order.On our first night in Vegas, after a long heavily trafficked drive, we decided to stay in and order take out. You have to know what to order here because it can be delicious, but it can also be blah. Bear ordered the shrimp over grits and it was mind blowing. MIND BLOWING!!! I ordered the jambalaya and it was yuck! YUHUCK!!! So think carefully before you order, ask them what their specialties are, what's popular on their menu, etc. An other thing I was extremely unhappy with, and I don't know if it's the same in the restaurant but, their take out portions are tiny. The pictures I'm about to share shows the food as it came before we started eating. Considering the amount of food, this place is heavily over priced!! I would go back for the shrimp and grits, but I would eat it there so I could demand more food lol
Boardhouse Serious Sandwiches=North Vegas has a slew of chain restaurants and some "just okay" independent places.  The Boardhouse Serious Sandwiches shop , though, is a winner. Sure, it's pricier than a mediocre Subway.  But taste  wise, you can't compare the fast food mass made subs of one and the seriously made Boardhouse food.. I had the pastrami Nami on rye, and my brother had the turkey.  The pastrami was aromatic and warm, thinly and evenly sliced and lean.  It was placed on very soft, thick rye bread.  With mustard,it was a beautiful, tasty, tall sandwich.  I didn't try the turkey, but my brother didn't say a word the whole time he devoured his sandwich. He said the other sandwiches, from Tuna to roast beef, are all really good.When in town next time, I hope to try the other items and their cookies. Their featured item on their web homepage is a fat turkey sub with cranberry. It makes me drool...so I always keep a napkin at my computer. I love a place that's all about quality..I just wish they were in the OC.Boardhouse Serious Sandwiches-Timber's newest experiment with 4 location across the Las Vegas Valley.First I even heard of this place was an ad I received in the mail. $2.00 off per sandwich, Buy 1 get 1 Free after 4pm and $10 off a $25 purchase on the Weekends. GREAT DEALS!!The ad had their menu printed on the back and the sandwiches all sounded quite appetizing and a little different variation than you see in most sub shops in Las Vegas.My 1st attempt at coming here I show up at 10:30 on a Sunday and they didn't open until 1 am so I went elsewhere.This time it was 4 pm on a Friday and I was hungry so I ordered 3 sandwiches to go. A Beef Dip,A BBQ Beef and a Pastrami Nami. The cashier was fantastic-very helpful,perky and informative. She said they were owned by Timbers Gaming and had been open since June 2009. Not on twitter yet but a TV commercial airing soon.The sandwiches are a little pricy $7-8 each -one size fits all.(smaller than a footlong bigger than a size inch)-one type of bread.The 1st sandwich was the beef dip. Thin roast beef , horseradish and onion. The beef was ok but not real impressive and this was the BEST of the 3 sandwiches.The 2nd sandwich was the BBQ Beef-same beef as the french dip slathered in bad bbq sauce and some onions thrown in. Nothing memorable here.The 3rd sandwich was the pastrami-It sure looked good-lots of pastrami-I only made it through half and had the WORST heartburn. It seemed like it had a TON of pepper. Too thin pastrami and it was a little dry and chewy not moist and tender like GOOD pastrami is.Overall the employees were very enthusiastic, the place had a real cool surfer vibe to it and a simple menu but it's a little too expensive and not impressive at all.It's nice to see a new place popping up in this economy but I do not have alot of hope for this place -especially this location. MOST of the customers will be college kids looking to eat cheap and Port Of Subs is nearby.
Juan Jaime's Tacos and Tequila=Just an update to my previous review. A few reviews had complained about having to pay for chips & salsa. On my most recent visit, chips & salsa were free as long as you were purchasing a meal item...
America's Taco Shop=I love America. I love tacos. Not always in that order, but let's continue. I've been a few times already. And have yet to order a taco. That's because America's Taco Shop could easily be named America's Quesadilla Shop. But, we know, that wouldn't stick. I've had the carne asada quesadilla with lettuce, guac and monterey jack. Definitely on the smaller side, but hey, it's $4.50. And then there's that Mexican Coke. Pricier than the U.S. Coke. Oh. Wait. We're talking beverages here folks. I left the 80s behind years ago! Yep. Mexican Coke has REAL sugar and not HFCS. I"m not a real anti HFCS kinda guy...but let's just say, this Mexican Coca Cola really rocks my meats and cheeses! But, it's $3. So you gotta feel in a fancy lunch mood. My last visit I added an order of chips and salsa. All said, with tip, was over $13. A little pricey. But I didn't mind. Kind of like buying Kiehl products at Neiman's. Or a brick of brie at AJs. Or the expensive toilet paper with chamomile and lotion. Worth it! Especially the latter. I"m just sayin'!Great service. Friendly, if not a bit too aggressive. Last visit Miss America herself was there with her cute and chatty daughter. I loved it! Though my kids are limited to a Schnauzer, I like seeing family together in the biz. America. America. God bless your tacos. From sea to shining sea. From 7th St. to 7th Ave. God shed your guac on me....I was driving down Melrose District when I saw that America's Taco Shop served breakfast. I needed something to eat, so I pulled over and went inside. They do not have a big vegetarian menu, so I just ordered a breakfast burro without meat and potatoes. It was decent, but this place is probably not my first choice for breakfast. They also should not advertise it as a Burro. A breakfast burro is pretty huge and the one that I got was the size of a breakfast burrito.
Maciano's Pizza & Pastaria=I spent a good 30 minutes on my drive home yelping pizza places that cater to vegetarians & local to where I live. this location is less than 5 minutes from my house and easily accessible. awesome right? I thought so till I ordered.My order was simple enough, small white pizza ordered as is & a cup of minestrone soup. The brunette hostess rang me up and said it would be about 25 minutes. This was at 630... so I waited in my car and went inside at 7. Around 7:10 and all the other patrons coming in and picking up their orders, the hostess told me it would be a few more minutes. Few moments later, she quietly says that my order had been "forgotten" and she was "sorry" and it would be another 20 minutes. I didn't even get my pizza until 7:41. And when I finally picked it up there was no compensation, no coupons for next time, just a simple "Sorry" with a shrug. Terrible service at best. there wasn't a line or anyone waiting to be seated. everyone else had been given their order and mine was pushed aside. I suggest eating elsewhere when you're craving pizza/pasta... unless waiting over an hour sounds appetizing.
Blossom=This is not your neighborhood Chinese restaurant.The flavors are familiar but the ingredients, their incredible quality, and the respect they are given are not.  There is a balance and harmony to the dishes that make each ingredient to sing.Warning, you're gonna have sticker shock when you first look at the menu (beef broccoli $28, fried rice $20) but do look.  Don't make the mistake I made on my first visit, after winning big in the poker room, I told the server to bring me a house specialty.  Yep, a $300 Chinese dinner for one. For starters, the Crispy fried beef roll and enoki mushrooms and the simple salt and pepper tempura ice fish are delicious.  Both so perfectly cooked, crispy on the outside and moist inside.Seafood is where this restaurant shines.  Most items can be prepared multiple ways.  Ask the server for a recommended preparation if you're not sure.  The spot prawn with salt and pepper was excellent.  Incredibly sweet and the head, so clean and creamy.  The giant clam (sashimi style) was delicious.  Clean ocean flavor with a hint of sweetness and some chew.  For the less adventurous, the lobster tail with the spicy XO sauce is a winner.  Layer after layer of flavor from the sweet lobster meat to the spicy, fermented sauce.  Tea works best with the flavors of the food.Note:  Avoid ordering typical Chinese takeout items.  You will end up factoring in the price and then comparing them to your favorite local place.Highly Recommended if you win big and if you are willing to try new things.This will be my very first review for Yelp.  I don't normally write reviews because 99% of the times I eat out I am with my husband Dennis T.  Now, for those of you who are familiar with Dennis' reviews you will understand why I don't find it necessary to write reviews.  He says it all, and in a much more creative and descriptive way than I ever could.  Who would want to follow his act?Dennis decided for Valentine's Day that we would eat at Blossom in Aria and follow it up with the Viva ELVIS show.  Excellent choices, but I won't be reviewing either one.  My sole reason for writing this review is to make you and the management at Blossom aware of an excellent server named Jackson V.  Immediately after I was seated he presented me with a perfect long stemmed red rose for Valentine's Day.  That was a very nice surprise, but not the reason for my review.  Jackson was simply one of the nicest servers I have ever encountered. We asked what kind of hot tea they had and after naming three types we weren't sure if we wanted Oolong or Jasmine.  We expressed to Jackson that we thought it was Oolong that we liked and ordered a pot.  After he poured our tea and we both tasted it he inquired how we liked it.  I said it was okay, but I really think I prefer Jasmine.  Without our prompting he immediately went to the kitchen and procured a piping hot order of Jasmine tea and gave each of us new teacups.  Now Dennis has two teacups in front of him and when he went to pour the second cup of Oolong tea for himself he learned just how hot that pot was and spilled the tea in the process.  Jackson and another server immediately appeared to clean up the mess.Dennis ordered potstickers as an appetizer and asked for and received five different sauces to complement them, including a small vial of red wine vinegar.  Dennis did not know to hold on to the top when pouring the vinegar.  You guessed it, the top came off and red wine vinegar was splattered all down the front of his shirt in a curious polka dot pattern.  This time three servers rushed to our rescue.  Jackson left and promptly returned with a glass of club soda and small cloth so we could attempt to clean up his shirt, to no avail.Now I am probably one of the pickiest eaters in the country.  I hate all vegetables (except potatoes if you consider that a vegetable), only eat a couple of fruits, and don't like anything spicy.  Even black pepper is too much for my sensitive palate.  You know how they say your taste buds change every seven years?  Well mine are still stuck at age seven!I ordered the Wor Wonton Soup without any vegetables because Jackson said it wouldn't be a problem and I did receive it sans vegetables.  I ordered the Honey Walnut Shrimp without the fruit and it also was presented the way I ordered it.Everything we asked for we promptly received from a smiling Jackson who was not even slightly fazed by my weird ordering style or Dennis' mishaps.  Blossom's management should know what a gem they have in Jackson.  He was efficient, courteous and friendly and Dennis and I will request him the next time we dine there, and I highly recommend you do the same.   By the way, the food was also excellent and deserves this five-star rating.Blossom was one of the restaurants in Aria that I had never been to even though I had read very positive reviews of the restaurant.  I had a ticket to see Zarkana so I went last night and ordered from the early dining menu which is a prix fixe 4 course meal.I started with the corn egg drop soup.  It was standard fare.  Very tasty and a good starter.  Next came Next came crisp fried beef roll with enoki mushroom and Mandarin brown sauce.  The rolls had a crisp exterior and very good tasting, moist beef inside.  The brown sauce was flavorful.  The main course has a choice option and I went with the beef tenderloin with portabella mushroom.  The beef was coated with black pepper and there was a small amount of black pepper sauce with the meat.  Accompanying the meat were stir fried bok choy and rice.  The meat was so very tender it could almost be cut with a fork only.  For dessert, there were two mochi--red bean and green tea.Service was superb!  The servers knew I had a 7 PM show.  Since the restaurant opens at 5:30, time is an issue.  The courses were brought out in a timely manner with enough time between so not to feel rushed yet never was I tapping my foot nor looking at my watch.  They know what they're doing!My server, Kenny, was very polite and pleasant.  The restaurant is quite elegant.  It was relatively quiet with modern music playing at a low, background volume which would be conducive to conversation.I have to return and order à la carte when I can try some of the very interesting things on the menu.
Rosati's Pizza=We got in around 7 pm into Las  Vegas, everyone was hungry. We didn't want to go to a buffet. We wanted something simple, since we had a bunch of kids with us. When we checked in at the resort, they gave us a menu for Rosati's Pizza. It even had some family value coupons and they deliver. Spaghetti, Pizza & Wings it is then. The coupon "Family Pasta Special" ($25.99) was for (1) Family Spaghetti or Mostaccioli, (4) Bread Sticks, (6) Meatballs & a 2 litter soda. We chose the spaghetti w/ meat sauce. When they say "family" they mean big, large as in a full tray of spaghetti. That was not what I expected. And it was very very good. The bread stick was garlicky, also good. The meatballs were delicious. (A must order) Matched well with the spaghetti. Highly recommend this deal. Like I said, I didn't expect the special to be so much food, so I ordered more. Hawaiian Luau Pizza, Canadian Bacon & Pineapple. This was just okay for me. The kids loved it though. Buffalo Wings (24 pcs) Delicious. Fried to perfection. The sauce was not too vinegary (the way I like it) I could not stop eating them. Yummy!!Fettuccine Alfredo was also a hit. Pasta was cooked perfectly and the sauce was creamy without being too rich. Delicious Service was good. From the lady taking the order to the gentlemen who delivered it. Even got a courtesy phone call to tell me he was parking (it's hard to find parking where I'm staying) I appreciated that It was a very good Family dinner. Everything tasted delicious and getting a lot of food was a pleasant surprise. I'll definitely be back.
Shabu Shabu Kagayaki=Shabu Shabu aka Japanese fondue has a home in Montreal!This is  actually a really fun place to eat at. Seating is around a horse-shoe shaped counter/bar  which takes up the whole restaurant. You have a choice of broths (spicy or traditional) and you choose which kinds of meats and veggies you'd like. You're also given a bowl of rice on the side. You "cook" the thinly sliced meat in your broth   a la fondue style along with the veggies.Everything is super fresh and super healthy. You can overeat all you want here and don't have to feel bad about it afterwards at all! It's a great cheap date spot!
Jimmy John's=Not a fan of Jimmy John's and find nothing gourmet about their sandwiches. The location on Mill has a bad set up. The door to the counter is only about 5 feet so when it gets busy customers try and pile in, then the people behind the counter are constantly yelling for them to move out of the doorway.. It's a mess. Also the seating is great for 1 or 2 people, but bring more than that and you are SOL. I really don't like that there is not 4" option, only 8". I'm not hungry enough to eat an 8" sub for lunch. I want options! I ordered the Italian night club and didn't read the menu close enough to see they include mayo on it. I HATE MAYO. My sub was drenched in mayo, seriously like a pond of mayo. Gross. I couldn't taste any vinaigrette. Who ever heard of putting mayo on an Italian sammy? I think I'll stick to Silver Mine should I need to get  my Mill sub fix on.I would give them 0 stars if it was available. This is the worst jimmy johns in the area. The manager has a bad attitude and makes you feel stupid. Let me tell you about the last time I was there a few weeks ago.Granted it was about 1:30 an and was relatively busy.I ordered a few club lulu sandwiches with cheese and a bag of BBQ chips. The sandwich was made by the time the cashier swiped my card.  We sat down near the soda machine and munched away on our sandwiches and talking about random events that took place during the nights adventures. As we finished up our sandwiches we decided to grab the BBQ chips on the way out because we got all fought up in conversation that I didn't get a chance to eat them. And yes I think the BBQ chips are there best option. K here's where the whole thing when down hill. As I started walking out I got grabbed and almost thrown down by one of the employees that was making the sandwiches. He grabbed the chips out of my hands and yelled "I Don't think so dude" and then he started telling people in the restaurant and the staff that I had already eaten my chips and that I was stealing another bag.! Are you freaking kidding?!! He assaulted me then embarrassed me in front of everybody because he thought I was stealing a freaking 1.50 bag of chips!!I asked to speak to the manager, at this point I was furious. I explained to him and confirmed with the cashier that I paid for a bag of chips and the sandwiches. they were made so fast that we just sat down and ate the sandwiches and grabbed the chips on the way out. He said. " well that's bs, my employee says you already ate a bag of chips and I believe him over you so, unless you want to actually pay for something were done"Just a bunch of poorly trained staff, who abide by there own set of rules. Poor poor jimmy johns. Actually disappointed they let this happen
Tottie's Asian Fusion='Twas Wednesday night before Thanksgiving and the airport was a zoo...We picked up my sis nonetheless, like any good family would do.We were hungry for something different and perhaps something new...Finally a decision was made to head to Tottie's Asian Fusion 2!Fresh spring rolls, Totties Rolls, Soup, Eggplant, Curry, and Rice...We shared a bunch of tasty dishes and the atmosphere was beyond nice.--Enough of the rhyme, I just have to declare my love for Tottie!  She's the sweetest lady and a damn good chef.  You cannot go wrong at either location.  This new one is located inside the Lincoln Village Shops by Trader Joe's and Fogo De Chao.  Tottie's is our go-to place for Chinese, Thai, and Vietnamese... some of our favorite dishes are the panang curry, spicy eggplant, and pad seu eu, but we've never had anything from Tottie's that we didn't like.  Next time you're craving anything Asian, go to one of Tottie's restaurants - you can't go wrong!And for weekday lunch specials on Tuesday through Friday (11am - 3pm), Tottie's offers entrees served with steamed rice and a house salad starting at just $6.50 - such a deal!Although this Tottie's location has been open just a few months, it's time for an update... We've already been a handful of times and never been disappointed.  Tottie and her staff are extremely attentive and friendly every visit.  And the food... well, I could eat here all of the time and it would never get old!  Although our 'old standby' dishes are consistently cooked just right, we often try to order something new.  Tonight we shared the sizzle rice soup and a noodle dish that we'd never tried before... it had chow fun noodles, broccoli, bok choy, carrots, in a brown sauce.  It was delicious!Despite being full, we also ended up trying the banana pudding... and it was the perfect sweet ending to the meal and the long day!  Each bite had just the right amount of banana, mochi, ice cream, and who knows what other surprises, but it was damn good!***One last reason for an update: the shopping center is still undergoing major construction.  Do no let that deter you from going in.  Tottie's is staying open through it all!This is one of the best Asian restaurants in the valley. When you first visit you will notice that the decor and lighting is superb - suitable for a date night. The staff are gracious. Most importantly tho, the food here is fantastic. From the spring rolls and kung pao to the egg drop soup. Every meal I watched come out (to other tables) looked better and better. Now that I trust them I will return to sample some less cliché dishes.This also happens to be one of the least expensive lunch places in the area.You must try the Tangerine Shrimp. My mouth is watering right now just thinking about the to-go dinner that I ordered for my bf and I from Tottie's 2 last night. Mmmmm Mmmmm Mmmmm. Scrumptiousness!But back to the Tangerine Shrimp, it's sweet, it's a little sour, it's drenched in a blackish glaze (so don't freak out if it looks like black globs of shrimp, like I did), it's surrounded by orange slices, it's fried in tempura.... and it's amazing. Judging by looks alone, this dish does not look appetizing. But what it lacks in visual appeal, it makes up for in taste. You will be missing out if you don't try it.Now on to the rest of the Tottie's extravaganza, we ordered:- Kung Pao Shrimp - Fresh and crisp vegetables chopped into little cubes, tons of whole peanuts and succulent meaty shrimp in a spicy soy flavored sauce. Peanuts and shrimp in every bite!- Scallops with Black Bean Sauce - Fresh veggies and HUUUUGE meaty scallops in the most amazingly flavorful yet light black bean sauce I've ever tasted. OMG good.- Pad Thai with Chicken - Thai stir fried noodles (not overcooked and not undercooked, instead they were moist, flavorful and cooked to absolute perfection!) yummy fried egg pieces, crisp bean sprouts, shredded carrots, flavorful chicken (it was moist! not dry at all!), and topped with millions of crushed peanuts. Pad Thai heaven.- Fried Won Tons - For only about $6 you get 10 of these little drops from heaven. Won tons encasing pork and formed into little ball-like shapes - I'm astounded that I liked these as much as I did, as I'm not a huge pork fan. But the meat inside was so moist! And flavorful! They came with a sweet and sour dipping sauce as well as a spicy mustard sauce, another true taste bud delight.Now, a couple of notes before you head on over to Tottie's 2:- Portions are pretty large. We had leftovers, but I must admit that I stuffed myself silly with food.- For the high quality of the food, the price point at Tottie's is excellent. Yeah, it's on the pricier side of Asian Fusion food, but it didn't feel like Tottie hijacked my wallet. Entree's are around $10-12 each depending on if you pick shrimp, chicken or beef (shrimp will always be the most expensive - but SO worth it, as this is high quality seafood).- Take out is an excellent option if you don't feel like eating at the restaurant. It's fast and easy.- Their online menu has sushi items on it, but if you go to the N. Scottsdale Rd location they don't serve sushi. Originally I had tried to order some but on the phone I was informed that sushi isn't on their menu - so if this is what you desire, go to the spot on East Thomas Road.Hands down, the best Asian food I've tried in the valley. I'm officially a Tottie's 2 addict. I was so immensely satisfied with this meal, and now I'm dreaming about the leftovers I have for lunch...Last night Tottie cooked me up a special "diet" plate. She started with fresh steamed shrimp, chicken and dry fried those with cabbage, red pepper and onion then finished with fresh spring onion and cilantro. Let me tell you, it was amazing! No oil, no sugar, no starch but ALL flavor! Along side she brought me a dish of spicy Tottie sauce which is made from vinegar, chile and garlic.. again sugar free but still packed with complexity flavors and major heat! Tottie is just an amazing chef, owner and person. Even this morning I'm still reeling about the experience I had at Totties last night, I felt just like family.4.5 stars Oh Tottie's. I think I love you because our names are similar... Beyond that, you have earned my love based on your DELICIOUS food and friendly service! The first time I went to Tottie's it was for my Favorite Bear's birthday party. I arrived before Happy Hour ended and scored a Sake Bomber (or two?) before we were seated for dinner. I let the birthday boy handle all of the ordering. He knows what I like! I don't remember exactly what all we had but I do know that I want an IV drip of her curry sauce in my arm at all times. I also enjoyed her pork belly lettuce cups. Yep, PORK BELLY. It was so good! The second visit I had, I ordered a duck with creamy curry noodle dish. It was not on the menu, and you're lucky if you can get it, but if you do, I wouldn't mind if you named your next child after me. You're welcome. The duck was tender and flavorful. The noodles were perfectly cooked with the most delicious creamy, spicy curry sauce. I could eat it every day. Seriously. During our meal, our server was friendly but a little absentminded. She also seemed like she was new because she wasn't terribly knowledgeable on the menu. At the end of my meal, Tottie asked me about my food and thanked me for coming in. I am looking forward to my next visit to Tottie's The food is great, the servings are huge, the prices are reasonable. I know 5 stars from me is in their future!An offbeat bistro just north of Downtown Scottsdale that knows the key to good Asian fusion: mix the menu, not the dishes.Tottie's offers large portions of hearty, and authentic, Asian cuisine that ranges from Chinese to Vietnamese to Thai to the owner's native Laotion.We began the meal with an order of Vietnamese summer rolls, packed with shrimp, greens, mint, and a roasted pork that brought to mind char siu. The peanut dipping sauce added a pleasant touch. This was followed by a silky Panang curry, an on-point pad thai, and a ginger-basil salmon. There were no weak links, even if the Panang curry was a little muted and the pad thai noodles on the thinner side.For the size of the dishes and quality of preparation, the meal was a good choice for a late lunch.Driving south from the Grand Canyon on a Sunday morning, we were late for lunchtime and hungry.  Tucked away in a small strip mall was this location of Tottie's, and what a "find" it was.The décor at Tottie's is pleasantly understated and quite attractive.  Table placement and noise levels don't detract from the dining experience.  With an emphasis upon the cuisines of Thailand and Vietnam, the menu is geographically varied and large.  Yet, contrary to the current trend of Pan-Asian bistro restaurants, portion sizes are ample.  The food is satisfying, generally authentic and aesthetically plated.  As a guide, the kitchen uses an Asian standard of spiciness; "moderate" heat will pack a punch, albeit one which we found to be agreeable.Lunch began with a shared appetizer of Vietnamese-styled rice paper summer rolls.  In comparison to others that I've eaten, these were uncommonly thick, and a bit difficult to eat out-of-hand.  Shrimp, shredded pork and mint were apparent, but an overenthusiastic use of vegetables muted their flavors.  The accompanying peanut sauce was successful in balancing the flavors, but was a bit under-seasoned in its own right.An entrée of red Panang beef curry was true-to-form in its Thai seasoning.  Accents of lemongrass and galangal, two aromatics often omitted from corner-cutting preparations, were apparent.  If a bit heavy in its liquid portion, the dish was otherwise spot-on.The salmon filet in a basil and ginger sauce was both generous and quite tasty.  Very well balanced in its seasoning, yet not overpowering the taste of the fresh fish, this dish was an unconditioned success.Shrimp Pad Thai rounded out our shared lunch entrees.  Ample in portion, a vermicelli noodle was used.  Pad Thai is best judged by how effectively the kitchen balances the key flavors of sweet, spicy, salty and sour, and lesser substitutions for tamarind sourness is usually where the preparation suffers.  In this case, however, slight demerits go to an inadequate representation of the sweet component-- perhaps the easiest area to master.  Although a bit unbalanced, the shrimp Pad Thai was still very good.Our server, Rain, was enthusiastic, pleasant and prompt.  Before adding a generous tip for her services the tab for this enjoyable lunchtime feast for 4 totaled under $55; an excellent value for the dining experience received.
Pho Village=Our fellow yelpers have been raving about Pho Village in the Korean Plaza marketplace and we decided to give this place a go! First thing to notice is the matching furniture creates a nice zen-like environment right off the bat.  It looks like they spent a few more dollars on the furniture.  They also have an open kitchen atmosphere, so you can actually take a peak of how things are being made.  This is a good sign to me since a restaurant who is willing to show off their kitchen must be confident of it!Started off with #4. Cha Gio " 4 Vietnamese fried eggrolls" ($5.50).  I like restaurants that give you the greens so you can wrap your eggroll up.  Plenty of lettuce, mint, and the other stuff to make it quite complete.  It did take awhile to come out, I barely had a chance to wrap one up when our main entrees arrived.  The Husband said he could see that they were pan-frying it, which could explain why it took longer.  As a result though, it stayed hot longer since I had put the egg roll down to work on my pho and it was still quite hot when I got around to it.I went for the standard #11. Pho Dac Biet "Special combo with rare slices of steak, well done brisket, flank, tendon, tripe and beef balls with rice noodle. " (Small $5.95) The Husband said the broth tasted more 'perfumey' than other places.  I just noticed that I only got one piece of beef ball in my soup.The Husband wanted his staple - #28. Hu Tieu Hoac Mi Bo Kho "Beef stew with egg noodle" ($6.50) but they were out of it that evening.  He settled on #32. Com Ga Hai Nam "Hai Nam style chicken served with seasonal rice" ($7.50), which is something I usually get.  First off, it definitely looked (and tasted) a lot better than Pho Little Saigon's and Pho Thanh Huong Restaurant's versions.  They give you a lot of rice with this dish, perhaps too much since you end up eating it all. It was decent, but I've had better.  (Then again, it's always hard to compare this dish when you've had it homemade!  But I'll keep looking nonetheless.)Overall, Pho Village was a good experience overall.  The real test will be when the Husband gets to test out their version of the beef stew though! 3.5 stars.
Hook Fish & Chicken=Good shrimp and wings! Hook has been in Pittsburgh since 2005. This Hook location is on Federal Street on the North Side across from the library. It is a take out only location.As far as seafood they offer catfish fillets, nuggets, cod, perch, regular and jumbo shrimp, oysters, scallops, tilapia and whiting. Dinners come in small, large and family sizes. All dinners come with cole slaw, fries and bread. As far as chicken dinners they offer gizzards, nuggets, tenders and wings and they are also available in small and large sizes. Wing dinners are available anywhere from 3 wings to 150 wings. They also offer chicken and fish combos including: catfish & wings, perch & wings, catfish cut & chicken tenders and perch & chicken tenders. For sandwiches they offer crab cake, cod, perch, tilapia, whiting and chicken tender sandwiches. All sandwiches come with fries and cole slaw. For sides they offer cole slaw, okra, fries, hush puppies, jalapenos, onion rings, mozzarella sticks and jalapeno poppers. For desserts they offer cheese cake, peach cobbler, banana pudding and assorted cakes. I really like their fries and jumbo shrimp. The jumbo shrimp are HUGE! The wings are very good also, they're just on the small side. I like my wings big like at Honeybee's in Homewood.I don't know what kind of magic unicorn pixie dust they sprinkle on their food, but whatever it is, I can't get enough!After years of hearing a friend ask me if I've tried Hook Fish and Chicken yet, I could finally answer yes.  And then I finally understood why she kept asking.  I tried the combo featuring 6 whole wings, fries, slaw and bread.  It was all just. So. Good.  The bread (your basic white sliced) is placed on the bottom, like a cloud that any grease from the wings can soak in to.  The wings and fries are packed into a styrofoam container and sprinkled with their infamous seasoning and then closed tightly with a rubber band placed around to keep all that goodness from spilling out.  The menu is basic, just pick your fried food of choice (wings, tenders, fish, shrimp) and sides (even fried okra).  My meal was $8.  It is cash only and take out only with an ATM on site.  You can call ahead but most orders are ready in ten minutes.  Be warned, you will become an addict.  "Why did I only get 6 wings?" I kept asking myself as I have been dreaming of those wings ever since.
Thai Original BBQ Restaurant=I am impressed! We got a Winner! This Gem of a restaurant is right behind my house, amazing how many times I have passed by and not stopped in to give it a try. What the hell have I been waiting for? Went to dinner with my pal Karen tonight and said this is the night we try something new! This restaurant is very comfy and cozy, love the booth seating so relaxing. What we ordered: PORK PHAD THAI NOODLES, (thin noodles) mmmm melt in your mouth, nice flavor with that hint of sweet. BBQ CHICKEN W/ SHRIMP FRIED RICE, 1/2 of a chicken, generous portion, I had to take a thigh home I was soooo stuffed. Perfectly cooked literally falling off the bone and the BBQ sauce semi sweet just perfect. Shrimp fried rice is a winner as well, tasty and flavorful.GINGER CHICKEN, ordered a 10 on the hot spicy scale, perfection, juicy chicken and fresh veggies! RASPBERRY ICED TEA SWEET BLACK ICED TEA, yes for all of you fellow sweet iced tea lovers, this is it for you, black tea with simple syrup mixed in, mmmmm as good as southern sweet tea! MMMMMMMM Yummy to the bone! Wowzers! Everything was delicious!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The service was fantastic, our waitress kept the iced tea refills a flowing and we had quite a few! She was awesome, props to the service staff! I will be back many times over :) *side note* I noticed they have a green garden section on their menu for Vegetarian style, 14 selections to choose from.I attached pictures of our meals, mmmmm!* I can see why they were issued "The Best of Vegas" by the Review Journal.Return visit :)Yes indeed since my first visit less than one week ago I have done nothing but crave a repeat visit.Went today for lunch with my bestie and boy they just keep bringing it on in a good way!Today I ordered from the lunch special menu $6.95BBQ CHICKEN SKEWERS SA-TE PEANUT SAUCE w/fried rice and sweet and spicy cucumber salad. Mmmmm yummy and filling, generous lunch portion. I walked out stuffed and ready to pop!DRUNKEN NOODLES Spice level 10 my bestie Karen loved it!BLACK SWEET ICED TEATHAI ICED TEAI am going to try something different each time, will be hard as I have loved everything I have had so far!This is one of those places you could close your eyes and point to the menu and just go with whatever your finger lands on and know it will be great!The service just as fantastic as the first time! Incredible!I attached pictures from this visit as well.Indeed I did it again! Lunch this time for my 3rd visit :)Lunch special menu item $6.50BBQ PORK SPARE RIBS w/fried riceYep Yep...delicious as always!Mmmmm yummy yummy. Lip and finger licking good, almost had another mouth orgasm, I was sooooooo close!Black sweet iced tea, I swear must have had 5 refills this time.Service amazing as always!My first and last time eating at Thai Original BBQ.  Oooooh, how dramatic!  I bet you can't wait to see what disaster I incurred!   Well, none.  I got the right food that I ordered, it was close enough to being available at the time promised, and the service and price were fine.   No, the reason I won't be back is that compared to all of the other quality Thai offerings Vegas has to offer, it simply wasn't good enough.  I will be the first to admit that Thai BBQ is suffering the affect of being the ~21st Thai restaurant I've tried here in Las Vegas, many of which are outstanding in every aspect.  I can't help but compare any new Thai restaurant to class acts such as Weera Thai or Prommares, neither of which is exceptionally far from this location of Thai BBQ.   All that being said, let's get to it:I called in my order of a Chili Chicken lunch special because it seemed closest to what I normally order when I get Thai and also because of the lovely photo uploaded of the same dish in the photos here.  No seriously, look at this beautiful dish:  http://s3-media2.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/IBxLi-C_it0Rm-m6N0TQDg/l.jpg     I was told it'd be ready in 15 minutes and I arrived probably a few minutes beyond that.Upon entering it took a few minutes for the solitary server to get my order.  It wasn't an extremely long wait and she did seem very busy waiting actual tables so it didn't bother me.  If she was on her phone using snapchat or tumblr or sextor or whatever new app the kids use nowadays, I'd be a little more bothered by this.  Got back to my office and was a little disappointed in a few things.  1) That pic I posted above?  Mine looked nothing like that.  The chicken was chopped up sloppily and not beautifully ground up as you see above.  It was like going to Wendy's and expecting to get that 99 cent burger that can barely fit in Wendy's mouth on the commercial, only to receive one that your pet hamster can gobble in one bite.  2) No eggroll.   As a matter of fact, there was nothing but the chicken dish and the rice.  Now nothing extra was promised or advertised, but it seems pretty customary for most Thai restaurants to provide SOMETHING with the lunch special besides the discount.  If anything it adds a little value that I could have used after being charged $2 for my brown rice upgrade.   The food that WAS provided, tasted okay, but not great.  The rice seemed a little mushier than I prefer, and as I mentioned before the chicken was pretty haphazardly chopped up.   Sorry Thai BBQ, that ultimately winds up being worth 2 stars.  If you'd have gotten to me a year ago, you probably would have eeked out a 3.  Where's Doc Brown when you need him?
El Pollo Loco=For fast food, this place hits it out of the park. First off, the counter space, drink station and salsa bar are always clean. Service is prompt and courteous. As you might guess, (el POLLO loco) their specialty is chicken - "flame grilled," though I've never looked for the flames, personally. They offer all kinds of applications from whole chickens (wings, thighs, legs, etc.) to sandwiches, to tacos, burritos and salads. Heads up: the street tacos are TINY. The burritos are dense (loaded with beans, rice and cheese). Today, I tried the new jalapeno chicken sandwich. It was good but lots of condiments: jalapenos, pepper jack cheese, southwest sauce, lettuce and pico de gallo that distracted from the chicken. Interesting bread - like a hybrid between cibatta and a Wonder bun. They boast a citrus-marinade which they also use on their beef. I don't know that I've ever tried their beef though... the chicken is moist and flavorful. Maybe, one day, I'll mix it up a bit!Another cool thing about this place is: there are numerous options for combo "sides" including beans and rice but als fries, corn on the cob and mac and cheese and more!I'm surprised I had never eaten at El Pollo Loco.  But Jeff Lewis seems pretty fond of it, either that or El Pollo Loco pays him extreme amounts of money to eat it on the show.  And I LOVE that show, so I thought I might love El Pollo Loco, too.I went with the twice grilled chicken burrito, not sure if the twice grilled part referred to grilling the chicken twice or grilling the chicken once and then grilling the burrito.  It was the latter.  Anywho, filled with chicken breast, pico, sour cream, guac, and a little cheese, it was quite tasty, and probably pretty healthy wouldn't you think?  I like that you get a little bag of tortilla chips with your order.  Also sampled the black beans, but they were a barbeque bean, not my thing.It was fun to see strawberry soda on the fountain, too, which I had to have, much to my husband's horror.  This from the man who drinks orange soda routinely.  The restaurant was reasonably clean, but my shoes stuck to the floor, perhaps from someone else's sickeningly sweet strawberry soda.  It was a nice change to have your order brought to the table.  I hate the lingering at the counter you get at most fast food restaurants.Too bad my somewhat healthy burrito had 796 calories, and 39g of fat.  While I might return to El Pollo Loco if convenient, I wouldn't go out of my way for that kind of nutrition.  I would opt for a (insert name)berto burrito instead.And BTW, you can catch the new season of Flipping Out Tuesdays on Bravo.  Now that's useful information!
Oink=Need meat? Go to Oink!It was -1C outside, I could no longer feel my fingers, and my tummy was a-rumbling. I was on George Street but none of the cutsey cafes or restaurants were floating my boat. I knew what I wanted. Hot pig onna roll, with chilli sauce.I had heard of Oink before, through Yelp, and it was HIGH on my 'must try' list. So I took the extra 15 minute walk just to get here. I was not disappointed.As all the other reviewers have said, this is simple and does exactly what it says in the tin - or is on show in the window. Pork, slow roasted, inna roll with a few optional extras: haggis or sage stuffing; chilli or apple sauce; small, medium or large. Done, done and done.It's simply amazing. Hot pork, fresh from the pig (literally, it's in the window in all its tasty, crackling glory) on a fresh roll. Simple Scottish fare, no frills, but delicious.Sorry, there are no veggie options. Also, if you get squeamish about seeing the animal you're actually eating, it might not work. I am a self-confessed food snob. I don't like wasting my pennies or tummy-space on mediocre fare, and usually I'm a deli, fancy schmancy type. But whilst this is simple, it is very, very good. Although probably not for my arteries.Oh, quick note, there are no toilets when you sit in. Worth knowing.As tasty as the piggy looks from the outside, I wasn't too impressed with my oink sandwich. I ordered mine with BBQ sauce and after taking the first bite, I found the meat to be dry. I quickly asked for more sauce. You know it can't be that good if I'm asking for more sauce to make it taste better. In addition to the dryness, the meat was room temperature. I guess this is how they're served, but I would've preferred mine to be hot. Other than my not so special sandwich, the shop is cute since it's on a lovely street just off The Royal Mile. The workers weren't particularly friendly, but nice enough to serve me my sandwich. Some people love it, I just wasn't a fan...Well ...........................Oinky goodess in a bap!!!I went here a good few months ago, and I loved it !! How pllued pork has taken off and it is soo tasty. This little place is great for meat craving. We got a pulled pork roll with stuffing and we managed to grab a little seat next to the window and chomp chomp. Its not the fancied of places, infact id say that its more of a takeaway, grab and go styleee. Definatley worth trying and great value for money.
Skybox Sports Bar & Grill=I've been a Las Vegas local for 35 years. I rarely go to The Strip and now I remember why!We politely declined the server's offer for another round of drinks. At which time, she told us that if we didn't spend another $10 per person, we would have to leave.I was OK with the fact that they had a $10 per person / per hour beverage minimum. I wasn't OK with the waitress telling me (3-minutes after I paid my bill): "you've already paid, so you can't just sit here....we have people waiting for tables". I was completely stunned! We had not even finished our drinks. For the record, there was no one waiting in line.As for the food, mediocre at best! As for the service, Josie G's face might have cracked if she smiled. This is an overflow restaurant. A place where diners go to eat when there are no other restaurants/seats available. My suggestion: if The Skybox is the only seat in the house, WAIT UNTIL ANOTHER SEAT OPENS!
Yimmy's Deli=Yimmy's is truly a delight. Yimmy's was one of those establishments that I just bustled past work day after work day. Until a lovely co-worker of mine invited me to join her there for lunch one day and off I went.  I did not know ahead of time what a pleasantly filling and hearty lunch I was in for. Yimmy's is a true hole in the way on the ground floor of a busy office space. It's located on Smithfield. On the inside there are two tiny tables that just barely fit inside of the restaurant. I am no sandwich girl so I played it safe and opted for a ham and cheese.  This sandwich knocked my socks off. It was piled high with salty chipped ham and two thick slices of American cheese, freshe romanie lettuce , tomato and just the right amount of mayo, with a pickle spear. Thanks Yimmy's you make a mean sandwich that left me well fed and happy for the rest of the day.
Wendy's=Well, that girl we all know that is "Always Fresh" and "Always Juicy" is hanging out here at Terminal 2 at Sky Harbor Airport. (Isn't that conflicting images? Just Sayin'!)No, she isn't waiting to meet a Pilot sugar daddy. She is here to give him some of her hot goodness. Dave's little girl is all grown up now, even though she still has freckles and pigtails. Of course I am talking about Wendy. Who did you think I was talking about?When I lived here in the Valley of the Sun 6 years ago, this Terminal was pretty sad, old and tired. But they have done their best to update it, and add more fast food choices, like Wendy's. I haven't tasted Wendy's Hot and Juicy offerings in a long time. They now have many breakfast combos including an attempted upscale sausage egg melt panini. They also have what the military would call S.O.S, or commonly known as "Sh*t On a Shingle" (Creamed chipped beef on toast). But here it is on their biscuit, true to there southern image, although I believe their HQ is in suburban Ohio. They have several SOS type options, including sausage and chicken.I tried the $4.59 2 sausage and egg burrito combo. It sounds like a great deal until you realize  that the burritos are about the size of a Milky Way bar. Still, like Wendy, they were Fresh and Juicy.This used to be an A-OK restaurant when they first opened. Who doesn't like a square burger and have it cooked to order?Been coming here on and off since day ONE. Usually the food is pretty tolerable and it gets me to my next location - Wally World. Just park the car in the middle of the parking lot and you only have to get out of the car once.This location seems to always be a little tricky. The French Fries are normally cold and we have to go up and ask for some fresh ones. The Burgers and Chicken Sandwiches are not too bad depending on the roll of the dice and whether it is a full moon or not.Service is rather poor and the inside could probably use a makeover. Today they asked me for my name and somehow they interpreted (Mark) for Bark. Could this just have been a Freudian slip or are we making Dog noises at me?It almost seems that ever since the famous Dave Thomas left the picture this place has just gone downhill in general. Plus we miss the old lady with the white hair in the commercials. Ok ... WHERE"S THE BEEF?2.25 STARS
Jacs Dining and Tap House=Yeah doggie, doggie. This is what I'm talking 'bout Madison. Food. Service. Atmosphere. Check. Check. Check. I had the opportunity to whisk Elites Bob S and Scrantz outta their home while they are without kitchen and met them down the street for my first jac attack. I dug it. Lots. First off without even asking the waitress let me know I could try any beer I wanted (it's like she saw the indecisiveness coming outta my pores). She grabbed a taste of Oso;s Hop Whoopin' which on tap is pretty spectacular. Not as hoppy as I thought (score, as I'm just learning to embrace bitter... I'm a naturally cheery person) with grapefruit notes (my fave of the round citrus). For din din I went with the fried cod (3rd week in a row I've had fish fry) and I have to tell you, it was one of the best I've had. For frozen, battered deep fried cod, it was pretty darn flaky. You can get potatoes pancakes alongside but I opted for frites and I'm glad I did. They're seasoned really nicely and served hot... like frites should be. (If you get the Mussels which Bob did, frites are served in this cornucopia like contraption that makes it look like they go on for daaaaaaays. Easy sharing!) Scrantz had a roasted veggie salad with an amazing smoked salmon atop. So much smoky flavor in the bite she shared with me. All in all I was quite pleased with my first trip and can't wait to go back to try more of the menu. (It's probably no coincidence that my favorite restaurant in Tucson... old stomping grounds... is Jax!)I had been wanting to try this place for a long time and this weekend was finally able to do so. It's seriously so good. I can't wait until my next visit. Honestly thank god I don't live within walking distance because I'd be broke.They don't take reservations, but we called on our way there and the host said he had a table for 2 if we got there within 15 minutes. We did, and sure enough our table was waiting for us (awesome). We started off with a beer and cider for me, and could tell right from the get-go that the service was going to be stellar. And it was throughout our dinner.We had the almond stuffed dates as an appetizer and they were absolutely phenomenal. Best thing I've eaten in a very long time. We then split the roasted beet salad and pheasant flatbread (gluten free). Both were divine. I was particularly impressed with how yummy the gluten free flatbread was, it was clear that it was homemade. The entrees might be a little pricey, but it's so worth it. Best meal I've had in quite some time, and even my mom agreed. I cannot wait to come back!We stopped by for happy hour. The bloody marys were average at best. The bartender was an exquisite jerk. Rude, negligent, and brusque, he charged us full price for our drinks, and after we pointed out that it was happy hour, he stated "oh yeah, the only reason you're here." We didn't eat anything, so I'd feel bad totally slamming the place, but man, get your service mentality together guys. That was just bad.
The Keg Steakhouse + Bar - Montreal=Had a delicious steak and strong drink with the wife. The salad was tasty (a bit heavy on the dressing) but the calamari was on point. Would definitely go back again as it was worth the cost.This was my first time eating at this location in the Old City, I had previously eaten at their downtown location several years back so I new what to expect, or did I? For a starter I ordered escargot stuffed mushroom caps with garlic herb butter which I have had in countless locations but nothing like this, the mushrooms and snails worked perfectly together and the garlic butter herbs was more of a rich emulsion, thick, decadent and a flavor that will have you swooning. My Salad was mixed field greens, garden vegetables with a vinaigrette and I asked for goat cheese and walnuts. The dressing didn't have quite enough vinegar for me but I had a lemon wedge from my water which took care of that, still and all, it was a wonderful fresh nicely presented green salad. The Keg is known for it's Canadian beef, especially It's Baseball Cut Top Sirloin which I had not had before, so I ordered it cooked rare with garlic mashed potatoes and green beans. This cut of meat is so thick it can only be guaranteed rare or a medium rare without burning the out side, so don't try to order it any other way. It was cooked to a perfect rare with all the tenderness of a Filet Mignon and the wonderful intense beefy flavor of a sirloin. The garlic mashed potatoes were perfect along with the green beans. This was a very good steak dinner and the escargot...well you will have to go and see for yourself because words are woefully inadequate to describe this rich garlicky buttery herb flavored delightful escargot preparation!!!
Tasty House Chinese Restaurant=3 1/2 starsIf I may I'd like to begin using a new phrase: Hole-In-The-Strip-MallThese are little hole-in-the-wall establishments -- no,... joints -- that come in and set up shop in an empty pad at a strip mall without really remodeling beyond cleaning up a bit and hanging some thing on the walls.Tasty House is a brand spanking new Hole-In-The-Strip-Mall occupying the carcass formerly known as Panda King Express at about 15th Avenue on Bell Rd in the glorious NoPho wastelands.They offered a quick, friendly greeting and a huge menu of fresh-cooked ameri-chino fast food.  A large selection of Lunch Specials for $4.95 caught my eye, coming with your choice of steamed or fried rice, and choice of egg roll, drink, or soup (choice of egg drop, hot&sour, or wonton).Get the idea there are lots of choices here?  This is no terriyaki bowl assembly line; they've got just about every imaginable combination of vegetables, tofu, chicken, pork, beef, shrimp, and even offer Duck.I sat and she brought out the food after several minutes, hot and steamy.  The plate had a scoop of rice in a corner, and the rest was FILLED with my General Tso's Chicken -- seriously a ratio of about 80% meat.  She said that if I wanted any more rice or soup to just let her know.    8^ )   Great service!My first experience with the new Tasty House was tasty, indeed.  I believe the wonton soup was about tops that I've had, with no skimping on wonton, meat, onion/scallion bits, or especially flavor.I let them know that since they offer plenty of choices for non-spicy chicken (S&S, lemon, orange, pineapple) that they could notch up the spiciness on their General Tso's a bit.I will return to Tasty House, despite their bleak location, whether they pretty it up or not.  As long as the quality, portions, and flavor I had remain consistent this could become a four star regular cheap lunch for me, but if they did pretty up the digs, I'm sure a lot of others would feel that way, too.A hole in the wall Chinese fast food spot with some "tasty" options. Tofu dishes for veggie heads too!Ryan C described this place perfectly, so check out his review ( http://www.yelp.com/biz/tasty-house-chinese-restaurant-phoenix#hrid:dPH4TU9Ys-04gmbkYPj5Yg ) to get a good picture of what this place is like.I dropped in for lunch today and was also impressed by the $5 lunch specials. Unfortunately, they had zero tofu dishes available on the lunch special menu (there are 3 or so tofu dishes on the dinner menu). I inquired about this fact and they hooked me up with a custom tofu dish lunch special deal! Now that's good customer service!I got the tofu with vegetables dish, which is some tasty thinly sliced tofu, deep fried and doused in a ameri-chino sauce. A selection of vegetables is also tossed in, with white rice and a veggie eggroll finishing off the dish. All this for $5.XX! Noice!I really dug their tofu dish and the low prices. I'll be back to try their other offerings.Tasty House has 4 reviews -- two of which have been chosen as ROTD on separate occasions.They may have gotten lucky with the infamous yelp algorithm, but they really do deserve it.4.5 stars   ( even for a Hole-In-The-Strip-Mall )The quality, portion, and price all combine together in a trifecta of value.They are really friendly, ingredients are always fresh, and the food really is tasty!Fried/Steamed dumplings is a new favorite.  They are thicker and more doughy, like dim sum -- and delicious!
Don Tortaco Mexican Grill=Looking for some late night grub, we stumbled across this taco shop chain on Blue Diamond.  The employees seem a little tired or lifeless, but what do you expect at a 24-hour joint!  Regardless, we were content after our meal, and had a great morning sleep.Out of all the items we ordered, my least favorite...even though I devoured the whole thing...was the taco de lengua.  Tongue lacked some flavor and wasn't tender enough. The taco was bigger (in size and cost) than what I'm used to.   Their chicken taco (crunchy shell) was a lot better....with a peppery taste and loads of cheese.  The Horchata was just okay for me...I had better.  But why complain when the Mexican drinks are bottomless like the other fountain drinks!?My favorite was the Carne Asada nachos, with a mountain of flavorful asada, cheese, cilantro, tomatoes, guacamole, and beans (we opted for no sour cream).  It was so good (and greasy), we ended up ordering another "mountain" to go.  Up next....Carne Asada Fries!
Sagos Baja Tavern & Lounge=A new benchmark has been set for pubs in Las Vegas. In my initial review, I praised the amazing service and exceptionally friendly atmosphere of this hidden little gem on the western edge of town, but I also mentioned that the food was nothing to get excited about.Well that has all changed with Sagos new menu. I have two words - GREAT JOB!Moving the menu closer to the restaurants Baja theme, management has introduced a completely new menu filled with some great selections like fish and shrimp tacos, homemade pizza, a delicious chicken avocado sandwich, a new twist on the BLT with a tomato jelly that rocks and much more.If you go, and you will, you have to try the Ceviche - cradled in what looked like a sea-shell shaped crisp flour tortilla, the taste is fabulous and the serving size to price ratio will fill you up but still make you want to order another.Way to go Sagos, you guys have hit all the marks now - great food, great service, great atmosphere. I'll be there - soon.If a bar offers match play, we're there.  The reviews certainly didn't hurt the place either.  They had a "text and receive $20 match play" but they informed us it took 24 hours to put it on a player's card so we would get it the next time we came.  That's a lock for repeat business.  We also had a restaurant.com coupon but it wasn't necessary during happy hour since all drinks were $2 and appetizers were half off.  Everything is full price if you use the coupon.  We ended up ordering chicken fingers, chicken fajitas and the carne asada tacos.  Everything was just OK.  I didn't really like the tacos since the salsa was already put on them and the beef was kinda cold.Wednesday night was insane.  All the regulars were there for the video poker drawings they do so if you're planning to play, avoid Wednesday between 5pm and 8:30pm.  You will not get a seat at the bar.  The staff was friendly and attentive.   Went back again last week on a Tuesday to redeem the free play and got a plate of the carne asada nachos which were better than what we ate before.  All the patrons sure love their slots and everyone knows everyone else for the most part.  The restaurant area was dead both times but I imagine it would be packed for certain sports events since the TV's are decent.  The football deals sound sweet so maybe we'll try that in the fall.  They also just sent us another $20 match play in the mail along with a bogo entree coupon for signing up for their slot club.  I guess we're going back!
Café Cravings=I wish so much that I could give this 5 stars!  I wish so much I could sit and work here for hours!  I wish so much... that they had internet!  That's the whomp, whomp moment right there...The cafe is adorable, set inside the beautiful Chatham Village.  Chatham Village in Mt. W is like this little Victorian colony of townhouses that you would never imagine are hidden up there.  But they're there.  And the residents are lucky enough to enjoy this adorable little coffee house right next door.But it's so much more than a coffee house.  They have a huge menu full of lunch offerings besides the drink menu.  The drink menu alone is impressive for a small, hidden cafe.  I ordered the roast beef panini with horsey sauce.  It was tasty and came with chips and a little bowl of oranges.  At $7, it was a steal!  Living up here I'd make this my go to meeting and work spot but it doesn't have wireless internet.  I hate to be a spoiled Millennials (okay, I'm barely that), but that's kinda annoying.  Maybe it's just that environment where it's not necessarily needed.  Don't know.  But I'll be back for a quick bite with friends fo sho!
Vivace=I think this is one of my favorite places to be on a warm summer night.  I love to sit outside and gaze at all the twinklies....it is the most beautiful view of the city.  My man and I like to sit upstairs in the lounge area.  The bartenders are great.  The service is spot on.  Their food is really good too.  We always get the cheese tray, it has the best selection of cheeses and sweet touches like honey and fig marmalade.  I am a huge tapas fan so we typically get a bunch of appetizers and split them.  They have a nice wine selection and it is reasonably priced.  This place is really sexy.  Check it out.Can you say scrumptious?  Man, this place is what's up!  I mean seriously!  It's something about Italian food that makes me weak....I just love it.....but this place is just on another level.  Everything is fresh and homemade pasta.......homemade pasta?  Who does that?  Certainly none of the Italian spots I've been to.  All I can say is I hope this place is around for a very long time because I am in food love!I'll get to the food in a sec, but I was digging the plush dining upstairs and the incredible view of the qc.  They have tables and sofa's outside on both levels so I imagine it gets very lively in the summer.They start you off with bread and a bean spread that my 4 year old loved(I swear the kid will eat anything:-) The brushetta had a shrimp salad topping instead of the normal tomato mix, and it had a bit of a pepper kick to it, but it was good.  The bolognese and the smoked chicken and spinach agnolotti was some of the best Italian food I ever eaten.....ever!  I mean change your facial expression with every bite good!  Let's keep this place in business......for my own selfish reasons:-)A Vivace Tale...A long, long time ago... there was a date night.... And it went a lil like this...Well, wasn't the best experience for a restaurant, but the positives...  The waiter was very attentive.  I think I drank about a gallon of water before we got our appetizer, which was the eggplant dip (Perfect)   He also offered a GREAT wine which complimented the meal very well!  I try for a vegan diet, which can be hard if you don't call ahead, so the options here are extremely limited, I got a cheese-less pizza ( a fail-safe at any Italian establishment) and it was more of a tasteless one.  But the company was good :)  If you make a reservation, ask for a table that's separate from the wall or not along the windows.  Awkward Turtle moment when you have to move someones purse to get to your seat on the bench as they managed to cram an extra table in.  If you get stuck at one of those tables, be prepared to have little privacy and be involved in a myriad of conversations that are going on around you.THEY GET A 4!  So, this is an update to an earlier review, I was contacted by a few of the customer service reps and they insisted we try it again!  So, they get a star for wanting to impress us!  I'm in!  LOL, so I will definitely update this soon!  Vivace is trying for a FIVE star, and I'm looking forward to it!Once upon a giftcard...So, thanks to an attentive management staff, we tried Vivace again... SCORE!  It was amazing!  We took the suggestion of wine and was without a doubt, right on point!   The chef prepared a 3 course vegan meal and it was A-Maze-Ing, I got lost in the flavors!  YUM!  The appetizer was a variation of Bruscetta that was made very decadently with butternut squash and flavored with vinaigrette.  Mouth waterin' good! :)  On to the main course, was a great hodge podge of arugula, shrooms, squash, broccoli and many more that I can't remember... Let's just say I got my servings in that day!  The flavor was awesome.  dessert was really done very well as well, with apples and cinnamon in a flaky pizza dough wrap topped with raspberry syrup and powdered sugar!  Welll, hheeelllooooo there!!! Great job Vivace, we shall return, And they lived happily ever after!:-P**Gem Alert**I have found another rare delight in Charlotte. This restaurant is right outside of Uptown but worth the travel. It begins with a perfect ambiance that is extremely complimentary to an all around delightful dining experience. You are able to bring your own bottle of wine and that truly helps keep your check in check. They prepare all the pasta on site and it is deliciously fresh. We started off with the mussels appetizer and we couldn't get enough. So many mussels!! And the sauce is the kind that you need to soak up every last drop with the bread. Which we did! For my entrée, I order the Smoked Chicken and Spinach Stuffed Angolini.. MMMMMmmmmmmmmm (see picture).. It was superb. My wife ordered some shrimp and pasta dish that I didn't try because my face was glued to my plate (See 2nd pic). I wish I went a little slower and enjoyed it more, but that is what the second trip is for. Right? I obviously recommend this restaurant and suggest you put it high on your list of places to try in the area.Helpful Facts:* Free valet parking* Great bar are if you have to wait* Huge wine selection if you don't want to byob/byow* Excellent service and knowledgeable staffEnjoy!-Ian M.Oh, Vivace. I had long wondered why I was never a huge fan of Italian cuisine. Too many experiences of overly-filled plates of pasta with heavy, sweet sauce I suppose. My negative streak was meant to be broken here! Vivace has tuned my palate to the finer side of Italian eating. These guys have a killer location in Metro and their space is coveted by many. Juxtaposition alone lands them a whopping high-five. Hello, greenway and view of Uptown. Little did I know before my visit. We stumbled in on a lazy afternoon for a 3:30pm lunch. Perfect timing for a quiet meal on the patio. We had one of their over-sized umbrellas all to our selves with a glorious Uptown backdrop. We weren't even aiming for romantic but it comes standard on the patio. Huge fan.Our server was very helpful and knowledgeable with the menu. Took into account the weather (rather hot) and recommended some refreshing appetizers and drinks. Greatly appreciated his recommendations. I ordered a Limon Cello. Fresh lime juice, triple sec and soda water. Here's the breakdown on the "Cellos." Not an instrument. Nay. In fact, there are several choices and all made from fresh fruits and juices in house. Quite impressive and the freshness doesn't lie. Apps: Bruschetta. Holy wow. This is the best bruschetta I've had in the Queen City to date. Perfectly balanced with fresh bread, sweetness and fresh basil. The tomatoes are smoked in house. Yes, I said smoked. The flavor is incredible. Comes with six 1-2 bite pieces. Each should be savored and perhaps taken from your fellow diners if they aren't paying attention. I was tempted to lick the plate. Incredible flavors swirling on each crostini of joy. Cheese Plate. Man. What a treasure trove. We chose all 6 cheeses to try. Served on a woodblock with bread, honey, an apricot marmalade and a cranberry chutney-ish jam. Each cheese had it's own interesting note. Spicy, sweet, fermented, strong, mild and so on. No combination was incorrect with the jams and honey. I'd get this again in a heartbeat. Entree-ish: Prosciutto di Parma pizza. The dough was thin, chewy and served as a perfect catalyst for the rest of the flavors. Fig spread, Gorgonzola and arugula danced very lightly on my palate and complimented one another nicely. This pizza was great. The proscuitto was only on half since my wife is a vegetarian but it was great. Mild and salty like it should be. Dessert: Pistachio gelato. Creamy and choc a boc filled with pistachio pieces. Served with a biscotti. I only wish there had been a few more pieces of biscotti since it worked so well with the gelato. So glad to have tried Vivace finally. Looking forward to heading back in the near future for a further look into their pizzas and greater entree selection. Cheers! (or, Ciao!)I don't know why but Italian restaurants have never been on my go-to list when it comes to dining out. I think it was the result of dining at too many Italian restaurants that hardly impressed - heck, I could cook Italian better than that.BUT I'm a big fan of Vivace. It's Italian cuisine on a whole different level: refined and delicious! I've been to Vivace a couple of times before and I liked it - but we're rarely near Midtown so we hardly make it in. Big mistake. We need to make into Vivace on a regular basis!We arrived on Friday evening after work and were seated in a booth with a great view of their open kitchen. I love seeing all the action in the kitchen. The chef was nice enough to send out an amuse bouche of a perfectly seared scallop with olive oil.  It was a perfect bite. After looking over the menu - everything sounded so awesome - my husband and I decided to start with the fried calamari. It was crispy and tender at the same time.  Perfect calamari.For my dinner, I ordered the primi of the pappardelle bolongnese with goat cheese crema and a big bowl of mussels!  My husband ordered the larger size of the risotto with crab and corn. When my pappardelle came out, our server brought out another dish of their special homemade pasta with squash, squash blossoms, and sea urchin butter for my husband because the chef didn't want him to be without a plate. Super classy chef! Now, when I heard sea urchin, I perked up, my hubby, on the other hand, looked terrified. But he ate all of it and is no longer a sea urchin virgin!  I also cleaned my plate of pappardelle :)At this point we were getting full and wondered how we were going to get through our entrees. But when our entrees arrived, feelings of fullness were pushed aside and we dug in.  My mussels were perfect (I know, I say perfect a lot) but they were. A savory broth with the sweet tender, mussel meat. My hubby's risotto was perfect (again!) - I snagged a bite and declared that I was going to order the risotto next time. You're probably thinking we passed on dessert but when we heard that they were rolling out their new dessert menu we had to try something! Something turned out to be 4 desserts: Cinnamon sugar focaccia with honey, marscarpone cheesecake with a homemade graham cracker crust, chocolate bomba with ice cream and a cherry inside, and espresso ice cream with cherries. OMG - I loved every one of these desserts. The focaccia was light and airy, the cheesecake had a wonderful texture, the bomba was decadent, and the ice cream was was rich and creamy.Needless to say, we were stuffed. Our server was great, she was super attentive and very knowledgeable of the menu. The restaurant is beautiful and I love the modern decor. Vivace changed my thinking when it came to restaurants serving Italian cuisine. They've done it so right that they have ruined me for any other Italian restaurant. We'll definitely be back.I recently attended an event in their private upstairs dining space. This space is FANTASTIC for private events, small receptions, or even (hint, hint), holiday functions! It has a private and fully-stocked bar, a large space that can be appointed to seat a fair number of guests (or, set up for over 100 if you do hors d'oeuvres (lighter food far, antipasto, appetizers...). Additionally, there is a beautiful (really nice!) private terrace/balcony up there. I was able to meet the event manager David, and he was delightful. I'll try to remember to upload a picture of his card. He was very bright-eyed-and-bushy-tailed, and super friendly. The way they do events is quite simple, and reasonable... you don't have to pay a deposit, instead, you simply sign a contract committing to rent the space, and have a minimum to spend on food/bev. So if you want to have a sit down dinner with x guests, he'll just work with you and say we just need you to spend at least $x on food and beverage. I'll add, this is exactly how we've done it at Ruth's Chris and other CLT establishments for my holiday parties. You also have the option of setting a specific menu, going a la cart, or, picking what apps/etc you want set out or passed. They'll work with you. Also, they have complimentary valet (don't forget to tip!). This is a MUST for any restaurant in Charlotte. While there is a free and close parking deck, I prefer the convenience of pulling up and letting someone else worry about finding a spot. :) Plus, (random factoid), they're next to Trader Joes - so you can stock up on that oh-so-delicious Cookie Butter. Dang it, now I want Cookie Butter. I digress...The particular event I went to only had hors d'oeuvres, which simply means I didn't get a chance to try their entrees or pastas (which I would have liked to try). Oh well, it gives me a goal next time I'm there. So what did I try? I first had what the waiter said was blue cheese stuffed fig. Errr... I like fig, and I love blue (or any kind of funky-) cheese, but I was not a fan of this. But, don't let that discourage you because many of my fellow guests did seem to enjoy it. For me, the ratio of bold cheese (really bold!) to fig was off. Dare I say, too much cheese? GASP! I said it... oh well. (Though, really, you can't ever have too much cheese... or bacon.) Darn, I'm off track again. Ok... where was I? Oh yes, hors d'oeuvres. They had oodles of olives (that's fun to say... try saying it 10 times fast!). The olives were fresh, flavorful and diverse. Yum! They also had blue cheese stuffed olives, which I enjoyed! Of course, you have to appreciate both olives and blue cheese - if you do, this would be a treat. We had a huge antipasto platter to pull from. It had an olive spread (almost like a tapenade meets hummus), which was good on their pita-breads. They had an assortment of quality meats (spicy and yummy salami and pepperoni), and even better quality cheeses on the platter. Now, the show stopper for the night was the cheesy fried risotto balls. Let me be clear, if you dine here (event of not), you MUST ORDER THESE! Delicious and perfectly balanced. They went very quickly, and despite the lovely staff hustling to refill them, they would run out many times before the platter made it to the table. That good!Lastly, I cannot forget to comment on the drinks. They had VERY STIFF drinks (read: strong). This I actually think is an upsell... I had trouble drinking my mixed drink, but generally, when I pay the market rate for a mixed drink, I want value in the booze-to-mix ratio. This place has it down! Of course, they have a great assortment of wine and beer as well.So, while I can't comment on the traditional dining service, or the heavier entrees, I do recommend Vivace based on my experiences here. Great location, easy to get to, valet parking, and quality ingredients in a modern-but-sleek restaurant.
Dillon's=Caribbean, mon!Some water in the desert.Get the chili dog!Dillon's is a chain down in Arizona.  BBQ is their specialty.  Kind of like the Famous Dave's of the Southwest.  Have been to the Glendale location in the past.  Solid.  This place brings it to another level.  Situated on Lake Pleasant, just outside of old timers land in NW Phoenix burbs. They have a vernicular to get you down to the Lake? How cool is that? I am sure that I will appreciate that in my later ages when I retire down there in my golden years.  Look at the old guy getting busy!:http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dillons-morristown?select=wkEu8lVCFfLLd9oek0jHqA#wkEu8lVCFfLLd9oek0jHqAAnyways, their chili dog is out of this world.  See my picture.  Comes on a hamburger bun with two sliced dogs, topped with cheese and jalapenos and BBQ pulled pork.  Just died and went to heaven.  Gives the Gopher Bar a run for its money. 4.99999!
Dolce Espresso Video Coffee Bar=Chai!  After days of thinking about it, I finally had chai.  I feel really guilty that I hadn't been here before, since I can literally walk here.  Comfy couches, lots of tables!  One even had a gigantic checkers game on it.  Three huge video screens on the wall.  I'm not sure what mood the owner was in last night, but it was all Madonna (yeah, bitches!), Shakira and Britney videos.  OMG she did a remake of "I Love Rock n Roll" which really pisses me off.  *grumble*Anyway, they have a pretty big menu.  Their hours are awesome:  They're open till midnight during the week and 24/7 on weekends.   FTW!  Now I know I have somewhere to go late at night for a hunk of cheesecake.This place needs some decor.  I mean, the pointsettia was nice and all, but what happens after Xmas?  Walls are bare except for the screens playing girl-pop.  They make all their own desserts (except for the muffins) and have a large coffee/tea menu.  I'll be back.  If I see that Britney video again, though, I will slay kittens.
Cafe China=If you are in the Glendale/northwest Phoenix area and are craving good Chinese food, this is the place to go. The restaurant is very clean and nicely appointed, and the staff is very friendly. A quick glance at the prices in the menu will immediately tell you that  your dining experience will be very easy on the wallet. The quality of the food is definitely above that of most of the Chinese restaurants in this area of the Valley. Since I'm often in this area, often hungry, and often craving good Chinese food and have a limited budget,  I believe I've found a new favorite dining spot.
The Living Room=We (me and husband) are pretty happy with the location of this new wine bar, since it's within bike-riding distance from our house. The decor is nice, cool patio with couches, full bar and a nice little menu. We met some friends there last Friday night thinking it would be semi-quiet since it just opened, but it was pretty busy, not complaining, I'm happy places around here are busy. The only thing is it was packed with cougars, cougars acting like 20-year-olds, so not really our thing. But maybe it will calm down after it's open a little longer, crossing our fingers, we really wanted to like this place.02/04/10Happy hour w/ Violeta.  Loved the furniture (dark wood and slightly reminiscent of old Mission churches or Spanish villas that one may find back home- I'm from the Philippines), and the ambience.  I liked how the doors/paneling opened up to a patio- it was a little chilly that afternoon, but I imagine that w/ the perfect weather we have now, happy hour at TLR would FEEL nice.  What I did not like about the LR is that it was NOISY.  Now, I didn't mind so much that the music selections were eclectic (country to jazz to classic rock, and even Motown); After all, we were AT The Living Room, and, as in different households, one can find different music playing.  No, it was just too noisy.  I'd hate to imagine what conversing would be like if the doors opening up to the patio were closed...  What I also noticed was that while there were smatterings of all age groups (there were even children running around in the patio!), most of the people there were in their mid-40s to mid-50s.  I usually check out happy hours at restaurants for the food offered, and not to meet potential love interests, and this venue would definitely be somewhere I'd just go for the food MYSELF.  I can't even picture being able to do some work on my laptop here... maybe it'll be different in a few months?Service was a little bit lacking, but the place was packed!  A chair was even taken from our table (I didn't mind, but I think V. did, since she was keeping her fingers crossed that her hubby would join us).  As for the food, we were going to keep it light by ordering bruschetta.  (I knew that TLR was affiliated w/ Scottsdale's 5th & Wine, and I had tried and enjoyed the bruschetta there.)  The bread pieces here were sliced much thicker than those at 5th, and while they may have reminded me of Postino's bruschetta, the flavors, while good enough that I enjoyed the dish, made me wish I was at Postino's, or even at 5th & Wine.  Especially when it was so noisy we had to raise our voices to hear each other; Violeta wasn't enjoying the music; and children were running around not two feet away from me.I would like to give TLR another chance, and hopefully, my guests and I will find a younger crowd (no children present, please!) to enjoy the ambience, music, and food with.Don't ask my why, but I was pleasantly surprised and not expecting to find a place like the Living Room hidden on Queen Creek Road. But, I'm happy to see that it exists! When I arrived, the exterior looked like a winery and should have been surrounded by grapevines instead of parked cars. I walked through the entry of large wooden doors and to the left drinkers lounged in an open bar area while restaurateurs ate in the surrounding tables. The atmosphere was cozy and true to a wino's environment with dark wood and wine everywhere. The restaurant was surrounded by a patio equipped with my favorite: fire places! Since it was a cold night, a fire place was a perfect touch. At first it seemed like we were under dressed for the atmosphere, but after looking around in more depth, I noticed that people were dressed in everything from Scottsdale bar goer clothes to jeans and t-shirts. So I came to the conclusion that like more places in AZ, any attire goes as long as your clothed. The food was decent for the type of food they offer. We shared the bruschetta trio to start which was similar to other wine bars I've visited. I went the salad route which was like a Mary Poppins salad because it didn't seem to ever disappear! The sandwiches also looked tasty but if you're hungry with an appetite, I suggest getting an appetizer with your entree. Men, do go here expecting a hearty meal. I would suggest ordering two appetizers and your entree if you're really hungry. So in summary, this really did feel exactly like a living room and now I want to check out their newest location on 7th!I sure wish my living room looked like this place! Great interior design with a classy, sophisticated atmosphere. I recently planned my boss's 50th birthday here and we had a great evening! Thanks for great service, we had one dedicated server and he was on it! We also planned to have appetizers and pizzas delivered throughout the evening and it worked out perfectly! We had some flatbread pizzas, bruschetta planks, spinach artichoke dip, sliders and cheese fondue. Plenty for all of our guests and everything kept disappearing so we clearly enjoyed it! The restaurant was packed on this particular evening and the staff handled it like champs. I would hold other parties or events here, making sure to plan the menu and discuss our wants with a manager ahead of time. I totally forgot to mention the layout of this restaurant. It's pretty cool. There are a few really neat wrap around patios. And inside the dining room has an open layout with smaller little nooks for larger groups. Check it out, you'll definitely be comfortable in this living room!Chandler can be pretty darn cool. Just take a look at The Living Room, a happening indoor/outdoor bar with an attractive wait staff, tasty sangria and om nom nommable eats. Now that I work in Chandler full-time, it's quickly become my favorite go-to for happy hour and lunch, with a vibe that's more downtown Phoenix than family-filled suburbs.The place is open and airy, with the indoors spilling out to the patio, no wall dividing the two. Dark wood and burnt orange furniture decorate the space, with the funky color scheme giving the spot a Mediterranean vibe. Comfy couches surrounded by fireplaces outside are perfect for lounging, while high-tops and an expansive bar with sports televisions inside give drinkers and diners more options.The place gets packed during "normal" happy hour time, but if you're a day drinker, you're in luck, since happy hour prices are available from open to 6 p.m. Definitely try a glass of sangria ($5 during happy hour) - I loved the red version I got, since it was really fruity but strong. There's an extensive wine list, as well as a mixed cocktail selection, if fruity sangria isn't your thing.The food at The Living Room is also mighty tasty. The Caprese sandwich ($9.95), with thick mozzarella, a pesto sauce, juicy grape tomatoes and a balsamic glaze that perfectly ties everything together, is delicious. I love it with a mixed green salad with lemon caper vinaigrette - the salad reminds me of another favorite salad of mine, at The Main Ingredient in Phoenix.Even if you don't live in Chandler, I'd say The Living Room is a destination spot and should entice you to venture out South if you don't usually head that direction.Patios like this with the AZ weather are the best! We had a good size group and took up most the patio but the server was able to keep our drinks filled and food when we wanted it with no problems! They have a good wine selection, great appetizers, and great service. There was live music on Sunday evening. I am really glad to have found this spot that I didn't even know existed. The brucetta's were great, I had 3 of them! Someone in our group said the cheese dip was really good as well. 2 glasses of wine and 3 bruchetta's were a good deal at just over $20.
Silk Road=I love Chinese food. There I said it. Now I can get this review properly underway.I'm not that familiar with the south hills because I'm a city kid. I don't venture outside unless I have reason to. A friend invited me out that way for dinner here knowing how much I enjoy Chinese food and she said she just knew I would like it. Boy was she right.Silk Road is located in the heart of Caste Village in Whitehall (which that itself I need to explore more). It's modestly decorated and basically looks like your run of the mill sit down Chinese restaurant.Every time I go to Silk Road I order the following:Appetizer: Spicy Wontons. I was turned onto the spicy wonton at Silk Road and have been loving them ever since. It's the traditional wonton from your wonton soup with a spicy peanut sauce. I believe you get 8 of them for $6.Snack: Egg roll. They probably have one of the best egg rolls ever.Entire: Pineapple beef. I NEVER order a beef dish when I eat Chinese except for at Silk Road. The pineapple beef is probably THE best Chinese meal I've ever eaten. I feel horrible because I feel any description I give it will not to it justice. The portion is enormous so no matter how greedy I'm feeling there is always plenty to take home (side note: I always ask for extra rice)Dessert: Fortune Cookie, duh.Please, please, please go eat there! And maybe try something else because I'm not sure if I can be persuaded to change my order anytime soon.
Mueller's Neighborhood Grill=What a gem!  How does anyone find it?  This mom and pop shop is securely tucked away behind Providence Road.  You could throw a rock either direction and hit Providence Cafe or Wolfman Pizza but still never see it from the street.  So there's strong support from regular customers keeping them open.  As a matter of fact, they're only open from 11 to 3 for lunch so we went and I got a ham sandwich that's pretty good.  The meat is high quality but the bread is plain store bought bread.  But then I realized the real deal is the burgers, so I'll be back to try one out.  All sodas are in bottle form and the mesquite bbq chips are great.  Water in a tall cup is free.  I like that they don't force you to buy a bottle.I saw an awesome looking Cuban sandwich and while standing in line a short five minutes three different people ordered the rueben sandwich, so that also sounds like one of  their specialties.  Give 'em a go!I walked into Mueller's today, starving, it was 315p, I asked what was their closing time.  3p.  But they graciously made a burger for me. That is way beyond the call of duty. Very nice.  And the burger was damn fine too.
Gimme Some Sugar=Everything up to the point of my wedding went well.... the ladies are very on top of the whole ordering process and very nice to deal with. I wouldn't have even written a review except I feel like they could have been a little more apologetic  about delivering my wedding cupcakes late to my reception. I had all my guests sitting watching the assembly of my cupcake tower when they were to be delivered an hour before the reception was set to start. Then I get an email notifying me that I was late making final payment but since they neglected to call me to ask for payment they were going to wave any and all late charges.... Um, if GSS had called me right after my wedding I would have paid the balance in full so I really didn't understand the email letting me know how kind they were to wave late charges that would have been their issue to begin with since they neglected to phone me to get the balance after services were rendered. It was kind of like they wanted to write me and tell me how kind they were waving the late charges when it was their fault for not calling me sooner. When I emailed them back explaining that I was disappointed with how late the cupcakes were delivered all I got was a "sorry".... "please call us as soon as possible and make final payment".... not what I expected. Cupcakes were cute and tasted pretty good, from what I was able to taste.... a little pricey but that's the trend I guess. I was disappointed in their lack of remorse over the late delivery and their annoying email about neglecting to call me for payment, I think I should have at least received some kind of a peace offering.Sealing the deal!I saw the sign facing the 215 for weeks.  Drove by one day only to find out it wasn't open for business yet.  As the weeks went by, I stared longing at that sign EVERY damned day, wondering when the hell I was going to get my chance.Then, by chance, my wife decided she would get me some sugar and they were open!  She came home with a really nice bag that contained these attractive pink boxes with clear cellophane lids (presumably to see the contents, eh?).  Unfortunately for my review, she's not very detail oriented, so I can't really tell you the exact names of what she bought, nor can I even describe the store and what other goods they offer.   Here's what we ended up with, according to her recollection:1.  Cake pops: They were chocolate cake with a chocolate shell.  Besides my not understanding the whole cupcake fad (is it really going to last?), I have hated - no really HATED - the whole cake pop thing.  All the ones I've had were either tasteless, dry, way too dense or a combination thereof.  These, however, were the anti-thesis to all that I have hated (HATED) about cake pops.  These were rich, moist and cake-like (as opposed to tasting like they mixed a pound of frosting with some leftover crumbs to hold it all together).  The only thing I hated (HATED) about these particular cake pops is that they were too doggone small.  One bite.  That's all it took.  :(1.  Red Velvet cupcakes: ok, so it didn't take a genius to know what this one was.  These were tasty, but not as moist or rich as the red velvet I know and love.  Ok substitute, but not enough to make me crave them.2.  Peanut butter cupcake: I'm not really a fan of peanut butter pastries, so I didn't even take a bite.  She liked them, but she was short on adjectives, so I can't really elaborate.3.  Bacon Banana cupcake: un-holy-freaking-rock-my-sugar-tooth-believable.  If you know me, you know I'm a bacon addict.  This cupcake was a revelation, a total mouth f***.  But let me back up and start at the beginning.  Once upon a time, there was this little confection that didn't smell all that enticing.  Had it not been for the bacon chunks on the frosting, I would have skipped it.  The scent was a bit confusing, starting with overt rendered bacon fat tones and an undercurrent of burnt sugar.  Not the most appetizing combo in all honestly.  Anyway, after cutting it in two, only then could I smell banana, which really threw my nose for a loop.  Then I took a bite.  I can't say it was heaven, nor that it was the best thing I have eaten in my life.  What I can and will say is that the flavor combination just works.  The sweet of the frosting and salty of the bacon are harmonious, with the tropical banana adding a whole new dimension.  I love inventive dishes that a cook/chef prepares that tries to let you in on a secret.  Sometimes you're just not meant to understand that secret and other times, when you get it, it totally makes you respect the thought and effort behind the creation.  The bacon banana cupcake really sealed the deal for me.  I'll be back to try some other unique creations.  Whatever they're baking, gimme some sugar baby.After our Hot N Juicy UYE, most of the group headed here for dessert and was it a trip worth taking.  I had just bookmarked the new business--yesterday was their second day open--when Shirley and Teri decided we'd go here after the UYE if we weren't too full.We picked out what we wanted and took it to a large dining room type table with some fresh flowers for their grand opening.  I got a macaron that was filled with gif and goat cheese.  What a wonderful combination!  Light crisp outside shell and a smooth interior.  I also got a box of 6 macarons to bring home--maple bacon, s'mores, pumpkin, and Nutella.  I can't remember the other two but they look great and based on the one I ate last night, they will be good!!  The macarons are about 3 inches in diameter--more like the ones at Bouchon than other bakeries that sell them.While we were having our treats and chatting at the table, the owner came around with a sample of their rich hot chocolate.  It was very good.For those who have been to a movie or were out shopping, this is a nice place to stop and unwind a bit.  Order some wine and have a sweet.  The interior is very pleasant and the staff is great!  Considering this was their second day open, they did a great job when the seven of us descended on the place.  They're open late on Friday and Saturday.To the owner--after you've got everything in order there, open another location on the west side of town.  Then I'd see you more often.In the area and craving a sweet I decided to check my bookmarks and lo and behold Gimme Some Sugar popped up on my Yelp app bookmarks. Having heard some good reviews from trusted Yelpers I was excited to give them a try. I walked in and the place is super cute. Clean and well-decorated. I was greeted warmly by the three girls working at the counter. They were ready for any questions and had plenty of suggestions for me while I perished their inventory. I had my heart set on a macaron and they are huge. Interesting flavors as well. I decided on the fig & goat cheese and the maple bacon. I also had some questions on some pricing for specialty cakes and towers and they were very helpful and assisted me with all my questions and gave me lots of information and contact information if I decided to order something for the future. The macarons were flaky and moist. I didn't love the flavors, but they were ok. I took a few bites and didn't really feel the need to finish them. I'd be back if I'm in the area to see what else they have to offer.4.5 starsGimme Some Sugar is such a unique bakery on this side of town!  First thing I noticed is how luxurious and beautiful it is.  The sparkly and modern decor make me feel like I'm in a boutique hotel.  I'm taking a half star off simply because our chairs and table were very "wobbly".  The furniture, while beautiful, does not seem durable.  There are so many indulgent treats to choose from, e.g., mini NY style cheesecakes, huge macarons in a variety of flavors, cupcakes, cookies, cake pops, etc.  And almost everything can come with a little bit of a twist - a freshly baked cookie a la mode, a side of milk with your warm cookies, or add strawberries and balsamic to your cheesecake.  Delectable!  This bakery serves alcohol and is open until midnight on the weekends!  This is such a dangerous find for me considering I can practically walk to it from my house.  My late night dessert prayers have been answered!Gimme some sugar, gimme some artificial tasting frosting and then gimme my tooth brush. Sorry to be the buzz kill of the group, but I'm not loving what I had here. We ordered 3 different macarons, Nutella, Maple-Bacon and Late Night Snack. The first bite of each, all I could think of was how artificial it tasted. It tasted like someone had stuffed store bought cake frosting in between the macarons. I took a bite of each and couldn't finish any of them. The rest of their dessert cake wasn't that appealing. They had inidividual size treats, like dirt cake and the such, but each costing around $6? Gimme (no pun intended) a break. Way overpriced on all of their desserts here. Would much rather spend my money and calories elsewhere.How can somebody who's always had a sweet tooth like me not love this place? I've been telling myself I'll cut back on my sweets intake - it's been a battle that I keep losing. Since this shop is in the same complex as a  Gold's Gym - that's a good enough excuse to indulge in sweet treats, right?The shop is so cute. Black and white interior and the colors come from the beautiful cakes, pastries and macarons they have. I'm actually wishing my birthday was much sooner so I can get a birthday cake from here. They serve hot chocolate, tea and coffee, milk, juice, soda...and alcohol (at night). Champagne, wine and beer + dessert? Can I just live here? Before I continue, I must say that my love for macarons started when I first had them in Paris - oh l'amour! So, I'm not one of those that eat them because they're trendy or whatever. The fad can die but I'd still love macarons. These French cookies are my faves just like chunky chocolate chip cookies. I'd go to a macaron shop at every city I visit for comparison and get macarons in ALL their flavors. So, I'm glad the Vegas area has Gimme Some Sugar. My true test for macarons is pistachio macarons but unfortunately, they didn't have it when I went but I think you can special order items a day before.They have 10 macaron flavors at a time. I think 2 are seasonal flavors and 8 mainstays. I've tried 10 flavors: fig & goat cheese, Snickerdoodle, strawberries & champagne, Nutella, PB&J, grandpa's blueberry pancake, birthday cake, maple-bacon, Snickers Candy bar and chocolate-covered strawberry. I got 14 macarons - I had to get an extra fig and goat cheese macaron and 2 extra Nutella macarons. I also got a fresh fruit pavlova and a green tea cheesecake. As for the macarons, here's how each ranks:5/5: fig & goat cheese, Nutella, chocolate-covered strawberry4/5: Snickerdoodle, PB&J, Snickers candy bar, maple-bacon bar3/5: strawberries & champagne, grandpa's blueberry pancake, birthday cakeGreen Tea Cheesecake:I love green tea and not a lot of places have green tea cheesecake. The crust is crunchy. The cheesecake is deliciously creamy with a good green tea flavor. It's topped with a thin sesame nougatine and a raspberry. Amazing! 5/5Fresh Fruit Pavlova:A pavlova is a meringue topped with fruits. It's light and crisp. It's like a "healthier" dessert if you will. 5/5They warned me that the birthday cake was really sweet and that I shouldn't get it if I was torn between that and another flavor. Hooray for honesty! The fig & goat cheese macaron sounds a bit unusual but it's actually good since I love goat cheese. Sweet fig + tart goat cheese...yum! Nutella is a no-brainer...it's instant love for me. The strawberries & champagne sounded real good and looks so pretty and dainty but the flavors were mild but really sweet. I think the strawberry flavor needs to be more pronounced. I got lucky to have the last maple-bacon macaron. Score! The service is amazing here. Very friendly and honest. I was holding up the line with all the desserts I got and I felt bad for the people behind me who came in just to pick up 2 items. But one of the girls who was helping me out offered them a cookie so everything was fine and dandy. Sure, the desserts here cost an average of $7 apiece and the macarons are $3.50-4.50 each - the macarons are HUUUUGE though (the size of your palm or about 4 macarons) and the ingredients are of quality. Hello? I don't mind paying for something good. You can actually get $1 off with a Yelp check-in. And if you buy more than 6 macarons, you get 50cents off each additional you buy.I was smiling the whole time I was in the shop like a kid in candy store. My friend who was driving me around even said, "see! It's that smile that makes driving here worth it".There has been a lot of attention for this new bakery off of Stephanie and the 215 and I'll quickly chime in to add my experience with them.We visited the weekend they first opened and things were still new, kinks were still being worked out.  However, I did enjoy that first visit with the tasty pumpkin cheesecake.  A month later, I ordered a custom birthday cake for good friend, Shirley B., who's a big fan of Gimme Some Sugar.  I e-mailed GSS with my requests for a cake with a Hello Kitty and SF 49er theme because those are two of Shirley B.'s favorite things.  Ashley responded promptly and we coordinated on the details.  The resulting birthday cake was just the thing and the surprised look on Shirley's face when we presented the cake at her birthday dinner was priceless; she loved it.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gimme-some-sugar-henderson-3?userid=7Oe6ikklTjVBbEFw9emLcA#xMTMOVBqAc0YKsVJaeUGEAFirst-rate customer service from the beginning to the end with Ashley and her shop.  That is a rare thing indeed and I give them five stars all the way for filling the order above and beyond.  I'm a fan and we'll definitely be giving GSS more business in the future.Thanks Bethany E. for recommending Gimme Some Sugar. Located in a strip center in Henderson where parking was no issue.I happened to be in the area so I made it a point to stop in and check out the larger then norm macarons. I purchased two macarons - peanut butter and blueberry. Being a huge peanut butter fan I favored the peanut butter and thought the blueberry was on the overly sweet side. I also returned another day and tried the berry mascarpone but was disappointed the outer layer was on the hard side.Besides individual desserts I saw some of the custom cakes they make and was blown away by the creativity of the dessert chef here. If you're in the area stop in for a macaron  -  compared to a LV Blvd bakery they are a real bargain.Do I give it 3 stars? Do I give it 4? Usually if I can't decide I go with the lesser until they have proven me wrong. I think eventually I will up this review a star. But based on my first experience we will start with average. All of my yelp friends always talk about this place, check in, post pics, and its so close to me house! Finally after work one night I had a sweet tooth and stopped in. Off top, 5 stars for décor and customer service. I love the old school classy barber shop, winery, ladies saloon style all in one. I was instantly greeted with a smile and a hello. Lighting was dim, but appropriate. I was instantly drawn to the berry mascarpone cake. 2 of my favorites in one. $7 for a small piece, I was disappointed. Not enough mascarpone and it was like a berry gelatin. Not bad, but not what I expected. I took home, chocolate covered strawberries (3 for $6, decent), cookies, macaroons, and a couple other randoms. Prices were ok. I could imagine myself loving this place and enjoying a glass of wine n cupcake after work entirely to often. Who's my first yelp date down for drinks and desserts?! Jessie B? Shirley B?Items Selected:Salty Caramel Banana CupcakePeanut Butter BlondieSnickerdoodleBirthday Cake Macaron - Rainbow Sprinkles, Vanilla ButtercreamMocha Madness Macaron - Gianduja Crisp, Coffee Buttercream, Coffee GanacheSnickers Macaron - Chewy Peanut-Caramel and Chocolate Ganache dipped in Chocolate and PeanutsFig and Goat Cheese Macaron - Honey Sweetened Goat Cheese and Mission Fig JamLocated just off the 215 in Henderson and receiving nearly universal praise from palates I trust "Gimme Some Sugar" from Jean Philippe protégé Kristen LoVullo had long been on my 'to visit list,' and thus when nothing in particular struck my fancy for dinner on Saturday I did the only thing a healthy, responsible adult would do - ate dessert for dinner while watching House of Cards and drinking home Siphon Brewed Ethiopian Chelelektu from Heart.  Without a doubt a 'cute' shop with friendly service provided by a young lady named Brenda it was just after 7:00pm when I walked into the small store and with a short line fronted by a woman and her daughter planning a 'Sweet 16' party I spent some time perusing the items and chatting with other customers, seemingly each with a different favorite amongst the store's nearly twenty options.  Featuring plated desserts, custom cakes, jars, cookies, and other take-home treats it was with an eye on variety that I ordered when I approached the front of the line and self-selecting a few favorites along with two selections confirmed by Brenda to be as good as the crowd had suggested I made my way to the door immediately indulging in a buttery cinnamon-laced snickerdoodle with crispy edges and a soft center, the first of a half dozen +1 items tallying $25 after tax and tip.  Showing some restrained and retaining the rest of my purchase for the twenty-seven minute drive home it was with coffee in hand that I continued my tasting first with a bananas-foster-esque cupcake that was plenty moist but somewhat marred by overly sweet frosting but moving on to the dense peanut butter blondie things improved substantially, the dense square loaded with rich chocolate tones and roasted organic peanut butter, a classic combo only improved after a minute on a warm skillet.  Moving finally to what has seemingly become LoVullo's 'signature' item, it was with a quartet of macarons that I rounded out my evening and with each palm-sized cookie featuring a characteristic crackle over rich flavors, the texture of the crmb was actually far more dense than the Parisian classic - a moist cake-like consistency akin to the American whoopie pie and although perhaps not 'traditional,' entirely delicious - both the dense chocolate dipped Snickers and rich, savory Fig and Goat Cheese "Whooparons" undoubtedly justifying the nearly hour-long round trip...though if they ever decide to expand I definitely see a market for a second shop in ever trendy Summerlin.A bakery that also serves alcohol? I'm in trouble! This place has all your favorite vices: indulgent sweets, quality wines, and even savory scones. If you have a crack habit, I'm pretty sure it's baked into the delicate, double-layer fruit Pavlova. This is also the only place you'll find macarons the size of your palm- higher price, lessened opportunity to try multiple styles, but the flavors are spot-on! The popular ginger-fig has been a bit elusive, but the strawberry-lemonade has ample, balanced notes of each, plus a smear of jam in the middle. Everything in the cases looks like a work of art. On the downside, they're priced like art, too- $5.25/macaron, $7 for that tiny but tasty Pavlova. Great spot for a special occasion, like a Girls Night Out or a birthday meetup with friends, but not an easy spot to visit regularly.After 346 Patisserie closed, I wanted to find another go-to Henderson dessert shop. So far, this place isn't it.Gimme Some Sugar is the "Bake Shoppe" located off 215 and Stephanie. They offer refrigerated desserts such as tarts and cheesecakes, baked goods ranging from muffins to macarons, tea, Mothership coffee, and alcoholic beverages. The cushioned chairs, chandelier-like lights, and black rear wall would be nice to enjoy at night, but it's a little odd to step into this kind of place during the day.They offered me a couple of samples while I was perusing their selections. The chocolate ganache brownie had a rich chocolate flavor and sweetness, and I would have ordered it if I wasn't set on maximizing variety from my visit. The peanut butter blondie wasn't bad, but it was boring and not as rich in peanut butter flavor as I would've liked.I made several orders. The fig & goat cheese macaron ($5.25) is huge, as all their macarons are. They're roughly double the diameter of a standard macaron and are taller as well. The goat cheese was a delight, and the fig jam and macaron shell provided the sweetness to cement this as a dessert - maybe a bit too much sweetness, but not problematic. My issues were with the macaron shell's texture. It didn't lack crunch, but the exterior fractured into pieces with my first bite, and the interior seemed more mushy than chewy.Next, I tried the mixed berry scone ($2.45). It is advertised as "light and flakey" and "studded with fresh mixed berries." However, it was decidedly neither light nor flaky. Granted, it was soft, but the interior was indistinguishable from an average muffin, and it wasn't that crisp on the exterior. It was, however, too sweet - yes, even for a place called Gimme Some Sugar. Also, there were perhaps a few blueberries in the entirety of the scone. They weren't as prominent as I expected, and there wasn't a trace of the other berries. I'm not too enamored with the sugar crystals generously layered on the top of the scone, but I don't hate them either.Finally, I tasted two of their cookies ($1.75). The chocolate chip cookie had plenty of chocolate, but the texture is too mushy and there wasn't any rise to it. It is not a cookie that I would recommend. And frankly, neither is the monster cookie. It has a drier feel because of oats and peanut butter, and the generic M&M's (didn't see an imprint) were fine, but I wasn't thrilled.While Gimme Some Sugar certainly has their fans, some good sweet treats, and friendly customer service (samples and asking a phone caller to hold because I'd waited a while), I wasn't impressed with them overall. Maybe I'll try some of their pricey cold case items in the future (upwards of $7), but otherwise, I'd like Henderson to gimme a new place with better desserts.I had such a horrible experience here I would never, never recommend this bakery to anyone. It seems as though my unfortunate timing of requesting a gender reveal cake for my baby shower coincided with the bakery attending Life Is Beautiful to hock their confectioneries to concert goers. I emailed and was at first told there would be no issue making my cake, but then after multiple not returned emails and phone calls I started to get weary. However, someone there did get back to me and assured me my cake would be ready for Sunday pick up at 1 pm. Since I was already a week out from my baby shower I figured this was my only choice now since I wanted a custom cake, and most bakeries want at least a two week window to complete such a project.I sent them my invitation that I had sent out to all my guests. It was a lovely invite done by a friend, it was very cute and professional. I simply asked they recreate the theme of the invitation on the cake, and they could do so however they wanted. The main feature of the invite was a horse wearing a cowboy hat. No such creature even made it on to my cake. I told them I did not want any writing on the cake, and they achieved that much, but the cake was boring and sad, and did not represent my invitation at all.  (See pictures for comparison)Seems to me like they needed a lot of direction on how to make the cake, which is odd considering they're touted as such a great bakery. You would think they could recreate something given a visual representation. I'm not a baker, nor am I a cake artist, but it can't be that hard. *shrugs*On top of the fact that my cake was plain Jane and boring as hell, it didn't taste all that great either. The cake inside was crumbly and not moist. The filling inside meant to represent a GIRL was the lightest pink one could imagine -- really, some people at the party were like, uuhhh is it pink or white? when I cut into it to do the "reveal" of the gender.Bad cake, bad customer service, no artistic ability. Also, when I arrived with a friend to the store on Sunday a little before 1 PM, there was no one there. We rang the doorbell, knocked on the doors, and looked inside. I called the bakery only to have it ring and go to voicemail. I also emailed them (which they never returned the email, btw). I was at my wit's end. I had a baby shower to get to (MY OWN!), so my friend and I left, but in a last ditch moment of anxiety I returned to the bakery to see an SUV now parked out front. I went to the door and was able to open it and find someone there to give me my cake. It came to me in a brown UPS looking box, not a nice cake box one would expect when paying over $100 for a cake. I had half a mind to tell them I wasn't going to take it, but I had no time. I paid and left.This was just a really bad experience and has turned me off of the whole "custom cake" game. I can bake my own cakes for my special occasions from here on out.
V. Picasso=This won't be much of a review because we didn't have much of a visit.  I went on a bustling Saturday night and got the last free table in the dining room.  There was no wait.  As my dinner party sat there, after a while the conversation at our table turned to how long it was appropriate to wait to be served.  5 minutes?  10 minutes?  There was a loud piano nearby so it was hard to talk about that, or anything, but we tried.The restaurant didn't appear understaffed.  In particular there was a busboy-looking guy who was practicing twirling his dishtowel in an elaborate way while walking back and forth between tables in the dining room.  He passed close by our table and several others.  Since he was dressed as a busboy we kept expecting him to do busboy-like things.  Maybe bring some water.  Put some silverware down on our empty table.  Refill some water at the tables near us with empty glasses.  Clear some of the dirty dishes that I could see sitting around?  But he never did.  Maybe he was a plant -- an agent of a competing restaurant trying to discredit this one?There were also waiters walking around.  The waiter who was in our section the most often seemed to be engaged in apologizing sincerely to many of the other tables near us.  We couldn't quite overhear him though (thanks to the piano).Again, how long is it appropriate to wait for someone to serve you?  10 minutes?  15 minutes?  Several attempts at meaningful eye contact had failed at this point, so I tried raising my hand.  No luck.  The dishtowel-twirler was in his own world, and the waiters were bustling, but not stopping.  We tried discussing the overly-eclectic menu for a while but grew tired of it.  Since we were hungry talking about food didn't seem like a good idea.  And that piano sure was loud.I read in the paper that the Picasso estate routinely files lawsuits trying to stop unauthorized use of the artist's name.  I wonder if this place has a license?  Yelp forbids reviewers from mentioning the names of other restaurants in reviews, so I'll refrain from mentioning the authorized restaurant with a similar name in Las Vegas.  (I've never been there anyway so I don't know how they would compare.)  I also won't mention the similarly-named restaurants in New York that were closed down by lawsuits from the Picasso estate.  Although I guess they don't count as restaurants since they don't exist anymore.After saying "excuse me" loudly to a passing waiter a few times produced no effect, I thought that maybe there was a kind of invisibility shield around our table.  At 25 minutes we gave up and left.
El Palacio Mexican Restaurant & Cantina=Service was OK.Underwhelming Gringo Mexican food.Chef specialties don't come with rice & beans...Cheese crisp was greasy even for a cheese crisp.I kept thinking I could have eaten here and had much better food for less:http://www.yelp.com/biz/el-ranchero-chandlerAfter falling for their amazing carnitas at Scottsdale Spice, I badly wanted to give their restaurant a try so tada!  Saturday Night with the boys commenced!  Walking in was a treat.  El Palacio was all decked out for some Halloween fun!  The donkeys wore dinosaur pet costumes and tacky-yet-adorable vinyls covered the windows.  They also were advertising heavily that they'll be at this weekend's AZ Taco Festival.  I was mesmerized and ecstatic.  After ordering a rich horchata and getting the complimentary two bowls of salsa and a delicious homemade bean dip with some chips, I checked-in on the Yelp app and discovered a "free appetizer with purchase of any entree" offer.  Yes!  This night keeps getting better and better!Our waitress had recommended us to get the Fiesta Sampler for the check-in offer since we're new patrons of the place and it was a great suggestion.  There were cheesy quesadillas, crunchy taquitos, tiny tacos with warm chorizo and potatoes, and dressed-up nachos all on this plate.  It was a lot of food and a part of me wishes they brought it out before our entrees because I was hungry and I was too busy stuffing my face with carnitas to pay too much attention to the appetizers.  Bah. I stuck with my Carnitas Rancheras, not straying to steal bites off anyone else's plate.  It came out piping hot and smelling of delicious meats!  Three warm tortillas stayed wrapped up in their foil and were waiting for me to get my green-painted nails on them.  I piled my little tortilla up with a helping of succulent slow-cooked pork, I spooned some onions and guacamole, added my pico de gallo [sorry El Palacio, I think my pico's better], and threw on some beans and rice just because.  It was an amazing first bite.  Minus their pico de gallo being a bit wimpy, I did find that the seasoning on their carnitas to be light-handed.  Where's the heat, man!?  Make me sweat!  The portions are very generous.  Three tortillas was not enough for all that juicy meat they give you.  The free cinnamon sugar apple-filled taquito-dessert thing with whipped cream they give you with the bill was delish.All in all, I had a great night out with good food and great company.  Service was a bit slow and the wait was pretty killer considering it wasn't even packed nor were there any big parties in the place but oh well.  Nothing great company can't cure.  I would come back for sure.  The Mole Poblano is calling my name.  Help me.
Archie's=Archie's is great for cheap, quality wings. The place has bar seatings on one side and spacious tables for groups on the other side. Staffs are friendly and service efficient. There are TV's at every angle--360 degrees of visual stimulations. When I was there, I saw Archie himself. He is a very friendly and social guy. Okay more about the wings. From Monday-Thursday wings are 35 cents each, all day. However, you must purchase a drink with your wings order, minimum of 10 wings per order. Even with the drink purchase, the meal was still pretty cheap. I was able to try three flavors: spicy Thai sauce, Cajun rub and flaming hot. Spicy Thai was on the sweeter side and not spicy at all. Cajun rub had a spicy kick to it and flaming hot pretty much went up my nose and I was in tears. The wings were juicy and meaty with just the right amount of flavors. My favorite flavor so far is Cajun rub.  Overall, I highly recommend Archie's for those with a passion for wings. It was a very satisfying experience, and easy on the wallet.
Ocean Blue Caribbean Restaurant and Bar=Well my experience was different than previous Yelpers.  Maybe I went in with '"hole in the wall" expectations as soon as I had a look around, maybe Ocean Blue took a little time to get on it's feet.I went for lunch with some coworkers and everyone seemed more or less happy with the meal.  I had a jerk chicken appetizer (1.95) which was kind of a pocket filled with mildly spiced chicken.  It came with a side of jerk sauce which was complex and spicy.I followed that with one of the daily specials, 2 fish tacos.  It was flour tortillas with very tender and sweet tilapia, some cabbage and other leafy stuff and a sweet, slightly smoky sauce.  I added some of the jerk sauce to throw some heat on it.I also had an iced tea.  How much for the app, 2 fish tacos and iced tea?  $9.70.  Not bad at all.They also have a small lunch buffet which is refreshed often.  It had four dishes-a white rice with some veggies, broiled tilapia, potato salad and some kind of roasted chicken.  While we were there they changed the fish twice and switched to BBQ chicken.I'll be back to give them another shot, maybe try the all-you-can-eat buffet for 7.99.Always happy to find a new spot to try for lunch and saw a friend had bookmarked Ocean Blue and I asked her if she was up to giving them a try, said yes so made plans for lunch and off we went.Arrived around 11:45 and already knew I wanted to do the lunch buffet, they have a weekly buffet that changes daily for 7.99, and for that day  it was steamed white rice,  curry chicken, potato salad, and steamed fish.  I tried everything, and I have to say I was pretty excited to try the curry chicken , but sadly I was not able to eat it, it just was too salty to me, the potato salad was perfect and the steamed rice went well with the fish and let's talk about that fish, I did not come to try the fish, it was an afterthought but after I tried the fish, holy cow that was some great fish, also on the table was a unlabeled bottle, I asked what it was and found out it was a pineapple mango pepper sauce , so I put a little with the fish, and BAM! That added some great flavor & heat! If you cannot handle hot stuff, maybe you should stay away from the sauce, but for me it was amazing! Even put it on my rice, so good!I've only tried the buffet, so I can't attest for the rest of the menu, but I am happy to had found them and look forward to going back.
Pusadee's Garden=In what used a be a shady corner in the dodgy end of Lawrenceville, now exists a miniature restaurant district, reminiscent of Bryant street in Highland Park.  On one side of the street you have Cure (my 2nd favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh) and Allegheny Wine Mixer (a really cool wine bar, one of the only ones in town).  Across the street is Pusadee's Garden, a Thai restaurant with a fantastic outdoor patio on the side completely hidden from the street.The garden is really the restaurant's big draw.  There's a small indoor seating area but the majority of the seats are outside.  The outside area is split into two halves, with one half having small tables with umbrellas and the other underneath an ivy-covered trellis.On a recent Saturday evening my wife and I were meeting another couple there for dinner and in typical Pittsburgh fashion, it was pouring down rain.  We called the restaurant to make certain our reservation was still OK and they said it was.  By an incredible stroke of luck, the sun came out right before we sat down.  Unfortunately, that meant that everything was covered with rainwater.  It also meant that during our entire dinner rain dripped on us, our food, and our wine.The menu is standard Thai fare: curries, noodle dishes, and a few "garden specialities."  We started off sharing crispy chicken spring rolls with plum sauce, chicken satay with peanut sauce and cucumber relish, and thai fried chicken with a sweet and spicy sriracha sauce.  It was all very tasty.  For entrees my wife had "street noodle #1", rice noodles with bean sprouts, bok choy, and more thai friend chicken.  I had a rice noodle dish with grilled duck breast, vegetables, and a spicy black soy sauce.  The duck was well done (not a way I normally like duck, but typical for an Asian restaurant) and the sauce had a nice spicy flavor.  Like many Thai restaurants, they ask you for a spice level of 1-10 for your dish.  I like spicy food so  I opted for a 6 and was glad that I did not venture higher.Pusadee's Garden is BYOB only and everyone around us had a varity of wines and beers.  Corkage was inexpensive, only $1 per glass. Overall cost of dinner was very reasonable and added up to about $40 for 2 people.Overall, we felt Pusadee's Garden was a good Thai restaurant.  The cuisine is standard Thai and honestly no better or worse than any other Thai restaurant that I've been to. There's nothing here that's going to push the envelope of Thai cuisine.  The BYOB option is nice and the garden is a very nice place to sit (when it's not raining).  Why only 3-stars?  Well, according to Yelp, 3-stars = A-OK which is how I feel about Pusadee's Garden.  It's a standard Thai restaurant with a nice outdoor seating area.  It's not someplace I would ever specifically seek out, but it's a good option if you're in the mood for Thai and there's nice weather outside.No one is lying when they say the outdoor area is incredible... because it is! If you entered through the back, you'd never know that busy Butler Street is right in front of you. But since you enter from the front... it tricks you into thinking you're in some sort of garden utopia because the trees and ivy are so thick. So if you boast such a wonderful garden in the summer... what do you do in the winter? You make awesome food so people come back! I'm one of those people that can sometimes end up going to ethnic restaurants and ordering the same thing over and over. I know, super lame. But I get scurred! Considering the couple we were with raved about the street noodles, I went out of my pad thai/curry comfort zone.I have to admit, I've only had street noodles once at Noodlehead in Shadyside and these were way more flavorful! I ordered up Street Noodles 2 with rice noodles and fried shrimp. I could tell right away it was way more filled with more zesty ingrediants. Competition's on the horizon Noodlehead! I like that it's BYOB, so you can bring your fave bottle with you. I will say, the dish isn't large, but just right. Let's just say, I was satisfied, but definitely ready for dessert later! But isn't that kinda the best of both worlds?
Namaste Indian Cuisine=I'm usually stay far away from buffets, however I am very happy I decided to give this place a try.  My mom and I were both in the mood to try some place new and after driving around and checking out all of commerical center we decided a Indian food sounded pretty yummy.  After eating there, I decide this really is the only way to go out for Indian food with just 2 people because I always want to try just a little bit of everything.  At Namaste you can, and everything I tasted was fantastic!Eat here for lunch. $9 lunch buffet, really amazing food, good service. I can't wait to go back.This place was so hyped up that I was expecting something out of this world delicious. My favorite Indian restaurant in the entire world is Bombay Club in Harvard Square. Delicious, in my eyes, you can't beat it. So, I came in here with high hopes.This was the first Indian restaurant I've tried in Vegas, it's right next to Lotus of Siam, and right away that was a good sign for me. Anything that someone in my group of foodie friends recommends that is in a seedy strip mall HAS to be good.Started off with a kingfisher beer, papadom, and the requisite sauces. Friend of mine got the mulligatawny soup, I didn't try it, but he said it was good! For dinner, I got the chicken vindaloo and kheema naan (lamb stuffed bread). I asked them to make the vindaloo as hot as they could, and I didn't have a problem eating it. Wasn't as spicy as I thought it'd be. I mean, it was spicy, but it wasn't like -  OH MY GOD IM GOING TO DIE IF I DONT GET WATER RIGHT NOW AIGDJGSADJG kind of spicy, na'mean?Overall, though, high quality food for a very low price. I was impressed with the place and I'll definitely be going back again.THE BEST INDIAN FOOD IN VEGAS!My girlfriend and I were accidentally one of the first people to eat at Namaste. We were in the area and are very familiar with the great places in the tucked-away Commercial Center. As I recall we were considering going to Komol, one of our favorite Thai food restaurants and hangouts, when we saw that Namaste was finally open. We both love Indian food as she primarily eats vegetarian and Indian restaurants are easy targets for us.THE LUNCH BUFFET FOR $9 IS NOT TO BE MISSED! Indian buffets are hit-or-miss. Some will put out the standard dishes and only have one or two really yummy entrees set out. Not Namaste! They pull out all the stops and have many favorite dishes out at the same time. Mind you, the place is new, and many new places will start out this way and then go downhill, but I don't think this will be the case with Namaste. Chef and owner, Om Singh, has a reputation that precedes him in the culinary world and I suspect that the quality at Namaste will endure.We have eaten here many times since it has opened up and every meal has been outstanding. Most notably, the VEGETARIAN DINNER FOR TWO ($40) is perfect. From the first course to the last it is exceptionally yummy. The main courses are all super good and it was so plentiful we had a lot of left-overs for lunch the next day. And the dessert, especially the carrot one, is REALLY GOOD.The wait staff is very friendly and are constantly circling the floor. The atmosphere is decent and comfortable. I attend a discussion group every Sunday afternoon and we usually go out to dinner afterward. Komol is one of our regular haunts, but now it seems that Namaste will be our new default location.Was trying to go to Lotus of Siam next door, but line was too long, so we went here instead (which I assume is how they get most of their biz).  Food was good but nothing really stood out over other Indian joints.  My boyfriend and I shared the veggie dinner for 2, which was $40.  Service was good, restroom is very clean, place is nicely decorated.Indian lunch buffets were on my mind, especially have hearing Misti Y. praise their deliciousness.We pull into Commercial Center at 1:45 pm on a Sunday.  As we park the car, we notice there aren't too many other cars parked out front.  Hmmm...As we open the door, what a shock to see!  The place was packed full of Indians!  This was a great sign! I wasn't sure if there was a wait with all the people standing around of if there was a private party.  With no one to greet us at the front, the Husband goes in search of an empty table.  He finds one last table at the far back and after checking with a waiter, I get the affirmative wave.  I tell him to start first on the buffet line.  Meanwhile, I ask a waiter for some utensils.When the waiter brings over our water, he apologizes as a tour group had just arrived, which explains all the craziness.  Nonetheless, an Indian tour group stops at Namaste in Commercial Center, of all places, for their lunch en route is still a good sign!My turn at the buffet line!  Now, I'm no expert on Indian buffets as I've been to only a couple.  But I think the spread was pretty good for $8.99!My favorite was the Vegetable Korma "Vegetable cooked in creamy cashew nut gravy finished with almond and garnished with coriander and cream."  This was good on rice or the hot naan "unleavened white bread" they provided.  I also liked the sauce from the Chicken Tikka Masala "Tender pieces of chicken breast roasted in homemade creamy tomato," however, we both found the chicken pieces itself to be dry.  I also liked the Allo Jerra, which were ultimately potatoes.The Husband was loving the Saag Paneer "Spinach cooked with homemade cheese" and the Goat Curry.  Other items on the buffet line were Pakara, a fried veggie, Cholle Masala, a dish with chickpeas; and a Cabbage Masala.  Something that was both new to us was the Uttapam, a thick pancake with a sour-like taste that was topped with a bit of tomato and onion.  Traditionally it's made from rice that has been fermented, which explains it's tangy taste.Finishing off the meal was the Kheer, "Traditional Indian rice pudding with nuts, flavored with cardamon and rose."At one point, I helped myself to the water pitcher.  (I wasn't sure if this was self serve since there were about four water pitchers right next to where we were sitting and the place was so crowded.  They did end up refilling my glass the next 4-5 times though.)  The waiters were pretty friendly to us once the crowd got settled in more and started clearing out.  They were quick to clear out our dirty dishes and refill the water glasses.Namaste also has a simple, but pleasant decor with its mango painted walls, which I'm sure makes one crave a mango lassi.Overall, definitely not a bad choice for an Indian buffet.  I was so stuffed from that meal that I didn't eat again until 10 pm that night! I don't know if it's always this busy on Sundays though, so keep that in mind!
Crudo=Last night I was lucky enough to try out Crudo for the first time. The crew was soft-launching their dinner menu and offered a VERY special $15 price for a 3-course meal. Chrissy and Dottsy joined me for the 6PM reservation, so the evening was off to a great start. We were seated outside which was still a little chilly, but a small heat lamp was brought out and arranged by our table without our requesting it. Their standard menu will offer 3, 4, and 5 course options, at $30, $40 and $50 or you can offer off the menu. Keep in mind that our dinner was a preview, and the menu is not finalized yet. As of now the menu is divided into Freddo and Caldo options and I made my meal of the Butterfish with a citrus glaze, the Hamachi with black garlic and truffle oil, and the Risotto, which had a massive mushroom seared on top and (kind of gross to think about but tasty nonetheless) cock's comb. Yes, the red dangly bits of a chicken. blerg. The risotto was great though, if you didn't know about the cock's comb you would have though it was sauteed mushroom, so that's what I pretended. The Butterfish was great, super buttery and the citrus sauce was just the right note to set it off. Hands down my favorite plate was the Hamachi though, the texture and density of the yellowtail was perfect and the apples, truffle oil and black garlic on it were to die for. The wine list we were presented with numbered 5 wines with no prices, and while I'm a Bisol Jeio Prosecco fan I wasn't crazy about the red and white options, but I'm sure they are working on that. Our server was Lisa G, and her presence instigated an odd sort of tourettes in both Dottsy and Chrissy: "balls! balls! we love your balls! put your balls on the menu!"The service, by Lisa and the rest of the Crudo staff and chefs was perfect, perfectly timed, very welcoming, open to questions. I would gladly spend another couple of hours at Crudo enjoying their menu, it was really inspired.
Babbo Italian Eatery=I sometimes eat here with my friends after hiking Dreamy Draw Hiking Trail.Yeah we ruin the burned calories by stuffing our faces with pastas and pizzas at Babbo afterwards.Is it good? Definitely!As you sit you are swarmed with servers laying down complimentary breads with olive oil, and balsamic dip.However, I cannot eat bread and pastas all the time, or I'll gain weight.I have to watch my svelte figure now that I'm getting older.They do have an interesting menu and the ones that I've had were extremely flavorful. I've had the Garlic Cheese Crostini, Bruschetta Romana, Roasted Asparagus, Mandarin Spinach, Mushroom Asparagus, and Pasta Rustico. The place is also very clean,  the ambiance is fabulous, and service is always great.Highly recommended with a great lunch menu too! :-)This is really one of my favorite places to go now.Lots of calories, but very good meal and for a very low price. On Monday and Tuesday they have the Spaghetti and Meatball Special for just $5.99.Best deal in town, I think.Bread is great, and I also really like the salad. They make it the Italian way. Really good! HeheeePizza here is really good as well. Nice crust with great cheese.Every time we come here,I always leave happy. {Parking is a bit tight) so be careful out there. Nice clean restrooms.Trying out Babbo for the very first time and was hoping that the trip was not a waste.  I did check Yelp reviews prior to going but you know how it is--sometimes they're right and sometimes they're wrong.  We were served sliced foccacia bread along with a dipping sauce made from an olive oil/balsamic vinegar mix.  I felt too much balsamic for the olive oil, but gave it a whirl.  But first I added black pepper, hot pepper flakes and a little salt.  Not bad, but I hate having to "cook" when I go out to dinner.  The foccacia and dipping sauce was quite nice.  But, but, but.... why is it that they never give you small plates so you can put your own bread on it and you don't drip olive oil from the table to your mouth??  So I asked Morgan, our server, if they have bread plates.  She says, "Sure" AND THEN she comes back with ONE plate (there are two of us ! Morgan).  Hubby's entree comes with a salad. He chose, "MISTA" or something like that.  Small salad but delicious.  Mixed greens with golden raisins, onion and PINE NUTS.... I love PINE NUTS.  It was topped with gorgonzola cheese and a sweet balsamic-type dressing.  Really good.  I stole some from hubby so I know.  Entrees arrive:  Spaghetii and meatballs for me and a "chalkboard" menu item which included chicken, marsala wine, mushrooms accompanied by veggies.  No pasta.  Pasta was $6 extra.  Really?On a $13 entree?  not even a teeny tiny bit of pasta on his plate!Now why,you ask, did I order spaghetti and meatballs.   BECAUSE IN AN ITALIAN RESTAURANT THIS DISH TELLS YOU EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW--that's why.   If you can't make a meatball you are DONE in an italian restaurant.  If you can't make a good SAUCE you are DONE as well.  So here it is:  the italian meatball was really, really, really good.  A little on the salty side but good enough for me because I like my food with a little saltiness.  That's just me.  The mix of spices in the meatball was great--sometimes restaurants put in too much oregano.  Not here.  It was a good mix of spices.  And now for the sauce... The question is whether this sauce could stand up to my own.  Yes, my dear readers, I make a killer sauce --the mother of all sauces; the "capo di tutti capo", the cat's meow; the slurpiest sauce around!  Let me put it to you this way, if I accidentally dropped my marinara sauce on my kitchen floor, hubby would say, "skip the mop... I'll lap it up".   No, really, it's that good.  With that, I am going to tell you that the sauce met my standards.  It was pretty good.  Better than mine.? No.  But remember this is a commercial establishment, they don't do the love thing that I do with the sauce. (Please do not let your imaginations wander).   So not to digress any further, the spaghetti and meatballs was a dish I would order again.  Hubby's dish, while he said it was good, was served on a smallish oval plate that made it look like a nothing portion.  PLUS, and this is important to the restaurant management:  The chicken along with the mushrooms looked like ALPO (the dog food) had been placed on the plate.  Now, keep in mind that he tasted it and liked it--the chicken, the mushrooms, the marsala wine and the sautéed veggies--He liked it all.  Do you think I was going to mention to him that it looked like an Alpo special??  Restaurants are supposed to make dishes ,at least, look a little pretty.  Even I do so at home.  There was no parsley garnish, nothing.  I make chicken fricassee at home and it doesn't look like mush.  Yes, mush.  That's the word I was looking for.  The mushrooms made it look like mush. Hubby said he would order it again so he liked it.  Management could you work on making this dish look more professional?  My spaghetti and meatballs was nice looking--a little parsley sprinkled atop of two beautiful Mount Vesuvious meatballs; beautiful red sauce.  Nice.  So after all is said and done I am giving this place 4 stars.  Morgan, you were a great server and very patient with us on ordering (it was our first time here) .  We forgive you for bringing just ONE bread plate.  Head on out to Babbo's.  You'll have a good meal for a good price in a family oriented setting.
Impressionz=I had been wanting to try Impressionz for a long while, since it fits the profile of my favorite type of ethnic restaurant--a little-known hole in the wall with great food.  I finally received the opportunity to do so this Sat. evening, since I needed to make a Target run.  Since CM was shuttling me over and was hungry for dinner, I suggested it, and after parking in the garage, we headed a block or two over to check it out.Although I'd never had Jamaican cuisine before, I did some research on Wikipedia beforehand and learned that salt fish and ackee was a traditional dish.  Since I didn't know how spicy the jerk chicken would be, and I wanted to try a more unique dish, I had to order it when I saw it on the MTO section of the menu ($18).  CM, on the other hand, decided to stick to what he knows and went with the small jerk chicken ($10.50).  While we were waiting for our entrees, CM ordered a beef patty ($2.50), and I ordered a bottle of Ting grapefruit soda.  Although I don't eat beef, I decided to break my rule for a split second and ate a corner with a tiny bit of the filling.  The pastry was quite flaky, and the filling was well seasoned, which helped to mask the flavor of the beef.  CM assured me that the rest was quite tasty.Despite being told that MTO entrees take 20 min. to make, my entree seemed to come out faster than expected (in about 15 min., I believe, though I wasn't timing it), and CM's was brought out immediately afterward.  My entree was more savory than I would have guessed, and had just the right amount of fishiness.  The ratios of ingredients seemed well-balanced, and it was huge--so much so that the sides of rice, cabbage, and plantains came on an additional plate (see photo).  Though it came on a single plate with sides, CM's jerk chicken, which consisted of a quarter dark meat, was also portioned generously.  Between the large portion and the spiciness of the jerk sauce, he took half home for later enjoyment, along with some of the left over sides.As others have mentioned, the only part of our experience that bested the food was the service from Cecilia and her family.  Cecilia is very personable, and was very good about answering our questions about the menu.  Her daughters were there as well, and were adorable.  We could tell that Impressionz attracts regular customers, probably from the local neighborhood, by the rapport that they had with Cecilia.The quality and amount of food, as well as the caliber of service, at Impressionz lived up to the hype, and then some.  (CM agreed, saying it was better than a Jamaican restaurant he frequented in Ann Arbor.)  However, I'm not awarding a full 5 stars because (1) I felt the MTO dishes were a bit overpriced, esp. for a cash only place (even in light of the portion size) and (2) I think I would have enjoyed a different dish more (though this was my fault for choosing it...) The only other major downside was that the bathroom's currently out of service due to a flood that occurred in Mar. Nevertheless, I highly recommend checking out this neighborhood jewel! 4.5 stars.
Roberto's Mexican Food=Ok let me try this again. This is no longer the same Roberto's that was featured on Food Network. It is def under new management and/or ownership. If you go to robertosaz.com it only has the Anthem location listed and that actually explains everything to me. The staff here is not friendly and there is no one from the old crew here anymore its been like this for awhile now maybe almost a year. I kept coming back thinking that maybe with the changes eventually stuff would work itself out and get back to normal. That didnt happen here and I gave the place many many chances. It really makes me sad after going here for like a decade knowing it wasn't the same I still kept coming back here. You know what they say old habits die hard!?! They really do I was like a kid that kept going back to that mean dog and pulling its tail over and over again while ending up bit every damn time! This was the last straw for me last night. I always order the same thing here...again creature of habit. They have tried this before but they usually work with me this time the cashier tried to nickel and dime me where I ended up with a $10 burrito!! Are you fucking kidding me here!?!?! The cashier had no care what so ever on what I had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced. I'm looking for a new place now I learned my lesson and wont waste any more time on this place getting mediocre food!
Siam Thai Cusine=Disclaimer and Qualifications:I'm a midwestern gringo, but I've been here 20+ years, so can take a little heat.  My wife is half Thai, and her Mom and Aunts used to sit around prepping, cooking REAL ACTUAL Thai food (and gossiping) all day long, so she knows the good stuff.  The first time we went, she loved it so much that the second time we went and got a TOGO order, we brought home over $75 worth of food for her, I, and a 12 yo girl.  This doesn't mean three $25 meals, either,  since each entree/appetizer ranges from a little under to a little over $10.  Yea, leftovers!Instructions:1.  Hire a group of thugs to tie you up, slip a sack over your mousse-head, toss you in the back of a cargo van, and dump your pretentious, elitist butt INSIDE the front doors of Siam.2.  Enjoy the tastiest, most authentically prepared and flavored Thai food you'll likely have this side of Bangok, served by friendly authentically prepared and flavored Thai folk, in a very clean and ornately decorated, authentically prepared and flavored environment.3. Go through moral, ethical, and spiritual crisis as you decide whether it is time to forgoe your judgemental, plastic-coated, dream world where everything is pristine and sanitized, so that you may indulge in the tastes of the real world, not the Real World tm.4. Decide that you simply cannot face the ugly Glendale strip mall you know is outside those doors; have thugs kidnap you back to East Valley and drop you off at Kierland Commons, so that you can wash away the filthy feeling with an overpriced gourmet coffee amongst the beautiful people.  Pretend you didn't just start down the dark path of heroin-like spicy Thai basil & peppers.  Pretend that you won't be slinking back to the other side of the tracks to cop another score sooner than you think.  Look around at all of the fronts -- on the stores, and especially the people -- they want you to believe that they are authentically prepared and flavored, but they aren't.3/14/10Liked the ambience!   Beautiful wooden screens lined the walls; Clothed glass tables and wooden chairs.  Nice to find a place that serves tasty food and, at the same time, invests in creating a lovely space to round out the whole dining-out experience!Had very tasty eggrolls to start, and they were some of the best I've ever had anywhere.  That is, besides my Mom's lumpia!  I believe Siam Thai's eggroll filling contain ground chicken, as well as eggs.  For my entree, I had the tofu green curry (as I use this dish to compare a new place to all of the other Thai restos I've tried thus far), and while I liked it, I found the dish too spicy (ordered medium spice) and found veggies there I had asked specifically to omit due to food allergies.  I normally send items back if they don't arrive the way I ordered, but I was hungry and I thought I'd just grin and bear through the allergy attacks as long as the dish was worthy of them.  (It's not.)  Mind you, it's tasty and spicy, but the cream sauce looked "broken" (I like mine silky-smooth and creamy!), and coupled with the veggies I didn't want, let's just say I'll speak up more the next time I go!For dessert, I had the fried bananas and coconut ice cream, and oh my!  I've wanted to go back just to have this again, but alas, all my bookmarks have kept me from going back to do so :(  Soon.  So very soon...Siam, located in a tiny strip mall, may lack luster from the outside but serves a pretty decent dish of Thai cuisine!  While not my favorite place to go for Thai food, this place offers a pretty delicious bowl of Tom Kha and Duck with Pineapple Curry  The Tom Kha is rich and creamy and full of delicious coconut milk but could use more lemongrass.  Whenever duck is an option on the menu, I naturally order that as my choice of protein.  While the pineapple curry doesn't have too much of a pineapple kick, the subtle hints of it gave it a nice after-taste.  Siam does seem to go light-handed on spice so if you're feeling bold, get it a level higher than what you normally order!The place is kept very clean and the servers are pretty friendly.  I wouldn't exactly drive out of my way to come here but hey:  the food is warm, filling, and flavorful!  It's worth a try!
Daddy Macs=I've driven by Daddy Macs several times, and wondered what it was about. Last night, it was late, I was hungry, and decided to stop in.I walked in the door, seated myself (there didn't seem to be any waitstaff around), and discovered that it was "Comedy" night - though I use the term "comedy" very loosely.  The "entertainers" consisted of young African-American men, yelling "Niggah" "Sh*t" and various other profanities as loud and as often as they could.Now, I'm no prude. I get *shock* comedy. But this was just loud and juvenile. The biggest laugh came when he screamed,"Hey ladies, if you've got a clean p**sy, lemme hear ya yell!"Nobody yelled, and that silence got a laugh.When the silence is funnier than the comic, you know you're in trouble.Meanwhile, nobody comes to take an order, and I notice that none of the other tables have food. I guess I could have gone up to the bar to see if they were serving food, [at a restaurant?!] but I was beginning to feel like I wasn't going to be there long enough to enjoy it anyway.After the requisite gay, ghetto, and prostitute jokes -  the third "entertainer" came on, and started in on a White couple in the front, with "Hey! You White folks.... you know all about the KKK, right?" I thought,"That's my cue. I'm outta here."All in all, I was probably there for a half-hour.I never saw a waiter. I never had a drink or food.The "entertainment" ranged from dull to offensive.Needless to say, I now know everything I need to know about Daddy Macs. I won't be back.
K Peppers=Where is everyone? Srsly Middleton! Show up. Represent! After an exhausting... er I mean underwhelming trip to World Market Tom, Ryan and I decided it was time to make the drive west worth it. Tom had been craving Korean for some time and because I don't make decisions I was game. The interior is pretty fancy pants for a small strip off the beaten path. Nice booths, tasteful artwork, cool color palate. But the paper napkins? That's like going to L'Etoile and eating dinner with a spork.Here's the thing though, I'd eat K Peppers with a spork, with a spatula or with my own bare hands, heck I'd eat K Peppers with YOUR bare hands... it's that good. We started with Topokki, Korean rice cake and a boiled egg cooked in a sweet and spicy sauce. We all thought 2 stars (spicy) was pretty darn spicy, but the sweetness balanced it out. From there, I moved on to Bulgogi which was unbulgogievable (wah wah). Tender meat, sweet soy, some veg for good measure... it was bomb, more than I could polish off after the app, but great for breakfast. A little bummed that we were the first table there at ten after six, and the only table dining for the hour-ish we stayed. But maybe people just don't know K Pepper's brilliance just yet. Get to know.
Falling Water Cafe=***This restaurant and its breakfast buffet do not feel fresh (kind of like this Marriott, which has a very outdated decor); the breakfast buffet featured a good variety of items--bacon, sausage, breakfast, potatoes, scrambled eggs, smoked salmon, cereal, pastries, oatmeal, and an omelet bar; the food was not horrible, but a lot of it was salty; the poor lighting in the lobby (this is an open lobby restaurant) probably made the food feel worse than it actually was; service was pleasant***This Marriott has its own free self parking lot.
Mad Onion=Wings or prime rib?  Those are probably the two most common choices at this 24 hour restaurant located at the casino level of the Hooters Casino Hotel. The prime rib special is $9.95 all day and you can order 25 cents hot wings with a minimum order of ten from midnight until 6 AM.  The restaurant used to be Dan Marino's and quotes and images of the former NFL Miami Dolphins star quarterback are still a big part of the restaurant's décor.  Apparently, the recent name change to Mad Onion Fine Foods and Spirits occurred just before Thanksgiving 2009.  From a distance both specials looked decent, but I made a middle-of-the-night mistake by ordering their half pound Classic Mad Onion Burger.  The unique thing about the Mad Onion burger is having your choice of onions put on your burger.  I chose "carmalized" onions among the list which also included raw onions, sauteed onions, BBQ onions and chipotle onions.  The burger comes with fries also.At least the fries were hot in temperature because the burger was not.  The food took an excruciating amount of time to come out of the kitchen and when it finally did not only was the burger just warm but the carmalized onions were ice cold.  The half pound sirloin burger did not taste like fresh beef either.  It was a bit too ground up in texture and had a peculiar taste.  I think I made the right decision by tossing most of my food and making a run up to a 24 hour Wendy's at a nearby food court instead.The Mad Onion staff were nice though, but this place is avoidable.It's like my food was cooked then marinated in methane...Substandard.Destroy the Mad Onion! What happened to Dan Marino?! He ditched this place and turned it into a whack sack of chicken wings that shrunk! The best part about (the reason why it even has 2 stars) is that the wings are still 25 cents. They should charge 15 cents for how small the wings shrunk!Quick tip: Order the wings naked and ask for sauce on the side! They come out super soggy and oily beyond the BP accident out in the ocean!Another things that destroyed what made this an awesome late night spot is the ranch swap! What gives with that?! I mean, what restaurant even carries individual ranch dressing buckets and on top of that, CHARGES you for it! Ridiculous! Whoever kidnapped Mr. Marino and placed Mr. Onion in his restaurant needs to be found and punished for this heinous abomination! I mean, COME ON! You're in a Hooters hotel for God's sake. Represent the legendary wings chain!The only reason why I would EVER go back to the Mad Onion is when they bring Mr. Marino, the large wings, and ranch free of charge. Or if my friends forced me and played the "you're my friend and you have to support me in coming to the Mad Onion because I love this place" card.=========================================================UPDATE-- Correction! The wings are no longer 25 cents! They're $7.95 for 10 wings and fries.... Star removed!
Caffe Boa Bistro=This is the PERFECT location for me and my sister to meet inbetween. and we did before she left for Ethiopia. We gave it a try, and I was stoked because I love lunch at Caffe Boa in Tempe. I was hoping Boa Bistro would have the same spark. But sadly, it was all just hmm and we left a little confused. We split the mufaletta and this salad that SOUNDED amazing but when it was put on the table we both were like 'HUH?!'It was the chicken, almond something salad. something about california maybe? It was presented very oddly and didn't look anything like i pictured it from the description. the chicken was bland and the dressing was bland. it was unexpected in a 'i wish we ordered something else' way. the mufaletta was good, but maybe we were just so bummed about the salad. it wasn't gross or anything, it just didn't sound as good as the description. everything was fresh and clean. just soooo.......flavorless. our waiter told us it was all delicious, but he is obviously a liar. or hasn't tasted the entire menu.the patio was great. and so was the tea. maybe we'll give it another shot the next time we meet for lunch and try something else.
Station Street Hot Dogs=Shocker folks, I don't normally like hot dogs.  The only way you can hand me a hot dog I'll actually eat is if it's fresh off the grill.  With loads of ketchup...and I DO mean loads, like buckets full!  If I ever think of eating a hot dog without ketchup, the world may end.  The world kinda did tonight...a little.I ordered the New York Dog and the Sweetbread Dog, plus the duck fat fries to split with my friend.  I had to order the NYC Dog because I love me some sauerkraut.  I ordered the Sweetbread dog because it had the word "sweet" in it.  No lie.  Please don't judge, but I thought sweetbread was like cornbread (I see you rolling your eyes foodies!).  So I imagined this dog in between a roll that's actually corn bread...perhaps another creation Mr. Sousa?  Anyway, I digress... The sweetbread I actually found out is...I suggest you look it up (but a hint: it deals with hearts and throats of animals).  I'm willing to try anything so biting into the sweetbread it was almost a gel like consistency and very salty.  I'm not a salty food person (a weirdo, I know!), so this wasn't my favorite thing.  What was my favorite thing was the NYC Dog.  I know, traditional, but the dog itself was absolutely high grade meat.  It was not your typical microwaved wiener.  The sauerkraut was the right amount of tangy and crunch.  And I swear, I only put a dab of ketchup on!  Probably because I wanted to enjoy the taste of the grain mustard, which I have really become a fan of as of late.  Total winner!The duck fat fries were good, but I enjoy them a bit more crispy.  I dumped ketchup on them.  I should really just shut up about the ketchup....This really is a great, fast and fairly cheap option for the East End area.  When me and the hubby are heading over there to volunteer at the Animal Rescue League we need something fast, but something that will also taste good.  Surprisingly, there's not many options.  But now, we're saved!  Good thing we're not eating dogs and then going to see dogs, we only volunteer with the cats...phew!
Rinaldi's Italian Deli=A welcome addition to the N Phx "Black Hole" As many of you know there really are not too many unique places to eat up this way. That is changing little by little. Rinaldis is now open and serving the eager crowds. The line was out the door today and the food was flowing as fast as possible. The deli is a little small but has 12 or so 4 top tables. The problem is the chairs are a little big for the tables, therefore only comfortably allowing 2 to a table. The staff was excellent right on top of each order. No one came back with wrong togo orders or anything. The boss mentioned to the staff in a rare slow spot, "make sure the sandwiches don't look sloppy" That is cool to hear they care what goes out. it is your typical Boars Head cold cuts, with some great bread and some homemade dishes too. I had the chicken Parm sandwich. It was a full size hoagie loaded with chicken parm, sauce and cheese toasted. It was good, the bread was fresh, the chicken was good but it lacked a little flavor. The sauce needed a little more. Served with a pickle and chips. They had a whole beef brisket, just out of the oven, that looked amazing...
Panchero's Mexican Grill=I wanted to try something different for dinner, so I headed on over to Pancheros to give them a try.I knew I wanted a burrito, and I dig the fact that the tortilla is made right then and there, that's pretty sweet.I went with the grilled steak, and I was going to toss some grilled veggies on there, but after looking into the pan and seeing dried up stuck to the side veggies I quickly changed my mind.  I went with the white rice, pinto beans, meat, cheese, salsa verde and sour cream, after everything was layered inside I thought they would wrap it up, but no they took a knife and mixed everything together, had I known they were going to do that I would have asked for the salsa & sour cream to be added later, I like the layering effect. Maybe I'm weird but I do.Over all, I prefer Chipotle, I wanted to like this place, but it just didn't stack up.  The ingredients didn't look fresh, the white rice was supposed to be cilantro & lime but I can tell you there were no hints of green in the rice, and I happen to think cilantro is the best ingredient in the world but it was missing from my rice. The grilled veggies like I said where dried out and stuck to the pan, the meat was tough and cold. I just wasn't impressed over all.I met some friends for a late lunch at Pancheros Mexican Grill.  The line was long however, they kept the line moving along nicely.  When we went to find a table, most of the tables were dirty, but cleaned one off ourselves. The food was good and I the atmosphere was causal.The menu is limited, but the entrees are good.  The tortillas are freshly pressed when you order your entrée  and you can select your preferences as you move along the quick-order line. I really enjoy the chicken quesadillas and the chicken tacos.  The meat is flavorful and moist.So if your looking for an inexpensive, quick, and filling meal, give Pancheros a try.
Little Caesars=Owner is a greedy crook.Supreme pizza is $8.50, hawaiian is $6.50. Ordered half hawaiian/half supreme. When I picked up the pizza, the owner charged $13.50 for an 8 dollar pizza. What kind of scam is the owner trying to run?! The d-bag owner tried to give some BS excuse that he doesn't do half/half on pizzas & instead doubles the toppings on each half of a single pizza. WTF?! I didn't order double toppings, a-hole. Of course he doesn't tell you this when you order, he waits until you're picking up your pizza, charges you and hopes you don't notice the 70% mark-up on the price.He then tried to explain that his way is cheaper by telling me that two large pizzas would have been $15 and he's doing me a favor and saving me money. So what you just told me is that because of your little scam I just paid $13 for one pizza when I could have paid $15 for two pizzas?! You just made yourself look like an even more of an A-hole, dude.How anyone believes they can get away with trying to rip people off in the age of the internet is beyond me.P.S. I called 4 other Little Caesars franchises in the area and none of them charge 70% extra do a half/half pizza.Do you snub a place because they're cheap, and you equate cheap with inferior or sub par quality? Do you snub something because people never mention them, and they don't get reviewed, even once, on Yelp?Shame on you. SHAME ON YOU.I used to be that person. I'm guilty of all of the above, especially in regards to the pizza with the a toga-wearing guy who thinks he's funny. I know, I know, shame on me.I was "introduced" to this place when I first came to the states almost 20 years ago, I was young then and my cousin was even younger. Fast-forward almost 20 years, I found myself ordering stuff from this place while I was visiting the Phoenix metro area. He swore by this stuff. He told me how the pizza was NOT half-bad, and the price made it more appealing. 5 bucks a one topping pizza, how can anyone refuse? Additional toppings extra, and so are thin crusts and deep dish, but that's to be expected.Remember, they don't deliver. That's how the keep the prices dirt-cheap. The people there were very nice, and was not pushy about upselling anything. They also have dipping sauces, which I got the garlic butter one. They have chilled soft-drinks, and that's a good thing since it's hot here. They also have the infamous Crazy Bread. Gotta taste it to believe it.So, you ask, why did I give four stars to a place that I snubbed till this place changed my mind? Take notes, here's the formula:Cheap pizza + Ok pizza + convenient location + nice people and service + my attitude adjustment = 4 stars!Did you get that? The lesson you should learn:Don't knock it till you try it.
Scoglio's Greentree=Has been a long time since my last visit. Had a lunch meeting at Scoglio.  The restaurant has not been updated since before it was Soglio's, over 20 years is my guess; it could use some updates.  It is a popular place, was crowded.  Our server was friendly and did the refills but seemed to be in a busy and not to friendly mood.Fresh bread came out immediately and was welcome by my stomach since I as famished. My salad was good with an assortment of greens, with tomato and cucumber.  My crab cake was just OK.
The Main Ingredient Ale House And Café=Nothing makes me happier than to visit a new establishment that over delivers on all points that matter to me.  I was a loyal fan of Lisa G. and was heartbroken to see her leave. However, I've made way for TMI to fill the void and as the song goes, My Heart Will Go On.The charming Sheridan bungalow takes on a new life with a new menu, new decor, new staff and a  great experience for you to enjoy.  The ambiance is perfect if you are, as I am, one for dim lit places that play old school/neo-soul/hip hop beats while chilling with a group of friends. The interior space is relaxed and the furniture very comfy. The Drink Menu has something for everyone. Wine, draft, maybe a cocktail. My choice, the Four Peaks Hefe and a sip of a friend's dirty martini.   The menu options are great and the prices even better. Although I only had the soup, I snuck a bite of Bacon's grilled cheese sandwich and Ayesha's mac & cheese. Both were amazing and I can't wait to go back for more. The staff was extremely friendly and timely even though the place was bustling. Our table had 11 people on separate checks but our server didn't even bat an eye. Cash out, easy breezy! Thanks TMI, I'm a fan.When I was in grade school, my best friend lived next door. We would do everything together but then one day my best friend moved away. A new family moved in with another kid my age. I effing hated that kid. He had a stupid name and a stupid face and he lived in my friend's house! How dare he?!Over time, once I gave him a chance it turned out the new kid wasn't so bad. We even became friends and he played a mean second base at kickball."The Main Ingredient? Seriously? That is a tragically terrible name." Is a direct quote from somewhere in the middle of a conversation I had with my good friend Julia T about the new establishment in the old Lisa G's location. Then after arriving: "Julia, they serve sandwiches and salads. Nothing here even has a goddamned main ingredient."But ya know what? The new kid aint so bad! My sandwich (the calvano) seriously good,like SERIOUSLY, and remember I didn't want to like it at all. I also had a bite of the tuna melt and it was awesome as well. One thing I will bring up is that the booze selection leaves a bit to be desired. Crown and JD are the only two whiskey's. Seriously, new friend, fix this or I am going to be forced to make fun of you with the other kids behind your back.Defining things in the negative is dangerous, but in this case, a little negative-definition is necessary: TMI isn't a fake dive bar frequented by white kids pretending to be poor; it isn't a fake (insert European nationality here) pub; it isn't trying to serve over-priced small plates; it doesn't have super sexy low lighting or uncomfortable chairs.It is a low-key house-turned bar that serves solid food executed extremely well, alongside beer and wine that has obviously been selected with care by fans of things that taste good.The sandwiches here are really a reminder about how good a sandwich can be, flirting with the platonic ideal in sandwich-ness.  The mac n' cheese is just like mom made it, baked and crusty and rich.  The salads are simple and delicious.Happy hour is really generous - $2.50 draught beers and $4 selected glasses of wine.  The tap beer selection is better than anywhere else in downtown Phoenix, excepting the Roosevelt, which is very un-hang-outable.  I've sipped three or four glasses of other people's wines, and the wine selection is really great as well.Best of all, kind of like Casey Moore's in Tempe, the bar is starting to act as a great place to see the diversity of folks who live in the Coronado and Roosevelt neighborhoods.In the former Lisa G. spot (RIP my love) TMI is now what you will find, and apparently I am the only person in the universe who isnt madly in love with it.I came here a few weeks ago for dinner/drinks with the boy since he had heard from a co-worker that their menu was pretty delicious, and more specifically that their mac n cheese was to die for.. Well let me tell you what, I had it, and it's not that great. At least on this particular night, I was definitely not impressed. It was loaded with peppers that completely overpowered any other flavor that may have been there. The boy had one of their *awesome* grilled cheeses, which again, wasn't something i would rave about, mostly because it was so unmemorable and basic, plus I kinda hate it when a place serves mainly lunch options for dinner. I like sandwiches as much as the next guy, but not for dinner. However, they do have a decent drink menu, lots of beers, wine & even liquor, so whatever your alcoholic heart desires, you will find it here..Our service was a mess, I think we had 3 different waiters asking us the same questions over and over, then forgetting and asking them again. I don't care if the place was packed, get it together dudes.The interior was classy & cute, but also a zoo.. So packed that I couldn't even get to the bathroom, people running into our table as they walked by and at one point I watched our waiter stand for 3 whole minutes, plates in hand, waiting for people to get the hell out of the way so he could drop them on our table. Maybe I am just impatient.. Anyway I realize this place is new, so there's definitely hype, but over all, I was just really disappointed in what I had hoped would be a close match to its previous occupant. I will give it another shot, but I'm in no rush.03/12/10Four stars for the food and atmosphere, but I deducted a star for the service.  I was to meet a couple of friends for happy hour here, but I arrived almost two hours before they did.  (He was waiting to get off work and had to swing by to pick up his wife, and I was getting hungry!  They knew this, so it wasn't an issue.)  (As you can see, it's been two months since our visit, so I forgot the name of the awesome server that was first assigned to me... silly me, I know, but I can say that it was a name of Hispanic origin.  HOWEVER, I do remember quite well the name of the server that took over our party, (a fave gemstone of mine), since my original server was assigned to work the patio.  We all considered leaving, but my friends had heard a few Yelpers and me talk TMI up a few days before at the Yelp In Bloom event and wanted to check out the ales and food.)OK, onto the food!!I came to check out the happy hour app menu, which I sadly found does not exist.  While there are beverages discounted during happy hour, the list isn't very long.  I understand that there's only one or two wines by the glass on it, as well as one or two draft ales.  I think he tried the Oak Creek Nut Brown (thumbs down) and two glasses of the White Rascal (thumbs up!).  (Another testimony to the subpar service showed us by that-who-goes-by-a-jewel's-moniker is that he was overcharged by not one, but TWO beer selections.  It's always a good idea to check your receipts!).So what did I eat??  I had the terrific RB & C, made w/ roast beef, muenster cheese, and horseradish sauce on a baguette.  If you haven't already done so, you must RUN at this very moment to TMI and order one!!  Everything about this sandwich, as well as the side salad that accompanied it, was faultless!  From the deliciously aromatic, crusty baguette; melty muenster; ample portion of roast beef- cooked to juicy perfection!; and the divine horseradish sauce, I was in "thunderbolt city" with every saporous bite!  It was a battle of willpower vs. a basal desire for full sensory gratification.  Willpower won, my Mom able to enjoy the other half-sandwich later that night, but only because I was going to order the Artichoke Heaven, a dip which consisted of atichoke hearts and a blend of three cheeses, to share with my friends (they had it w/ LT chips, and I had mine w/ crostini and house-fried potato chips).  This dish went over well!!  Definitely a must-order-again selection.  Friends' selections were the Griddled Cheese and house-made salsa and LT chips.  Both sandwich and salsa were very tasty!  FYI: my friend had a hard time trying to order a Tequila Sunrise.  First, our server wasn't familiar with the cocktail.  Second, we were told by our server that the barkeep did not know what it was either.  After a few minutes, and by then, I started asking if I could get a Sidecar (no), a bartender finally came up and said that they lacked the grenadine to make a TS.  (No on the Sidecar, bec. they didn't carry lemon juice.)  Thought I should mention this.p.s.  I just remembered... when I first arrived and sat in the main dining area of TMI, I was only one of maybe three people sitting there.  I found the music to be disconcertingly loud.  I can't recall if I put in a request for the level to be lowered...  By the time my friends arrived, it was busier out in the patio and in the main dining room; we'd moved to the community table next to the bar area, and we were practically shouting at each other as we tried to carry on a conversation.  Not ideal.  At least, not for me.FYI, I heard from Matt D., the owner, that eight draft beers, two wines by the glass, and all cocktails are discounted during happy hour.  I'll have to go back soon and see if they'll make a revised Sidecar for me using lime juice!True to Downtown Phoenix, The Main Ingredient Ale House and Cafe is in the most unassuming area and you have to have an eagle eye while driving to find it.Once I entered the house situated in the historic downtown neighborhood, I noticed the homey vibe of this converted house. The patio was lit with luminous lights and guests were enjoying a casual and cozy dining experience. While the patio was lively, the inside (although cozy), was pretty empty so we opted for the outdoor option -- especially since the weather was so nice that night.Besides the atmosphere, the food at Main Ingredient is comfort food with a twist. I ordered a warm turkey "jive" sandwich which was on crunchy sourdough bread, with freshly slices of warm turkey and topped with jalapeno cream cheese. The sandwich was large, in charge and accompanied by a hefty field green salad. It was too big for me to finish more than half, but if ordered, this could be a good leftover meal. I also tried the mac and cheese with a kick of green chilies. It's listed as an appetizer but so hearty it can absolutely suffice for a meal. The artichoke heaven as a starter was hearty as well and you could easily share that with three or four others due to how rich it is. The beers to wash down the meal were tasty and they had some unique options to choose from. So for a house-converted restaurant in Downtown Phoenix, it's worth trying out if you're in the area and once you leave the hustle of 7th street and sit at the Ale House, you'll forget that you are just off a busy city street.adjectives that come to mind when someone suggests TMI:charming. quaint. refurbished. amiable. TMI represents the burgeoning scene of cenpho well, and caters to the ethos that other hip local business owners in our city have come to adopt: namely- rennovate, restore, refurbish, resurrect.the four R'swith that in mind TMI has succeeded head over heels. They've taken something great and improved on it, and stuck to a method that is key for success.The surrounding environs of 7th st seem to hone in on something, something hard to define, but when i go to places like the coronado cafe, the main ingredient ale house, the roosevelt, carlys- they all say to me: "Phoenician Renaissance"For as long as your are around, and lets hope its generations, i will frequent you TMI, and i will bring along droves of friend/foodies to further sing your praises.delicious sandwiches, salads, and an amazing beer list. a great spot for calling off of work and enjoying a lazy day.I never made it to Lisa G's but my visit to The Main Ingredient made me forget that. Simple Menu, some apps, salads and sammies. I ordered Sophie's Salad, easily made vegan with no cheese and no onion,......field greens, local tomatoes, artichoke hearts, fresh mozzarella, red onion, toasted pine nuts & fresh basil tossed in balsamic vinaigrette. I don't often get excited about salads but I was pleasantly surprised at the generous portion. It was dressed better than me and LOADED with artichokes, tomatoes, toasted pine nuts and basil. There was no skimping on toppings or fishing through the greens for the goods, every bite was magic in my mouth. I will be craving that salad in the near future and they've got a Veggie sandwich that I'd like to try as well. Can't wait to go back!It's the middle of January and 75 degrees out.  While there's no shortage of things to do outside, there aren't many dog-friendly places for that where you can sit down and eat.Jacqui J and I took out doggies to the dog park.  They're bruthas, you see, and hadn't hung out in awhile.  We had MLK day off together and spend the afternoon together.  Trying to decide where to eat with the pooches, I thought of TMI because I had seen so many people recently check in on Yelp.  Their patio is pretty big and mostly shaded.  This wasn't a day to be too concerned about shade, since it wasn't hot out.  I read the reviews ahead of time and already knew what I wanted before I even got there.  I was happy to have to take home a doggie bag, too.  I got the olives, red goat salad and the mac and cheese.  I will eat anything that includes green chiles in it.  Anything.  A few varieties of olives were served wtih fresh herbs and a dash an oil & vinegar.  I love all olives and don't always buy them for home, so it was a real treat.  They came in a little bowl, but there were about 20 of them.  The red goat salad was perfect: tons of pistachios on it, big chunks of goat cheese and strawberries.And den...and den...the mac and cheese, generously stuffed with chopped green chiles, ooey-gooey melted cheese that was crusty on the edges, the way it's supposed to be.I'll be back with Dexter.  They gave him a treat.  Oh, and my meal was treat.  I'm burping up the leftovers as I type this.I went here for a large get together over the weekend. Our waitress was really great considering the large, drunk group. :) The only thing I didn't like was the lack of fountain diet coke. It came in a cute mexican glass bottle but i prefer my diet coke to come from a fountain. I'm crazy like that. Other than that, the glass did pour me 3 refills which was PLENTY so i didn't feel jipped......except by the lack of extra bubbles that comes from a fountain cola, but i digress.I had this amazing salad. it had artichoke hearts, pine nuts, onions, mozarella, and leafy greens. top notch. everyone elses food looked amazing too. especially that damn hotdog. i wish they had a few more menu options unrelated to sandwiches or salads, but i definitely recommend. super good.Came here on a Saturday afternoon..had some wine & beer..both were fabulous...my husband really enjoyed the amber ale infused with raspberry.We decided to share the mac & cheese, not a fan of this AT ALL. Maybe it's just my personal preference...I thought it was not creamy enough, the bottom was burnt to a crisp, there was way too much green chili in it, and the very very thick layer of cheddar on top was not tasting good at all. We could only take a few bites and had to stop. We shared some vanilla ice cream & it was perfect. The service was great all around. We did have quite a few different folks helping us, but they were all wonderful, and this didn't bother me at all. We sat on the patio and enjoyed the day while looking at all the cute doggies that were coming in. They are VERY dog friendly here, and I love that!I will return and would like to come in the evening and maybe try one of their sandwiches, they looked really good as they were passing by.Eeeehhhh.....a group of us came here on a Saturday to take advantage of the patio and our beautiful weather, and I'll admit, I was so, so disappointed. I'm completely shocked it has such killer reviews.One: they don't have high chairs. Big slap in the face as a parent, if I'm being honest. You DO know you lose a customer when you so blatantly tell them their children aren't welcome...you know that, right? Not all children are misbehaved nuisances, and if I want to bring my kids out with me for a nice afternoon lunch in which we all enjoy ourselves, then I will! And you will have a high chair! And you will not rudely tell me "we don't have those" when I ask for one! Because then I get on Yelp and do crazy things like use too many exclamation points! So take a risk and order the damn high chairs. (Also let me now point out that there were several DOGS on the patio. So, I can bring my DOG to slobber and shed and just be gross all over while I'm eating, but I can't bring my child of high-chair-sitting-age?)*Rant over.Ahem. Where was I? Two: the servers were rude, slow, and all around unpleasant. Not a good vibe when you're trying to relax. (Oh wait, I bet it was my crazy kids making everyone grumpy!) We had to wait a good 10 minutes after sitting down for someone to clean our table/bring us menus/even notice we were there. Turns out half of our group didn't want to dine here because of said awful service, but they didn't mention it until after we were there and seated. Three: the food is alright, but not great. The Coney is still good (though I'm not sure it's the Best, per the New Times), and the Mac and Cheese is just alright (I personally prefer Windsor's). The hus ordered The Veg and he said it was one of the worst vegetable sandwiches he's ever had. I'm not sure why offering a decent vegetable sandwich is so difficult for many restaurants in Phoenix. Four: ambience. There was none. No music was playing, the tables and chairs were flimsy with no place settings/decorations, there's no art or plants or really anything inside or out. I probably won't ever be back to TMI, because frankly, there are just so many other places that are way better. *I understand I went totally nuts, and that not offering high chairs doesn't mean they don't welcome children, but really? COME ON.Main ingredient, oh how your deliciousness overfloweth, and your food ain't bad either!After getting suckered into a lunch with the guys from work, we flipped a coin and ended up aimed from The Main Ingredient. Let me tell you, there are worse places to end up for lunch. I wasn't sure how, but the coin was flipped between, Main Ingredient, Cartel, AND Upper Crust. I didn't realize there were 3 sides to a coin before, but apparently there is. I was torn between the Mac & Cheese and the the Red Goat. After some convincing my buddies and the waitress helped me land on the Mac & Cheese. Although, you can't really compare apples to apples here, being that the Red Goat is a salad and the Mac & Cheese is; well, Mac & Cheese, I really was torn. Let me tell you now, this was the beginning of the end for me, and I haven't looked back since. After that first bite I made an executive decision; I would be taking a vacation from my normal diet. Don't worry diet, we'll get back together someday soon, just not today and likely not tomorrow either.The Mac & Cheese here was like a lasagne of good ol' hometown delicious cheesy goodness, expecting to see a piled scoop of cheesy noodles, I was pleasantly surprised! Cooked with loads of cheddar cheese and topped with green chile, this was pure Mac & Cheese bliss.In real downtown Phoenix fashion, Main Ingredient is tucked into a renovated home, redone to give that home / cafe feel. Many of their dishes are served with a crispy crusted soft and extremely tasty bread and on a side note, ask them for a side of olive oil for dipping it in. Better for you than butter and in my opinion better tasting, and it adds a little European charm. Here's hoping your next coin flip ends all you up at Main Ingredient. Happy Dining Yelpers!I loved the patio area and the lights!! Good food and friendly service!! I went with the ever yummy cash-money!!! Oh soo gooey delicious!!! Must try!! The vibe of the place was just right!!  Very soothing and hip!!Last Friday for lunch we decided to go to Main Ingredient.  OMG,  this place has the best BLT in town.  I'm not really sure what bacon they used, but it was awesome.  So the sandwich had chipotle mayonnaise,  lettuce, tomato and the perfect amount of bacon.  Normally when I get a BLT from somewhere it only has a couple of pieces of bacon on it.    Thanks, Main Ingredient for the best BLT ever.  :)Both times I've visited The Main Ingredient, it was Mainly a disappointment.This is based on two main things. Thing 1: Nothing on the food menu on either visit jumped out, making me feel, Oh I Have To Have That! I had the Jive Turkey on my first visit and the Cash Money on my second. Both were good sandwiches but again neither made me yearn to come back in a hurry...Thing 2: The service is average at best, in fact, on our second visit the service... errr... server was awful. I side stepped from saying all the service was bad because actually the bus staff were great. They were attentive, friendly, and kept asking if we wanted our waters refilled. Our server on the other hand, never put in our appetizer ordered and overall just seemed flighty and was inattentive. After a while, when she realized she hadn't put in the order she came over and apologized, but it was downhill from there. I don't know if she was embarrassed or what, but she then got even less attentive. They weren't busy either... It was just bad... As far as the vibe, I like the old house reused as a restaurant atmosphere. Although both times we've eaten here, we didn't sit inside, but instead chose the patio. Overall, an okay place. It's worth checking out once, but this second visit will more than likely be my last.DOWN TOWN GEM!! That's what this place is. The renovated 1920s bungalow turned restaurant is so perfect. We stepped inside this place, and as it was darling inside, it just turned into patio weather that day. And for me... That's the only option when you have a nice patio with patio seating still available. So we sat at a long kind of bar top outside to look out on the down town street corner. They have a place to give your dog a drink, a place to park your bike, and all kinds of down town goodies. They had a nice selection of craft beers. They were on Happy Hour. It seemed to me that they are always on happy hour. But I didn't find a happy hour menu. We were just please that when we got the bill they were much cheaper than what was posted on the drink menu. The food menu was filled with delicious, and different options. We decided to do one a little out of the ordinary, and one staple dish. The first meal was their Cash Money....house-made cashew butter, Red Pepper-Cabernet Jelly, & banana, on sourdough. It was a great spin on a traditional PB&J. Makes me want to experiment at home. I do think that next time I will ask for a little extra Red- Pepper-Cabernet Jelly though. The second dish we got  was The Acapulco Cheesesteak......juicy roast beef, Oaxacan cheese, griddled red pepper & red onion, cilantro, & house-made chipotle mayo, on baguette. This is THE BEST Cheesesteak I have EVER HAD. My husband agreed. And he is a Cheesesteak fanatic. That cheese, with those perfectly cooked red peppers, and that chipotle mayo... You CAN NOT go wrong. And after all that, the bill was not bad at all. We were pleasantly surprised. We cant wait to go back and try more.
New China Super Buffet=A signed picture of a smiling LaToya Jackson greets you as you enter. The staff is friendly, the restaurant is spacious, and more than 80 items are offered, dessert included. But the food is far from memorable. A lot of the items were bland - even my favorite, fried chicken - and those which were not were sub par even for a buffet. And don't bother with the sushi; I've come to the conclusion that if you don't have a sushi chef preparing the sushi behind a sushi counter, it's probably not worth it. The establishment will probably survive, though. It looks like it's been there forever and seems to have a loyal customer base from Sun City. The perpetual bumper-to-bumper traffic on that part of Grand Avenue on the drive back to Phoenix was a fitting conclusion for this buffet excursion.
Yagyu Yakiniku=Yagyu has been on the radar for a good while since many Vegas locals have spotted their "Yakiniku" sign.  Apparently, they opened up this week and Philip T. was so kind to remind us that it had finally opened.It's what I would call Korean barbecue meets the finer end of Japanese quality meat.  Yakiniku means "grilling meat" and it's hard to separate the two from just regular good ole fashion Korean BBQ.I was pretty excited when I walked in the restaurant - clean lines, large tables with exhaust chimneys for grilling, and a thermometer announcing the beer was 29 degrees.However, when I saw the menu, I was disappointed.  It was very simple and basic.  I was a bit turned off.  But since we were there already, I just had to try it.  The waitresses also gave us two dipping sauces - a Japanese soy sauce with mirin and another one I can't remember.* Pork Toro ($6.75) - Twelve pieces of fatty pork sprinkled with salt and pepper.  We threw them on the grill and yes, they were amazingly delicious and fatty.* Prime Beef Tongue ($9.25) - Seven pieces of fresh beef tongue and went quite nicely with the lemon juice and sesame oil/salt concoction.* Ribeye ($7.75) - Six or seven pieces of beef, along with three pieces of veggies.  Also, very tasty and fresh.Initially, the prices don't seem too bad.  But I knew we were hungry and if were going to stick around, the bill would have been costly.  I thought we would be able to enjoy a nice meaty dinner, but seeing the direction of the costs, it looked like it would be a pricey meat dinner.  I don't really like how everything is a la carte - kimchee, garlic, lettuce, rice, etc.  With all the Korean restaurants in town, you get used to getting all that other stuff included.And like john h.'s friend, our friend thought some of the waitresses were cute, but that's his fever.Service was good, a bit over efficient this first week of business.  We had at least three different girls ask if we were ready to order, and we were not.  I think they are just trying to be out there, but it can get suffocating.The exhaust doesn't work that great because tears were welling up from all the smoke coming from our grill. Overall, I think it would be good for a snack or light meal, but not for a hearty meal with friends.I really misjudged this place the first time I ate here, well cause for one. I didn't know what to order.  After eating here a second time, I feel like the place deserved its justice.  I do now have a better understanding of what to order, and how to order it.  I never understood why the prices were so high, untili the waitress came out and explained it to us.  The reason why it's $8.95 or higher a plate for a couple slices of meat, is because they're giving you high quality meat.  They can't do an all you can eat option, because it would cause them to go broke.  With those pieces of meat I can't complain, they were so tender and amazingly satisfying.  Don't be confused in mixing this with korean bbq, in fact there is nothing korean about it, except for the fact that they give kimchi and pickled cucumbers as sides.  My friends and I ordered 2 of the family specials at $39.95 a plate.  It came with 3 types of meat (we ordered prime), beef tongue, and chicken.  OMG, the kalbi is sooooo melt in your mouth delicious.  Try not to cook it all the way, and have the meat be a little pink.  Trust me, the juices will intensify your tongue with a booming blast of flavors! We then ordered another round of kalbi and some other type of meat.  I think this has been one of the best quality meats I've had at a Yakiniku restaurant, for a reasonable price.  The atmosphere of this place is good, the waiters/waitresses weren't rude and they sit you down immediately after walking in.  The food preparation is fast, and they're not bad with splitting the checks.  It was a good encounter in chinatown, where I'm always faced with bad service. All in all, I would return again. Maybe with a group, because all together the bill came out to $120.  But with the groupon, we ended up saving $100.00.  Thank you groupon!
Grimaldi's Pizzeria=The name "New York Pizza" conjures up a predictable image in the heads of most people, and to those lucky enough, an intense and blissful memory.  This kind of pizza, large, floppy and often sold by the slice has been imitated in one way or another in every corner of the country to mixed results.  But there is another sort of New York pizza that predates the style most (New Yorkers included) are familiar with. It's the kind of pizza made in a small handful of ancient pizzerias in New York city like Lomardi's, Grimaldi's and Totono's. It's thin crusted with a sweet tomato sauce and a dusting of parmesan and/or romano, some dried oregano and fresh basil and a generous drizzle of olive oil. Mozzarella is used sparingly, about half as much as you'd expect. This is the style of the very first pizzas made in America by Neapolitan immigrants.  The distinguishing factor today is the once-common coal-fired brick oven running about 900 degrees that's capable of charring the crust before it browns the cheese.  The result is a striking palette of black, light brown, white, dark green and about five shades of red.I've never been to Grimaldi's in Brooklyn, but I have been to Totono's. And this style, the so-called New York Neapolitan, was one I thought I could only score in NYC.  Through the magic of Yelp, I found this improbable outpost while looking for a hassle-free, off the strip locale for a family dinner. Problem is, I talk too much and felt the need to find a real gem.  This couldn't have been easier.  I was shocked to see that NYC's favorite pizzeria had franchised, but this looks like a small chain run by a nephew of the original owner, with his blessings, assistance and recipes.  We were quickly seated through the help of a call-ahead quasi-reservation at the best table in the house, right next to the pizza prep station.  The pies were nearly flawless.  I went with extra basil and I sampled the pepperoni and sausage. There were six of us, all northeast natives, two of which have lived in Italy, and all of us ranked this as our favorite or near-favorite pizza ever.  Is it my favorite?  I'm not sure, but it's 2nd or third at worst.  It has to be the best in Vegas and it will be a mandatory stop every time I'm in town.They don't have a line out the door yet, so check it out before the word spreads.  Service is attentive and polite, which isn't very "East Coast" of them, but that's one part of back home that I don't miss. Five mother-f'n stars.DAMN!  Simply the best!  I got a coupon for a free pizza so my lady and I decided to come back on our way out of Vegas this past weekend. We got a small mediteranean salad and a large pepperoni and garlic pizza.  This is perfect pizza in every possible way.  Crispy crust, charred bottom, fresh mozz, savory pepperoni and great garlic.  Just flat out awesome!  Its definitely in the top 5 pizzas I have consumed in my life. If you have never been, please go!  Its by far the best pizza you can get anywhere outside of New York!small pizza was like a medium at other places. it was divided into 6 slices evenly. the pizza crust was delicious - thin and lightly burnt - just the way i like it!! got the pepperoni and mushroom toppings - i like the pepperoni, it was different and tasted really good. the pizza had the perfect amount of sauce, service was good. I like the atmosphere of there restaurant and that you can see two pizza guys tossing the pizza dough - that was amusing to watch.next time, i'll ask for extra basil!Still the best!  I came here straight from the airport and decided to try out a new combo.  I got a personal sausage and onion pie.  Great flavors!  Friendly staff and great pizza as always!  I need a teleportation device so I can go to the different Grimaldis across the US whenever I want.  If I am ever in a city that has one, it is a must do!I am not a huge fan of this place. I feel it is all hype. Seriously. The pies I have tried were average and taste and everything is above average in price. The restaurant itself is warm and inviting with brick walls and red and white checkered table clothes, but it feels like a scam when they bring out the pies and then the inflated bill. At least I was with good friends this night.The food is nothing to write home about at all. I've had the antipasto salad which was ordinary. The white pizza with garlic and sausage and onions as toppings. Please tell me I am not the only one who feels these pies are dry? I'm not an extra sauce kind of girl, but we have always had to ask for a side of sauce with the pizza. Sausage is tasty. I will give them kudos for that. I've also had pizza with red sauce and sausage. It still seemed sauce deficient. Bread basket? It might as well be Wonder Bread. It was lacking in freshness, flavor and flare. They get two stars for serving booze and for decent service. That's it. I'd rather microwave Totinos Pizza Rolls in the comfort of my own home than be seen at Grimaldi's again.As much as I mostly loathe Vegas after having been obligated to visit for so many conventions and trade shows over the years, the outer reaches are even worse. WTF is this, Irvine in the desert?If it wasn't for the divine blessings of Dave G and Steven N I would have circled back to the freeway after gazing upon this strip mall hell stretch. Once extracting myself from the Stang my initial impression of the  exterior was also a let down. Faak, I drove this far out of my way for this? But as soon as I entered and sat at the bar I was greeted in the most enthusiastic way by Alex. The wear of 2 nights of Vegas debauchery was quickly dashed by this consummate pro. This is the guy you will want to hire as your front of the house person if thinking about opening a restaurant. Hell,  I would hire him to watch over my daughters and secret cache of gold, well that is if I had either.First up was deciding on a glass of vino. I chose the Coppola Directors Cut Zin ($12 per glass). For my pizza Alex and I agreed that I should keep it simple since this was my first time kneeling at the alter of NY Pizza heaven. I went with shrooms, pepperoni, onions, and olives. Damn fine pizza indeed. Perfectly baked hand spun crust, very fresh high quality toppings, absolute perfection. Here is where you go for that elusive Vegas hangover cure.Contrary to the brilliantly funny review by Jaime (http://www.yelp.com/biz/grimaldis-pizzeria-las-vegas-2) I can think of another word besides the eff one.....Yum!One of the best pizza's in town (NY thin style pizza). The staff is always so attentive. The bartender, Anthony always goes out of his way to make sure we have a great time.  You must save room for the freshly made cheesecake.  I've never tasted anything as delicious.  I would also recommend the Caesar or Greek salad, both are an excellent addition.BaaaaaM!! Upping to 5 stars. Sure, some of the best NY style pizza to be had anywhere, including NY where the original Grimaldis was born. But the service here is unparalleled, especially for a pizza joint. This time we had the immense pleasure of being helped by Joelle. She is definitely on it like Blue Bonnet. Patient in explaining the menu and pizza sauce variations etc. Also very efficient and fun loving too. I brought several family members here for my off to the airport meal, and we all had a blast with Joelle as our enabler. And this was on a random Monday lunch when you expect most restaurants to have their B team. I have a feeling they don't have a B team here. Thanks again Grimaldis for another 5 star service experience.WHERE: Eastern & Richmar (inside the plaza, right by Cafe Rio)WHY: If you're craving legit New York style pizza, this is the place to be!WHAT: I never thought for once that I would be able to taste the difference between pizzas until I came here.  For years, I've always thought that pizza was just pizza! Little did I know, pizza here is beyond Little Caesar's!I am a part of a charity, and we actually held a charity event here a few months ago, and it was the first time I've ever stepped foot into this place. I mean, I've seen it around, but never got to trying it.  Let me tell you! The entire staff including the manager were all wonderful, accommodating, and super friendly!  They had plenty of recommendations (Everthing was basically recommended, and I'm going to have to agree!)Note: It is all thin-crust goodness! From the classic sauce, to the white sauce, all the way to the pesto sauce-- all G double O D = GOOD! There is also a list of toppings you may choose from (tomatoes, mushroom, SUN DRIED TOMATOES, anchovies, and the list goes on), and also different sizes of pizza. I'd recommend the biggest one (you know, so you can save the rest for later. You gotta strategize!!). So about the pizza, I'll leave it at that. Now it's your turn to try it!Now onto the desserts! I am not a huge fan of cheesecake, but I'll definitely eat a slice here! There is a variety to choose from as well (RECURRING THEME: so many to choose from, all so GOOD)! I have personally tried the oreo cheesecake (I highly recommend), original NY style, and the pumpkin cheesecake... which were all just perfection melting in my mouth! Yes, melt it does. The consistency of the cheesecake is just so perfect, probably why I'll only like cheesecake here at Grimaldi's!! Aside from the cheesecake, you must try the cannoli!!! JUST DO IT!FUN FACT: Grimaldi's has a unique water system, where their water comes directly from NY, to get that authentic NY style pizza. DID I GET YOU NOW??...I HOPE SO... GO NOW! THERE ARE SEVERAL LOCATIONS AROUND THE CITY =DSo we meet again. Me and Grimaldi's. I have to say I have seen the light. In the form of a white pizza.....I forgot I was a part of their Birthday Club and low and behold I get the email wishing me Happy Birthday in the form of a free pizza. It didn't end up being completely free, but I don't care. What I do care about is I tasted the glory in their white sauce pizza with sausage. It was garlicky, it was crispy and slightly chewy and just the right amount of every ingredient. I would have liked a little more fresh Basil, but that is the story of my life. The sausage was savory and spicy without overpowering the other ingredients.This pizza was just what I needed and I have even almost gone back. I know, it's insane.Downfalls. Because you know I gots sum;)1. Loud, loud, loud. I'm not sure if it's because of the flooring or brick walls, but I could not think it was so terribly loud and it gave me extreme anxiety. My hearing is better than most so imagine being able to hear twenty conversations at once. Yeah, bad news bears. Next time I return I will be wearing headphones.2. Bright lights. Pet peeve is bright lights in a restaurant in the evening. I don't need to see or hear the fifty kids fondling their raw dough, wasting the parm on the table and pretending to make their own za. I also don't need to see my date's pores. Ever.3. 4pm. Whatever you do 4pm is not the time to come to Grimaldi's. They do something to the oven at that time for about 20-30 minutes and you cannot get a pizza. Instead you have to eat a boring salad with a bitter dressing and stare at each other. You can't talk because you can't hear each other over the noise. I really think the chef might just be celebrating 4:20p everyday getting erie mon. Whatever he did my pie tasted like a million bucks so keep on keepin on Chef pizza dude. Will I return? Oh hellz yeah. Just for the Large White Sauce with Garlic and Sausage and extra Basil pie. Kudos Grimaldi's for redeeming yourself. I am feelin' you big time. Until we meet again my new white saucy friend.Decided to have dinner far away from the strip thinking it would be way better overall. I don't know if we were wrong or right but this place surely disappointed us. It started out first with the beer selection. Okay, not a big deal as food is more important but they're out of a beer we chose and they didn't even offer a suggestion. We ordered a large pizza and got two toppings (sausage and mushrooms). I could literally count all the sausage toppings and mushrooms were just as sparse. For a place that charges by the topping, we felt ripped off! Service wasn't that much better. The table nearby had more food and drinks and could tell they got better service the entire time because of it. Ridiculous for the party of two! By the time we are almost half the pizza, it became rubbery and impossible to cut with a fork and knife, bleh! We had one slice left over and decided to get it to go. When we tried eating it later that evening it was disgusting! Needless to say we won't be returning to this or any of the other Grimaldi's locations.A chain pizza place that can actually deliver, no pun intended. I have driven past this place a million times, but never ventured in because there are plenty of places to eat on Eastern Avenue without hitting up a cross country pizza chain. When in Henderson, on a Friday night, after eleven, the pickin's are slim and I was tired. I was "pizza chained" into submission. I came in, bellied up to the bar, and ordered a Goose Island and Caesar salad. While perusing the menu for pizza options my salad quickly came and it was good. I mean it's a Caesar salad, with fresh lettuce and solid dressing. You really have to try hard to mess up a Caesar salad. I ordered a personal pizza (12in) with ricotta, sausage, basil, black olives, with a pesto drizzle. This pizza was very good and also came out fast and fresh. The crust was crispy and the ricotta was the perfect addition to the marinara and pesto collaboration. This was plenty of pizza for one person and the perfect sharing size. I like the fact that I can build my own pie and the process was mostly painless. Good pizza, not amazing, but I would come back for the service and the beer selection. Grimaldi's had done its job, I had a full belly, light buzz, and was ready for bed!The Boyfriend and I indulged in a date night and of course we chose or favorite place, Grimaldis! I wanted to update my review because once again we had a perfect experience. Bf wanted to try the spinach salad (I have a hard time not ordering the Caesar because it is my favorite), but the spinach was quite good. I appreciate that they never scrimp on the toppings. Now to the good stuff... Pizza. This pizza is my absolute favorite. I have to hold myself from eating the whole pie! This time we ordered spicy chicken, sun dried tomatoes & spinach and I don't know if I'll ever ordered another variation. It was perfection! I also love the Layer Cake Malbec and we couldn't leave without an order of cheesecake for takeout. So yummy! The service was great. Kimberly was very attentive & friendly. She got a little busy towards the end of our meal, but she communicated and made sure we had everything we needed. I'm so glad this place has been able to stay consistently delicious. Thanks Grimaldis, I can't wait for my next slice!
Teakwoods Tavern & Grill=Portions: HugeService: Top NotchAtmosphere: Awesome for loud groups and familiesThis place is a great basic restaurant for groups and families. It lies in the old Vine/McKenna's Tavern location, and while the decor isn't anything fancy, the service was fabulous and the food was really good and large portions. So some of their TVs are old school, who cares. They have great drink prices and daily specials as well as plenty of flat screens. They were really good accommodating all my food allergies and they serve cider, so I'm a happy camper. And, I love the fact that I can toss my peanuts on the floor and make a major mess with my 2 year old without anyone giving me the stink eye.
Burrito Drive=As much as I've come to love their burritos, I'm giving up on Burrito Drive. I've tried over the summer to keep my enthusiasm but I'm not trying any more.The only good thing about this place is the food.  The bad things, listed here, have caused me to walk away: (1) slowness of service, (2) late deliver times, and (3) inaccuracy of the orders.(1) If I place an order over the phone to pick up at your location, don't tell me to be there in 10 minutes when, 10 minutes later, you haven't even started on my order.  Also, don't say, "No, it will be ready in 10 minutes" when I offer to be there in 15 or 20 minutes.(2) If you tell me that the order will be delivered in 30 to 50 minutes, don't show up in an hour.(3) If I order chips and salsa, bring me the damn salsa.Full disclosure: I have no fucking clue where this place is. What is a Brearly Street anyway?  So many questions. What I do know is that when I'm in Madison for a couple days I eventually have a pretty civilized conversation with my stomach. It goes like this:Stomach: Burrito?Me: We just had breakfast.S: Yeah, but burrito.Me: They don't open until 11.S:  Ok so burrito at 11?Me: Maybe.S. Don't you dare maybe me I will fucking end you.Girlfriend: Who are you talking to?Me: What? I'm not talking to anybody. Who would I be talking to? You're crazy. How do you feel about burritos for lunch?Girlfriend: Again? OK. (leaves room)S: That's right, bitches. Come to daddy, braised pork burrito.So roughly 30 minutes after I'm verbally abused by one of my own internal organs a guy magically shows up with a tasty treat for me. I like the braised pork burrito, the high roller burrito and the steak quesadilla. When I eat them my stomach stops saying mean things to me and I don't have to cry myself to sleep.
Mamita's=YIKES!!! I had no idea that they were in the middle of a political fight with food carts AND that they were closed down not too long ago by the health department. http://vegas.eater.com/archives/2012/04/10/mamitas-stays-closed-after-health-district-reinspection.phpThis was one of those -let's be spontaneous moments. Just makes me realize that I need to stay on top of my restaurant research and not just take a chance!Anyway I had their shrimp dish with garlic. She brings me pollo.. I have her take it back and she brings me the shrimp dish. The shrimp must have been in the sauce for 10 minutes - totally overcooked.. Yikes I say again!  We had stepped out from the yelp event to have a looksee in the funky neighborhood and the Mamitas/CUBAN neon sign drug me right over there.  When we got inside it reminded me of some of the mexican restaurant dives in Portland and that's a good thing. I should have realized that there were mostly only white faces eating their food and stepped back out though.
Club Sandwich & Deli=I finally found a spot close to work that offers some pretty decent food at a considerable value.  I got take-out from Club Sandwich today.  I received a tip from another co-worker to "call ahead" to order or I would be waiting my whole lunch break for my lunch. So me and another co-worker decided to call and place our order for pickup.  When I got there our orders were mostly done.  They have weekly specials, todays was order any original sandwich and get a cup of soup for free.  They had other daily specials advertised in the restaurant but not on their website.  I opted to get an Original Sangwich Bavarian Style.  They offer your choice of grilled local steak or free-ranged chicken, and the Bavarian comes with onions, pickles, swiss cheese and black forest mustard on a ciabatta bread.  They advertise that they also have lettuce and tomato on them but there was none on mine.  I am not sure if I had to ask for this but seems as though they forgot.  They also ran out of their soup of the day, beef tortellini, so I went with the Texas Chicken Chili.  The meal was only $6.25 plus tax.  Not a bad deal for a home style lunch.  The sandwich was pretty tasty, just a little too much bread to steak ratio, but flavors were savory .  The soup strangely appeared to have no chicken.  In fact I proposed the opinion of my co-worker to identify the meat.  Indeed we agreed beef.  Good thing I like beef,  but not sure why they would call it chicken chili.  The chili had a lot of beans and tomatoes in it.  Not spicy, but a good flavor, yet a little oily.  All considered this is definitely a worthy choice for lunch.
Wooden Vine Wine Bar & Bistro=I've been intrigued by Wooden Vine every time I walk by, but rarely had occasion to stop in. On a recent weekend evening I finally caved and decided to have a glass. My overall impression after one visit was "meh."Let's talk wine. They do have a pretty decently constructed wine list that represents most parts of the globe (though it did feel a little California heavy on my visit, not that there's anything wrong with Cali wines). I ordered a glass of a slightly obscure cabernet that I had not had before (since I like to try new things), and it was meh. The server really couldn't tell me anything about it before hand, but we'll get to the service in a minute.  First, let's talk about price.  Given that I work in the wine industry, I'm aware of the customary markups. But this list seemed a little on the pricey side, compared to what I'm used to. Could be that I'm a cheap date, or maybe it's the uptown atmosphere.Which leads me back to the service. Aside from no one in the room really being able to talk intelligently about the wines I was considering when I asked,other than offering scant more than what the menu stated, we were met with a coldness from the staff that honestly made me a little uncomfortable.  I felt my presence was an inconvenience to them. Maybe it's a byproduct of serving mostly Center City banker-types and they are giving their usual crowd what they expect, but at the least a smile never killed anyone.My opinion at this time, is that there are better options in the QC. I'll give it a couple months and try Wooden Vine again and see if my opinion is swayed.
Frank & Albert's=Not only did I enjoy sitting outside for a lovely ladies business lunch at Frank & Albert's last week, but I enjoyed the best Cobb salad ever!  I'm picky about chicken and this was excellent quality and delicious rotisserie chicken they used.  The combo of the other ingredients (lettuce, tomato, egg, avocado, bacon, and black olives) along with the green goddess dressing was superb.  It was a beautiful presentation too!My dining companions' meals looked amazing as well.  I saw the Biltmore Bistro Burger, the Grilled Fish Tacos, and the B.A.L.T. (their Tuesday Blue Plate Special).  We devoured pretty much everything on the table too...The service was a tad on the slow side but it was also a packed restaurant.  I will have to return for breakfast, dinner, and/or happy hour too as all of their menus look outstanding.  The bar/drinks menu alone has something for everyone with economy friendly prices.  If you have not yet been to the Arizona Biltmore, this new restaurant is reason to go... and since this year marks the Biltmore's 80th Birthday, there is a ton of history in the resort as well.Located inside the Biltmore, this place is an awesome restaurant to meet clients or friends for lunch.  I ordered a Margherita Pizza and some Iced Tea.  The Margarita Pizza was superb!  Very good and just the right size too....not too large & not too small.  I left satisfied.  The Iced Tea was very good too....I think I drank 5 or 6 glasses!Of course, the service was outstanding as well.  It's no wonder why there were several tables and booths with people conducting business....it's a great place for that.Return Factor - 96%Immerse yourself in a setting inspired by Mr.Frank Lloyd Wright himself and savor some of the better Southwestern infused upscale comfort food this side of anything offered at Kai.  It truly captures the essence of its famous namesake.
IHOP=Came here for National pancake day where you may donate dollars for the free short stack of plain buttermilk pancakes.  Added hash browns and an egg, but my server forgot to add the egg order.  I reminded him of the omission after a few minutes and told him I didn't want it anymore, but a manager brought one over, anyway.  Hash browns were OK, crisped the way I requested it, but the pancakes tasted very sweet, and I hadn't even added any of the syrup I'd brought, not like any other kind of pancake I've had at local breakfast places, such as Good Egg, Snooze, Soul Cafe, and even U.S. Egg.  I ate one at the restaurant, and took the leftovers home, but they turned rubbery the next day and was inedible.  I could taste the sugar left on my teeth when I tried to take a bite...I won't be back for the free pancakes, but perhaps, in a pinch*, I could have more of the crispy hash browns, bacon, and eggs.*Thanks to Jeffery A., who made me realize I didn't have to throw the baby out with the bath water!
Pita Jungle=It's hard to keep up with all of the new Pita Jungles in the Valley, but I'm doing my best to make it to each one.  Today was the day for me to finally try the Fashion Square Jungle location and it did not disappoint!Laura L and I were doing a tad bit of shopping and we worked up an appetite for lunch.  We would've likely gone to one of the sit-down restaurants in the mall but we were limited on time since she had a flight to catch.  It's nice to have a decent option in the food court as in the past I've gone to Paradise Bakery or Panda Express.Laura went with a gyro and I had a small greek salad with a falafel ball on the side.  I enjoyed my meal despite having to eat it in the middle of the crowded mall food court.  The extra bonus?  They even have Sriracha in little cups on the side!While I wouldn't seek out this PJ location, it comes in handy when you're at the mall... Keep up the good work Pita Jungle peeps.  Next stop? Downtown in the works I hear!i dont know why i didn't fall in love with pita jungle sooner. i work right next to the mall so the food court is super convenient for us. let me tell you a story of how i ate here everyday for lunch for a week. i ordered a standard gyro with no pickles (they put pickles on their gyros and i find that disgusting) my coworker, jen, ordered the pasta salad with chicken on top. mine was delicious and i tasted hers. hers was so good! i was like, that's what i'm ordering tomorrow.the next day we went again and i ordered the chicken pasta. while waiting for the food to come out someone in front of me picked up their order of a hummus trio with chicken on top and a side of pita.the next day jen asked where i wanted to go to lunch. i said pita jungle and i got my hummus trio. and the trend continued. their food is so good!!!! and its like $8!! and since i work nearby i get a discount! today i had a side of chicken breast with super fresh mushrooms. i watched them steam them, then put them in a pan with w tons of garlic, red wine, and seasoning. some of the best mushrooms i've ever had and it was a HUGE order of mushrooms.i love this place!06/16/112.5 stars.Was hungry and decided to try the new addition (a few months, anyway) to Scottsdale's Fashion Square's food court.  Decided to see if the hummus http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pita-jungle-scottsdale-2?select=AxUkQfJnvEHNTadsybTnsw#AxUkQfJnvEHNTadsybTnsw was just as tasty as the ones at the restaurants across the valley.  Decided to round the meal with a salad, as well.  The presentation of the food wasn't very appetizing...** The prices of what you pay for here are about the same you'd pay at the stand-alone restaurants, so i'd suggest just dining at the restaurants to get the added ambience, rather than sit at the food court using styrofoam plates and plastic boxes and utensils.***  Atmosphere would be more relaxed, as well.  However, if looking for healthier options at Scottsdale Fashion Square's courtyard, then Pita Jungle is one of the very few.**I tend not to return to places that use styrofoam cups and plates.  Sorry, but it's my way to help reduce the amounts of styrofoam that enter landfills.***Note to PJ: Please consider sourcing paper plates and biodegradeable utensils, instead.  Most people in your target demographic won't mind paying slightly higher prices for the switch!i've always been a fan of the pita jungle franchise. whether it's their Chandler location, and their fantastic servers, or the Tempe locale and their easy access along the lightrail corridor- pita jungle is usually a sure fire bet. I've been watching the progress of their dwn twn location for a good couple months now and anticipating the days when i could leisurely stroll down 3rd ave and grab myself some of their tasty treats.When they finally opened i was pleased. It wasnt until last night however that i actually stopped in for a bite.around 9 o'clock pm they have their reverse happy hour, a great time to drop in catch some drinks and wash them down with their tapas; an assortment of their appetizer items that you can order for anywhere from $1 - $3 per tiny plate, and generally due to my cheap and stingy nature anything under $5 i am a big fan of.sampling delicious appetizer items ranging from their spanish style "gambas al ajo", to the yummy hummus concoctions to potato infused garlic dip, dolmades, mozarella tomato and basil with balsamic, to their falafel you can really load up and get a feel to the swagger they portend. Our server was cute, friendly, and charmingly alt. if not a little unsure of the menu she was perky and willing to find all the answers to our various questions regarding the menu. after all was said and done my brother and i had shared several plates of tapas and left quite satisfied with a meagre bill of only $16. Pita Jungle is a great option to the late night foodie scene of downtown, a def. stop.I don't think it was that bad. I can't believe the low stars that some people are giving this place. I thought the new location was fabulous! I went there with my friend Sage and Billy last night and enjoyed a nice dinner. It was Billy's first time there and he got the mozzarella and tomato appetizer and some chicken entree. Sage got the shawarma and quesadilla. Sage said the shawarma tasted different, but good. Maybe it's because they have a different cook. We've been to the other locations several times and have always enjoyed them. I ordered a tomato basil soup and a vegetarian burger. The only thing that's strange was the burger. They used  two pieces of toast instead of a burger bun. That was weird. Why call it a burger when it looked more like a sandwich? However I still like this place. Definitely a great addition to the downtown location.Granted, the ambiance at this location is completely different than any of the other locations I've been to, I think this is such a pretty space! I was especially impressed that despite all the concrete and block, it wasn't as noisy as some other Valley restaurants that share design elements. As for the food and any menu recommendations, I like the: Red Pepper Hummus Gambas Con Ajo (5 shrimp, loads of garlic and tomato. Hint: the description says there's cilantro. I HATE cilantro and I like this dish.) Spicy Chicken Wrap (packed with chicken, beans and rice -- big enough to share!) Broiled Fish Sandwich (My fish was cooked perfectly here. There was way too much bread, though. I wound up eating most of the fish with a fork and leaving most of the bread) Fruit & Cheese Fantasia (A hit with my family. It's huge!) Wine List (they have great selections! I can always find something I like.) Perhaps my least favorite thing on the menu: One Thousand Beans because it has tempted me more than once and then proved to be beyond bland -- flavorless. Blech!I've always been a fan of Pita Jungle, but this location takes the cake for service!I call before I leave the office to get an order to go.  They tell me 15 minutes.  When I arrive 15 minutes later, my order is ready!  The service here is always friendly and they know my name.  The place is clean, too.The back patio is huge and they have free wifi.  There's even a small bar outside, looking in.  I've never seen it completely empty. So glad we finally have a Pita Jungle in CenPho!!!Generally speaking I am not the hugest fan of Pita Jungle, but I really enjoy this particular location. It is large, has a great atmosphere, friendly staff, and an awesome patio.My favorite thing about PJ is their INCREDIBLE happy hour. They do a huge selection of tapas for $1-2 each! You can get a few small plates and try multiple things and have your bill, with drink, come out under $10. Slammin! Tapas items: Hummus Trio, Garlic Dip, Sauteed Mushrooms, Tomato and Mozzarella, Olives, Taziki, Some Lemon Chicken Dish, Olive Oil and Pita, and Falaffel. I'm sure I missed a few others. They also do $1 of cocktails and beers, and have $5 draft margaritas. HH ends at 6pm. Generally I think the food is pretty bland, but I have also come to love the cilantro jalapeno hummus, the 1000 bean entree, and the Caribbean salad. I also enjoy their falaffel. I'm not really sure what would make PJ a 5-star for me other than all around improvement on the flavor of the food. Maybe I am just picky.First time eating food from Pita Jungle.  I've heard so much about this place, I couldn't wait.  I was at a client meeting in Downtown Phoenix and since the meeting went over the lunch hour, they asked if we wanted to grab something to eat and someone mentioned Pita Jungle....awesome.I ordered the Falafel Pita.  It was pretty good.  The Falafel was cooked just right with a hard outer shell and moist and tasty center.  The Pita and Veggies were good too.Overall, it was a very satisfying meal and we were able to power through our meeting.  I want to come back and try different menu items.Return Factor - 80%

You will need to call two hours in advance for beef ribs. Visa and Mastercard are accepted.I highly recommend this place!I have been on a quest to find 5 star worthy BBQ in the Burgh, and by golly, this is it!  My friend mentioned to me a couple of weeks ago that she'd been wanting to try Showcase, since she works nearby and a coworker often gets lunch there.  As thanks for helping me drop off a window air conditioner that'd stopped functioning and pick up a new one yesterday, I decided to treat her (and myself!) to dinner from Showcase, which happened to be nearby.  I'm so glad that I seized the opportunity to try Showcase's BBQ, since we both found it positively mouthwatering!When we went to place our order, we asked to see both the turkey and pork ribs.  The woman working asked us if we'd ever had turkey ribs before, and we said we hadn't, so she gave us a sample to try.  It was so moist and smoky, I had to order it, so we got the 6 bone dinner with them, as well as two sides of collard greens and candied yams ($16.05).  The dinner came with a generous amount of homemade sauce, which my friend applied sparingly, and I applied liberally.  While the ribs can totally stand on their own in terms of flavor, the sauce had such a complex and interesting flavor that I wanted to take advantage of it.  Please note that this sauce isn't your typical Sweet Baby Ray's or Kraft BBQ sauce--Tony D.'s review describes the flavor well, and it has just a slight kick of heat.As for the sides, they were both great!  The greens were cooked perfectly--they were tender without being soggy or mushy--and were delicious, with just the right amount of salt.  The candied yams were sweet yet smoky in flavor, and were also tender but not overly mushy, with a somewhat chunky consistency.  Even my friend, who isn't a big fan of yams, enjoyed them!  We were originally planning to order baked beans in place of the yams, but they were out at the time of our visit.  Needless to say, given my love of mac and cheese, I would have ordered that, but my friend subsists on a GF diet, which unfortunately ruled that out.Overall, we were very impressed with the quality of the BBQ at Showcase.  The prices are right on par with other nearby neighborhood BBQ spots, and the service was friendly.  While it's true that the neighborhood isn't the best, let's face it, sometimes the best food can be found in the unlikeliest of places--esp. when it comes to BBQ!  If you live in PGH and you enjoy BBQ, but you haven't checked out Showcase, you're missing out bigtime--so stop procrastinating and stop by ASAP for some quality 'Q!
Sandbar Mexican Grill=I noticed months ago that construction crews were working on the structure formerly known as Bahama Breeze. Note: I didn't shed a tear when Bahama Breeze shut down, like, a year ago. I'm not generally a fan of chain restaurants (other than Jenny's), and the Breeze to me was nothing more than a glorified Applebee's with a pseudo-tropical theme. Whatev. So what was this new establishment going to be? A Walgreens? CVS? Fresh&Easy? A strip club? (Dear lord, PLEASE let it be a strip club. I'm begging you. It's a good 40-minute drive back home to Ahwatukee from most of the other fine establishments, and I've found that the longer the commute, the harder it is to get that stripper smell out of my car.)Much to my chagrin, the joint reopened last week - not as a gentlemen's club - but as the second coming of Bahama Breeze: Sandbar. That was my impression as I pulled into the parking lot ... that I had waited all this time and the place reopened as a smaller version of itself.But in fact, Sandbar is different. Than Applebee's, I mean. Turns out it's like a cross between Salty Senorita and Dos Gringos. (Sandbar also has locations in Peoria and Scottsdale, neither of which I've been to nor did I know exist.)The digs are pretty cool, actually. Mexican beach theme with several overhead doors that bring the outside in. In fact, the outside bar area is surrounded by sand. Actual sand. Hence the name. Sandbar. Even though I got sand in my Pumas, I decided it was a pretty cool touch. Ladies ... you might not want to wear high heels, however. Continuing with the theme, they have cabanas and a little beach/wading pool thing that I guarantee drunk people will end up in on many nights, even though it's supposed to be just for looks.I had the Famous Sandbar Chimichanga, (made famous, apparently, by the other two locations, as this one has only been open for eight days), and it was really good. I was pleasantly surprised. It seems to me that often times, restaurants that put so much effort into their theme have food that's just "eh." The chimi is all I had, so I've nothing else to report culinarily; just know that it was tasty.Thirty-some-odd flatscreens scattered about the place. Looks like it could be a good place to watch the game on Sundays.The service was just okay. I'll give Sandbar a mulligan on that, seeing as how it's their first week in operation and I imagine they're just trying to get their feet under them. But it better rock next time. It's been said - and it's entirely true - that the place doesn't make the place, the people make the place. So ultimately, that will decide whether or not I frequent Sandbar. Too soon to get a feel for the vibe here. There was a whole range of folks patronizing the place on this evening, probably trying to figure out for themselves what kinda' scene it's gonna be. From seemingly normal cool people, to the "Did we get lost? I thought we were on Mill Ave" crowd, to the "Does my Affliction shirt fit tight enough?" crowd, to the "They say 60 is the new 25, right?" crowd ... they were all here on this evening.  Eww. But again, a mulligan because the place is new. We'll see ...Still have sand in my Pumas. Three stars for now.There is no justification in the service I received. I went to meet a couple of friends the Friday before last. They happen to run into a friend of theirs. That gentlemen ordered some shots, drinks and dinner. I heard him tell the bartender it was on his boss's tab. A while later they tried to get him to pay his tab. He said "I told you it was on my boss's tab" Long story short, his boss had left and they never put it on his tab. Some time goes by, the manager walks over to myself and the gentleman I was sitting with. He asked if we knew this other man. The gentleman I was with says he knew him a little, I stated I've never met him before. The manager asked if we can get him to pay his tab. (I personally find this to be extremely tacky and unprofessional) We did not come here with this man, it is not our responsibility). I've bartended in Scottsdale and Vegas. It is the server/bartenders responsibility to get the credit card when starting a tab. After all, they did make sure to get mine. The manager stated it was just 1 drink ('what's the big deal'?) I clarified with him that it was just one drink? Again he stated yes. I didn't want to deal with trying to get some man I don't know to pay his tab and I didn't enjoy my evening being interrupted by this nonsense, so I said "If it's just one drink, put it on my tab" (which I shouldn't have to do). The manager shook my hand and said thank you.30 min later I closed out my tab. Keep in mind all I had was 2 drinks and bought my friend a drink. My tab was $62.00!!! The bartender ended up putting that mans entire tab on mine. I called her over and I told her I found that to be very sneaky and disrespectful. She stated I said I would pay for the whole thing. I stated that was incorrect, she continued to argue with me. Why are we arguing? This is not my friend nor my tab. There is NOTHING to argue about. She finally went to speak to the manager. After about 10 minutes, she comes back has me sign a voided sales receipt for the 62.00. She never apologizes and then runs my card for my drinks plus one of his. I understand I said I would pay for this mans drink, but being that he had an entire tab it seems desperate to have a complete stranger pay for 1 of his drinks just to minimize how much of his tab they'll have to eat. Every bar has a spill/comp tab. They shouldn't make anybody else responsible for this...On top of the unprofessionalism, arguing, lack of apology, and wait time to get this solved. As a person who runs a business myself, if my employees neglect to follow protocol (ie; neglect to obtain credit card in this case,)I eat the cost. I most certainly wouldn't have another paying customer cover it.To make matters worse, myself and a friend (who frequents this establishment) went in to talk to a manager about this incident. I gave the MOD my business card and have yet to hear back from anyone. It has been 10 days. I never yelp about a place without giving the manager an opportunity to fix it...so there you have it folks... They lack professionalism big time in this place.
Herbs & Rye=In the location that once housed the famous Slanted Clam, Herbs & Rye touts a 20s speakeasy spirit that, while obviously faux, has been done so lovingly you can't help but respect it. Haven't tried the food, but sitting at the bar perusing the history lesson-cum-cocktail list, a tear almost came to my eye. If I were to open a bar, certainly this is the way I'd do it (oh wait, I did open a bar once, and we almost did it right--H&R do it better). From classic to creative, H&R mixes with finesse. I'm a fan, and how. Oh, and the drinks cost easily half what they'd be on the Strip.Misti Y had told me a lot of good things about Herbs and Rye before my trip to Vegas so I was pretty excited when she picked me up from the airport and we headed here immediately for happy hour.They have some pretty awesome classic cocktails here including Moscow mules served in the copper cups and French 75s. The bartenders have a lot of fun crafting these drinks and as a patron I had a lot of fun drinking them.Misti and I also shared a couple of snacks to offset the liquor including a big mixed green salad that had bacon croutons. Um, yum! The other food we had was a Mediterranean flatbread that came with a blended spinach spread instead of tomato sauce, feta cheese, black olives and artichoke hearts. I really like the unique flavors of food and drink at Herbs and Rye so I can see why Misti is such a fan. I'd definitely come back on my next visit to Vegas and try more of what they're offering here.Herbs and Rye offers an excellent happy hour twice a day: 5pm-8pm and 12am-3am.  Happy hour gets you 50% off certain food items, $5 wells and $3 drafts.  The other evening I enjoyed a 17 oz. bone-in ribeye and a side of jalapeno creamed corn...all for a delicious $13.00.  While it still makes for a good $26 entree (ordering this dish during non-happy hours gets you two sides instead of one), getting this for half price only sweetens the deal.  This is one of the better deals I've come across in a while.  Don't get dragged to a Station Casino looking for their late night steak and eggs;  this is the place to be!The bartenders are the other stars here at Herbs and Rye.  They have been able to make all drinks that my friends and I have ordered without giving us a blank stare and asking, "What is that?"  This is a refreshing thing to see as compared to other establishments.  My friends have been very impressed by the drinks crafted here; I think they make good drinks, but nothing on their menu has really made my palate scream for more.  I'm perfectly happy ordering an Old Fashioned here, though, which I can't say about 90% of the other bars out there!One nice thing that's happened recently is that all the video poker machines have been removed from the bar!  This makes for an even better place to grab a few drinks and a meal if your party is small enough to sit at the bar.  Nectaly has been a superb host, remembering customers and always asking customers how their experience has been.  Herbs and Rye is another repeat eat for me here in Las Vegas!WHO: If you love italian, you'll love this place for sures! The bartender & server were super sweethearts & also chatted it up with me!WHEN: The first time I hit this restaurant up, I missed Happy Hour by a minute! Literally! So, from my experience, you definitely need to check it out from 5-8pm, and 12-3am! Happy Hour consists of half off the entire menu! =D Also, if you are a yelper and you let them know, you are rewarded with a free cocktail with the order of an entree. Yayy for yelpp!!(I went there recently and there are cones directly in front of the restaurant due to construction! I automatically thought it was closed because there were no cars in the parking lot, but my friend and I took a chance. MISSION COMPLETE!)WHERE: Located on the corner of Sahara & Arville, look out for the red sign!WHAT: There were no cocktails for me this time, but I will look into it on my next visit! After a couple of hours of shopping, my friend and I decided we wanted to try this place out. (I really just wanted to see what the Truffle Mac&Cheese was all about, haha). My friend and I tried:-Italian Sausage Flatbread: I was seriously expecting something small, but the server came out with an 8-piece flatbread pizza! It was marvelous! The sausage gave it the taste it needed, and I LOVE FLATBREAD!-Truffle Mac&Cheese: Ahhh!! Thank heaven for mac&cheese!! I am a lover of macaroni & cheese and this has got to be one of the best I've ever had!! I am craving for some more just thinking about it! There is such a perfect amount of truffle in every single bite, and the perfect amount of cheese. It is just pure perfection!-Pork & Figs: One word that describes this dish... BOMB!! I've never tried figs (besides fig newtons, haha) but they were just dandy! I wish I would have taken a picture of the dish (as I usually do!) It was perfectly created, the pork on top of the gravy'd mashed potatoes, and the flavorful figs all around it. I highly recommend!! =DWHY: The food is a must & an A-plusplusplus, the service was incredible (newfound friends), and the atmosphere was just CHILL!*NOTE: REMEMBER TO GO DURING HAPPY HOUR!You don't know how much I love you,You don't know how much I care.This review is way old but since I'm sick and have nothing better to do than stare at my feet and feel like crap I thought I'd catch up on old reviews before they are erased from memory.Happy Hour is where its at son!1/2 off Steaks (and a gnocchi I just couldn't pass up)The vibe is straight up sexy, (I never use that word because I feel awkward saying it out loud) but its just dark, sultry and sleek and straight out of an old-school movie.  The specialty cocktails are divine, the bartenders take their time and they know wassup.  Quality drinks cost money, but oh what a way to burn.If I could give this a negative 5 stars I would.WORST DINING EXPERIENCE SO FAR IN LAS VEGAS! I went there last night with 2 friends and ordered a steak. I got the steak (which was IHOP quality) and it had 2 pieces of plastic cooked into it. They were not small pieces, they were the size of silver dollars! I showed the waiter and he said "that is from the plastic wrapping we cut the meat out of" (This WAS the same kind of steaks that Dennys and IHOP uses!) Well he asked me if I wanted a new steak and I jokingly said "yes, but no plastic please" and laughed. He then rudely replied "yeah, thats common sense, don't you think"! and walked away. My friends and I looked at each other and were shocked and asked if we had heard him correctly. I got up and went to ask the hostess if the manager was there and if I could speak to them about my waiter. The hostess informed me that my waiter WAS THE OWNER! The waiter/owner then came up behind the hostess and confronted me about me trying to make a complaint. I told him I didn't like how he talked to me at my table and that he then replied "Then get the (explative) out of my restaurant! I said get out, you and your friends too!" I stood there stunned and actually laughed in his face. That made him angry so he called over 2 "goons" from the dining room to try to muscle me out. One guy walks up and takes off his suit jacket like he is going to assault me. Not cool at all!  This being my first time in this restaurant will also be my last! The service was atrocious and the food was IHOP quality for strip prices. And then to add insult to injury, they still made us pay for our meal!Cocktail geeks rejoice - craft cocktails exist in Vegas. I'm not sure since when, but they're here in full effect at Herbs & Rye. The elixirs you'll find coming across this bar are seriously top notch and could stand their ground against any in my favorite coastal cities such as Portland, Seattle, SF and the like. I'm so glad  to have found this spot (thanks to all who recommended it and to Misti for taking me there) and it will definitely be on my itinerary for any return trip.This is the lest "Vegas" bar in Vegas,  and that's one of the big reasons I am drawn to it. No flashy BS, no gaming, no smoking, no crazy-extreme high prices on the drinks, and almost zero pretense. Nice guys making stellar drinks in a chill, subdued setting (at least when I was in there) that's free of all the glam and glitz that exists a few blocks away. Nothing against that stuff (my stop prior to this was for a delicious cocktail at the fancy Vesper Bar) but I sure do love me good cocktails minus the snoot. The cocktails on the list are all classics, organized by the decade that gave birth to them. The list is medium-length but very carefully curated, and I found no less than three of my favorite elixers jumping off the pages and into my glass. The two drinks I sampled were a Vieux Carre (a personal fave) and a Remember The Maine (also a fave). Both were impeccable - perfectly balanced with a nice depth of flavor. High quality ingredients and trained hands sure do make some fine drinks. The story behind the guy who owns the place is a cool one too. He started out at the bottom and made is way up to the top - self taught. I respect that. And his humility and charm is something often not seen amongst the highest level of mixologists. He's a true barman. The food menu is hearty and tasty. I only sampled the truffled mac side fior $7 (a hearty portion) and it fit the bill. For a respite from overpriced drinks and chaos of the strip, get thee to Herbs & Rye. You'll make up your $$ on cab fare after only a couple of drinks and you'll be so glad you did.I had wanted to sample the fare at Herbs & Rye for some time, based on the recommendations of Yelp Friends.  Finally, the moment came, and Diane and I passed through the darkened entrance.  We were there for the food--not the creative drinks--and looked forward to a sumptuous dinner.  First to be set before us by our friendly server Eddie A was delicious fresh-baked French bread and soft butter.  This was quickly followed by a lovely-looking Shrimp Cocktail featuring six medium-sized red-tailed and white-topped shrimps curled over the serving plate.  The cold crustaceans tasted very good after being dipped in the zesty traditional Cocktail Sauce that accompanied them.Next was a novel surprise: an Iceberg Wedge that, instead of being crafted in the shape of a wedge as expected, was about two-thirds of a head of Iceberg Lettuce that had been sliced straight through the top to resemble a high mesa somewhere in the Southwest.  Festooned on the flat leafy surface were slices of tomato, red onion, bacon, Bleu Cheese crumbles, croutons, and a rich and ample supply of Bleu Cheese Dressing.  This was an excellent, crunchy salad course. Produced after this were my 9 oz. Filet Mignon with Brandy Cream Sauce & Peppercorns, and Diane's 12 oz. Ribeye Steak.  My entree was largely medium-rare as ordered, but a few parts of it were slightly undercooked.  Diane's Ribeye, on the other hand, was overcooked--more medium-well than medium-rare as she prefers.  When asked if her steak was cooked as she had specified, she admitted that it was more done than desired, but said that it was okay and she would eat it.  "No," said our server.  "We'll prepare you another one, and take it off the bill.  We want you to come back."  My wife politely declined the gracious offer, and slowly picked at her steak and sides until not too long afterward when suddenly a steaming plate was placed before her, with a new, obviously medium-rare and glistening 12 oz. Ribeye mounted on it.  The kitchen had quietly prepared a new steak anyway.  She accepted the promising substitution, and her old steak was immediately removed.  This fresh and juicy steak she really enjoyed, accompanied by a luscious Macaroni & Cheese side with bacon added.  I sampled the Mac & Cheese, and the hot white cheesy sauce really was delectable, just as was the Brandy Cream Sauce that covered my Filet and provided a liquid base for it.We had other sides to indulge in as well.  Sauteed Button Mushrooms were hot and meaty, and I opted for the deluxe version of Sweet Potato Tots with Honey & Marshmallow Crust.  Large marshmallows were nicely melted over tater-tot-shaped knobs of sweet potato that had been sweetened further with honey.  While we were eating our meals, mob movies were playing without commercial breaks on a large flat-screen TV mounted behind the bar and facing our booth.  It was actually quite enjoyable to have that as a backdrop, and we became engaged in following the action.  The final delight of the night was the gigantic, warm, and freshly baked Chocolate Chip Cookie a la mode that was presented with long trails of Chocolate Sauce drizzled across the massive cookie and streaming down the two large scoops of Vanilla Ice Cream that rested on top and stood like silent sentinels.  It was a great dessert, and a sweet way to end our leisurely stay.P.S.  True to our server's word, when the bill arrived, besides a 50% price reduction off the cost of my Filet for dining during the extended Happy Hour, no Ribeye Steak appeared on the tab.  It was an unnecessary but generous and classy gesture.  So, I reciprocated by leaving a substantial tip.  And, I am sure that we will come back.I really feel this place warrants more like 3.5 stars. Dark, clubby, with a sort of hipster take on vintage Vegas...cool menu full of mixology "craft" cocktails...solid steaks and accouterments. A cool place to go for late-night food...and located in a SOLIDLY unpretentious part of town (bonus points!!!). I went during regular hours and had a filet with a side of mushrooms, and caesar salad. All were good, but a pit pricey for what they were. I'll have to go back and try the happy hour menu...I have a feeling my cheap ass will like that more!Overall, I endorse this spot.I've been going here for the past few years and yes, it's been consistently lovely. I've taken even a few visitors here for late night eats as it surely beats having graveyard specials at a janky diner. We get to sit in a cozy, dark booth and listen to a really thoughful soundtrack if you like stuff like downtempo.The main draw is every night from 5pm-8pm and 12am-close is HAPPY HOUR. No, it doesn't include the cocktails, but I believe well drinks and some beers are. The gem of it is the food. There is a limited half off food selection of various types of steaks, a few apps (currently spicy mussels and garlic butter clams), and a entree of linguine and clams. Get the steak! Its good quality for the price. I normally go with the 18oz ribeye (ends up like $20 at HH) or the Kansas City Bone In 12oz ( I believe $15 during HH) and it's been tender, cooked to the right temperature, and seasoned well that I don't put any steak sauce. It comes with one side and their sides are great here. I really like their truffle mac n cheese, sweet potato tots, or super garlicky spinach. No it isn't your dirt cheap steak special, but you get what you pay for and it's a great value considering the quality. We've brought even the BFs grandma and mom recently and both approved of the steak and would like us to bring them back.  We also get the spicy mussels often during HH. It's a rather large pot they give you for the $11 HH price and the marinara is garlicky, a bit spicy, and needs to be sopped up. Ask for more bread - theirs is delicious, hot out the oven. They serve some of my favorite consistent drinks. Drinks here don't rotate so much, but are all classic cocktails using a lot of small batch spirits so it speaks to my heart.  The BFs and my drink of choice is the Vieux Carr'e (Rye, Cognac, Benedictine, Sweet Vermouth, Peychauds Bitters, Angostura Bitters) since its just alcohol on top of more alcohol. I just find I like less sweet stuff over the years and just want something unfussy and you can taste the nuances of the alcohol. If I want something tart and refreshing for a change, I go for Blackthorn or Moscow Mules. I find both great for summer. I've also ordered mystery drinks here and have been pleased, whatever I was given. I think at this point they can peg my tastes pretty well. I shockingly haven't drank the entire menu yet (but close) and will report back once I do with a running list of what each drink is like.I think this place will always have a special little spot in my heart. It was actually the place I met all my Yelp friends, for the first time so it holds special memories. And throughout the years the steaks and the drinks have never disappointed.Herbs & Rye was one of those late dinners with Terri R that was on a whim.  Herbs & Rye looks like a pub on the outside, even has that feel when you walk in. All I know is that it was a very long day, I was starving, and anything that was food would have hit the spot.  In other words, I didn't expect much coming in. Maybe a good thing that I didn't expect much because I was actually surprised by the menu.  I expected nothing but fried dishes or meals with zero sustenance. What I found was a menu ranging from apps to steaks.  Prices are not pub prices though.  Price here is what you are to expect at a steakhouse.  A ton of really tempting items on this menu like Filet Mignon and Lobster, Burgers, and other steak options.  With all the recent talk about White Castle here in Vegas for the last couple of days (compliments of the Foodie Fest), I decided on their sliders.  The presentation of these sliders is probably the best I've seen in awhile.  It at least kicks White Castle's butt.  I thought that the sliders were pretty good, but just a little rich.  We also got their fully loaded calamari.  To me, I thought it was one big workout killing mess.  It had a ton of what appears to be mayo, bacon, and some other add ons.  Both Terri and I, scraped off this mess and ate some calamari the way it should be eaten.  As for the ambiance, you can say that you get two types.  When you walk in, you have the bar to the right where all the action is.  It's louder, brighter, and this is where everyone else is eating.  Then you got the quiet side where it's dimmer, quiet, and barely where anyone is dining.  Normally, I'm good with either side. But on this night, the dining was a little too tight on the bar side. So, we ate where it was quieter and darker.  Since it was also late, keeping ourselves from falling asleep was a challenge in itself.  My other concern is that we would be forgotten and our orders never taken.  This wasn't an issue at Herbs & Rye.  Regardless which side you choose to eat, service seems to be right on. Overall, Herbs & Rye is a decent place to meet with friends, grab a drink, and some dinner.  I'm not a huge fan of pubs in general, but I still have my favorites.  Herbs and Rye can easily be one of them.  PS:  I don't drink, but there's a some great Happy Hour specials here.  For all you HH dudes and gals, give this place a try.

I've only gone a couple times so far, but the perfect storm of quality food, excellent customer service and happy hour half priced steaks has won me over immensely. Each time I have come here I have been treated awesomely right from stepping in the door and being greeted by the friendly hostess. And the waitresses Donna and Debbie are fantastic as well. They are friendly and they go above and beyond to take care of you. I have opted for the 18 oz. Rib-Eye both times and have been very pleased with it. Rib-Eye is my go to steak in most any circumstance. I did try a bite of the New York Strip and that was pretty fantastic too. The sides are incredible. My favorite is the truffle mac and cheese, but I have also been a fan of the garlic mashed potatoes and the truffle parmesan french fries. The steaks come with one side order and during happy hour, they are an absolute deal. They also have $5 well drinks and I think a $3 amber ale, if I remember correct. If you want Jack, they charge you $8. That's my one knock against this place, but I'll live. The bread also isn't bad and definitely hits the spot while you wait. Nothing really to write home about, but better than nothing while you wait. The ambiance of the place is pretty classy. It's dim and the walls are lined with a nice velvet looking wall paper that looks pretty elegant. It's the kind of place you would probably want to dress up a little for. Overall, Herbs is most likely going to be a regular spot of mine when I need my steak fix. If you haven't checked it out, do yourself a favor and head over there. Best time would be during one of their happy hours. The first one is from 5 to 8 and I think the second one starts at 11. Oh and they're currently in the process of changing out their beer and wine menu along with adding a few food items including a Porterhouse. More reasons to check back.I attended Herbs & Rye's grand opening four years ago and it was an interesting experience. The night started and almost ended as one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had (primarily the service). Fortunately, they took care of us and we ended up relocating to the bar and having the complete opposite experience. The food was delicious and the cocktails were wonderful. I didn't intentionally not return, but I never ended up going back until a couple months ago.Teresa S., my fiance, and I were in the area and very hungry, so we headed over with a reservation via Open Table. We were very excited that we were in time for their Happy Hour (5pm-8pm), which meant 50% off select steaks and other items! What sounds better than a 9 oz. filet mignon? A $17 9 oz. filet mignon! I also ordered sides of Asparagus, Garlic Mash, and Roasted Brussel Sprouts (I can't remember what it was called, but it also had panchetta). My fiance ordered the Italian Sausage flatbread.The sides were all very delicious. The highlight was definitely the brussel sprouts. Ridiculously good flavor! The asparagus were slightly overcooked, but still good. The mashed potatoes were so flavorful and creamy. My steak made me sad. It was dry and NOT medium rare. As you can see in the photo, there wasn't even a touch of red in the center. Le sigh. I lose all respect for a restaurant that can't properly prepare a medium rare steak (or burger). It's the worst offense and totally ruins my whole meal. Which made me more sad since I enjoyed everything else so much.Service was spotty as well. Everyone seemed more fixated on the big group in the center of the dining room. I guess they were more important. Anyway, although most of the food was really great, it's not enough to bring me back.So I've been hearing about this place for a while for fellow Yelpers and been wanting to try. When I finally got the chance, we ended up having plans to go twice in the same week! If my rating was based solely on service they would've got a 1.5, based on drinks 4.5, based on food 3.My first time there we were with a very large group ( 30+ people) on a Tuesday night at 8pm. It's not like they didn't know we were coming, but they seemed overwhelmed. They couldn't keep up with our drink orders, it took way too long to get the orders in let alone get the drink (even if it was just bourbon on the rocks). It took a long time to get our food as well, some people in our group were done and leaving when we didn't even get our food yet. They ran out of sides. Brought out sides way before our entree so the side was cold. Steaks were overdone. My lobster tail was over cooked. The food was just  "meh". We were all happy with the drink selection and drinks...when we got them.I was turned off with that first try, but I gave them a pass since it was such a large group. And went back with some friends on Friday night around 7:30. Again, service was horrible. It took forever to get our drink orders, and it was nearly impossible to get the waiters attention if you wanted anything else. Once we ordered food, the food also took forever. I got the Calamari this time and the first time and it was good both times. I also got a Prosciutto and Asparagus Flatbread, it was good, nothing exciting, but good. My husbands steak was much better this time and his side, Broccoli and Cheese was yummy. A friend at our table never got his food when we were all done eating, so he cancelled his order. My drinks were perfect (order 2 drinks at a time because they take so long to get!) Brown Derby and Blinker, both good in their own way. It was our friends birthday so we all split some Donuts....they were awesome.I like the decor and old fashioned vibe. I've been to this locale before it was Herbs And Rye...boy has it changed! The service alone would keep me from going back, not sure if I will go back. Only time will tell. Good thing they have some loyal Yelpers as patrons because they turned off a room full of people.I finally got to try their steaks at happy hour!  I was going to get my favorite filet mignon but our server informed us that they have a filet wrapped in bacon. So, I got that and truffle fries. I also tried the truffle mac & cheese and the Herbs & Rye House Brew (HH price: $3). The sides aren't included in happy hour. We got beignets to end a great meal.Bacon-wrapped Filet Mignon:It had two thick slices of bacon on top and not wrapped around the filet. For a piece of steak that would normally be at least $50, getting this at half the price definitely changes everything. It was perfectly medium-rare, tender and juicy. 4.5/5Truffle Fries:Thin-cut fries with truffles and parmesan cheese. You can taste and see truffles, yay! The fries were crispy. I enjoy truffle fries but what makes this even better is that it's less than $10! 5/5Truffle Mac & Cheese:After eating great truffle fries, I was disappointed with this mac & cheese. I couldn't taste truffles. It was like regular, plain mac & cheese. 2/5Beignets:These aren't similar to the famous beignets from New Orleans. These are like mini doughnuts covered in granulated sugar. Normally comes with 2 dipping sauces: white chocolate and caramel but since I don't like white chocolate, our server threw in chocolate sauce. 4/5The Kool Kids ordered Jack & Coke but it wasn't like Jack & Coke - our server later on said it's not really Jack & Coke, it was something else. That and my not-so-bacon-wrapped bacon-wrapped filet made me think we were getting punked by our server.This is probably one of my greatest finds on Yelp. Half off steak during happy hour??! How can it not be?Here's the run down :+ Happy hour from 5-8PM and then midnight to close (3AM). + During happy hour, you get half off steaks and a few other options. Each steak order (unless otherwise noted) comes with one side. I usually go for the mushrooms and creamed corn.+ If you split/share.. there's an additional charge. Note : Don't bring people who aren't eating their own meal. + free bread is good+ Don't be scared by the grungy exterior look. This place is worth it.They really do close right at 3AM, so better to come earlier rather than later!Ok so here is your deal of the day in FABULOUS LAS VEGAS, come here, for an early happy hour or after midnight. The steaks are all on the 50% fire sale... seriously BLUE LIGHT SPECIAL AT Herbs & Rye! and its super tasty to boot! So drag your bootay over here off the strip for a split second or ten and descend into decadent gluttony for a bit.I arrived with a group of folks around 12:30 or so and most of us had had a few drinks already and had been gambling for a few hours. We hadn't had dinner yet as we were planning on coming here and had heard about it from one of my buddies who is a local. It was described as a great steak joint with cheap high end fare. It did not disappoint on that perspective whatsoever.Pro Tip: Parking early can be tough, so be forwarned, perhaps taxi it over =DI got the 18oz boneless ribeye for $29 Dee LISH  Ushhhhhh. Normally it is $58! Well I want another one right now... and the bacon haphazardly tossed on top was awesome as well. I had the bacon topper which was two thick cuts of my favorite veggie crossed on top of the steak. WOW, just WOW.Pro Tip #2: Do NOT ask for steak sauce unless you are an uncouth Neanderthal with no understanding of good steak. Some jackwagon in my group asked for it and a few of us had our eyes just about pop out of our heads!You get a side with it and I kinda messed up trying something experimental but *shrugs* the steak and bacon were AWESOME.  But for my side I got the asparagus with the broccoli cheese sauce and it didn't turnout as well as I had hoped it would. Pro Tip #3: Drink up before you get here. Their drinks are a bit pricy and kitchee IMHO. Unless you want to drink specialty drinks at $8-$15/ea...The bread was fresh and super toasty tasty and just what you would need or expect for a meal like this. Ahhh the memories of this meal are still so fresh in my head I can taste that steak and the bacon strips! Since I have been here, I have had several friends hit this place up and no one has a bad thing to say about the steaks. I definitely plan on hitting this joint up again on another vegas run and I think you should too!Upon arriving here we were taken back by the rough exterior. But as I read with previous Yelpers reviews, I knew what to expect. But once you walk inside... Wow the decor and ambiance was pretty cool. I loved the feel of the place. Walking in was like a completely different place than the outside.Me & the beau seated at the bar to wait for our friends. I ordered a Moscow Mule & he got a Pisco Sour. My Moscow Mule was so good, I just didn't like how it was filled with ice so I basically paid for a cup full of ice, I woulda liked more drink for my buck. Pisco sour had egg white in it so it basically just tasted like foam, honestly. I then ordered a Pimms Cup. Oh how I loved that drink! & had cucumber chunks in it! So delicious! My recommendation for a drink if you go here. Our friends started to come so we got a table. We were waiting for the clock to strike 12am so we can take advantage of their infamous happy hour! I ordered a Kansas Bone In w/ that extra spicy rub with Truffle Mac n Cheese as my side! OMG to die for! That rub on the steak had little flavor fairies dancing in my mouth! My friend ordered the Penne Pasta. That was also extremely good, not part of their happy hour though. The beau ordered chicken wings and everyone thought they were so good, but I think they tasted like chicken wings! Lol. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ What really stood out to me was our waiter, Christian. He was extremely delightful, making suggestions for which cocktails we would like. One of my friends got what he has suggested & didn't like it and Christian brought him another drink for free! Also towards the end he brought us out some bomb sugar donuts with 2 mouth watering dipping sauces, also on the house! How sweet of him. Overall I loved this place.. I'll probably be returning very soon!I give it to our waiter, Christian and the steaks!The outside is a bit "ghetto".. But soon as you come in, it's almost like a renaissance, back in the old days, touch of vampire feel.Similar to the Artisan Hotel on Sahara.We sat at the bar first while waiting for the infamous happy hour at midnight! I only did like one cocktail that night and it happened to be my friend's, the Pimms Cup - which had ginger ale, cucumber and lime. I usually don't like cucumber drinks, but this is the drink to try there! The other cocktails I had just had a weird after taste to me and so just wasn't a fan.Midnight hits, we're seated at the table and so we ordered our steaks and other desired items. I ordered the 18oz Ribeye Steak with side of the Garlicky Spinach. Grilled to perfection, tender, juicy and oh SOO delicious! You can def taste the quality in the steak! My side on the other hand was, as you expected, garlicky. I had asked for it to be a little less garlicky, but nonetheless still a good side.The group ordered Penne, Chicken Wings, New York Steak, Kansas Bone In, sides and more drinks!Christian definitely accommodated our every need and was very knowledgeable of the items/ drinks on the menu! He even topped off our night with a complimentary dessert, which I couldn't, unfortunately have.Nothing beats great service and food!After two consecutive incidents with the same server, Debra, I'm forced to write this review. First happened February 14th, 2014. My girlfriend and I came in for dinner. She took our order wrong, food came out wrong, runner went back into kitchen, couple minutes later food came out right so no big deal. Debra however pretended it didn't happen and didn't even apologize. Again, no big deal. Left her a 18% tip and totaled it to 90$ on my card. On my credit card statement I was charged 100$. I Talked to the manager, Alennry, on the phone and said he was busy at the moment so he gave me his email to explain the situation. Emailed him twice over the course of two weeks and no reply. I ended up letting it go, convincing myself it could have been an honest mistake. April 12th, 2014 rolls around and I decide their happy hour sounds good, which it is. Don't get me wrong it's a great happy hour. Again were sat in Debra's section. Funny right? This time I total my card to 33$ and I was charged 38$, same thing with my girlfriends card. Now I'm at the point where I'm very upset because it's clear Debra is forging credit card tips. Being a server in the Vegas industry myself I know this is the biggest no no. Now I go in and talk to Nectaly himself about the situation. He seemed very sorry and genuine about the situation and said he would get the money refunded. At the end of the day, the extra 5$ charged on not only one but both our cards is not a big deal, it's the principle that counts. Nectaly emails me saying he's getting statements from his merchant. Takes about a week but he finally gets them. Then he doesn't email back for a couple days and then I finally get an email saying he's in New York and will refund them as soon as he's back. I say that's awesome and couple days go by and no email or refund. I email again and now there's absolutely no response for a week.And now I'm writing this review. It's upsetting because like I said, their happy hour and food quality is awesome. But this is not the way you do business. The first time could have been an honest mistake but twice from the same server is no coincidence. You don't steal from customers, that's not the way you do business. Please take warning. The managers and owners seem to be more than okay with doing shady business.One of my girlfriends who moved to Vegas about a year ago wanted to take me out on a dinner date. Rather than perusing through Yelp, I opted for her to call the shots on where to take me. Now that's a rare occasion since more often than not, I do the cuisine-suggesting. The change was definitely nice and made for a few pleasant surprises.She picked me up from MGM and took the backroads, clearly well off the strip to a local hang out called Herbs & Rye. Upon entering, you definitely are taken aback by how dark it is in there. Seriously, your eyes don't quite fully adjust until you are seated. We got there in the early evening and it was starting to get packed. Fortunately, my girl made reservations and we were situated in one of their awesome booths facing the bar. You don't have pages and pages of menu to peruse through. Their offerings are simple and to the point, no frills here. Don't get me wrong, just because the menu isn't laced with words you can't pronounce or ingredients you've never seen, doesn't mean quality has been sacrificed. On the contrary, the seem to use products of utmost quality with particular attention to the entree's final outcome.We had  a wonderful server, I'd like to say his name was Richard though I'm no longer sure. He was warm without being overbearing, made us laugh a little and suggested deliciously buttery chardonnay for me. BTW happy hour is awesome here, but many of their dishes, yes even the steaks at 50% off!We ordered:Carpaccio - i have never had carpaccio before and this was just amazing. I would order this again in a heartbeatNew York Strip - We added bacon and oh my was that a thick cut piece of pork! They prepared it medium rare and seasoned just rightTruffle Mac n Cheese - Although not too truffle-y, this mac n cheese was still a hitSweet Potato Tots - We got this with the marshmallow crust. heaven in your mouth. geez.Mind you they have a very impressive selection of cocktails as well.We skipped dessert this particular time since we were going somewhere else for our sweet treats. Regardless, our meal was fantastic and kudos to the folks at Herbs & Rye for the stellar experience.I've heard a lot about their cocktails and have been meaning to make a visit for the longest time but for some reason only remembered on Sundays which is when they're closed. I finally was able to visit last night around midnight ! It looks like just a bar on the outside, so driving by if you've never heard about this place, you wouldn't think it was anything special. But people, enough about it's "in the ghetto". North-town, Twain/Maryland Parkway, Boulder Highway, MLK/Charleston, THAT'S ghetto. Sahara/Valley View? Not the best but come on, not ghetto. Let's not get crazy.Soo anyways, the inside, kind of vampirey and a little dark, it takes your eyes some time to adjust but they have mini flashlights you can request. Oh and bring your glasses, goodness I felt like an old lady trying to read the super small lettering on the menu lol. There was lots of seating and at the time we came, not busy even though happy hour was going on (12-3). Happy hour was half off some steaks included with a side. Sounds like a great deal but my boyfriend and I didn't want something too heavy so we'll try it next time especially since everyone around us was taking advantage of that great deal and it looked delicious!Onto the drinks! Oh my goodness, soo good, AMAZING. After my first drink, Weekend at the Walfdorf, which is a fruity rum based drink, I made part of my life's goal to try all the drinks on their menu Lol. Next I had the infamous Moscow Mule that I've heard soo much about. The best I've had. Perfect amount of fizzyness and Ginger. Yummy!! I'll take a liter for home please Lol. My boyfriend had the Ramos Gin Fizz and it was another amazing drink especially if you love Gin. It had a lemon tang to it and frothed egg whites. If you're from San Fran, my boyfriend said the quality of drinks were very similar to Burritt Room & Tavern in Union Square.Next, the food. Carpaccio was flavorful and I always like when restaurants serve an argula salad on top, so really good. I wish there was a little more capers though. Very comparable to carpaccios I've had on the strip. The Pork & Figs we shared was large and really delicious as well. I loved the sauce and figs, and the mashed potatoes. The pork was not as tender as I liked it to be but the Gorgonzola on top made up for that. I could definitely see myself craving this dish. Now let's talk about their amazing donuts. Wow. First of all, I think there's like a dozen mini donuts & holes sugar coated and was served super soft and warm. Definitely enough for four people! But since they're soo addicting, two people could easily demolish these even with a full belly. It came with two sauces, I forgot the names but it seemed like a white chocolate and caramel. Lick your fingers good Lol. I just really wish that this place had a higher quality feel to match the great quality and pricing of the food and drinks they serve! You can still look prohibitiony and sleek at the same time! Lol The service was good and friendly, drinks took a little long but they are hand crafted cocktails! The poor bartenders even had to froth up egg whites for one of our drinks! Lmao I will definitely be back for their happy hour steak special and their drinks!! :)Items Selected:Clover Club - Gin, Lemon, Raspberry Syrup, Egg WhiteThe Farmer Flatbread - Double Thick Bacon, Spinach, Cracked Egg, Crème FraicheTruffled Mac n' CheesePork and Figs - Gorgonzola, Garlic Mash, Fig GlazeSweet Potato Tots with Marshmallow and Honey CrustOld Granddad Bread Pudding with Vanilla Ice Cream Heavily praised for an extensive era-specific list of craft cocktails with a menu full of sustainable organic meats and plates far more interesting than the average bar or lounge Herbs & Rye had long been a place of interest and with recent reports suggesting the kitchen to be firing on all cylinders I finally decided to stop by, a Saturday feast for one in the dimly-lit dining area my reward for eschewing alternative plans on Las Vegas Boulevard South.  Designed in a style somewhere between "Old time Vegas" and stripped-down speakeasy with a less-than-ideal location on West Sahara it was with eyes still adjusting from the 6pm sun that I entered the small tavern and greeted at a small podium by the woman later to be my waitress I was quickly led to my choice of tables, a menu soon in hand presenting tough decisions with a resultant four item order divided into two courses accompanied by one of nearly a dozen gin based cocktails I'd have liked to try were my liver's capacity on par with that of my gut.  Obviously a space prone to becoming lively as the night wears on but only perhaps half-full during the course of my meal it was after perhaps a ten minute wait that my cocktail arrived and featuring a lovely balance of fruit juxtaposing juniper notes beneath a cloudy of foam the Clover Club was a hit, the flavor profile particularly refreshing when matched to a rich opening duo of tender macaroni unfortunately overwhelmed with truffle oil and a crisp, lightly charred flatbread that fared far better with briny bacon finding its foil in the tang of crème fraiche.   At this point debating an Aviation versus the Bee's Knees it was a bit to my surprise that my second round arrived immediately on the heels of my first and forgetting the second cocktail as it was likely to arrive far too late to be enjoyed with the food I instead dug straight in, the 12oz bone-in piece of pork seared perfectly and coated with bleu over hand-smashed potatoes amidst a jus of pork and poached figs, the later laying split alongside the protein and still intensely sweet...though certainly not as much so as a bowl of tender tots bathed in a pool of honey beneath snowcaps of toasted marshmallow that ranks amongst the best "sides" I've had this year.  At this point sated but happy to go another round it was to an oral explanation of the restaurant's desserts that I was finally treated and although large sharing portions of sugared doughnuts and a skillet cookie were hard to resist it was instead in the day's special that I partook, the piping hot chunk of booze-soaked baguette crowned by a ball of vanilla ice cream proving very 'special' indeed with butter and cinnamon bubbling at its base as if the kitchen had known I was coming and prepared it just for me.Stumbled upon this place while I was driving around for a place to eat dinner. I noticed the parking lot was full so decided to pull in and find a parking spot which took a while BC the lot was full. I made it in just before HH ended so I took advantage of the discounted beverages. I sat in the dinning room which dark but I noticed this place is definitely a locals joint. I Started off with a wedge salad that didn't disappoint followed by the 12 oz bone in Kansas City steak and side of truffle mac & cheese. The steak was tender, juicy and the mac & cheese was solid. Overall a good dinner with cordial service from my waitress at a reasonable price.Was here last night with a large group for a birthday party. It was my second time here and at first I was excited to be back based on my experience the first time around. I was shocked to find customer service and quality control so horrendous this second time around! Long story short, this place has totally gone downhill and I likely won't be back. I wouldn't recommend anyone waste their time coming here either unless you want your food to come out an hour late and then take a half hour at the end to pay your group's tab!Rachel and I got here about 40 min before our party's reservation so we decided to sit at the bar for some drinks and salad as an appetizer. After being greeted by the bartender we didn't see him again for another 15 min and sat around waiting for our order to be taken. What bartender doesn't ask for a drink order right away?After everyone placed their orders we proceeded to wait about 45-50 min before any of food even came out. I was wondering if it was even going to come out at all! When our food arrived they brought everyone's except Roger's with no explanation of any kind...it was almost like the forgot that he had ordered anything. When this was brought to the server's attention she checked on it and came back to inform us that they had just "fired it up" and that it would "be out shortly" with no further explanation of what happened to the original order, nor an apology. About 10-15 min passes before the server returns to inform us that Roger's steak would be out soon and that they had overcooked the original one. Funny how they would wait to tell us this instead of being up front about it...I call bs!When Roger's steak finally came it was overcooked and not cooked medium rare like ordered. How hard is it for a steak restaurant to not overcook 2 steaks in a row?! After this debacle they still wanted to charge us for his steak at first and then decided not to in the end...I'm sure they heard that we were all Yelpers lol! But seriously this place is ridiculous. No updates on your food and no service whatsoever. It's almost like they don't care if their customers are happy or not, and we definitely were not.At the end of the night we attempted to settle our table's tab. We had asked the server at the beginning of the meal to split our tabs, however, at the end of the meal she told us that this wasn't possible. WTF! Why didn't you just tell us that in the first place? The manager came out to explain that it was against store policy to split checks of groups with 6 or more people...Ok, so it's possible...you're just not going to do it? Who says that? Especially after the crap service we just endured? It was a debacle trying to figure out the tab due to this and they had to run about a dozen cards separately. I almost wanted our group just to leave because the servers didn't know what was going on, except that they couldn't split the tab. If it wasn't for the manager coming out to handle the situation I'm pretty sure it would've taken longer than 30 min to figure this out and I would've just left. I don't have the patience or time to deal with crap like this. Get your shit together or don't run business! We were also pissed to see a 20% auto gratuity which is bs because they deserve nothingSave your time and your money and avoid this place. There are so many other steak places here in Vegas and there's really nothing special about this one. Steaks after overpriced just so they can do a "happy hour" 50% deal and even then the appetizers are $15, sides are $7 and sauces are $3.50 for such a crap place that's not even fancy at all.Who doesn't love happy hour?Its no secret, Herbs & Rye is a popular spot for steak lovers. Offering nice cuts of quality meat at half the price. Their happy hour menu is not limited to steaks but also sides and by the glass wines. Being a popular spot, if you go with a big group expect a wait. Midnight hits and this place is packed. Who would of thought so many carnivores craved meats this late. I ordered my favorite cut, Ribeye medium rare closer to rare. I like it juicer than most. It was cooked a little more medium but still very tasty. I also ordered two sides: asparagus and their truffle mashed potatoes. The asparagus were perfect, steamed with still a bite to it. The truffle oil mash was a little too buttery for my taste. It was very wet and mushy. Overall, this place is great for late night eats. For a fine dining establishment. I really hope their food is better during normal hours.Holy moly! I've been here a few times, but tonight was my first time for dinner. Let's start with pre-dinner drinks. This place really knows how to craft a cocktail. So far I haven't had a bad cocktail yet, but I'm mostly a vodka or wine girl. The happy hour red is not too shabby. I wish there were more choices, but considering the awesome HH food choices, I think we can agree to let that one go. Our friends told us about the happy hour until 8pm and we were shocked that it includes half off steaks! What a great deal. We started with the mussels appetizer. I loved the sauce. Mussels tasted great, but that red sauce had a real nice kick to it. Quite a few of the mussels would not open, but the waiter had no issue bringing us another batch. For dinner, I ordered the Bone - in Kansas city. It was very flavorful and tender. I'm seriously laying in bed still thinking about it. We also ordered the garlic smashed, garlic spinach, and sweet potato tots. Best way I've ever had sweet potato.  The spinach and smashed came out with a piece of garlic clove on top. Nice touch. I liked all of our sides, but the favorite at the table was the truffle Mac n cheese. Ronnie was an excellent server. Very knowledgeable, friendly and attentive. If you have any questions on the menu, ask him! I'm not one for adding anything to an already amazing steak, but my friend really loved the chimichurri add on. My other friend cautioned that the ribeye was quite fatty, but the bf ordered it and was very happy. It was huge! They also ordered the homemade doughnuts and ice cream cookie. I can't comment on taste, because I was good and abstained, but it smelled delicious. Either would have easily been enough for the whole table! I will def be back, I just don't know if I'll be able to try any of the other steak choices, as I'm still dreaming of the Kansas. Yum!Cool spot with some killer cocktails!I love it when bartenders take their craft seriously and drinking becomes an experience. This place doesn't fail and when we walked in around 8pm on a Friday night the bar was packed and the restaurant had a 30 min wait; deservingly so.The bartenders are great and it has a very cool vibe with friendly locals who are happy it's finally Friday! Two couples moved around to fit my man and I immediately as we walked in and that was a really nice gesture. We had several cocktails and definitely began feeling tipsy on drink two. Pretty pathetic but these suckers were strong! After a short time we were called for our table and we were starving! Everything tastes better when you're tipsy! Well almost everything! So let's get to the food. Started with a margarita flat bread which was good (still on my search for amazing margarita pizza) and then the filet sliders. These were by far the highlight of the experience. The meat was so tender with caramelized onions, horse radish sauce on a very soft potato bun (AMAZING)! Then we wanted something decadent and decided on the penne. It was so salty we couldn't take more then a few bites. It tasted like eating spoons full of salt. As tipsy as I was I couldn't do it. We told our waitress and she was kind enough to ask if we wanted it remade but we decided to skip as we wanted to save ourselves for something sweet. That dish was straight up nasty. We ordered the hot donuts and they made up for the pasta! Overall good food but that penne really screwed us up. The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars was over that.The service was great. Strong cocktails to get a nice buzz going and maybe we just got unlucky with the pasta. Everything else was good.The decor is cool with a very back in the day feel when the cool kids were bootlegging in dark places. I would definitely try this place again.1920s style speakeasy atmosphere? Check.Massive menu of obscure and classic drinks? Check.2 daily HHs with half-price steaks? Check again.Server was great about suggesting and recommending drinks to help us, as the menu is a bit overwhelming- the Blackthorne, Pegu, and Diablo were all tasty and strong without being too sweet. I do wish they offered better wines, and found it odd they don't have any beers on tap.The littleneck clams app has a delicious lemon-herb sauce, but the half-price flat iron was the star: cooked to perfection, juicy, and well-seasoned. I'll have to come back hungrier to try a better cut. Sides of sprouts and truffle mac were both enjoyable, if a touch salty. Wish the HH menu featured more apps, like the flatbreads.In addition to dinner and drinks, they make killer desserts. Our party couldn't decide, so we got both their seasonal apple bread pudding and their fresh-baked cookies. Both were massive and really hit the spot for the sweet tooth folks. I'll be back for more drinks and eventually the rib eye. Maybe next time I'll actually sit in the bar area, but the volume of the music was blasting even sitting in the quieter dining room area. Great retro-Vegas, blast from the past experience.I feel like I came in on an off night. This was my night cap selection after an evening out with the lady. I love a good cocktail to end the night and relax, but this place was packed, loud and not an available seat in the house. I figured it be might more chill on Thursday night at 12:30am, but nope. We finally were able to sit down and were greeted by a server who had excellent knowledge of the drink menu. I chose from the "Years of Reform" menu, specifically the "Lion's Tail". This is a Rye Whiskey based drink with bitters, lime, bar syrup, and Allspice Dram. It was a very good cocktail with great flavors and nothing too overpowering. I could have had another, but the first drink took so long I didn't want to wait for another.We also ordered some fried calamari to snack-on while we hung out. This was a pretty basic plate of fried calamari, but you get almost an entire ocean's worth of fried salty morsels. This is a great option for sharing with friends, but the no mind blowing flavors here. I do love the prohibition look of this place and the dimly lit secret agent vibe, but I was wanting more. The bartender's seemed to be behind with a large party taking up most of the restaurant's service. I believe in second chances. Herbs and Rye I'll see you again soon!
La Hacienda=High end Mexican Restaurant?  Is there such a thing?  Sure there is!  La Hacienda is a perfect example of that.  Located inside the Fairmont Princess Resort, this gem offers a high end Mexican dining experience.  We've been here for happy hour and they have great Margaritas and we've come for dinner.  The dinner is spectacular.  Here's what we ordered:Guacamole, $14 (prepared tableside)http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-hacienda-by-richard-sandoval-scottsdale?select=2JkVDRonRyvi3jZx4_qUuw#2JkVDRonRyvi3jZx4_qUuwhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-hacienda-by-richard-sandoval-scottsdale?select=SROog3ZPUjd0R0GZ2r8HPg#SROog3ZPUjd0R0GZ2r8HPgQueso Fundido, $14http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-hacienda-by-richard-sandoval-scottsdale?select=fQNZkQPkLvIckEZDr9vdVg#fQNZkQPkLvIckEZDr9vdVgTampiquena, $30http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-hacienda-by-richard-sandoval-scottsdale?select=X-viGoMAkqDhmK28EWS9qg#X-viGoMAkqDhmK28EWS9qgChicken Mole Poblano, $24http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-hacienda-by-richard-sandoval-scottsdale?select=BURdzfDTQHaCEKxlrd2OXw#BURdzfDTQHaCEKxlrd2OXwBarbacoa de Res Taquitos, $14http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-hacienda-by-richard-sandoval-scottsdale?select=VjETCzzdeXy2X2xDAuDAUA#VjETCzzdeXy2X2xDAuDAUACapirotada, $9http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-hacienda-by-richard-sandoval-scottsdale?select=aGiE3CUwG1_n1NyO_d1BVg#aGiE3CUwG1_n1NyO_d1BVgTrio de Helados Fritos, $9http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-hacienda-by-richard-sandoval-scottsdale?select=4fhS2VZDUj07JKdJ_e6IsA#4fhS2VZDUj07JKdJ_e6IsAhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-hacienda-by-richard-sandoval-scottsdale?select=t5RYGd6HJBlje0-2aAKOwA#t5RYGd6HJBlje0-2aAKOwAFor appetizers, the tableside Guacamole is phenomenal....smooth and creamy.  They don't add too many Onions & Tomatoes, which is a mortal sin for Guac and most restaurants do that.  The Queso Fundido is excellent and comes with fresh, homemade Tortillas....definitely not store bought.For the entree, I had the Tampiquena, which is a Steak cut thin and served with an Enchilada, Corn Mash, and Guacamole.....another excellent dish!  The Enchilada is covered in Mole Sauce, which offers a smooth, chocolatey taste to compliment the Steak.  Amazing.Kiddo and The Wife had the Chicken Mole Poblano and the Barbacoa Taquitos.  They loved their dishes and finished their plate.Dessert was the Capirotada and the Trio de Helados Fritos.  All I can say is yum!  I could only muster a bite of each because I was stuffed.  The family finished the rest.Service was spectacular throughout dinner.  I highly recommend this place to anyone visiting Scottsdale.Return Factor - 95%

Hillside Spot=5/27/10After reading a couple of reviews on Hillside Spot, I decided to check it out myself.  Besides noticing that the line was still long, despite it being around 1030-1045 on a Thursday morning, I also noticed that this place gets NOISY!  I didn't care if it was full-on sun outdoors and already hot, I could not, and would not, bear the noise indoors :(, and apparently a few customers had the same idea, bec. the only available tables out there were lacking umbrellas.  [I'd give 4 or more stars if it wasn't so loud!!]  Don't fret, though, as I found one of the staff was willing to set up a table w/ an umbrella- all you have to do is ask!I already checked the menu online for ideas, so I already knew what I might want to try.  Bec. of the crowd and the noise that greeted me on this first visit, which jarred me and had me scrambling for some space, I wasn't able to check out the display cases and counterspace w/ their array of pastries- cupcakes, apple pie by-the-slice, cookies, tarts, muffins, and scones, which vary daily.  Do check them out!  (The apple pie is so so good!)  The daily special sounded good, but I decided I'd try the Croque Madame (a Croque monsieur topped w/ a fried egg) and the Pancakes w/ Apple Compote.  Ordering is at the counter where you pay and take a card to mark your table w/.  It takes awhile for your food to be prepared, so keep this in mind when you do decide to visit.  I'd say this would be a good time to check out the pastries, but depending on how busy HS gets, you may want to place all of your order selections in the beginning and get it over w/.The croque madame is simply outstanding!  Well, except for the burnt bits.  The French bread (from MJ Bread, I believe) was just perfect, topped w/ a fantastic bechamel sauce, sliced ham, melty gruyere cheese, and a fried egg!  This is definitely an item I would order again and again!The pancakes were good (loved the batter mix!), but "apple compote," this wasn't!  OK, I admit, the compotes I've had thus far were fruit reductions that were thick and sweetened from the natural juices, as well as added sugar, so perhaps Hillside Spot's "apple compote" technically qualifies as a compote (as defined by dictionary.com- "fruit stewed or cooked in a syrup"), but I found the topping as neither sweet nor stewed enough (the chopped apples still had a lot of crunch in them!).  Thankfully, I had my bottle of pure maple syrup in my purse to sweeten the pancakes!  :)7/24/10I visited HS for a second time in early June and tried the berry pancakes w/ homemade whipped cream.  These were delightful!  I almost ate the whole thing, and had I not tried the apple pie, I definitely would've polished them off.  The added bananas (perfectly ripened) took this dish over-the-top!Just went there for breakfast. It was a complete disaster. We waited in line for 5 minutes for the hostess to take our name and then waited 15 minutes after that to be seated. This was a little frustrating since we could see there were open tables. Once we were sat on the patio, the waitress took our drink order and didn't come back to take our food order for about 15 minutes. She seemed annoyed and indifferent.We waited FOREVER for our food. People around us were clearly as displeased as we were. The waitress never came over to refill our drinks or offer any explanation for the wait. It was almost as if she was avoiding us. We just sat and waited, getting more annoyed every minute. We watched as tables of customers sat with no food and the staff milled around, no pep in their step, no sense of urgency. They all seemed like they really could not care less about their jobs and their tips. When we finally got our food it was nothing impressive. We basically got an $8 slice of bread with some ham and cheese on it. Nothing anyone couldn't make at home. Never got a refill on our drinks. Food was edible but I wouldn't call it "good". The waitress explained, after I asked why it took so long that 3 people in the kitchen had walked out so that's why she was frustrated. SHE WAS FRUSTRATED? I couldn't believe she had the nerve to say that when she wasn't doing anything to make up for it. I would respect them if they looked like they were trying but they really weren't. There was no sign of a manager or owner. It looked like a bunch of sloppy, apathetic kids with no guidance working there. If your kitchen staff walked out that's a clear indication of a problem. It's too bad because the ambiance is cute and hip, and this area could really use a privately owned spot for breakfast, but all in all, I would say DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY on this poorly managed joint. We won't be back.There are two main reasons why I frequent  Hillside Spot in Ahwatukee.  One, because it is close to home.  And two, because is the closest location to my house that regularly carries a fairly decent choice of craft beers in my neighborhood.I've enjoyed bringing my family here, meeting friends here for craft beer nights, even conducting a few casual business meetings here.  The atmosphere is nice, the food is pretty good, but the reason I am revising my review has nothing to do with the food or the atmosphere, but more to do with the service and management.A couple weeks ago we stopped in for dinner after and evening event.  On the way out, I stopped to look at the cooler and found a couple of bombers that I thought I would take home.  One of the things I would always tell people about this place was the excellent deals offered on carry out beers.  For $8.95 you can build your own 6-pack of 12oz cans/bottles, or you can choose two bombers for the same  price, as long as you are carrying it out of the restaurant.  So, I take to two bombers to the register and a few minutes later some snarky little wannabe hipster comes to ring me up.  The first words from his mouth was that he could not sell me this one particular bomber for that price because it was a more expensive brew than the others.   I asked why they would have that beer in the same cooler with the other $8.95 bottles...but was pretty much blown off.  I mentioned that it's not really appropriate to advertise one price on the shelf and then charge another at the register....again, just a rude, non-response.So this past Friday night we stopped in again for dinner.  Again, I stopped at the cooler on the way out and found two beers to take home, thinking they must have surely fixed the issue from last time.  To my disappointment, the same snarky, hipster wannabe comes out and rudely proceeds with his spew.  I asked if he was the beer buyer for the establishment he affirmed adding that he was also an assistant manager for the place, but he was not there in that capacity on that night. Again, I asked him as a manager, if he thought it was ok to have beers being advertised for one price in the cooler, but then telling customers, 'not that one' when they bring up their choices.  Again, I got a rude non-answer.Today I would like to retract my previous reviews.  I would also like to warn any of my craft beer friends from the area who may stop by this place based on my previous recommendation.  After the rudeness I experienced here on Friday night, we will find another close-by local spot with good beers.  Perhaps Tukee's.So badly, do I want to give these guys five stars. And each time I visit I am hopeful for a better experience.  Unfortunately, this place has consistently poor service.  Long waits for food, incorrectly taken orders and generally inattentive servers are just a few of the problems.  What continues to frustrate me more than anything is the beer cooler in the front of the store, and the borderline dishonest pricing advertised.   Above the cooler on a chalk board they advertise two of the bombers to go for $8.99*.  Select bottles do not apply.  But they don't label the prices!  You don't find out that both bombers you chose were exempt from the deal until you are making the purchase.  I've mentioned this frustration  to the staff in the past, only to be rudely spoken down to by someone claiming to be an assistant manager and one of the beer buyers.If this place wasn't just a couple blocks from my home I would have never returned after my initial bad experience.  But they are close and convenient, and at certain times they are the only alternative to fast food in the immediate area.  Their food has been pretty good for the most part....I just wish they could get their service and their craft beer issues solved so I can start recommending this place to friends again.Interesting place. Expansive menu. They apparently take pride in the ingredients in their food, which is a good thing.Just don't tell them that you're under any sort of time constraint, as they really don't seem to care, despite the fact that it was mentioned *several* times. I wouldn't recommend it for lunch during the week on your lunch hour, even if "lunch" happens to be 2:00 PM. On a Tuesday. I'm guessing that the slow service is because they take the time to let your food die from natural causes, painlessly, in its sleep, before cooking it up and serving it to you. Honestly, I'm kind of disappointed, especially after the rave reviews that friends had given it.When I checked in, the Yelp app asked me if Hillside Spot was "hipster"; I guess that sums it up. They're not worried about "the man's" bourgeois constructs like "time" and "work".In short- food... Good. Service... Good. Attention to time constraints... Needs work.
Wholly Grill=As a Filipino in Phoenix it's hard to find Filipino restaurants in Phoenix especially Tagalog Filipino cooking. Most Filipinos in Phoenix are illocano or Visayan and there really isn't alot of Filipino restaurants to try so when my mom and I saw a banner outside of Mekong Plaza of a Filipino grill that just opened, I made sure that the next time I found myself at Mekong I'd stop and try it out. Anywho, Wholly Grill is owned by a Cebuana, and they specialize in grilling hence the name. There are usually two things I'll try out at a Filipino restaurant and that is their barbeque and the house special. In this case it was the pork barbeque and the Liempo (grilled pork belly). Chona the owner was pulling out all the stops to get people to try out her place hence the 4 stars coz she was giving out samples. The barbeque was not sweet which was good and not too saucy! I think that's what people are not big fans of and that's sugar sweet filipino food. The Liempo was not fatty nor salty and with the 2 scoops of rice and the macaroni salad (pinoy style with the raisins) along with two pork bbq sticks for around $10 it wasn't a bad deal. I just wish she had sago or Halo-Halo. But it's not bad, and if I need a Filipino fix I'll stop by at Wholly Grill! you should too!4/7/10Wanted to try this place back in March when Mom and I spotted an ad mentioning Filipino food in the plaza, but we'd already eaten pho, so had to wait until the next shopping opportunity brought us to this area again.  Met the very warm and friendly owners-- we really do wish them great success!Since it was almost closing time, the food items in the buffet, and there weren't many to choose from, didn't look interesting, so we decided to try the pork skewers (the recipe of which the husband and wife team were very proud of), as well as the liempo (pork belly) serving that called out to Mom.  A combo plate of these two items also came with rice and achara (pickled papaya and carrots).  I also ordered one piece of saba at langka [saba bananas (or in this case, plantains) and jackfruit, wrapped in lumpia wrapper and deep-fried].The wait for our food took longer than I expected, but it wasn't too much of an issue since Mom took awhile to do the groceries.  The wait, however, was worth it!  I really enjoyed the pork barbecue skewers- the flavors really took me back to my childhood in the Philippines, when street food, already a daily ritual for us then (and just now gaining popularity stateside) had us sampling BBQ, fried fishballs (and the many different sauces to dip them in!), steamed rolled rice and tuber pancakes, ripe and sour mangoes (the latter eaten with bagoong (very tiny salted shrimp) or vinegar and garlic, and "dirty" ice cream, to name a few from food carts that were to be seen all over Metro Manila and around colleges (grammar schools) and universities ("colleges" here).  Writing about those pork skewers actually make me want to stop at Mekong Plaza now, instead of going for Italian or French food I was considering earlier!  The liempo, on the other hand, I could've gone without; I remember thinking that we should've just ordered a double of the BBQ!  The skewers were just more flavorful than the pork belly pieces.  While Mom enjoyed the liempo, she did agree that the BBQ was were the money was at, and the owners really did have something to be proud of!Let's not forget the dessert!  On second thought, maybe we should.  First, I didn't care for the presentation.  Take a gander at the photos, and you'll see what I mean.  Second, it wasn't very sweet.  Not even sweet enough.  See that pool of caramel sauce the turon rested on?  I did not leave a single drop on the plate!  Not because it was so delicious, but because the roll really needed the added punch.  Mom already knew it wasn't going to be anything to write home about, just by looking at the offering, but did wait till I took a couple of bites before saying "I should've just bought the ingredients at Mekong and made you those at home!"  My sentiments exactly, Mommy dearest!Oh, but the pork BBQ!  Run and try some now!I have one word for you, son.Porkbellies.Specifically, GRILLED Porkbellies.With a side of rice, a side of pickled eggplant, a side of macaroni salad, and a side of cucumbers.It doesn't get much better than this.  (crunch, crunch, crunch)
Carl's Jr.=I knew better than to stop by here, but I was hungry and I no longer resist the temptation to try some of those "fresh made" Breaded Chicken Tenders.  I ordered a 3 Piece Chicken Tender, Bean Burrito, and Western Bacon Cheeseburger.  It took a while for the food to come out....I guess they really do make them by hand.  The first item I had was the Western Bacon Cheeseburger.....once upon a time, this was my favorite Burger.  Now, it's just awful.  The Bacon doesn't even taste like Bacon.....it's that paper-thin, pre-cooked, microwave Bacon, blech!  And the Onion Rings inside the Burger were very poor quality....I took one bite and the entire Onion came out of the Ring because it was so tough.Next up was the Bean Burrito....it was just ok.  I'd rather have a Bean Burrito from Taco Bell or Del Taco.  Don't know why I ordered it.Last up was the Hand Breaded Chicken Tenders.....I saved them for last because if they were fresh, they'd be piping hot and I don't want to burn my mouth.  I bit into the first piece and yuck!!!  It was rubbery.....just awful.  I didn't finish the rest of them.....what a waste of time, money, and calories. Damn.They get 2 Stars instead of 1 Star because the employees were very nice and friendly and the place was clean.  You can have your Happy Star!Return Factor - 0.001%
Round Corner Cantina=It is dark in here. Like really REALLY dark! Like you could make out in the corner and no one would really notice dark. Let's not be silly though, I didn't make up in there, I come to eat! I really do enjoy this place, even if I have to feel around for the taco's on my plate because I can't see them. But this just makes me sound old. So on to the good part, the food! So good! I had the mahi mahi taco's and the pork taco's and they are exceptional! I love when they put cabbage in a taco, I know that sounds weird, but it's just so tasty with the marinade they use! I know that Chi Chi's (RIP) trained me to expect free chips and salsa, so it's always nice to have them free. Sorry to burst the bubble, but they're four bucks a pop....BUT it is an endless basket. Which is good because it usually disappears in about 5.5 seconds. I'm also a big judge of salsa, and this salsa definitely passes the test, with just the right amount of kick! I do LOVE the outside area! There's tons of seating and benches and it's just so great to sit out there on a nice warm summer night with a tall glass of Dos Equis! And I am SO into tequila...badly into it. So watch out, because that bill can get high when that's in the mix! You can also trip down the steps in the dark as night dining room after too many....I don't understand the appeal of this place.  Unless you have a seat at the bar or are lucky enough to be trapped there and can get the bartender's attention, the service is abysmal at best, non-existant at worst.Note to everyone - if you plan on having dinner, you will be there all night.  Cancel all other plans.  If you're lucky, you will get your dinner around last call.The one time I was actually served food at Round Corner, the food was pretty good..  It was also empty, so that is why I was able to actually order.  So maybe the long wait is a bit of hyperbole, but we arrived at Round Corner around 7.  We were seated quick enough, however the waiting game had just started.  We weren't greeted by our waitress for about 10 minutes who said she would be right with us and disappeared for another 10.  At least she returned with water for all.  She took our drink order and left without our food order.  This is when I realized we were in trouble. At 7:45, she returned with our drinks and promptly walked away again.  Yes, if you're doing the math, it took 25 minutes to get a round of 4 drinks.  All beer.She returned around 8pm, by then we had been there an hour and we asked first for another round (to get a head start on that) and ordered our dinner.  That was the last we saw of her.  After another 15 minutes or so, my friend went to the bar to find the status of our missing waitress. Our best guess was that she had been kidnapped and held for ransom unknown reason.  My friend returned in just under 5 minutes with a new round for us and said that they were free due to the circumstances.By 8:45 we had finished all of our drinks and still had not even seen our waitress in the dining room.  At 8:46 we left money on the table for the beer and a note that the money was for her ransom and left on our way to Tamari never to return.Holy expensive tacos Batman I will not be back.  I ordered a total of 4 tacos and a beer grand total $25.00 dollars.  My hubby had two chorizo and papas tacos and I had a two tacos that had a shrimp and cheese filling the name escapes me.  The menu boasts of house made chorizo but we could barely taste any chorizo in the tacos. There seemed to be only one shrimp cut up into 3 pieces in each of my tacos. I watched the cook walk back and forth between the kitchen and the dining room 8 times touching everything in the dining room and sitting down with a waitress to eat chips and salsa.  Granted the NBA Dunk Contest was on the bigscreen so it's possible that he didn't want to miss out on the action.  I would expect more professionalism from a place that charged $8 for two tacos.I visited Round Corner Cantina with my cousin last Sat.  We were looking for a place to have dinner, so I looked through my pack of City Dining Cards.  Based on the options available, my cousin and I both decided on Round Corner, so we headed over to Lawrenceville to check it out.At the time of our visit, it had just finished raining, so almost all of the tables on the patio were empty.  We decided to hedge our bets by sitting at the outdoor bar, which had partly covered seats.  Fortunately, it didn't rain any more, and the rest of the tables on the patio filled up during the time of our visit.  To get to the patio, when you walk in the front door, proceed to the doorway at the far end of the bar and you'll see another doorway leading to it right after that (this wasn't clear to us upon first entering!).  I highly recommend sitting on the patio if possible, since it's quite nice, whereas the indoor rooms are dark and stuffy.Once seated, we started off by ordering chips and guacamole ($7), which came out in about 5 min.  The chips were underseasoned and had a bit of a waxy texture, and the dip was fresh (containing avocado chunks) but wasn't super flavorful.  Nevertheless, they served their purpose as an appetizer by giving us something to munch on while awaiting the rest of our order.  This was a good thing, since the rest of our order took 30 min. to come out, which the bartender said was due to the printer in the kitchen breaking.For our entrees, my cousin ordered the pescado (fish) tacos ($9), and I ordered the carnitas (pork) tacos ($9).  We each exchanged a taco with one another so that we could both try both different types of tacos.  I found the tacos mediocre in flavor and composition, esp. for the price.  The fish was the better of the two--the shell of the pork taco fell apart while I ate it due to grease, and the meat was a bit chewy.  We also ordered the elote (Mexican street corn; $5) as a side item. This was by far the best part of the meal--the cotija cheese topping was quite delicious.  Even so, the corn was a bit mushy, which detracted from the overall effect.Overall, I was less than impressed with the quality of the food at Round Corner, esp. for the price (fortunately, we didn't pay full price thanks to the City Dining Card).  And, needless to say, I wasn't exactly pleased with having to wait so long for the main order, esp. after the initial order was fulfilled so quickly.  However, the patio provides a nice environment, and our service from the bartender was good, notwithstanding the kitchen delay.  If you're looking for great traditional tacos, I suggest Las Palmas in Oakland or Edgar's in the Strip, and if you're looking for delicious upscale tacos, I recommend Tako downtown.  In general, I'd suggest sticking to drinks and apps at Round Corner, and giving most of the food a pass.  2.5 stars.
Vincent's=This is some goooood pizza.... and the customer service is just as good :) i got there early waiting for my friend... so i sat down and right away the little blonde girl came over from behind the counter and asked me if i wanted anything ... (water with lemon lol) from what i saw you order from the counter.. pay.. sit down and they then bring you your food... i thought it to be a nice gesture :) especially since she didn't have to :) my friend finally showed up... it was grub time !! i had the Hawaiian and pepperoni and a side salad with ranch... first off the salad was amazing! red onions chopped up in it and carrots and other stuff too not like a normal side salad with iceberg lettuce and some croutons.... i was happy :) the pizza slices were huge.. and they were generous with the toppings :) the pineapples tasted awesome and my favorite part of the pizza was the crust.. :) (and that goes for any pizza.. i love bread! Italian for sure ) and their menu is huge... lots of choices and i like that... especially since i change my mind alot lol they had a bunch of flat screen TVs on the walls... with different channels on each one... i like that... who wants to watch the same game on every TV you see..!! i really liked the food and the atmosphere and especially the employees... they were friendly, helpful and very prompt with out food :) i will be back for lunch again in the future :)
Maui Wowi Hawaiian=I first tried Maui Wowi when I checked in on FourSquare to get a 15% discount.  A 15% discount on a cup of coffee doesn't amount to much, I know.  For that matter, neither does FourSquare, as far as I can tell after being on it for a couple months.  I feel like a dog going around marking my turf. Maybe they'll build to something, we'll see. If they keep getting money thrown at them they should eventually be able to produce something, right?Wait, was I reviewing FourSquare or Maui Wowi?  It was Maui Wowi wasn't it?So the iced mocha I had (with half chocolate per my request) was delicious.  I mean really delicious.So I came back another time to try the hot mocha (1/2 chocolate again - I like to taste COFFEE with a little chocolate, not CHOCOLATE SYRUP with a little coffee like some coffee houses make). It was quite good as well.The folks are very friendly and accommodating.I also started chatting with a guy named Phil who moved here from Foxboro, MA.  I moved here from Mansfield, MA. Neighboring 'burbs of Boston.
Grind Burger Bar and Lounge=My buddy was craving a burger for dinner and I remember driving by this place earlier in the day so we hit this place up. The host asked us if we wanted to sit at a table or at the bar. I wanted a pint, so I opted for the bar. I asked the bartender what they had on tap. His reply was, "nothing." Ok...fine no tap...so I ask for a Stella. Bartender says, "we don't have that...we only have cans." Wtf?!! What bar only serves beer in cans? I settled for an Amstel Light. Later I noticed on the bill that each can of Amstel Light was $5. I had 2 cans. A can of Amstel Light should not be $5. I should've just had a milkshake.What I ordered:-Premium Fresh Ground Chuck, Hand Pressed $9.00-Regular Bun-Pepper Jack Cheese $0.75-Toppings (2 included) $0.75 each:  Lettuce  Tomatoes   Marinated Mushrooms-Sauce (2 included) $0.75 each:  Roasted Garlic MayoI asked the bartender if I could pick 3 toppings since I only wanted 1 sauce. He replied in a rude tone, "that's not how it works!" I don't understand why he couldn't give me the 3rd topping for free. I only picked 1 sauce and extra toppings are the same price as extra sauces. The burger tasted ok for a $10.50 burger. The bill for the 2 of us was $46.48. If I'm spending this much at a burger place...I should at least be getting my beer in a bottle.Next time I'm going back to Burger Bar!Stopped by on the way to the airport with Mom to have lunch.  I've had this place on my "To Do" list for a while.....it was time to give it a try.  The decor is very nice and modern and I like how they are connected to a full service bar and separated by glass.....so the smokers in the bar won't bother the diners.  We were given menus and seated.  We were told that the menu doubles as an order sheet.....in other words, it's a custom Burger joint where you select each item for your Burger.....cool.After browsing the menu for a few minutes, I decided to go with:Juicy Lucy Burger w/Regular Bun, BBQ Sauce, Jalapenos, Marinated Onions, American Cheese, Cheddar Cheese $9.50+Bacon $1.50http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/UcgCSTCtPv1GeW5bKsEdag?select=r_g9twzpNXEvAjfXwIG20QTall and Thin Fries - $4http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/UcgCSTCtPv1GeW5bKsEdag?select=8hrzsZ1yfIxHC-3pxww4bAMom went with a Turkey Burger w/Lettuce, Tomatoes, Onions, and Jalapenos, $8.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/UcgCSTCtPv1GeW5bKsEdag?select=OvID1zfcEgO1ZvMXtMhyggThe Juicy Lucy is two Burger patties cooked together with the Cheese in the middle between the patties.  I've seen Burgers like this on the Food Network and was anxious to give this a try.After a few minutes our food was ready and I bit into the Juicy Lucy.....the Cheese oozed out of the center of the Burger.....you have to be really careful because it's HOT!http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/UcgCSTCtPv1GeW5bKsEdag?select=-IseHtIgiZZxOT1A8n4KpAThe Burger was good, but not great....I thought the toppings and Bun were the highlight of the Burger....the Meat was OK, but wasn't great.....I don't know, it was missing "something".  The BBQ Sauce was excellent and added some much needed flavor to the Burger.  I liked the Marinated Onions....would like to know how they are prepared.The Fries were very good and it's enough to serve 2 people.Mom enjoyed her Turkey Burger, but said she's not sure it was worth $8.  I would agree with her....for the price of our Burgers, I was hoping they would be mind-blowing.....they were good, but not great.  I will probably come back and give it another shot.....maybe I picked the wrong combo of toppings.Return Factor - 75%Finally have had a chance to try a burger here since my boyfriend has been telling me about it for the longest time. We just happen to have a coupon for a buy one get one free burger from the 2013 Entertainment book so here we went for dinner! I have no idea how the College kids can afford to eat here with these prices.They give you a product requisition form (menu) and you check off what you would like such as the size patty and the toppings you want. This is creative, cute and perhaps fun however it just really delayed the time in getting our order in. Myself being a Grind Burger virgin it just seemed to take forever to go over the complete menu, mark off what I wanted just to have the Server repeat it back to us. Save the paper and printing fees and just create a more reasonable menu.Every item is Ala carte which is fine however when it is like that I expect the side items, such as fries to be really good not just ordinary. I was disappointed with the fries they were lacking flavor and the portion for what they charge was very little. We ordered the short & thick fries which are potato wedge style and nothing special.I decided on a 4oz burger 7.49 with cheddar .75 additional and free toppings of lettuce, tomato, onion and garlic mayo. How is it free, who wants a plain burger seriously and those are standard cheeseburger toppings to specify them as free is absurd. Anyhow, my boyfriend got the infamous "Juicy Lucy" a patty with cheese on the inside 10.99 he opted for Pepper Jack. He truly enjoyed his burger that he had consumed in less than 4 bites, yikes and that is an 8oz patty!I was joking with my boyfriend that this is not a place that I would come on a first date,  as it was so damn messy! The burgers taste good and are really juicy as my meat juice and toppings were just oozing all over the place! I had a damn hamburger salad left on my plate after I finished my burger. The hamburger buns are the star player as they were so fresh and tasty almost a hint of sweetness like Hawaiian sweet bread.The Service was good, maybe too attentive. We went on a Sunday night and asked to sit in the bar so that we could watch the football game while eating. Unfortunately we were the only ones there dining at the time which I usually like when we eat out rather than huge crowds! The bartender gal had nothing to do but focus on us. She was nice but way too in our mix, we just want to relax and eat and if you are coming over every second or talking to us from across the room every moment it is rather annoying! I know who complains about an attentive staff however this was beyond ridiculous and avoiding eye contact was not working either. When I am busy stuffing my face with a big fat juicy burger the last thing i want to do is have to respond to a conversation I never wanted to join in the first place!  This is one of those burger joints I only need to try once, I am one and done. Next!I posted pictures of our meals as well, enjoy :)Entertainment book 2013 savings this meal $8.24Go big or go home! That's what I thought when I hesitantly ordered the Juicy Lucy. The waitress ,husband , and my brother emphasized it was big. I couldn't ignore the reviews though because I read everyone was really happy with the Juicy Lucy.. I wanted it and got it with no regrets! It was stuffed with Provolone cheese. I had it topped with lettuce, tomato, onion, jalapenos,mustard and garlic mayo. When I bit into it the waitress said to be careful just in case the hot cheese squirts in my eye or something . It oozed out of the burger it tasted heavenly. This has now made it to the top of my burger list! It was so good I had to share with my hubby who almost ate it all! I wouldn't waste my money on the fries because they tasted mediocre. We ended the meal with a chocolate sundae. It was ice cold deliciousness! I would definitely want to come back for that burger even though it's a bit out of my way!Awkward. Everything about our dinner here was awkward. We were not drinking so we decided to sit in the restaurant area... We were the only people seated there at the time. The table we were put at at was awkward, with a pole in the middle of it that seemed to make it difficult for staff to serve and clear plates. The chairs were uncomfortable. Ordering was awkward. The menu is a sheet of paper you mark your order on. Our waitress thought my husband only wanted an appetizer,  despite the fact that his standardized-test type ordering form was clearly completed to indicate he wanted a burger with specific toppings. Prices were high too, over $10 for a burger that didn't come with fries ($4 if you want to add a side of fries)... $10 for 3 smaller-than-typical sliders. Speaking of our waitress, not only was she rather poor at reading the ordering form but she also lacked in the personality department. Her entire vibe was a buzz kill. Most of this would be forgiven if the food was good... We started with fried mozzarella, served with the blandest marinara ever.  My husband had the Juicy Lucy which comes stuffed with cheese. I had the sliders which came with cheese and a side of thousand island dressing (pickles would have been nice). I found the meat under seasoned and overcooked. My husband didn't complain about his burger but he did have a ton of toppings added... Even the bathroom was awkward... There is no separation between the toilet and sink and a rather gross, messy floor. It took ages to get our check, we had to ask the busser to find our waitress to finally get the hell out of there...  There are a lot of places to overpay for a burger and fries on the Strip, which means there is no reason for me to ever come back here.
O'Thym=This was another recommendation by our B&B hosts.  We made 7:00 reservations and walked over.  We were greeted warmly but w/ the concern that we knew we were to bring our own wine, a concern that was echoed by our server.  We explained that we did, but only one of us drank wine, so it wasn't practical for us to bring a bottle.  Had we known before dinner at Steak Frîtes a couple of nights ago about bringing our own wine the bottle would likely have lasted me three dinners.We were brought the English menu and our server explained which dishes were no longer available and what had replaced them.  We decided to share an appetizer of pumpkin and walnut ravioli and grilled calamari.  Alan ordered the fish special (a white fish, the type I can't remember) and I ordered the rack of lamb.  We were brought a sliced baguette in a graceful Nambé-like elongated bowl accompanied by a small ramekin of butter.  Unexpectedly we were both brought bowls of a squash-cabbage soup.  It was thick and beautifully seasoned.  Completely delicious.The appetizer arrived and we were very sorry we hadn't brought the camera because the presentation was so beautiful.  The calamari was atop the ravioli and artfully arranged atop the calamari were delicate sprigs of herbs.  Under and around the ravioli were finely chopped tomatoes and tentacles.  Alan took the calamari and cut it in half while I took the ravioli (I should say raviolo because there was a single one) and cut it in half.  We exchanged halves and sprinkled some tomato and tentacles on top.  It was very tasty and we enjoyed it but would have appreciated a bit more generous portion for the price, like two ravioli.  We used the last of the bread to sop up the delicious sauce in the bottom of the bowl.  We were offered a lemon-vodka sorbet as a palate cleanser between courses but Alan declined and I didn't have any either.When our mains arrived they were again beautifully presented and accompanied by an interesting assortment of vegetables.  My lamb had a couple of small potatoes that had an appealing smokey flavor, a couple of barely cooked baby carrots and a mixture of shredded red and white cabbage.  It was a wonderful mélange.  The lamb was cooked medium rare and it was very tender.   Alan's fish was accompanied by thin slices of kumquat and a variety of vegetables.  He loved it and the bite I had was excellent.  After all that we had no room for dessert.  We had a lovely conversation w/ the people at the adjacent table, Swedish parents visiting their college age son here.  It's the kind of conversation you sometimes fall into while traveling.  Service was seamless, personable and smooth.  The noise level was a bit high because the ceilings are high and the walls are brick.  We enjoyed our evening here.  4.51 rounded up.Mon nouveau restaurant préféré a Montréal. O'Thym a été d'un professionalisme exemplaire lors de la soirée d'anniversaire que nous avons donné en l'honneur de mon copain. Nous avions réservé pour 13 personnes, un mardi. Le service fut d'une qualité exceptionnelle : honnête, chaleureux et discret. Le menu présenté sur une ardoise semblait déjà alléchant mais quand notre serveur nous en a fait la description détaillée nous avions tous véritablement l'eau à la bouche !Le service fut rapide, tous les plats sont arrivés en même temps. Tous les mets ont eu un franc succès. A la table, les gens s'échangeait des bouchées et commentaient favorablement la qualité des plats.Le concept apportez votre vin nous a permis de vraiment se laisser aller dans la nourriture sans compromettre la qualité du vin ($). Définitivement, nous y retournerons pour une prochaine occasion.
The Dive N=The name of this restaurant is actually "The Dive N".  I ate here for the first time today and was pleasantly surprised.  They only serve breakfast and lunch and they have daily specials for each.  The theme is that of a 50's style diner.With some reservations I decided to try to the BBQ plate.  Once I ordered I thought for sure I had made a mistake because I know what good Q tastes like and I just ordered it from a 50's style diner.  That's usually a big no no!  As you can see from the pic of the plate it's a nice portion of food.  I was acutally impressed by the pulled BBQ!  It was very tasty and I was a fan of the vinegar based sauce that accompanied it.  The slaw was great, finely chopped just the way I like it.  Also the drinks they serve come with that really crushed ice which is a favorite of mine.  I don't know why more restaurants don't have that?!?!  The BBQ plate was $7.25 plus $1.25 for the drink.The staff was very friendly and the restaurant area was very clean which is always a plus.  I will definitely be back here again to try some of their other menu items, but for first impressions I give them 4 stars!
Pink's Hot Dogs=It was pretty exciting to try Pink's for the very first time. But my sis said this location is $3-$4 more per item compared to the LA location. Not only that, but the menu is shorter and the specials are not the same. The good thing is, there's no crazy hour wait like in LA. Had the Vegas Strip Hot Dog. Two hot dogs, served with chili, mustard, guacamole and jalapenos. Very tasty, but a bit on the heavy side. Especially in 100+ degree weather since there's only outdoor seating. Sis had the Bacon Chili Cheese Dog, which was pretty good too. Gotta love chili! Had a bite of the Pastrami Burrito. Now that was just weird. Hot dog, pastrimi, chili, cheese and onions. Odd combo and taste. Pass. Lastly, their fries were very good. Seasoned and crispy, just the way I like it. After combo-ing my hot dog, it came out to like $12! Wow. That's some expensive hot dog that I couldn't even finish. Not because it was big, but it was just too difficult to eat in that hot weather.Pink's is one of those over-hyped places and since this location is in Vegas, also super over-priced! It was located right outside the Planet Hollywood hotel and wasn't hard to find with its bright, pink name etched on the glass. At least there was no line at all when we got there. Only outdoor seating so refrain from getting anything too spicy in the humid weather.It was $6.75 for my bacon chili cheese dog...not really worth it especially when the ones at the original Pink's in LA cost almost half that. It was topped with bacon, tomato, cheese, and mustard since I didn't want onions on mine. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/uQB9kS7LzEsGhLTMUUnmEA?select=3FCsHb9yQxmpuyvnn8fyxA) The bacon was nice and crispy but the hot dog was TINY and wasn't anything special. The ones from Costco are way bigger! My bun was also flimsy and broke in half after 2 bites. It could have used much more chili and the cheese wasn't melted enough. It was still a tasty meal overall but totally not worth the price tag.The Pink's in Southern California is another one of my bookmarked businesses. And again the franchise opened another location in Las Vegas. Located right on the busy Las Vegas Blvd strip and in the Planet Hollywood resort, there are no indoor seating, but plenty of outdoor seating. A great view of the strip and the Bellagio Hotel located across the street. I had one of their unique hot-dogs-"Three Dog Night". For $8.25, I get three skinny hot dogs wrapped with bacon and chlli, cheese and chopped red onions in a flour tortilla. This gourmet hot dog is featured on Triple-D in So-Cal and Guy Fieri considered this hot dog, "MONEY". But my hot dog is nowhere as good as his, where my slices of bacon was "undercooked" and not crispy. I still prefer the Bacon Dog Cart on Mission St in San Francisco any given day. The only positive thing about the small hot dog place is that I get to see the fountain show at the Bellagio while eating my subpar snack. I'll still go to the Pink's in Southern California and check out other items though.Three Dog night: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/T0Uw6vwwfO3el29wBoDamQ?select=ZPkgzbo64jO7u91BF6eXsADude, it's Pink's...in Vegas. My two favorite things in the world. OK, I really don't feel that way. But if I was a surfer dude from Redondo Beach out with my buds for a Vegas weekend, this would certainly be my dining destination of choice. Since I'm not, I guess I can be a little more discriminating. But dude, it's Pink's. Well not quite Pink's. Just a reasonable facsimile in an apt setting, Planet Hollywood. Jamie W. and I really wanted some dogs after strolling through the sterile City Center complex which has none of the kitsch that really is Vegas. Luckily, Pink's has kitsch to spare in its patio setting outside the hotel entrance. The menu looked familiar. We decided to each get a $4.75 Giant 12-inch Jalapeno Dog with nacho cheese and chili, and share a $6.50 "Planet Hollywood" Dog, which consisted of a Polish sausage, grilled onions, grilled mushrooms, bacon and cheese (see photos). Oh did I mention the fries, too? Nice and tasty they were. Indigestion thy name is Pink's. The Jalapeno Dog has that snap to the wiener that I don't care for much. I prefer a meatier dog to the tooth, and the mustard was way overwhelming, but chili, cheese and diced onions are bulletproof on a dog as far as I'm concerned. The "Planet Hollywood" Dog has quite a pile of toppings to maneuver in your mouth starting with the bacon strips lording over the sausage already drowning in melted cheese. The mushrooms seemed almost incidental to the creation, but they were good. Hell, it was all good in a bad, bad way. FOOD - 3 stars....quite an abundance of toppings on those dogs but not quite the Pink's I remember in LA AMBIANCE - 2 stars...hell, it's just a patio...in pink SERVICE - 2.5 stars...just keep moving the line and the dogs will eventually be there TOTAL - 3 stars...a middling experience based on a distant memory of the Pink's in LAAfter checking in and settling down in our Planet Hollywood room, Anchalee was starving for something simple. We hadn't eaten anything since our breakfast at Firewood Grill inside SFO at about 10 am, and now it was around 3:30 pm. The first eatery that caught her eye was Pink's Hot Dogs located outside Planet Hollywood but still around the premises because she was thinking of Top Dog in Berkeley. You really couldn't miss it with it's big pink sign. There was a super extensive menu of dogs, burgers, burritos, soda and alcoholic beverages, sides, and desserts. We chose only one hot dog to share, a Naked Polish, since we weren't looking for all the fix-ins. Can you really justify a $6 Polish dog? And that's before tax too. Maybe it was possibly for the polish dog size and since we were in a tourist attraction city, but I wouldn't want to pay this price on a daily basis. If it included a drink as a meal, then maybe that's a deal. Yes, the Polish was spicy, juicy, and hot. But there wasn't anything special about the bun. After consuming this expensive snack, I thought to myself I can't wait to get back to the Bay Area so I can really be spoiled and eat a good hot dog from Top Dog for $3.25 each. Family owned since 1939, it's always worth a try for something new with a little flair!Pink's was one of the cheapest meals we had in Vegas! $26 for three people was a nice change of pace from spending triple & quadruple that at other eateries. This was my first time eating at this Vegas location but I'd been to the original So Cal one a few times. I ordered my usual: a veggie hot dog covered in chili cheese & onions. Completely messy & totally heavy in the stomach; exactly what junk food should be. My companions ordered polish dogs. Even though I don't eat meat hot dogs, I like that I don't have to be excluded from dining at Pink's with people who do because they serve veggie dogs. Brownie points for that. Pink's food is kind of 'eh' but it's fun to eat outside, under heating lamps & surrounded by lights on The Strip.Pink's is a humongo staple in LA...and every time I'm outside the place I swear off poppin my Pink's cherry because of that ridonculous line. But you can't get away from the buzz...you hear about them online, from friends, and it's practically a celebrity hotspot. Well being the sceptic that I need to be to thrive, I figured it may be a lot of empty hype. I mean a hot dog's a hot dog, I thought. And I couldn't have been wronger. (yeah. it's a word now ;)Sure, I can't tell a lie...there were only 2-3 people ahead and yet we waited in line for probly 25 minutes. And yeah, for 2 simple styled hot dogs and an onion ring after all was said & done (including tax & a small tip), it was almost 20 dollars. And the cashier was very knowlegeable, but moved at the speed of a dmv employee..they all did.But I quickly found out that their food is the REAL DEAL HOLYFIELD. No empty hype. SO damn good. No, I think they put crack in there.After eating at Pink's LA twice on a trip a few months ago, I was ecstatic to eat at their Vegas location.  Hey who am I kidding, I was beyond ecstatic, excited more like it truth be told.LOCATION:  Pink's Las Vegas is one of the numerous eateries at the Miracle Mile Shops at the Planet Hollywood Hotel and Casino.  Please note that Pink's is NOT located within the Miracle Mile Shops.  The entrance and entire eatery can be accessed only externally from the shops themselves.  If you know where Earl of Sandwich is located, walk directly to the nearest doors that exit to Las Vegas blvd and there you will find hot dog mecca.I noticed that 2 things were exactly the same at this location:  The menu, of course, and the line!  The wait time was nowhere near that of the LA location, but I really didn't expect that many people to be waiting to be quite honest.FOOD:  My friend and I both decided to order a chili cheese dog each and shared a side of fries with nacho cheese.  PRICE:  Price$ are slightly higher than LA......this is Vega$ after all.SEATING:  All available seating, like the LA location, is first come first serve and is all outdoors.  Some tables have a covering provided while others do not.AWESOME: One of the best things about this location is that.....credit cards, namely Visa, MC, and AMEX are accepted!!  Bottom Line:  I'll absolutely be back on a future trip to Vegas!For the longest time, two places have sat at the top fo my Vegas To Try list - CraftSteak...and Pink's.  Yep, I know.  Quite possibly the only time those two will ever be #1 and #2 on the same list.  For anything.  Ever.Unlike Earl of Sandwich, which had its usual, ridiculous line going on, nary a person could be found at the at counter at Pink's.  Perfect for us since we just wanted a quick lunch before our flight...and because we probably took 10 minutes to figure out what to get from their giant menu board (it took me so long, I swear they all started to sound the same...).  Although it wasn't one of the sexier options, I ordered the POLISH PASTRAMI SWISS CHEESE DOG ($8.49), and tried some for the CHILI CHEESE FRIES ($6.79) that my friend had ordered for our group to share.  Topped with Pastrami, Swiss Cheese, and Mustard (forgot to add on the Sour Kraut), the polish wasn't bad but hardly exciting (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pinks-hot-dogs-las-vegas-2?select=ii0a_yyiuQlFKWpttNFiMA#2Cd3mM114U75Fre4_Z9ong).  While the Polish sausage itself was fine (who knew it went so well with Swiss cheese?), the shreds of pastrami were really dry and a bit salty.  The Chili Cheese Fries were guiltfully tasty though (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pinks-hot-dogs-las-vegas-2?select=ii0a_yyiuQlFKWpttNFiMA#ZCy7uTuIMph17rZSk5TtgA).  Not so much for the cheese sauce (because it's, you know, cheese sauce), but because their chili is surprisingly decent!  Plus...who doesn't love some good chili fries?All in all, I'd come back if I needed something relatively quick and simple, as well as to try some of the more unique and "exotic" combinations (stomach ache on a plane?  Ummm...no).  Pink's is probably one of the better bets around based on convenience alone, but at about $8 a pop, they do an even better job of making me appreciate Costco's $1.50 Polish and a drink that much more.Do get their Showgirl dog, which showcases all the ingredients you can load up on for a hot dog to scream supreme!This hot dog spot is conveniently located near Walgreens, semi-corner of Planet Hollywood - on the outside.  The staff brings the dogs out when ready.Their French fries were fried and textured delightfully. If you are craving for some hot dogs, this spot is the place to be!Wow, has it really been 5 years since my last review at Pink's??  Well, other than satisfy my craving for a hot dog, nothing's really changed from my last experience here except for the prices which have increased since then.Chicago Polish Dog -- http://bit.ly/1FsSnTOmustard, relish, lettuce & tomatoesThe hot dog was good but it was basically a salad on a hot dog.  Because it's on their Classic Dog side of the menu, the price wasn't too bad but still pricey though for what I got.  I guess I probably should've ordered the Planet Hollywood Dog (http://bit.ly/1JiKJjI) again because at least it has more of a 'wow' factor.For convenience on being right on the strip, I like Pink's.  But I think I'd rather get my gourmet hot dog fix off the strip at Buldogis or even at Gordon Ramsay BurGR.
Hot Dog Stop=OK, another up market hot dog joint...good enough hot dogs...rows of beautiful, state of the art condiment dispensers... lovely tables and décor...and I am just not getting it.I like hot dogs as much as the next red blooded, all American boy...maybe more...but I do not understand how these places can make it on dogs...in fact, I don't think they can.It seems that these new upscale kind of hot dog joints have a menu that stops just of short of being a Fox Restaurant Conniption...everything from yam fries to prime rib dip on the menu!But, I came in for a hot a dog and a hot dog is what I got...for $2.65 US Dollars.It was a particularly necessary and poignant retox for me...not only did I get in a nice run this morning, but I had to go to the Arizona MVD to finally complete the process of getting new tags for my car...a process that took over 4 months and more than 25 hours of my time on the phone and waiting at the MVD...which is another review about the adequacy (or lack thereof) of the data processing systems, processes and employees of the State of Arizona Motor Vehicle Division.I celebrated finally emerging from the gantlet, bloodied and scarred, but unbowed...with a hot dog!The hot dogs themselves are reasonably priced, pretty well prepared, served on little "loaves" that have been toasted and buttered (I think you know that in my world, butter=goodness).I looked around, and they don't seem to tout any particular type of sausages or wiener manufacturer (you know...like Schreiners or Schuylers or imported from Buffalo, NY, or specially made from baby seal scrotums or something)...but the wieners were certainly serviceable.The service was also "serviceable" but was more like a standard "hot dog stand"...not the most personable group behind the counter...and if you are trying to upsell to justify the rent and the build out of the space in a mall like this...you just might need a little personality...as well as the ability to do more than ask "ja want fry wit' dat?"Finally, as I ate my wiener (go ahead...snicker...I'll wait...done?...OK) I noticed another slightly "off" element to the HDS...the music playing sounded like Greek ballads (which may be the case, since I thought the accents behind the counter sounded Greek) and they were playing rather loudly...although the obligatory flat screen was tuned to ESPN and was also turned up...committing 1st degree cacophony.One set of sounds or the other...not both...and by the way, since when is the background music tuned to what the staff or owner wants to listen to, as opposed to what the customers want to hear?I'll tell you when...at good old divey, cruddy, greasy hot dog only hot dog joints, where the radio is playing what the cook wants and nobody had better mess with the settings.But that's not what HDS is trying for...they may need to rethink a couple of things if they want rise above the rest.2.5 stars for an average hot dog, mediocre service and the odd ambiance...and I just don't round up...esp. after a trip to the MVD...sadly.
Mandarin Oriental Tea Lounge=You don't usually think "high tea" when you think of Vegas. You think of showgirls, slot machines & douchbags (at least I do), but since experiencing Mandarin Oriental's Tea Lounge on the 23rd floor of the hotel, Vegas to me now means an afternoon of finger sandwiches & pots of tea. $40 per person buys you a comfy couch with a to-die-for view of The Strip, four finger sandwiches, your own pot of tea, two scones, five mini desserts & this strawberry-chocolate preserve that I could have drank like water. Portions are deceptively petite; you will leave stuffed (especially if you take advantage of their "want seconds? have it!" policy.)Service was phenomenal; so polite & refined & demure. Sidenotes:1) Comedian Louie Anderson was having high tea there. If it's good enough for him, surely it's good enough for you.2) I ordered a lychee green tea, which was light & refreshing but my companion's "Nutcracker" tea (black with hazelnut & vanilla flavors) was so bold, sweet & delicious--I highly recommend it if you like sweet instead of floral.3) Everything was delicious. It wasn't just about presentation here (unlike other high tea joints); the tiny bites were exceptionally tasty.I can drink tea anytime of the day and feel there aren't enough places that have quality tea let alone have a setting to sit and enjoy tea.I didn't notice til later that the pots are Teavana, but I thought in my head that a few sounds like some I have had from there. They probably are special blends for Mandarin since looking the names up popped up empty. The pu-erh is decent, but it's an earth based tea that isn't for everyone. The service was friendly and unobtrusive in passing by to pour tea.I try French macarons at every venue possible and excited to find that they are served here. Ggreen tea macaron ,I must! Though it was a well made macaron (a sad rarity of LV), I don't think it's worth going up there to get $2 smallish ones when the craving hits. If I'm here for tea, yes, but I rather take home palm sized Bouchon ones. Still, I'm happy to find one other place with decent macarons.  This isn't perfect a venue, but I get that this isn't a tea town. Stowing it into a lobbys excess space makes sense though it could use a little bit more partition. The decor felt upscale enough, but could use a bit more comfort in the padding. Tea is meant for relaxation, but it definitely was a bit library so don't come here to do private talk since you'll probably be heard. After a night of partying, a busy relay at the buffets or just tired feet needing a break somewhere, this is a good place to take in a view and sip peace of mind.This is a review of the afternoon tea service - this time with only 2 people instead of 6 the last time.The Skinny: Although a beautiful view, the uncomfortable seating, misses with the food and tea made this place a (3) Service: a little on the slow side, the service was only so-so (3), Value: now only 1 refill of the petit fours, scones and sammys... boo! (3)After a lazy Sunday morning, I decided to treat the hubby to a relaxing afternoon tea at 3 pm. When you're making reservations for 2 people, it's relatively a breeze with Opentable.com compared to my large group experience.There are very few places that serve afternoon tea on the Strip. The Mandarin Oriental gets bonus points because it may be the only one on the Strip that offers spectacular views, operates every day of the week AND won't leave you smelling like you've been cavorting around the casino all day (ie, not smokey!).For our little tete-a-tete, we both ordered the classic afternoon tea set ($40 per person, choice of loose leaf tea, 1 refill each of scones, sandwiches, and petit fours). After being spoiled by the Pennisula in Chicago, their tea service is okay in my books. Pet peeve - I didn't like the fact that their loose leaf tea was served without tea leaves in the teapot. And while my jasmine white pearl tea was quite nice, the matcha tea was overly mild and lacked flavour.There were some issues with the food. The sandwiches had quite nice fillings especially the curried chicken sandwiches (admittedly the ham sammys were a little on the unoriginal side). Unfortunately, the bread was a little too dry which detracted from the overall experience. Scones, served appropriately warm, were a little too mushy on the inside while the devonshire cream lacked that buttery, custardy aroma. The homemade preserves of blueberry and mixed berry were ho-hum and didn't offer something exciting (the fig jam at the previous event was much more intriguing and delicious!).Finally, the petit fours tray. The only dessert I wouldn't have minded a second taste was the almond/marzipan macaroon. Slightly chewy, the almond paste really knocked that cookie out of the park for me. The opera cake chocolate ganache tart and matcha financier were texturally a little dry. The chocolate/caramel tart was overly sweet.The service, considering how much you are paying for an afternoon tea here, was okay but not spectacular. Our server took a long time to bring out our tea and didn't refill our glasses of water. She also forgot to bring out refills of our condiments.Overall, despite it's shortcomings, it was a pleasant afternoon experience and deserves a 3-starred review.During my recent trip to Vegas over the Christmas holiday, my best friend and I decided to visit the Mandarin Oriental Tea Lounge for a relaxing late afternoon away from the fanny packs and liquor slushies. I'll start with the good...The hotel itself is very chic as is the Tea Lounge. Beautiful Asian decor with a view of the strip you could find on a postcard in a hotel gift shop. A clean and upscale environment but without a pretentious air that frequent accompanies "high tea".  The hostesses were elegantly dressed and had us seated almost instantly.In terms of food, I was impressed with the spread. The scones were delicious especially when accompanied by strawberry rhubarb compote and clotted cream. The selection of tea was lovely. My favorite being the matcha. Now, the bad...The sandwich selection they offer includes a curried chicken salad, which contains nuts. However, nowhere on the menu did it specify the use of nuts in any of the offerings. The waitress also gave an extremely detailed run down of the types of sandwiches, scone toppings, and desserts yet failed to mention nuts being in any of the food aside from a pistachio cake. For the record, I am deathly allergic to peanuts and cashews to the point that I carry around multiple Epi pens in my purse everywhere I go. When I bit into the sandwich, I started to feel sick and I took a closer look, only to see a small piece of nut that I couldn't identify off the bat. When I flagged down a waitress to ask about what kind of nuts were in the items, she panicked and left to ask the chef. When she returned, she kept firmly insisting that I was fine because it was "just walnuts" but ANYONE who knows ANYTHING about nuts knows that almost all tree nuts are processed in the same facilities. When I tried to ask about nuts being in any of the other desserts, she acted annoyed to be bothered by me again. I was appalled by how it was handled and I felt ill for the remainder of the day because of that ONE bite of sandwich. I was almost offended to see that they automatically included 18% gratuity to the bill because I would have left $0 if given the opportunity.I admit it was irresponsible on my part not to ask but the waitress had given such a precise account of ingredients used in other items (ie: eggnog truffles, bubblegum flavored French macarons, black forest ham sandwiches etc.) that I thought I was in the clear. I suppose it was my error to expect such a highly regarded establishment would care about their customer's dietary restrictions. I REALLY REALLY REALLY don't enjoy writing bad reviews (as you can tell from my profile) but it's necessary in this case to warn other people with severe nut allergies! I'm lucky that all I left with was a bad stomach ache. I really hope in the future the Mandarin Tea Lounge is more consequent of their patrons' needs.With the exception of a check-in snafu caused by the very "green" & inexperieced hostess, I'd have to say I had a pretty good experience at the tea lounge at the Mandarin Oriental.  I just have one point of advice, check your reservation with the hostess at least three times. By then, it may sink in for her.Ok, let's carry on shall we?Located adjacent to registration above the 23rd floor, you'd think the Tea Lounge was part of the lobby. But make no mistake, these premium seats come at a lofty price tag and a reservation to boot.  Luckily, we were seated by the panoramic window as I requested and service, albeit a bit slow, was paced nicely and lent to the whole relaxing afternoon tea experience.  With that in mind, the tea selection was fairly limited but adequate for my needs. There were a host of green teas and herbal teas to accommodate most individual preferences and tastes IMO. Since I just arrived from a massage session, I went with the introspective herbal relaxation tea. The tea service runs from 2-5 pm daily and reservations are highly recommended as there are only a few tables in the lounge.  The views can be quite spectacular if you're seated by the window. We had a perfect view of the strip and City Center and the natural lighting was equally relaxing and calming.  The food selections included a selection of finger sandwiches inspired by English afternoon "high tea" traditions, but where was the cucumber cream cheese?In any case, the selections included a savory smoked salmon cucumber and watercress spread sandwich (my favorite of the bunch) egg salad & chives on brioche, curried chicken salad, and black forest ham. The tea service also included the best scones I've ever had in my life! These were buttery, light, flaky and irresistibly good. They came out nice and warm, served with some fresh berry jam, marmalade and an imported Devonshire clotted cream (extremely smooth and very addictive.) So addictive, in fact,  I found myself wanting to spread it on practically everything!  Lastly, our afternoon tea service was completed with a selection of small bite sized desserts and pastries, which included macarons, tarts and chocolates.By the end of the meal, I felt nicely sated and totally relaxed. I would definitely return on my next trip to Vegas but im going to have to put that hostess on check!Happy Eats!WHO: Bring your boyfriends, girlfriends, nieces, and mamas for an amazing Tea Time!WHERE: Located at the top of the Mandarin Oriental in the City Center. WHEN: They are open from 10am-10pm, but Tea Service is from 2-5pm daily.WHAT: In all of my 24 years of being alive, I have never gotten the pleasure of having a TEA PARTY. So apparently my friend loves having tea parties, and decided to make reservations for my first tea party EVER! As we walked towards the Mandarin Oriental, went inside and sat in the elevator rising up towards the Tea Lounge, my heart skipped 10 beats due to excitement. I was definitely an excited girl that day!We were seated by the window overlooking the strip (that day they had part of the strip closed off for a while because the Nascar were doing a pre-show... Randomly we got to see the Nascar drift and all that jazz! Lol). Mary Anne was our server, and she actually recognized my friend since he comes here so much, Lol. He is definitely popular! Hahaha! She was such a sweetheart and explained the new temporary additions to the menu for winter. We ended up getting the Classic English Afternoon Tea set up, which came with several wonderful snacks and the choice of any tea in the menu.I chose the Lychee Organic Green Tea, and my friend chose the Peach Tea, which were both very calm and soothing! Mary Anne brought us honey and milk for our tea, along with our small little treats!About the treats, they were all really amazing, but I never knew how much the scones at starbucks and any other coffee shop were INCOMPARABLE to their scones here! They were fresh out of the over, and tasted absolutely WONDERFUL with the jellies they brought out!! I NEED MORE SCONES!!TREATS:Smoked salmon & cucumber with watercress spread- YES!Creamy deviled egg in a shell with Paleta Iberico & lavashTartlet of mango with foie gras mousse & spice bread crisp- YES!Black forest ham sandwich- YES!Signature scones with imported Devonshire clotted cream and Chef Philippe's house made marmalades and jams- YES!Random assortment of Tea pastries- YES!The rest of the goodies were on point! I ordered an extra Passion Fruit Macaron... BEST I'VE EVER HAD! They change some of the treats every 2 weeks to a month, so I will definitely come back next month! YES!!RANDOM NOTE: Make reservations just incase! =)I wish and hope you all have the experience of your first Tea Party! PINKY'S UP!The fanciest Afternoon Tea i've had so far!Awesome view-= can see the strip from the 23rd floor of the Mandarin Oriental hotel near the Aria and Vdara Hotels. We came to our reservation a bit early and luckily being the first ones there, we got the best seat in the house, on a couch right in front of the windows! The lounge is not very big and it's right next to the check in desk lobby, so it's not a ideal place to come with a big group. Three of us got the Classic English Afternoon tea set at $36.00. Tea service is daily 2-5pm. You get a choice of tea, 4 tea sandwiches (smoked salmon, egg salad, curried chicken salad sandwich, and black forest ham), 2 small scones served with a very thick cream cheese like Devonshire Cream, pineapple marmalade and strawberry jam, and a selection of petit desserts. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mandarin-oriental-tea-lounge-las-vegas?select=7s7p5TgVV9CTlWjWQMcgtQ#7s7p5TgVV9CTlWjWQMcgtQPresentation was superb. Although everything was petit, i thought it was very filling. The sandwiches were yummy. (They are flexible with the sandwiches if you have food restrictions). I didn't love the salmon one, as it had a strong herby flavor. The teas were my least favorite. From the last 4-5 afternoon tea experiences, I have loved my tropical black tea choices. When i saw mandarin orange black tea, i was excited. However, when i drank it, it has a strong chinese herbal flavor to it, which i wasn't expecting and kind of clashed with the sweet desserts and sandwiches in my taste... We tried the monkey picked oolong and white tea, and none of them really had us craving to have more. Despite not loving the tea flavors, the experience was great and we enjoyed the view. The lounge itself is pretty gorgeous with all the colors. Check it: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mandarin-oriental-tea-lounge-las-vegas?select=65joKJBgDCMDFsAg-wahcA#65joKJBgDCMDFsAg-wahcADisappointed. Ordered the preset package. The tea is served in a clear pot. Was cheap looking and not even half full.  It wasn't hot enough either.   The rum cake was absolutely awful in smell taste and texture.  Only 3 items were decent, the scone, deviled egg and the hazelnut tart.  I like the pineapple jam and clotted cream. It was a good thing we only ordered one set for the both of us.  We would have ordered another pot of tea but we were so turned of by the food items.  I've had better afternoon tea elsewhere for cheaper even.I've always been a sucker for finger sandwiches. Perfectly cut and how aesthetically appealing to the eye, it really pleases my OCD :) I have been to High Tea at Petrossian as well as Four Seasons, and had been looking forward to trying MO version, since only passing by the area, the view alone was worth a trip back. Served daily from 1p-5p, we had made a reservation not knowing how busy they get, upon arriving, there were a few open tables, but ours was right up against the window and offered amazing views from the 23rd floor. Looking over the tea menu, I chose the Organic Lychee Green and my friend chose the Mandarin Orange Blend. Neither one of these teas were anything special, I've had better tea at Starbucks, and I think Paymon's Mediterranean Cafe has a WAY better tea selection. The tower of food followed, and after a brief explanation from our waitress, we dove in. Starting with the creamy deviled egg (in a shell) with Paleta Iberico & lavash. This was the best deviled egg I've ever had, and I love how it as served in the shell. Up next was the smoked salmon & cucumber with watercress spread. This was my second favorite. Black Forest ham sandwich and the goat cheese tartlet with apricot jelly rounded out our savory portion, but the last two didn't impress me. The dessert plate was made of a selection of the assorted pastries, and the only one I really liked was the Yuzu shortbread. The others were way too sweet, a lemon chocolate cake pop, a rum cake cannelle  a blueberry creme puff.The scones were probably one of the best I've had, but I love clotted cream, so smother any kind of biscuit with clotted cream and jam and you can't go wrong. For $90 for two people (they do auto-grat), I just can't recommend this. It was okay, but nothing spectacular.Compared to Clipper Lounge in MO Hong Kong and Mo Bar in Landmark MO Hong Kong, Tea Lounge in MO Las Vegas had room in improvement. Why did I give Tea Lounge three stars? 1) The view was spectacular - My friend and I were able to see Aria and Cosmopolitan from the lounge.2) The service was good for Vegas standard  - Since I am allergic to melons, I requested to only have berries in my fruit platter. The waiter quickly fulfilled my request.3) The food was decent - Both my apple juice and my fruit platter were fresh.What could Tea Lounge do to get my other two stars?1) Easy access to reservation - Since I was not able to make a reservation via Opentable, I called MO and was transferred four times before I was able to make my reservation. 2) Increase the quality of the service - The waiter forgot my request for hot water. I had to remind her for it. It also took her a long time to stop by our table for the check. 3) Improve the quality of the food - My matcha latte with soy milk barely had any green tea flavor. At the same time, my friend's Danish was relatively bland. The pastries do not seem to be on par with those in MO HK and Landmark MO HK. Despite of these minor flaws, Mandarin Oriental Tea Lounge is my favorite place for high tea in Vegas due to its tranquil atmosphere. I hope that the quality of the food and the service would meet the five star standard during my next visit.Quick Takeaway:Enjoy an upscale tea party with pastries and finger sandwiches. You'll get to sip your tea and munch on  treats on the 23rd floor of the Mandarin. Relax, unwind and soak in sweeping views of the fabulous Las Vegas strip. Reservations?Yes. Go ahead and make reservations and request a window seat for your party. I didn't and wish I would've asked for this when I placed my reservations. Worth it? Yes. Come here to chill out, sip some tea and enjoy treats while overlooking the strip with their floor to ceiling windows. My guests and I arrived a bit early and were able to be seated immediately. Their tea selection is ample and we all truly enjoyed ourselves. I would recommend this for those seeking solitude from the Vegas chaos. It would also be nice for a group of friends looking for a unique and relaxing environment to catch up. Where:Make your way to the elevator and head up to the 23rd floor of the Mandarin Oriental Hotel. Service: This was the only misstep of our visit. I would expect more for the venue. Overall, it was a bit slow and we had to flag down our waitress for various items on multiple occasions. She was friendly and pleasant during our interactions. They automatically bill gratuity and I felt they didn't have enough servers for the room. I would rate service 3 out of 5 stars. Overall:This was my first time experiencing an afternoon tea and it was treat to enjoy it here. The lounge itself was smaller than I anticipated but we still enjoyed ourselves. My 2 guests and I enjoyed the "Classic English Afternoon Tea" for $38 per person (note- gratuity that will be automatically added on). The view and atmosphere alone will justify your visit. This "Classic English Afternoon Tea" option included our choice of tea with finger food sandwiches, pastries and scones.  We arrived on empty stomachs and were able to order extra plates of their 'sandwiches' to satisfy our appetites.Made a quick stop at this tea lounge before our brunch at MOzen upstairs, we didn't have a reservation but the friendly host gentleman still seated us, just not the window view seatings. We weren't staying long so it was OK. Very nice tea menu, many flavors to choose from, some cocktails too, tea martini or teatini looked good to me. Ordered lychee green tea and teatini. Huge pot of green tea, I love green tea with honey not sugar, it was a little bitter and very strong. Teatini was very sweet cause it was made with agave, the flavors of the cocktail and green tea were perfectly balanced. Loved it! Our waitress was very attentive and friendly, as all the staffs at Mandarin Oriental, they just provide the best services on earth! After my teatini, we got really hungry and headed out to our brunch. It was a short but pleassant tea time, I liked it a lot. Not sure I will ever do high tea cause I rarely eat carbs, maybe just some green tea or teatini again sometime!Remember when you were a little girl and you'd pretend to have tea parties with your friends, dolls, and stuffed animals?  Well I never did that, but if you did, your adult selves can do a real tea party here!  My expectation at first was a sit down lounge or restaurant, but the area feels like a lobby overlooking the strip.  Not that it's bad.  This area sits between the concierge and the bar on the 23rd floor of the Mandarin Hotel.  Very nice view of the strip. We ordered the Classic English Afternoon Tea, which consists of small decadent and intricate bites and desserts for $38.  I couldn't even tell you what they all were because they were so exquisite.  All were delicious...all of them!  If you're not that hungry, this is shareable between two (2) people, but I'd recommend ordering your own.  They were very good.  Included with the Classic English Afternoon Tea is a pot of loose leaf tea.  I believe we got the orange one.  I'd come back for the views and for friends and family who are feeling adventurous and want to do something different on the strip.  Great experience!After dropping your car off with valet, hop on the elevator to get here. Be wowed by the great view of the Strip. Fine tea set on your table.On the menu: Classic English Afternoon Tea, Children's Afternoon Tea (for kids 12 and under), champagne selections, and tea selections.Classic English Afternoon Tea:Smoked salmon and cucumber with watercress spread.Curry chicken, sesame cone and lemon grass Asian pear.Goat cheese tartlet with apricot jelly, dried fruits and spice bread crisp.Black Forest ham sandwich.Scones with clotted cream, mango and raspberry jams.Assorted pastries.Everything was dainty and delicious. The most memorable ones for me were the Smoked salmon, goat cheese tartlet, scones especially with the clotted cream and mango marmalade, and the chocolate hazelnut pastry. For my tea, I chose Jasmine Green Oolong. It was floral and lightly fragrant.If you want Gong Fu Cha service, you have to give them a 24-hour notice and you have to have a minimum of 3 people.This was a nice way to enjoy an afternoon at leisure.What a great experience! Came in here on Sunday afternoon and enjoyed the Afternoon Tea special. For $45.00 you receive 3 plates of assorted scones, finger sandwiches and desserts plus a large pot of tea of your choice. We chose the Winter Blend, it tasted like chocolate mint. We added a touch of honey and it was simply perfection. As you can see from the numerous photos they gave breath taking views and decor I'd die for. We were lucky enough to be seated relatively close to the window on a very comfortable couch. The scones were by far our favorite item food wise, specifically the lemon cranberry. I have a severe nut allergy and they were extremely accomidating. Our service was impeccable as well. We will be coming in far more often, the only thing I'm upset about is not coming in sooner!
Shula's Steak House=Shula's tries to combine upscale steakhouse with football to disastrous (though frequently hilarious) results.They take you on a "tour" before seating you, showing you a replica Lombardi trophy and telling you all about the '72 Dolphins undefeated season. I found it especially hysterical the hostess took extra care to point out this trophy is a replica. You mean the real Lombardi trophy isn't kept at a steakhouse inside a shitty Indian casino in Chandler, AZ???? Shocking. Equally entertaining was how the hostess kept droning on about the '72 Dolphins long after we made it clear we didn't care. Um lady? It's just me and 2 female coworkers. We're all hungry and none of us give a shit about the '72 Dolphins. Apparently we were also supposed to be impressed by the black-and-white pictures of the '72 Dolphins on the walls. Oooh, black-and-white pictures, how artsy. Someone took a couple photography classes at community college.After concluding that fascinating "tour" we were finally taken to our table. We were all exchanging "that was weird" looks when the waitress handed us our drink menus and explained the steak menu was painted on the football she was carrying. I know what you're thinking, and the answer is yes, it was a regulation sized football and yes, it was hand painted. She made sure to mention this last fact twice. I mean, what kind of upscale steakhouse would it be if its steak menu was painted on a football by a... MACHINE??? Pish posh.Anyway, that's when things went from amusing to "I will never set foot in this restaurant again." The hostess puts the football on a tee and sets it down RIGHT ON MY COWORKER'S PLATE. Gross. I wish I had taken a picture cuz the look on her face was PRICELESS. The waitress seemed shocked and somewhat offended she asked for another plate. The nerve!!!And this, my friends, was the straw that broke the proverbial '72 Dolphins back. I can handle being bored to death by an over-enthusiastic hostess. I can handle my menus hand painted on footballs. But if you have the nerve to charge $50-60 for a steak as this supposedly "upscale" steakhouse does, I will not tolerate a dirty football on my plate nor being treated like asking for a clean plate is an outrageous request.We left without even drinking our waters
Beso Steakhouse=Beso Off  is the best way to put it. A restaurant that needs to be shuttered - and in a city where there are many other choices, most likely will not continue to survive as the place does not seem to really care about the issues with the restaurant.And cheap food  - as in quality, not price. Or, the head chef is just way too enamored with salt, which is usually used to hide the cheap flavoring of sub-par steaks, especially the way that they slather it on everything.So, this is a cluster beyond clusters. We came here for a business dinner because the Los Angeles location has good reviews. Big mistake.The wait, etc was not bad. We made a reservations, they sat us when we had more than 50 percent of our party there. The wait staff - Craig and Angie - were super nice, very charming and had more common sense than the assistant manager on duty, Chad Jahn. Yep, totally using the full name.So, let's start with the cluster:A) Fire in the kitchen (grease fire) that made the whole place smoky. The grill is right there, so you can "see" them cooking steaks. Big whoop, sorta cool, but OBVIOUSLY too small for a restaurant of the size. And, apparently, the back kitchen is just as bad.B) Our salads/soups come out fine - nothing spectacular, but not terrible - and then we wait for the steaks. And wait. And wait. Oh, by the way, it's only 8.30 when we sit down but they're already out of the bone-in filet which the waiter talked up. How do you run out of a steak by 8.30 PM? Kitchen incompetence??C) We're still waiting for our steaks. It's a good 45 minutes post-finishing our salads and appetizers. We're still waiting. And still waiting.D) Angie and Craig are proactive, and good wait staff; they come up to us and apologize about the wait. It's not their fault - the kitchen is run by incompetents, but they do their job and do it well. E) The steaks come out ... medium rare. Not the medium that was ordered but the medium rare. We send them back, and one comes back ... charred on the outside, but still rare/medium rare. He's too nice to send it back, and the issue is that the kitchen is backed up so just sending out steaks. Good way to settle a problem with an incompetent kitchen staff: send out undercooked meat and hope they don't send it back to cause more setback in the kitchen. Idiots.F) I ask for the manager - the man with no freakin' sense to come to our table. This would be Chad Jahn, who looks like a former bouncer that has been elevated to restaurant manger. Demote him back to bouncer, that's what he seems he'd be good at. We talk to him, tell him the issues ... and he never checks up on us again. Good management skills, asshat!! Oh, and he doesn't acknowledge our issues when we leave. He did take care of the bill, but I think he had to be told to do that (I told him we're getting free desserts). G) I got churros. I like churros. The churros at Costco are better than Beso. Um, useless kitchen staff, churros are served hot. H) So, while walking outside with the colleague for her to smoke, we pass by former colleagues and they ask how it went. We told them it sucked, to leave. There was this long-haired guy listening to us. I'd noticed him for a bit walking around, so I said "are you one of the owners" and he said, no, he's just waiting for a friend. Um, found out he is one of the owners. If, as an owner, you cannot take responsibility for your poor service and food, the restaurant as a whole are doomed. Nice sidestepping and not taking ownership, long-haired 80's rocker looking dude!! His (or Chad's) solution to the fire and the wait was to offer free Sangria. Thanks, and those that don't drink thank you also. Idiots.I) Like I noted, the food was salty. The steaks had a salt layer that should not be necessary if they are really Harris Ranch. The string beans, mushrooms and other vegetables were slathered with salt as well. Salt is a lazy additive for poor quality and tasting food. Draw your own conclusions here. We got out of there 3 1/2 hours later, when it should have been 1 1/2 hour dinner. It's not because we were socializing, but because it was just waiting and waiting and waiting and then sending back food and waiting. The place is a train wreck rapped up in hipster clothing (well, like most things hipster) and the management (and owner) seem unable to manage or take ownership of the problems and issues. Good riddance for when it shuts down (the chef should not be a head chef), but our wait staff rocked and should be at a better place.Eva Longoria Parker should be ashamed her name is associated with this place. But, it might not be that long before others force it out. I heard Mastro's is opening in Vegas...Update: Yay!  A fake review posted by an employee or PR person for the restaurant!! Thanks Megan!We were staying at Aria and we decided to have dinner at Beso.  I love Eva Longoria's restaurant in Cali and so I had high expectations for Beso.  The booths are nice and comfy but the service leaves a lot to be desired.  My filet steak was just average and the prices are very high,  cocktails started at $14 and up.  We had an app of guac and chips and that was below average.  As I mentioned I love Eva's restaurant in Cal but I was disappointed in Beso at City Center.I went to Beso for my friend's bachelorette party with a group of ladies and we were told that dinner was complimentary and all we had to do is to leave tips for the server, which was $10/person.  I thought it was really nice of them to comp our dinner, especially with 9 ladies all together.It all began with champagne.  When the first server (very nice) started to serve champagne to us, she had run out of it after 3 glasses.  She then opened another bottle and continued pouring.  Another female server rushed over and asked: why did you open another bottle for them and then whispered something to the first server.5 minutes later, another server came to us and told us that our dinner included appetizer, tossed salad, steak, and a bed of mashed potatoes, which sounded amazing, right? Not even close.We got  2 tiny servings of guacamole with a very light portion of tortilla chips, and I think the chef forgot to season it with, you know, salt, onion, and whatever recipe it calls for.  0 star.The steak was a joke.  It had no flavor, overcooked, and lukewarm.  There were literally 8 pre-cut pieces of steak for 9 people, with a bed of mashed potatoes.  The mashed potatoes was the best part of the meal, but then again, all of us shared a one person meal.  I would have been fine to pay the $10 tips if the service was good, but we had to call 4 different servers to get some iced water, after we had already waited 10 minutes.  So we paid $90 for this crappy meal.  Was it worth it?  I'd rather give a homeless guy my $10 then spending it at Beso.This place has gone off the deep end.  It used to be my favorite steakhouse in all of LV, but it has gone so far downhill i'll never eat here again.It was our servers first day, and I'm more than willing to cut a new server some slack, but what happened was ridiculous.For entree I ordered the filet which was cooked well but tastes nowhere near what their steaks tasted like 2 years ago when I frequently ate there.  I asked the waiter to add a lobster TAIL to the steak.When the food came out, the waiter brought our steaks, and a WHOLE lobster.  I asked another server to get ours because we ordered a tail and not the whole lobster.About 5 minutes later our server came over and tried to tell me that what was on the table WAS a lobster tail. Funny - i've never seen a lobster tail with claws, legs, and a body before.My friend and I were already into our steaks when he took the whole lobster away and said he would look into it.15 mins later he comes back - still no lobster tail, and I was almost done with my steak and we were in a rush so I told him to just forget the tail if it was gonna take longer.Then he disappears for another 15 mins.  I asked another server to please grab him and he came out and I asked for the check.Another 10 minutes goes by and so we walked in to see if the check was ready and what was taking so long. (we ate outside)The manager was adjusting the bill - and this is what REALLY pissed me off.The manager says "since you ordered the whole lobster and then cancelled it and then ordered the tail and then cancelled it Im charging you for the tail.I said - "No - I ordered just a tail to begin with"  He says "No you didn't my server told me you ordered the whole lobster.  I trust my server"And wanted to stand there and argue with me about it telling me I was lying about ordering just the lobster tail.I told him I was almost done with my meal and the tail still wasn't there which was why I cancelled it.He didn't want to hear any of it, and got a really smug attitude with me.At no other nice restaurant on the Vegas  strip will you see this sort of treatment of a customer.  He stood there blatantly calling me a liar right to my face, when both my friend and I tried to tell him the server was the one who fucked up.  Not me.This place went from penthouse to outhouse.  From the management, to the wait staff, to the food. I'll never eat here again.
Maria's Mexican Restaurant=Cheap, yes. But nasty. Dull flavors, beyond cheap ingredients. There's veg fare to be gotten here, but so much better on almost every other corner in this part of town.Kind of amazing to me that even tho they're smack dab in the middle of Burrito Way that they continue to do business - hit Maria's around lunchtime and you'll find the explanation: mostly gringos, slurping up the watered down salsa, ordering the 5 dollar lunch special and leaving 1 dollar tips. No, gracias.
Ling and Louie's Asian Bar and Grill=Walking by the restaurant, we peeked at the menu and the unique items on there caught our interest, so we popped in for a bite.  There's a lot of interesting combinations of Asian, Mexican, American, Italian style food on the menu.  After a few minutes, we decided to order:Edamame, $4.99http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tAEKCC7h9h9A79SfYx0Prg?select=dQv6EXMRrGXzekKHPrWCBQ#dQv6EXMRrGXzekKHPrWCBQPotstickers, $7.99http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tAEKCC7h9h9A79SfYx0Prg?select=IujYeFio8lXyFxtXlS7aZQ#IujYeFio8lXyFxtXlS7aZQFirecracker Chicken with Broccoli, $11.99 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tAEKCC7h9h9A79SfYx0Prg?select=TNdXgXqP1vHHewqCcS5CDQ#TNdXgXqP1vHHewqCcS5CDQMeatloaf Sliders, $11.99http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tAEKCC7h9h9A79SfYx0Prg?select=Nnk3lac4Z-WL2PadKfHXlQ#Nnk3lac4Z-WL2PadKfHXlQGarlic Parmesan Fries (Came with the Sliders)http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tAEKCC7h9h9A79SfYx0Prg?select=5L5xBaNpKxIVuF7iv3g4rw#5L5xBaNpKxIVuF7iv3g4rwThe food came out pretty fast.  The Edamame was very good, The Potstickers were delish.  The Meatloaf Sliders was the one that I was most interested in, but it came up short.  The Meatloaf was a little bland, lacked a full flavor that I was expecting.  The Garlic Parmesan Fries were very good and full of flavor.  The best item though was the Firecracker Chicken w/Broccoli....nice Spicy flavor and the Sauce that the Chicken was cooked in complimented the dish well.Overall, it was a decent experience.  There are many more items on the menu I'd like to try.Return Factor - 87%
Kusina Ni Lorraine="Pinay ako!" That's the Filipino/Tagalog phrase for "I'm a Filipina." When I saw this place had Hello Kitty stickers with "Pinay ako" on their wall, I had a feeling this was a good place. (Hehe, I tend to like places with Hello Kitty...who would have thought ;). Anyways my first instinct was right because Kusina ni Loraine is great! They have a buffet filled with lots of Filipino food! If you've never ever had Filipino food ever, this would be the place to try it out! They have traditional favorites like Filipino pork bbq, beef steak, kare kare (Filipino peanut butter stew), sisig (sour fried pork) and pancit (noodles). . They also have items you don't see often at a Filipino buffet like fried chicken skin, chicken curry, picadillo (ground beef with potatoes) and molo soup (dumpling soup with noodles).  It's a great selection of savory eats and tasty treats! I really liked that I got a little taste of all of my favorite Filipino food here! There's nothing like eating a fulfilling meal of white rice topped with kare kare sauce and pairing it with pork bbq sticks! Yum!Aside from the savory offerings, Kusina ni Lorraine also has some desserts. They have a fruit bar with grapes, cantaloupes and honey dew. The day I went they also offered a yummy Filipino dessert via ginataang totong (coconut dessert with mung beans). The ginataang totong was sweet and very good. It is like eating rice pudding.The buffet here is $7.99. You can pay another $1.50 for the soda.They also offer other treats here for an extra price like turon (banana eggroll), 3 for $2 and Filipino ice cream popsicles and ice cream drumsticks, $1.50-$1.99 each. They also sell a variety of different chichirya or Filipino snacks via chips, crackers and other goodies! (Oh and  they sell non food items like the  cool Filipino stickers with the Hello Kitty I mentioned earlier ;) and Filipino clothing)Kusina ni Lorraine is a great place to try different Filipino food! Whether you are looking to eat a traditional meal or a light snack, you can find it here! I have found my new place for Filipino food in Vegas! Pinay ako and I love good Filipino food!
Fry Bread House East=This is a fun family owned restaurant to go check out and the food is pretty tasty as well. Reminds me of going to the swap meet or one of those local food markets and getting some fry bread for a treat.Always used to get the standard fry bread with powdered sugar and just recently realized they make them with all sorts of goodies sprinkled on top or stuffed inside. Not sure how healthy these puppies are but who cares when you are craving one or two and just can't resist.Ordered the Chili Beef Combo Taco on my first visit and was not disappointed. Came back later in the week and tried both the Red & Green Chili Stew. Used a side of Fry Bread to sop it up all the gravy. The flavors are very nice and there is some spicy heat to make your mouth wanting more.Next my wife goes out of town and I was feeling lazy. No kidding. Stopped in and picked up two containers of both Red Chili and Green Chile Taco meat - To Go. Just warmed up some tortillas and applied some meat and ate like a champ for the next couple nights.Service is counter style and there is plenty of room inside for larger groups. Looking forward to trying out some of their fancy sweet choices on my next visit. As Arnold says in his movies ... I'LL BE BACK!4.25 STARSFor me it's the simple things.  The simple things done very well.  And employees who actually, genuinely seem happy to see customers.  Imagine that.  (Take note Sprouts employees...you grouchy fockers).  I was the only person in the joint today around 11:30 and got myself a ground beef taco, a Coke, and a cinnamon and sugar fry bread for dessert.  I LOVED that the young man working the register asked me if I'd like to get the cinn & sug fry bread a little later.  Why yes I would!  For 2 reasons.  If you give it to me with my taco, I will eat all of it first and the taco will get cold.  Second, I made myself eat about a third of the taco, enjoying every bite, and saving room for my dessert, which was warm and cinnamoney and sugary and delicious!  Delicious is the word of the day for this place.  I enjoyed every aspect of my meal, and I was glad to see the place start to fill up as I was leaving.  I will try to be more adventurous next time and get something with stronger flavors, but I LOVE simple beef tacos.  For me they are comfort food, and this was a great one.  Go check them out if you haven't!
Fuddruckers=Love this location.....there is a small group of friends who meet for lunch at this location a few times a year.  We enjoy it because it's close the Strip, where most of the group works.  We also like how it's less busy than the Summerlin Location....at least during lunch hour mid-week.During my most recent visit, I had a 1/3 Burger with Cheese and Fries & Drink ($9.99).  It takes a few minutes for your Burger to be prepared, but it's worth the wait and not nearly as long as Fatburger.  The Burger was made to my specifications (medium).  I loaded it with Jalapenos, Onions, and melted Jalapeno Cheese....yum!The employees are always friendly and greet everyone as they walk up to place an order.  Overall, a solid place to grab a quick bite to eat.Return Factor - 95%
Modern Burger=Hit up Modern Burger with Jason W. and Deb S. yesterday. I totally think this needs a separate designation from Modern Steak as it's quite different and for what it is, it's good...It's basically a window in the side of Sam Fox's new place, Modern Steak. I think they do a couple of salads but I really didn't pay too much attention. We were there for the sliders. They are....uh, basically....awesome! Two sliders of fresh ground beef, a house made bun (crazy foccacia looking one), American cheese, grilled onions, 1000 island & iceberg lettuce.  I'm hot & cold on Fox spots but I'm in love with Modern Burger's sliders. The beef was awesome. Super moist, juicy & flavorful. Cooked in butter??? The rest of the compliments were great. I was particularly impressed with the bun. First of all for some crazy reason, I'm strongly anti-foccacia. This bun looks like foccacia bread (cut square & about the same thickness) but it definitely wasn't. Soft & tasty, it was great sopping up the burger juices & dressing.I also had the yukon gold fries which were good. While they don't jump to the top of my fry list, they're definitely respectable. MB has a few soft drink choices, a bunch of bottled water (sparkling & still) & I saw a bunch of bottles of wine so I'm guessing wines by the glass. (I was pretty much there for the sliders.)  The guys at the window were also quite cool & happy to do soda refills.There were also some interesting looking ice cream sandwiches on the board.While I thought everything was good, the major highlight for me was the sliders. I'd say they're even destination worthy. In addition to stopping over while in the mall, I will even fight the mall parking & crowds for more of those sliders.It's in Fashion Square but is separate from the Modern Steak. Couldn't add the spot with the same address. Kept kicking it out.Scottsdale Fashion Square7014 E. Camelback Rd.Scottsdale AZ 85251P: 480.423.7000My first visit to Modern Burger was yesterday, after treating Mom and myself to happy hour at Marcella's next door.  Before we had apps at Marcella's, we checked out MB's menu, and after spying their list of ice cream sandwiches, I knew what I wanted for dessert!Out of the three ice cream sandwich options (Oatmeal & raisin/Granny Smith ice cream, Peanut butter/Chocolate ice cream, and Chocolate chip/Tahitian vanilla bean), I chose Granny Smith.  I was able to have the MB rep procure a fresher one "from the bin" in the restaurant (for all I know, he just paused for a moment and turned around!).  Whatever.  All I know is that the 2nd ice cream sandwich didn't look as old and compacted as the one he initially offered to me.  The sandwich was so tasty!  Not too sweet, and it was certainly refreshing on a warm, Phoenix spring day!  I liked it so much, I stopped by tonight, two minutes past 6p (MB's closing time), to get another.  (Truthfully, I'd wanted to try their sliders, as well, but it was too late to order those, but ice cream sandwiches she could sell me, the rep said.)  And so I bought.Modern Burger is weird. It's attached to an expensive steakhouse located in a ritzy mall, yet it's seems like it's trying to emulate an in-n-out burger type of experience albiet with slightly higher prices. It's basically a little window you order from, and outside the order window is a couple of hightop counters with benches. It's set up perfectly for eating while people-watching...which let's be honest, is the best thing about going to Scottsdale Fashion Square. It takes a few minutes on average, and you're presented with a couple of sliders. They aren't very big, but unless you've got a raging appetite, they should do the trick...especially if you get an order of fries with them. Each time we've went, the burgers have been cooked to perfection...they're really juicy and flavorful. Nothing fancy...just a straight up burger with all the regular toppings that'll melt in your mouth. There's something to be said about a nicely cooked burger. When you use fresh meat and cook it right...you don't need to get fancy and have exotic toppings. There's just something about these burgers that melts in your mouth...whatever it is...it's got me craving them every couple months if we happen to be at the mall. I wouldn't go out of my way to get one of these burgers, but if you're already at the mall, you're not gonna do any better than Modern Burger for a nice little Mall lunch. It easily beats out all the other Mall food offerings. Worth a try. 3.75/5.10/07/102 stars for the food...Popped over to Modern Steak to have their HH (happy hour) $2 sliders, and instead found that the prices have increased (2 for $6, I believe).  I'd wanted to try their truffle fries, but thought I'd try the fries at Modern Burger first to have something to compare the truffle fries to the next time I visit.  The sliders ($5.75 for two, but I might be wrong) tasted like they did in the past and were the same size as those I had during happy hour.  So why the increase at Modern Steak?  The fries were soggy, and therefore were horrible (to me!), and I wonder if the truffle fries are even worth coming back for, now?  Service was friendly and accomodating, so I'm adding an extra star!
Lobbys Burgers=I walked up to the counter and said, "I'll have an Italian Beef, Hot, with provolone and hot Giardiniera, Full Dip"!Lobby (I don't know if that's his name, but he's the owner and the place is called "Lobby's", so...) looked at me, puzzled and said "what part of Chicago are you from"?I know...ending a sentence with a preposition...so authentically Chicago!He was puzzled because my accent ain't exactly South Side...but I've spent a lot of time in Chicago over the years and one of the things that I developed there is a taste for Italian Beef Sandwiches, made just the way they make them at Lobby's...WOW is that good!I was extra fortunate today, because he had just taken 50 lb's. of roast beef out of the oven, to  slice up for my sandwich (well, OK, and other peoples sandwiches, too)...and I got to stand there and snorkel in the aroma as they unwrapped the top of the roasting pans, right on the counter in front of me!The aroma of roast beef, oregano, pepper, onion, garlic...in other words, exactly what you want your roast beef to take a bath in!Lobby makes his own marinade and roasts the beef wet, low and slow in a method that I like to call "nearly perfect"...he is proud of his place and of his food, and it really shows!For me, it always starts and ends with the food itself.Oh sure, I like to be pampered with spectacular service and surroundings as much as the next over-fed, self-absorbed, slightly insecure Brahmin, and the service was good and the place is clean and bright...but it really is about the food.And the food here is remarkable...a simple menu of Beef, Hamburgers and Hot Dogs...done the way that Lobby grew up loving in his hometown of Chicago and done with loving care...the result is a Chicago style food experience that almost can't be matched here in the desert!I do like my sandwiches and I did, would and will go out of my way to drop by Lobby's for their signature item (BTW, notice the name...it isn't Lobby's Burgers and Dog's...make no mistake, the Italian Beef is the big deal here).While there are couple of places around here that make an Italian Beef that comes close to Lobby's, none of them have invited me to smell the wonderful aroma of the beef just as it comes out of the oven and that made Lobby's a 5 star experience today!And for those of you concerned about where my nose has been, well, I keep my nose clean...at least that's what I tell my parole officer.Lobby, Lobby, Lobby you spoiled me.  Your burgers are so good.  I walked in and was instantly warmly greeted at the counter.  The young man took my order with a smile and sense of humor.  I love that!  I ordered a bacon chesse burger with provolone.  When I unwrapped it I knew I had found near perfection.  The burger was on a fresh sesame bun, the bacon was nice and crisp but not over done and the cheese.....oh the cheese.....it was melted over the burger.  9 times out of 10 when you get a cheese burger it looks like they just slapped the cheese on right before they put the rest of the toppings on so it's not melted.  In my mind the cheese should be melted down the sides of the burger, not an afterthought to be slapped on at the last minute.  I took a bite and the burger was juicy and cooked perfectly, just a tiny bit pink inside.  Ahhhh!!  I also got crinkle cut fries and they were perfectly cooked as well and not greasy at all.  Lobby's has a secret sauce....you must get a side of the secret sauce to dip your fries in....YUM!!!  The soda cups are a generous size and free refills are included.  The whole place was clean and well lit.  You can see them cooking too.  Lobby, yes that is his real name, was there running the show and making sure his customers were happy.  I hear the Italian Beef sandwich is to die for so I will try that next.  I'm gonna have to psych myself into it though cause that burger was so darn good!  Thank you Lobby!!!  I'll be back soon!!I read their reviews and the 4.5 star average immediately intrigued me. It takes a lot to earn a 4.5/5 star average on yelp and it made me wonder, it made me ponder and it made me eager to visit immediately to see what all this burger hype was about. While planning an office hours at Lobby's, I spoke to Lobby several times and listened to him explain the attention he gives to his burgers. The incredibly lean meat, the personal attention to each patty, Lobby's commitment to making the patty's from scratch...it sounded like this was a business that was definitely handled with some tender loving care. So the day arrived for me to finally visit Lobby's. The directions indicated that it was in a strip mall. For those of you who might get a little turned around like I do...go towards the grocery store and when you're facing it look to the left and behind you and poof, there's Lobby's! So I walked in and received a friendly welcome from the staff the second my foot entered the store. As I sat there for several hours, I noticed that Lobby and staff treat every customer the same way and each customer gets a personal welcome upon arrival. I also like how they welcome but they don't banter the potential customers to try the food. They let the customer decide for themselves. The decor was retro and cool and I could see the burger and fries being made right in front of me. I glanced at the menu even though I knew that only a burger this visit would do, and I was pleased with the price. Inexpensive. Moving on to the grand finale, the food. I ordered the cheeseburger and upon the staffer's recommendation, I got it with provolone and kept everything on it, especially Lobby's special sauce. The staffer suggested I take some special sauce on the side for my fries and swore by it so I didn't question the man and said OK! The burger and fries arrived and I immediately knew I was in trouble... the gluttony kind. Nestled on a fresh sesame bun and topped with thick and juicy pickles, lettuce, tomato and the special sauce, the patty was cooked to perfection and just the right size. I took one bite and was in cheeseburger paradise and I didn't even have to go to Hawaii! The burger was juicy, full of taste and the meat was lean. The special sauce. Oh my the special sauce. It's not your typical special burger sauce. There was an ingredient in there that made it just the right amount of sweet and perfect for dipping fries. I guess the lesson here is trust the Lobby's staffer! I tried to guess what the ingredients in the special sauce were but Lobby said that nobody has ever been able to guess. So that's a challenge yelpers. Figure out what's in the special sauce and let me know! The fries were crunchy and delicious, but there were a lot of them so if you go with a friend, you might want to share the fries since the burger will fill you up. I can't wait to visit Lobby's again and try the Italian Beef sandwich Donald S was raving about. If it's anything like the burger, I know I'll be in heaven. But in the meantime, I'll just have burgerlicious dreams about the tastiness I experienced with Lobby's Burgers. And now I see why they have such a high rating on yelp. Bravo Lobby!ALERT!  ALERT!  5 STAR BURGER JOINT! GREAT PRICES! FRIENDLY SERVICE!AM I SHOUTING?!  Oh, sorry. I tend to hit "caps lock" when I have headphones on.I had lunch here with my wonderful wife, my youngest daughter and my friend Donald S (not to be confused with Don S...it has happened).Let me just say I was impressed with my burger and fries.  Cheesy fries.  With bacon. Tender and juicy burger.  Done just right.Donald's Italian beef sandwich looked so good I'll be having that the next time I go to Lobby's, which will be soon.  Maybe dinner today.We did chat with the owner, Lobby.  Nice guy, great local business.  Go here.Upon my second visit to Lobby's I tried the Italian Beef Sandwich.  WOW!  Go hungry if you're gonna get this one cause it is HUGE!  And it's really more of a knife and fork sandwich.  Oh sure, you can try to eat it like a sandwich but you're probably going to be picking up a lot of the filling with your fork so just cut it up and get every bite the first time.  The beef is so tender and tasty!  YUM!.  Let me speak about customer service for a moment.  I love being treated like a valued customer.  If I'm going to spend my hard earned cash somewhere I want a smile, willingness to help if I have questions, and getting my order correct. If they do that right then they are tops in my book. The last two weeks I have gone to two establishments that not only did all these things but they remembered me by name!  When I walked into Lobby's for lunch last week I was greated warmly by Lobby himself and he remembered me!  It's been a while since I was last in and I know he sees people all day long and I'm not what I would call particularly memorable.....I mean I don't have tats or pink hair, I'm just your average woman but Lobby goes that extra mile.  He really cares about his business and it shows.  There were some gentleman just finishing off their lunches and he took the time to ask them how it was and listened to their critique of the food.  He did it graciously and asked some questions genuinely wanted to know the answers.  Lobby cares.  His place is still spotless, again, a big plus for me.  When I crave a burger, this is what I crave.  A real beef patty with fresh ingrediants, cheese, and sometimes bacon.  This is by far my favorite burger joint.  Support your locan businesses!!  Especially the ones that go that extra mile and really care!!!No question -- my FAVORITE burger in the valley!I first got turned on to Lobbys at a Yelp Office Hours -- http://www.yelp.com/biz/september-office-hours-at-lobbys-tempe#hrid:kQOElzgklMRbAyWS8LhVFw - - and by my check-ins, you can see i've frequented there since. I've tried a lot of other "great" burgers -- 5 Guys, Smashburger, etc - but IMHO, none of them stack up to the food and the experience at Lobbys. The burgers at Lobbys are so good that I crave them --I want to drive across town or plan out my day so that I'm in the area to get one! I just feel that there's more quality ingredients with a Lobbys burger -- the bun, the taste, the way the cheese melts over the whole patty, the special sauce, and the burger itself. And just as Lynn W says the service is truly superior here and " He (Lobby) really cares about his business and it shows". I've recommended many friends to check out Lobbys and have brought a few friends here -- everyone has loved it! Especially my Chicago friends that live in the valley. Lobbys burgers is that raised bar that I measure all other burger joints to.I think a burger should be grilled on an open flame...none of this flat fried grilling. BUTIf your going to do that start with a nice round ball of meat, squish it down and cook it to order, just like Lobbys does. It was one of the best fried burgers I have had. I would say maybe a tad better then 5 guys. I would get another if ever in the area!Keep up the good work guys!I think it's funny that places like this are creating such a splash in the local food scene. Lobby's excels at being an average burger joint by using high quality, fresh ingredients. It's the kind of place that once was common, but was replaced in the last 20 years by novel and trendy restaurant concepts of other sorts. Or, for a more modern reference, imagine if Fudrucker's got rid of its ambiance and added a Chicago twist with its Italian beef, Polish sausage, and Chicago dogs.Lobby's is very proud of its caramelized onions (apparently, they have a magical way of making a crispy white onion brown and soft). When I asked about getting sauerkraut on a Polish sausage, the owner insisted that he too loves sauerkraut, but the onions are sooooooo much better: "Just look! We grill them right here," he says, pointing at the grill. In other words, they do not offer sauerkraut. And then there's the secret sauce. It's pink! And when offered as a dipping sauce for the otherwise mediocre school-cafeteria-style fries, it's made a little bit spicy with chili powder or something of the sort. Again, total magic!Just so that I don't sound too let down, I will say that the buns make the burgers above average at Lobby's. Good idea not to skimp on the buns. As you walk in, you get the sense that this place should have a drive thru and charge $2-3 per burger, but the burgers are more comparable to pub fare. And apparently people love Lobby's. My three stars are below average, and the owner drives a Mercedes when he's not happily engaging in chit chat with his customers -- they're apparently doing well enough and I would frequent this place if it were in my neighborhood.So if you're ever craving a burger and fries in Tempe, I would say skip the In-N-Out and go here instead. But for hot dogs? Granted, I'll never understand the whole Chicago dog craze, but this place is right near Ted's.... The only way I'm ordering a dog other than Ted's in the area is if it's wrapped in bacon and prepared Sonoran style. Sorry, Lobby's. Also, your onions are pretty much the same as anyone else's caramelized onions. I still want sauerkraut on my Polish sausage.Haven't written a review in a while.  Now's the time.I saw Lobby's from the road for a while as we were going from here to there.  I saw the sign and thought, "Hmmm, burgers,"  The GeoQpons coupon from my iPhone was my incentive to take my family over for lunch.  Cool ambiance here.  The first thing that I caught my eye about Lobby's is the service.  Everybody was friendly and attentive, and we even got a big mound of extra crinkle fries with our burgers--I'm not kidding, the guy just scooped a whole bunch of extra fries on our tray.There ain't nuthin' fancy about these burgers, and that's what makes 'em special.  Simple, fresh, grilled meat, topped any way you like (and believe me, these things can get topped REALLY high).  Fries were simple and tasty.  We left full and happy.  Next time, I might try me a dog or an Italian sandwich--we'll see.  This place rocks.This is the very first time I have ever been here. I had never even heard of it before.  Nestled in a little shopping center that is half empty is Lobby's.I Ordered a regular Cheese burger with fries, Mario got a double.Less than $20.00 for both of us including the tip.What amazed me at first as we waited for our food, was how very sparkling clean the place was, Here they are cooking grease all day and the stainless steel was shiny like The Top of the Chrysler Building!Which means they fully scrub it down every night. When we did get our food it was amazing!!! Yes it was hot, fresh, and oh so good. You could see the meat had no fillers ,the tomato's were a bit unripe but other than that, it was fantastic. I wanted to save a little for the dog (to take home). But, I ate it all.Fries were also really good.  While we were there they had their meat delivery , and guess what ! It is fresh meat that will do home delivery from grain feed cattle. This place is the bomb of the Burger World. It is just as you made it at home. The staff was super good as well, very friendly and always busy.I have been here many times over the years. We came here 2 weeks ago, but It was time for another visit.  Stopped in to pick up an early dinner to go around 3:30pm.Double cheese burger with Provolone and french fries. This is a grat place for a healthy Burger. They meat here is delivered fresh everyday.High price for the burgers but, well worth it, because, the food is great!This is better than what you can make at home.Nice and clean inside, smells good, and looks nice.We will come here again many times. My girlfriend does not even like Burgers, but she loves these.Whenever I bite into a burger I want it to taste exactly like the burgers at Lobbys.   Nuff said.Was dyingggggg for a burger during work one day and I found this place on Yelp. This place is literally down the street from my work so I had to try it out, especially with such good ratings. I ordered the Bacon burger with a side of fries. It wasn't the best burger I ever had but it was pretty good. They have their own special sauce on it as well which is also served with their fries. It actually reminded me of In & Out's sauce. That thousand Island shizz... lol. Their fries are good too. Not too salty or soggy but just right. My co worker ordered the chili cheese fries which I got to try. Holy crap, their portion for this was huge! It was a like a 2 person meal maybe. lol. The pricing wasn't that bad and the staff was really friendly. Plus I got my meal quick! The only thing was I felt like I needed to hit the gym after scarfing everything down. lol. I'll definitely come back when I'm feenin for a burger since it's so close to my work. =)I'll have to agree with Sue C. (ROTD) and other fellow Yelpers when it comes to rating this locally owned Chicago style restaurant. What more can you ask for other than friendly service and a tasty menu of quality food cooked with TLC.It is also nice to have a place that opens earlier than the usually lunch time competition. I start work early and can get hungry rather quickly. This place opens at 10 and is always clean and ready to go. The owner told me this is the Chicago way of doing things. Nice!Love the fact that they use Grass-fed Beef from Iowa in their Burgers. Reminds me of what beef used to taste like back in the days. The Chicago Style Vienna All-Beef Hot Dogs are also very tasty and you can get them with Chili and Cheese when you are in the mood. The Dipped Italian Beef with both types of peppers and some Provolone Cheese is one of my favorites as well.Yes there are cheaper places in town that start with Jimbo or the letter P. You can get more food there for the dollar but the quality can sometimes suffer a great deal. What I like here is that everything taste fresh and they go out of there way to keep it that way. No chili in a can at this restaurant.Located in a strip mall off the road with plenty of place to park. I'll pay extra to get the better quality and special attention. Chicago attitude comes free and is always a treat. Did I mention how big the Chili Cheese Fries were the other day? SHAZAM!4.75 STARSTempe, your secret is out. Lobby's Burgers is de-lic-ious! Dropped in here with my Dude two months back for a quick, definitely not good for you dinner. Tip: It's behind Gold Bar Espresso. Just drive around the building, and BOOM! Lobby's appears.Immaculately clean inside. In fact, it seemed that someone was constantly cleaning the place while we were there. Just one gal working the counter, another cooking, and she was very patient with us as we ordered. I had a Bacon Cheeseburger, lettuce wrapped, and Dude had the Chili Burger. We also tried some of the fries. Pst, split them with a friend, the serving is more than enough!Lobby uses grass-fed beef, and you can certainly taste the difference. The burger had thick slices of pickles, tomatoes, onions, and fresh lettuce with sliced cheddar, bacon, and Lobby's secret sauce.By the way, that sauce makes an awesome dip for the fries. Mmm mmm mmm! This was the best "fast food" burger I've had in ages, and for a great price. Dude wasn't a fan of the chili, but I'm a nice lady friend and shared. I don't know how you could think the mouthful of grease that's In-N-Out is still the "God of the Burger Industry" after eating at Lobby's Burgers. Can't wait to come back and try the rest of the menu!After driving around for ten minutes on the wrong side of the parking lot, the girl and I finally found this hidden gem in Tempe. But I am glad we did.I've been here twice so far and both times the burgers have been great. first time I got the chili burger and the second time I got a bacon burger with mushrooms. Both burgers were great. Good flavor and very fresh toppings. Admittedly I was a little underwhelmed with the chili but it may have been an off night so will give i another try. The fries are great especially with the Lobby's sauce. Both times I've been in the customer service has been excellent and very friendly. I've heard they make really good dogs and sandwiches as well so will definitely have to give them a shot sometime.Thanks to Preston's UYE at Lobbys, I now know the spot for a great burger in Tempe!One of the things I love about Lobby's, its locally owned, and the owner takes pride in his shop!After studying the menu for a minute I went with a cheeseburger & fries and was told to get some of that Lobby Sauce, I also heard that the Italian beef is the bombdiggity, I'll have to try that next time for sure. My burger was perfectly cooked! And it was messy too, but in a good way, everything on the burger tasted fresh too! Great flavor! The fries were delish too! Dip them in the Lobby Sauce and its game over! So good!Glad to have tried Lobby Burger and plan on coming back soon!
Shanghai Buffet=Good times with good people. Ryan C Norm R Rand H Mike C We came, we ate, we reviewed. There should be some nice reviews from my fellow Yelper's. We each have our favorites and our dislikes. We all agree, this place was good. I will allow Rand to expand on the # of trays and the various types of food. I had a little bit of everything, except the sushi and some of the exotic seafood. I stuck to the fish and the shrimp. Hot and sour soup was good,but not too hot Dumplings were good Fried Rice was good Spicy Chicken Coconut shrimp Spare ribs Green beans Orange chicken Honey chicken Thin noodles (reminded me of ponciet) Fried fish Fried shrimp Beef and broccoli and some others All the food was good, fresh and had nice variety. They serve real Thrifty Ice cream, which is a nice treat.Had an interesting breakfast today, since my Shanghai Boofay lunch was so early.  MikeC, NormR, RandH, DarenC, and I met up at the place which has recently opened in the carcass of the former original location of China Star Boofay, in the carcass of a former Red Lobster, near 43rd Ave and Bell Rd in North Phoenix.So since there will soon be several thorough reviews from notable Yelpilluminati, I will stick to those areas that are uniquely mine:Greasy~Crispy Spectrum:.-. 4 stars .-.  nothing was too soggy at all, and there was a crispy outside on very many dishes.  Bonus that the terryaki chicken appeared not to have been deep fried but perhaps baked.Discard Pile:.-. 4 stars .-.  i had very little to cut off or spit out (thinking even of the short ribs) and most dishes actually had absolutely zero Discard Pile.  Notable were both the honey and orange chicken, and a nice crisped-up outside on the wontons.McKenna Novelty Factor:.-. 5 stars .-. (here's another category, newly named, for how i judge a boofay, whether it's got the 'same old same old' or it has unique items that you can't get just anywhere)  Shanghai had several items that were pretty novel.  Scoop-it-yer-damn-self Thrifty ice cream in about 8 different flavors.  Sushi bar that included seaweed salad and other acoutrements.  Also of note was what Norm said was called a Dessert Soup, which had a yellowish syrupy looking liquid with a small amount of blanched peanuts and red grapes floating in it, along with what at first apeared to be bits of tripe, like in menudo! Norm later figured out that it was ceylon agar (just think of it as vegan gelatin - it's from seaweed!), and with the server's help, that the small round fruits that looked like small apricots or orange lychee, were in fact a chinese fruit called loquat, we supposed related to the cumquat, every gradeschool boy's favorite thing to call someone as a name, since it's a real fuit and how can you get in trouble for that?RyanC-isms:.-. 3 stars .-.  A few personal favorites were missing, such as bean sprouts and a General tsao-type chicken (the spicy chicken they had wasn't spicy at all, and was mostly jalapeno flavored).  I also wish I could have put some chocolate syrup on my ice cream.  The lone bowl of rainbow sprinkles made me wish for more of a sundae bar, although MikeC seemed to be doing very nicely with the cone(s)!  $7-something for lunch is just allright since it doesn't include the drink.   The decor is comfortable and clean.  The service was excellent, with plates cleared quickly, and friendliness all around.   The nice ladies found answers to our questions and even took our picture, too!The food here, plus the company of the other yelp buffet aficionados (Rand H., Ryan C., Daren C., Mike C.)  made for a really great time. There are quite a number of things I find unusual here for a buffet restaurant. Who wouldn't love a buffet with a selection of *decent*  sushi, made fresh in its own section of the restaurant. To go with that, in the main buffet area they serve  vegetable tempura - again, something not frequently served in Chinese buffets. Baby octopus, seaweed salad, Korean kalbi, crayfish - more items uncommon in buffets. They also have the practice of putting smaller amounts of food on the serving trays, so that none of the food stays on the tray for an extended period and replenishment is more frequent. The dishes are mostly good, and the attentive and friendly staff makes the dining experience quite pleasant.  There's not much here in terms of misses; the only thing I didn't like was their shu mai, which was large but quite dry and had an off taste. They also have a good selection of desserts, including the usual baked goods, pudding, gelatin, fruits (fresh and in syrup), but here again they add an unusual touch: several tubs of real ice cream (not soft serve), and tong sui (Chinese dessert soup). Yay for Shanghai Super Buffet! I wish them success; definitely an addition to my list of buffets for repeat visits.Yup  I did it , I took the family to the Boofay and it didn't make us sick ! I am not usually a huge buffet kinda gal  but I was interested in trying this place and with the Recommendations of the S.C.A.B. Y . ( Superior Crew of Boofays of Yelp)  also known as Ryan , Daren, Rand, Norm and Iain. I was sure I couldn't go wrong . Taking in consideration of the genre of this establishment this was a pretty good operation. While a pungent sour smell hit you upon walking in  you quickly dismissed it upon the viewing of food.  The food was strongly  decent . My favorite was a chicken they named BBQ chicken , ironic because it was a light teriayki , but whatever, it's their restaurant and they can name it whatever they like. But it wasn't BBQ.They also had  ---wait for it ---Crab legs.. cool !!  The other items were good and looked good: Veggies on the line still looked fresh and not overcooked. They had some interesting fish concoctions with shrimp and octopus  that caught my interest. The sushi line looked once again, decent but of course tasted only okay.  Orange Chicken and Beef Rib  tasted good .There was also big assortment of shrimp dishes , for a minute I went all Bubba Gump .. Fried Shrimp , Salt and Pepper Shrimp, Shrimp Tempura, Cold Shrimp, Coconut Shrimp then I remembered its 2010  and I snapped out of it.  They also had a few desserts which we didn't try and Ice Cream which the kids fully appreciated. For the price of 10.00 a person it was reasonable if you take into consideration its a  Chinese Buffet. We decided this a good place to go if you are craving Panda express or Teriakyi  Chicken .  Service was good and we got in and out of there relatively easily.My first review is a year old now, and I'm still eating at Shanghai Buffett 3-4 times a month for lunch.  I'm a big fan.Norm R's right, they deserve the 5th star.  (not that they're a ritzy place, but to judge each establishment against only it's own category, this is really the best of the large chinese buffets in north phoenix)Michael K makes a great point about the friendliness of the service.  90% of the staff is very smiley and friendly, and also extremely Service-Oriented.  This is a rare quality, in this rushed world where so many clerks and servers seem to be simply 'phoning it in'.  Your dirty plates will disappear and your drinks will seem to refill themselves.Variety and freshness are simply what I've come to expect from Shanghai.
China Chef=if you want to fit in san tan valley here is a step by step guide.1. be really proud of yourself for buying a super cheap house in the middle of nowhere. but don't tell anyone the location bc the moment you do people are less impressed.... and more turned off. 2. bc of #1, you can afford rims on your car. be sure to buy the ugliest  ones possible. people here prefer black rims with chrome outline.3. roll down your windows4. tune your radio to rap music 5. blast it really loud6. drive with your left arm only, straight out, and lean back. be sure you wear your wrist watch on this arm so that others can see it out your window. bonus points if you wiggle your wrist pretending to adjust the watch, but really you just want it to sparkle under the light.im not exaggerating, we saw about 10 different cars like this while eating our china chef. (i just checked out someone's profile who lives in san tan valley. first person i clicked on listed interest: purple drank. what are the chances? i rest my case.)this whole review is an embarrassment, but it must be said. don't ask why i was in this part of town last night, but i was. and we were waiting for a long time in this shopping center and hadn't had dinner. china chef of burger king? china chef it is! the food wasn't disgusting, actually it was just meh but edible and better than BK (on 2nd thought, maybe if i find myself in that horrible town/shopping center i will do BK). the space was clean and blah blah blah.  that's not the problem. the problem is that the meal doesn't come with a gas mask for later. and my body wasn't the only one having issues with this food. for the record, i've eaten my fair share of questionable food and i have never had a reaction like this. shhuuuuuuuuu-weeeeeeeee.
Avenue B=What a cute little place!  It's uber tiny, but you get the feeling it will pack a big punch.  I opted to try out the lunch first because I was very intrigued by the grilled cheese and tomato soup I had read about in other reviews.  Sure enough, both were mighty fab!  There wasn't a thing I would change about the grilled cheese.  The bread (wheat or grain) was awesome and it was toasted perfectly.  Tomatoes inside were an added bonus.  But the real winner of was the cheese.  Oh Cheddar, oh cheddar, how I love thee!  It was sharp as could be and absolute melty goodness.  I was in cheesy heaven!The soup was definitely good, but not great.  I think it could have done with a little more pepper and a tad more cream to add to the bisque name.  It tasted just a tad too runny for bisque.  If I'm going to calorie overload on my bisque, you better commit with my heavy cream!  Service left a little bit to be desired.  She just seemed very unenthusiastic about everything.  I really enjoy asking the server about different menu items, to get their take on what they enjoy.  Maybe I'm too trusting, but I assume they've tried mostly everything and have opinions about them.  I mean, I wouldn't work in a place I hated their food (that's maybe why I stuffed myself with one too many EnP Superburgers back in my day).  She didn't really offer much....oh well, you can't always have a peppy server (Lord knows I wasn't all the time!).  I can't wait to go back and try the dinner.  Everything on the lunch menu sounded awesome, and I'm sure dinner would be just the same.  I'll be back with my bottle of red for BYOB BABY!***Avenue B's kitchen turns fresh and high quality ingredients into light dishes that are also flavorful, vibrant and filling; their reasonable lunch prices also make Avenue B a great option for an upscale lunch in Pittsburgh***Avenue B sits in a neighborhood that kind of reminded me of Silver Lake, Los Feliz or Atwater Village.  The restaurant has a simple café-like décor, but there are great touches.  I liked the use of purple as well as the hanging light fixtures--rustic but also trendy.  The restaurant has a great neighborhood restaurant feel to it.Their lunch menu is reasonably priced and it features dishes inspired from many different cuisines.  There is a Cobb salad and a potpie as well as a Thai-like dish and a banh mi.  I went for one of their modern Asian entrees, which was black sesame crusted salmon served with a salad of seaweed, cucumber, surimi, and mushrooms.  It also came with a sauce of sweet soy and a garnish of carrot and daikon.The salmon entrée seemed like something you would find at a run-of-the-mill Asian fusion restaurant, but it was so much better than that.  The salmon was very fresh and they got a nice crispy crust on it.  The salmon was served medium rare and it was very moist, but it still flaked very easily.  I also liked the great flavor of the black sesame as well as the sweet soy sauce.The garnish of carrot and daikon was fresh with a light crunch while the seaweed salad was cool, refreshing and flavorful.  I liked the mix of the warm salmon with the cool salad.  It was a very light dish, but it was also a very flavorful and filling dish.If I were going to nitpick, I would say that the entrée seemed very close (maybe too close) to the Asian ingredients and flavors that influenced it.  But when the ingredients are high quality like this (especially the salmon) and they are handled so well, it is hard to complain (5 stars).I also tried their flatbread, which was topped with cheese, grilled artichokes, prosciutto, and arugula.  This flatbread had a great crust, which is where a lot of flatbreads can go wrong.  It had a great flavor with the right amount of char; it was thin and crispy but also with a little bit of a chew.The arugula was great--leafy, peppery and nicely dressed in a light vinaigrette (you often get dry arugula on flatbread).  The generous portion of the arugula kind of overwhelmed the small portion of prosciutto, but the prosciutto was good (not dry, meaty and with the right amount of saltiness).The cheese was good too.  In terms of other toppings, they used the woody part of the artichoke, which wouldn't be my first choice, but it was actually a good contrast to the leafy arugula and it made the artichokes stand out in a good way (4 stars).For dessert, I went with their blondie, which was filled with pretzel buttercream and garnished with bruleed green apple.  The bruleed green apple was great.  It was reminiscent of a candy apple but with the use of a tart green apple versus the more sweet red apple (the more traditional apple used in a candy apple).  I think the tart apple combined with the sweet crust was great.That candy apple-like taste made from a technique you often see with crème brulee was kind of eye opening.  And when it was mixed with the sweet and chewy caramel, it became a dessert that felt very nostalgic but also sophisticated at the same time.The pretzel buttercream was good.  You do get a little bit of a pretzel flavor with the addition of coarsely chopped pretzels though the buttercream did not have a prominent pretzel flavor.  What I liked about the buttercream though was how it was sweet and creamy without being overly sugary like a lot of buttercreams (4 stars).I also tried their housemade brown butter ice cream and it was great--great flavor, smooth, creamy, dense, and firm (without being hard) - 4 stars.Service by Lauren was great.  She was personable, nice, knowledgeable about the menu, and very attentive.  The food also came out at a good pace.Prices for lunch were reasonable.  Most of the entrees were in the $12-$15 range and several of the starters were $8 and below.Avenue B is a very impressive restaurant that showcases fresh ingredients in satisfying flavor combinations.  There is also a lot of talent in the kitchen as the flatbread and salmon were both perfectly to near perfectly prepared.  All these great things plus Avenue B's reasonable lunch prices make it a great choice for a delicious upscale lunch in Pittsburgh.Parking is available on the street by meter.  It is not that difficult finding a space during lunchtime.
India Masala=Look no further for the best Indian food on the strip!  Not like there was fierce competition.  It's pretty interesting that it popped up at the food court of the Riviera of all places.  I'm still trying to figure out why it's here.  Do guests of the Riviera have a strong fever that can only be satiated with tremendous curry flavors?  All I see are old people playing slots!  It doesn't matter though.  I'm just glad it's here and it's tremendous.Not only do they have every curry you could want but they serve a lot of south Indian dishes most places don't.  I only wished I was hungrier when I came to try more things.  We ended up ordering the tandoori combo which included 4 different meats and the saag paneer accompanied by 2 orders of naan.  Everything was delicious and I can't wait to go back and try more menu items.The two reasons for no 5 star rating are the location (hate the parking garage) and the price which is a couple extra dollars more than other places.  There are too many Indian options off the strip for lunch at better price points and they're all you can eat.  Still, it doesn't take away from how good their food is.I can't believe I actually have a reason to go to the Riviera now!Let me start off by saying, I only went to this place because of the reviews I read on Yelp.Definitely not disappointed. I truly would have never found this place if it were not for Yelp. And probably even if I did, I would have been reluctant to try it since it is in a food court.If you are going to India Masala it is for nothing else but good food. I mean who says I am going to the food court to eat dinner? Other than maybe high school kids. Prices were a bit pricey for a food court but it is in a hotel on the strip. However, to my surprise I had more than enough food and could hardly finish my meal. I paid about $15.00 for a butter chicken (spicy) meal with rice, naan and soda. I definitely was not disappointed. You wait a little longer for your food than we would be accustomed to in a food court setting but my food was fresh and oh so good. I am literally salivating now just thinking about it. My only set back was I had one little piece of lemon grass that was too big so when I bit into it it was not fun for me.Good sign for me is when I see native people eating their own food. There is nothing worse than going to an ethnic place to eat and you do not see any people of their own kind there.Best Naan in town, hands down.This is definate must try for any Indian Food Lovers. You can not be disappointed. It is definate return and new fave for me.Awesome!  And LATE LATE LATE!SITREPHot Dam!  What a find when wandering along Las Vegas Blvd at 2am!  MENULV Yelper Paolo had recommended the Butter Chicken, Naan, Rice, ALL GOOD, and this particular dish tends to be my "litmus test" for different places from Seattle to Sacramento to L.A. and now Vegas, and I have to say it was De-LISH.PRICE YIKES!But the combo was about $14 after tax and tip, with this and something that I would consider to be very pricey if at home or work.  However, this was my Vegas trip and in most situations while traveling, I won't spare the expense for the experience.THE LOWDOWNA great find in Vegas for Indian fare!
Passage To India=One of those roving-eye-hungry lunch stops (seriously, it could have been TGIFri or Hardees, we were so starved) that turned into super-happy-belly-land. Tiny, as has been said. Darkly lit, too. If you're a bit of a wide load, you're going to have trouble squeezing past chairs and tables. Buffet is cramped but packed - all the classics present and kept refreshed. Mostly veg, with some chicken and other meats at the left end. Malai kofta, paneer masala, daal, sambar, iddly, vada, hamburger buns (wtf), biryanis, chutneys and such, along with some sweets, on the cold bar. Veg lo mein . Free paper dosas brought to the table as you sit.10 bucks is a little high, but worth the variety of flavor and freshness of grub. Had a sip of a mango lassi - and smiled - pureed cardamom pods made my tongue sit up in surprise. Sweeeeet.
BB King's Blues Club=This review is based on my breakfast I had here one morning and the few glasses of wine I was able to enjoy here at the bar the night before.I really wish I could have spent some more time at this place. I absolutely love the hip bluesy, laid back, loungy atmosphere and could imagine it must be a fun place to kick back on an evening before hitting the rest of the town.Sunday morning and limited to the selection of breakfast choices to go to and not craving to go back to the not so delectable Cravings buffet option we chose before, this seemed to be our last, but decent resort.I was seated promptly and given my much needed coffee immediately. I ordered an omelet with Swiss cheese, bell peppers, onions and sausage.It arrived within a timely manner appearing fluffy and deliciously appealing. I then noticed it was ham instead of sausage in the omelet( I don't like to be too picky but I really don't like ham) so I told the waitress, she apologized politely and had another one remade.Come to find out it was sausage just a different kind and the chef actually came out (no, not to strangle me) but to show me a display of different sausages how they are and what I would like to use. She was extremely professional and extremely polite.She gladly remade it and brought it out to me. The omelet was seriously a fluffy, flavorful goodness. Savory flavor in each delectable bite and cooked to perfection. Yeah I know, that rave over an omelet, I just have to give praise to those who can make simple things outstanding.My experience the night before was nice; wine was nothing special though, the service we received from the bar tender was sincere, friendly and prompt.Definitely will make a trip back to this place again:)We all know the saying "What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas." Well, I offer another one, "Keep the wife happy when in Vegas or your vacation is going to be a battle that will come home with you." Not sure when I learned that, but I'm sure glad I did. So, when my wife said she wants to go to the Mirage Hotel to BB Kings Blues Club, I said, "Sure, let's go tonight." Whew... a bullet dodged and I probably didn't even know it at the time.See, Oliva loves Jazz and hates Gambling. I like Gambling and love Music. So, before I can gamble (and she gets uber-bored/pissed), I need to make sure she's knocked a few "to do" items off her list. Does it make me a bad husband? I don't know, but it sure made for a smoother trip because she loved BB King's Blues Club. We came about 5 minutes before a live set started, paid the cover fee $5/person, told the hostess we were there for the music, and got seated dead center in the front row. Nice.We ordered a couple draft beers and some Sweet Potato Tots with Caramel Sauce (meh) to snack on while Jazz heated up the place. The first part of the set was magical with some great improvisations and jazz joints. The crowd was into it, but not really hitting the dance floor. About half-way through the set, a new lead singer came out and the mood/tone of the music became love songs. The dance floor did eventually fill up, but the jazz vibe was muted. I definitely loved the first part of the set more than the second. Overall, Olivia gave BB King's 5-star gold. For me, it was a-ok 3 stars, but a happy wife makes for a happy life, so I'm officially a 4-star fan of BB King's Blues Club.
The Pizza Buffet=Uhh this place is totally cool. $5.49 you get all you can eat pizza, salad, pasta, and speciality types of food. Today was Fried Chicken, Enchiladas, rice, beans and spicy chicken noodle. Desserts too $4.99 you get all you can eat pizza, salad and pasta. Desserts too. There were #11  14 inch semi-thin crust pizzas to choose from. I asked what her favorite was and she said Chicken Alfredo, and proceeded to yell to a cook to make on asap. I was feeling really good knowing they make pizza just for me. Apparently you can have them make whatever you want, so I am not that special. I had, chicken Alfredo, BBQ chicken, pep and sausage, white pizza, the works, and pepperoni. They were all good but not the best you ever had. DUH I also had salad, pasta, soup, and dessert. The place is large and clean, there is a video game area but it looked closed. Maybe they only use it on Mondays or Tuesdays, when it is kids eat free. Monday = KEFTuesday = KEFWednesday = TacoThursday = EnchiladasFridays = They have fried fish all you can eat too. Check it out!The special item today (Friday) was fish, and and since I love fried fish I came here to give the place a try. The restaurant is spacious and clean and was not too busy when I came in, probably because it was around 1:30 and the lunch crowd was gone. There was a decent array of different pizzas, nothing exotic: white, pepperoni, veggie, ham & pineapple, etc. But beyond the pizza trays were the other dishes: yellow rice, beans, pasta, marinara sauce, corn, mashed 'taters, fried chicken, fried fish (the dish of the day, Friday), spicy chicken stew, desserts, and a small salad bar. I tried the veggie pizza and it was OK, and then went on to sample the other dishes. The rice was good, as were the pasta and marinara; the beans were a tad watery, though. In spite of that fact that it was that post-lunch time of early afternoon, these items were still fresh; they were replacing and replenishing the dishes frequently enough to avoid having dried-out food. The chicken stew was hearty and - thank goodness the server warned me beforehand - significantly spicy. The offerings of the salad bar were nice and fresh, though limited. But then you don't come here mainly for the salad, which is meant to be truly just a side for the main starches and proteins. And speaking of the proteins - for me, those were the best part! The fried chicken was juicy and the skin nice and crispy. I wish they had ketchup (I love that condiment), but actually the chicken was tasty and fresh enough to stand on its own. The mashed potatoes were an excellent creamy accompaniment to the chicken. And the fish -- yummm! It was perfect! It was deep-fried so of course some greasiness was unavoidable, but the batter was crispy with a light mouth feel -- unusual for deep-fried fish fillets -- and the fish itself was moist and tender. The desserts were freshly baked goods, such as brownies and cinnamon rolls; surprisingly I had room for the latter, even though I had already eaten a lot.Certainly worth coming back to; you get your money's worth, and more. After all, the complete name of the establishment is The Pizza Buffet and Much Much More (for real ... see the pic).
Nagoya Japanese Restaurant & Korean BBQ=Driving down Rainbow all the time and we always pass by Nagoya 2.  But leave it to an advertisement selling their newest addition to the menu "AYCE Korean BBQ" to have us coming through their doors.Once you get passed the boring facade, you walk into a large restaurant establishment with a bar to the right, sushi bar in the middle, tables to the left, and bbq tables on the further leftThe Husband wanted AYCE Korean BBQ, and there's only one way he can get it - if I order it with him.  (It's offered to parties of two or more doing AYCE only.)Adult prices: $19.95Kid prices: 8 years old and younger: $12.95A little banchan starts your Korean meal - Korean pancake, broccoli, pickled cucumbers, and potato. Not much here.As the waitress was getting our table set up, I asked her if I'm supposed to go ahead and tell her what I want.  She mentioned something about them usually bringing everything out, unless I have a preference.  We definitely did have a preference because we didn't quite want it all!There are about seven different appetizers to choose from, we went with:* Garlic Edamame "Soy bean with spicy garlic sauce)* Gyoza (Deep fried dumpling)* Chicken Wing (Spicy marinated)The kitchen list has about six items, and we got:* Tonkatsu (Deep fried breaded pork)* Vegetable Tempura (Assorted vegetable deep fried)* Kake Udon (Thick noodles soup with fried tofu, fish cake, seaweed)* Fried Rice (Vegetable)From the Korean BBQ list of four items:* Galbi (Angus marinated BBQ beef ribs)* Samgyubsal (Pork belly)(Our waitress did all the cooking for us here, so that was nice.)From the Classic Rolls list of seven items:* Salmon Skin Roll (grilled salmon skin)* Spicy Tuna Roll (spicy tuna, cucumber)For dessert, you get only one scoop of vanilla or green tea ice cream.The staff really didn't want our fellow diners to not do AYCE with us, but we told them otherwise.  The MIL and her companion chose to order off their regular Japanese menu.  They both had the Combination Dinner Special which includes salad, rice, miso soup, gyoza, and two items from their list for $13.50.  (It's $15.50 if you want three items.)  She went for the tonkatsu and miso saba, while he went for the shrimp tempura and calamari tempura.  However, we think he got the short end of the stick because there were only two pieces of shrimp and the rest were veggies.  (In retrospect, he would have done the Shrimp Tempura Entree dinner for $12.90 and gotten 6 pieces of shrimp instead.)  What a bummer!  They also got what looked like a half order of a CA roll with their meal.Service was good for the latter part.  Our initial waitress was a bit spacey, until we moved into the bbq section and then that waitress was better and a lot more friendlier.  It was only a Tuesday night, but they had a steady stream of customers - some sitting at the tables, another sitting at the AYCE bbq section, and more sitting at the sushi bar.  They have a pretty extensive menu, and the sushi menu is pretty long.Overall, it wasn't bad for AYCE.  Sure, we've had a better selection for a fraction of the price, but it'll have to do for the southwest area for now.  But for more bang for your buck, you're better off over on Spring Mountain.
Thai Basil=Perfect! Happy hour mon-sat 3pm-6pm3.5 stars All we wanted to do was to grab something to eat after a long drive from California to Arizona and we found this on rurual road, in Tempe. The exterior may look plain but hey, there's a bar and happy hour happening so why turn around?What does happy hour have? Well, well , well... 1/2 off appetizers, $2 blue moons and drafts that they carry. And there's specials on selected food.Got the..+ fresh rolls ($3) chicken - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7N3q70C_mwEYQ2QcGfjvgA?select=N1mhk603JkCFuPZJ58Cxew#mYLsvj4kSTgz7tqwKX07NQ You get to choose either chicken, beef or tofu. We got the chicken and it was pretty good. The sweet and sour sauce was a bit different from the Thai places I've been to. Usually there's garlic in it, but at Thai Basil, they put chopped up peanuts instead. So if you're allergic with peanuts, best ask for the sauce without the nuts!+ Papaya Salad ($6.25) mildTasted great! Only sad thing is that we only had one shrimp :(+ red snapper with mixed veggies and bamboo (mild) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7N3q70C_mwEYQ2QcGfjvgA?select=vhgbwyKOgx0caLeacQ1zQQ#pD9KU2uHEGRBQS4H02AJEQOh so yummy! Tasted garlic-y and having it over rice is delicious.+ Bluemoons ($2 each)  - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7N3q70C_mwEYQ2QcGfjvgA?select=vhgbwyKOgx0caLeacQ1zQQ#A2vWUeFM6vWyQXZeJJvwEw Service - Was great. The ladies who works there are very helpful when we asked what in what and they will let you know what's their special of the day. And yes, there is a bar here. Eat while you drink in front of a big screen t.v. Overall, not a bad place. I just wished they gave more than one darn shrimp!
MOzen Bistro=Bold.  In your face.  High octane.  The flavors of Mozen.  Unexpected in the reserved, contemporary elegance of the Mandarin Oriental but oh so good!Note:  This updated review is based on multiple visit for dinner service only.The menu is broken into two parts, a build your own bento box (select from regional Asian dishes) or larger portions of mains split between south east Asian dishes or classic western dishes.  The bento ($48 for six selections) is the best way to enjoy and sample Mozen.  Simply put, it's an exaggerated, fun, foodie tour of Asia.Flavors are very bold and over the top.  Do not expect subtle flavors, hints of this, a wafting aroma of that.  Surprisingly, it all works especially when combining so many strong classic cuisines of Asia.  Some standouts:  Hae-Mul Pa-Jeon (Korean pancake filled with shrimp and lump crab); what's not to love.Beef Carpaccio with a mixed mushroom "chutney" drizzled with a soy ginger vinaigrette; sweet beefy goodness explodes against the earthy foil.Steamed grouper topped with cilantro and scallions; moist and delicious.Singapore Chili crab made with a soft shell crab; sweet and spicy.Galouti Kebab (smoked, minced lamb with classic Indian spices and a mint chutney); deep earthy richness with a bright herbaceous finish.Very well chosen wine list.  Vegas resort prices.Service is excellentGreat concept.  Highly recommended.Spring Restaurant Week 2013I absolutely adore this place. I wish I had more reasons to visit the Mandarin Oriental just so I can eat here more often. When my girlfriends suggested we try lunch here for Restaurant Week, I was excited. Mozen definitely lived up to all its great reviews!For this week, our lunch was served very elegantly in these bento boxes:Murgh MakhaniGarlic NaanSalmon CrudoMiso Mustard New York AngusCalifornia RollMatcha TiramisuWe also ordered ala carte off their regular menu:Wasabi PrawnsThai Green CurryThe Salmon Crudo was served like a tartar and it was amazing. It melted in your mouth. My girlfriends ate the steak and said it was deliciously tender. We all devoured the wasabi prawns and green curry. Those were the highlights, but everything was tasty and yummlicious!The service is what you'd expect from a place like Mozen. Our server was very friendly and helpful, even when we took a while selecting our ala carte dishes. The staff came by regularly to refill and pour our green tea. At the end of our meal, they brought out a small complimentary dessert, Raspberry Coulis, which was very nice. I can't wait to try more items on their menu. If you're looking to have a great elegant lunch with amazing Asian-influenced food, plus sit in a nice cafe with a nice view, this is your place.FYI: They also provide a great gluten-free, vegan, and lightfare menu.Jazz brunch, complete with a guitarist and bass player. Served 12-2:30pm Sundays only. We made a reservation, not knowing how busy they would be, when we showed up, we were surprised to see not as many people as we anticipated being there. First thing when I was seated in the booth, I immediately noticed a cluster of white hairs and old dried skin flakes right next to me. I wanted to vomit. Grandma had not only left behind the free newspaper they offer, but she also left behind her DNA. The server was apologetic and cleaned it up, then offered me a black napkin in exchange for the white one on the table (bonus point, I had a black dress on). This is a non-traditional style brunch. Going over the menu selection, you can either choose between doing just the AYCE serve yourself brunch for $45, or you can do the AYCE, in addition to entrees (Hong Kong Style Grouper, Belgium Waffle with caramel pecan cream, some of the offerings) for $58. They have a ramen station, along with what they were calling dim sum, there were only two available, pork bun and shrimp shiu mai. A salad station with different offerings like, caprese, waldorf, mediterranean, pasta, etc. A small charcuterie and cheese board (my cheese was hard at the ends) as well as crab claws and what they were calling Kumamoto oysters (I don't think they were Kumamoto) and chilled shrimp, as well as some sushi rolls that were about grocery store quality. My favorite station happened to be the fruits. They had lambootan, dragonfruit and my favorite, passion fruit. Dessert station had mostly parfait type offerings, with some cake pops and one truffle and different creme puffs. In addition, they offer "free flowing" Veuve Clicquot for another $35 or mimosas for $19 (this is in addition to the cost of brunch).Service was less than stellar. I had to continually ask for refills on my coffee and water, she didn't come around often. I left disappointed. I've had way better brunches in town and at this price point, you can do better.The constant changing menu of MOzen continues to amaze me. In particular, I enjoyed eating the Mason Jar, which had smooth potato foam, creamy spinach and flavorful mushroom. The chef's flexibility of removing ham and bacon to meet my dietary restriction was appreciated. My friend also loved the fact that MOzen uniquely used baguette to create crunchy French toasts. Although the service is slightly slow, the great food and the tranquil environment make MOzen the perfect place for brunch in Vegas.I have just found the best Asian fusion brunch in Vegas! We wanted a nice brunch but didn't want to go far, Mandarin Oriental is walking distance from Aria, so MOzen it is! We got seated at a window seat with beautiful views of partial Aria hotel and Crystals. We chose Perrier Jouet brut flowing champagne for $35 per person over mimosa for $20 per person, figured a couple glasses of that would worth a bottle already, so why not. Brunch is buffet style with a choice of entree, there are quite a few good entree items on the menu. The buffet:Appetizers: sushi, salads, cold soup, ceviche, fresh Fanny bay and Kumamoto oysters, king crab claws, fresh shrimps, smoked salmon, assorted cheese and grilled vegetables. Live station: dim sum, strip loin, noodle soup and roasted vegetables. Dessert station: fruits, mini cakes, cup cakes, mousses, creme brûlée, macaroons and many more. We didn't try most of them, both hubby and I are not big fan of sweets. But it was really dessert heaven for dessert lovers! Also many kinds of sauces such as cocktail sauce, Chinese red vinegar and XO sauce, even chimichurri sauce! I ordered Makhani as entree, asked for tofu instead of chicken, garlic naan was so yummy, the curry was bomb! I never like curry, especially Indian curry, but that was so good, very light with amazing flavors! Hubby had scallops with pork dumplings in tomato broth. He loved the tender and flavorful scallops as well.The noodle station was exceptionally good! The fish broth was light with amazing flavors, many freshest ingredients to choose, I just added rice noodles and veggies, regardless how simple that noodle soup was, it was definitely the best noodle soup I have ever had! Hubby liked the chicken broth a lot too. The strip loin was so juicy and tender, perfect rare plus just the way hubby liked it, The brunch food was FANTASTIC with too many good things, hard to believe it's buffet food! The service was top notch, our waitress was extremely attentive and friendly, kept our champagne glasses full the entire time. This was no doubt the best brunch I have ever had in a very long time! It doesn't get any better than this, so relaxing and pleasant! I think for $64 per person, if you don't want champagne, that's a pretty good deal for what you get! MOzen is now our go to brunch spot whenever we are in Vegas!Simplicity at its finest.Walking in I thought to myself where is everything? No art? No decor? It seemed so bare. Everything is the same color and blends into each other.Once the experience began and the service was extraordinary with multiple staff members making us feel like the most important people in the room. After a long day at work and traffic on the strip this really made us all just feel so damn good. It was also genuine and not pretentious. It felt as if they appreciated us choosing to dine with them and I have to point this out because it really made the entire experience that much more special.So the food was perfection. Not only did it look appealing to the eye but it tasted just as good as it looked! Every little detail was thoughtful and I couldn't believe that everything I tried I wanted more of. I began with the sushi combo which was presented like art. I also had the tandoori chicken which was perfect (climax moment). And all of this was followed by a very simple mango tapioca which once again hit the spot (back to back climaxes). I don't even love mangos and I would have licked this up if it wasn't completely inappropriate! Sweet, tart, creamy and crispy little nuggets for an amazing texture experience! I also tasted my friends Beijing duck salad that was so simple but packed with flavor and the skirt steak which was cooked to tender perfection with some of the juiciest & sweetest tomatoes. Everything was so flavorful yet so simple with beautiful presentations. I was also so relaxed and just enjoying myself. My brain went back to why this place was bare. Its designed to put people at ease and you forget about the chaos in your everyday life. Simple, sleek and elegant is what this place is all about. I loved it. I need to make an effort to simplify my world and have less shit in it just like this design.
Golden Corral Family Steak House=This place just opened recently, so we decided to give it a shot. I've eaten at several of these over the years, while traveling, and they've always been at least okay.For what it is, this one is awesome! No, it's not a gourmet restaurant, it's a steakhouse with a buffet. They serve cafeteria style. It's aimed at families with a lot of mouths to feed.  The parking lot was well lit, and FULL on a Friday night. They had a cordial rent-a-cop outside directing traffic and greeting people in the cold. We expected a wait, but there was none. We got in line, got our drinks, and went through the check out, in about two minutes. The four of us ate dinner tonight for about $36... two adults, two 11-year-olds. Right away, our server led us to our table.  We immediately visited the salad bar. Everything I saw was fresh, and well-refreshed, too. The presentation was the best I've seen in one of these places. There is a big variety of fresh veggies, fruits, cheeses, meats and dressings. I usually fill up on salad at these places, so I don't overdo it on the other stuff, but... I did, on all counts. That's the only problem with places like this --- WAY too many temptations! For entrees, they had many good choices of grilled meats, fish, Asian style dishes, pizza, home-style cooked vegetables... something for everyone. Some things were better than others, but nothing was bad. I tried the barbecue (pulled pork) and found it a little smokey sweet, but tasty. The applewood bacon-wrapped pork loin was a little dry, but delicious. Applewood bacon-wrapped scallops were better. My wife had a small bacon-wrapped filet she really liked. Oh, don't forget to try the yeast rolls. You can smell them baking while driving down North Tryon street!The kids found plenty of things to eat, and my son who had wanted to go to the Taco Bell down the street (!) decided he was more than happy with Golden Corral instead. The server came by attentively, refreshing soft drinks and water and bringing us coffee, since it was cold beside the window (27 degrees outside!).What can I say? It is what it is... a great place for a family to strap on the feed bag. Healthy? Meh. It can be. You just have to make the right choices. There are enough. As for us, we made the mistake of hitting the extensive dessert bar... Sampling peanut butter cookie coated with chocolate and whipped cream, chocolate layer cake, peanut encrusted fudge, ice cream, and other goodies had us waddling out of there knowing we would be back, but sparingly.I'd give them five stars for people moving, four and a half stars for table service, two stars for climate control, three stars for seating arrangements, and three and a half stars for the food. They get four stars for variety, and overall, four stars for experience with reference to the "Platonic Form" of this concept of a restaurant. Well above average execution!
Popeyes=Was having a hankering for comforting, fast food and I was exhausted after working for 12 hours so what better way than Popeyes!I've visited this location via drive-thru and inside, found service to be actually good for a fast food place. In terms of the people working they have been pleasant and quick. I've been all about the $5 box which comes with either two pieces of chicken or three tenders and two sides of your choice and a biscuit. I got the Spicy Tenders with Mash, Mac & Cheese and Cajun Fries before. The Tenders are so juicy, tender and with a crispy, crunchy exterior. The mash is always my favorite, the mac tastes premade (noodles are mush) and the Cajun Fries tasted way too stale for my liking. The biscuits are so good and I was lucky enough to grab some fresh ones that were just slathered with butter. The Sweet Tea is pretty good too, though not as good as Raising Cane's or Lolo's.The chicken here is spot on and great for the price. Definitely easy on the wallet if you're a college student like myself!
Marcella's Italian Kitchen=4 stars means I'm a fan, and yes Id agree with that. However what is putting them from a solid 3 to a 4 is the value and service. Seriously, a chopped or caesar salad for 3.95? 5-7pm Happy Hour that includes half off starters, pizzas, and glasses of wine, wow, for real! So with that being said we had a great time at Marcella's, yes folks a chain, but a decent chain with only a few locations in Ohio. The straight forward menu makes for easy navigation and the helpful suggestive service was more than enough to make decisions easy. Okay, we kinda freaked out when  we heard the half off starts and pizzas.. we ordered way to much but was so worth it. Started with the meaty Sicilian pizza, topped with Capacola, Salami, Meatballs, Asiago Cheese, Red Onion, which was probably my favorite. The crust was thin and crunchy and all of the flavors of the meats and cheese really were balanced so I could taste each with one bite after the next.Beef Carpaccio was a close runner up with its thinly shaved rare beef, toasted capers and wild arugula. The flavors were bright thanks in part to the lemon aioli.The Braised Veal Meatball was so light and tender I wanted to order another as my entree rather than the Gnocchi con Bolognese . The problem with the gnocchi was the gnocchi themselves. Kind of like eating raw biscuit dough, but the lamb bolognese was simple and delicious. The Chicken Parmesan was served how I like to eat with both alfredo & tomato sauce. My only wish is that it had just a bit more sauce so I could use the house ciabatta to sop up the extra. Desserts are kept simple like the rest of the menu so we shared with Cherry Crustada. The crust was light and flaky, the cherries filling slightly tart and the ice cream rich and creamy, *pant pant* yum!This was certainly a pleasant experience with a welcoming laid back feel, generous portions and affordable pricing. Oh yes, they also use Opentable.com for free online reservations, so yes, I'm definitely a fan!!!Had another excellent meal here and was able to try many different item. The Melted Pecorino Cheese ($9.50) was wonderful. Melty cheese, fresh sliced granny smith apples, crostini and honey made for many different tastes and contrasts with each bite. For my entree I tried the Fettuccine & Meatball ($13.95) which was a different take on the classic. Their alfredo sauce tasted fresh and bold, plus the fist sized meatball was so tender it barely held its shape. Fantastically delicious!They also get their house bread from Arizona Bread Company, which was light, soft and had just the right amount of chewy crustiness. I dig this place, haven't had a bad time yet! Though the service was a bit off this last time. We seemed to be blown off once another table was sat next to us, we still had a great time.BTW.. if you're having trouble finding parking, there is a garage just west of the restaurant to an underground parking facility.12/11/09First visit was with fellow Yelper Violeta H.  I arrived earlier, so I waited for her at one of the tables out at the heated patio.  Nice space, though I didn't like the fact that my view of the cozy bar area was blocked from the table that I was first taken to, so I requested to be moved closer.  No problem.  I also found that some areas in the patio can be private (as in you're hidden from street view), so if that's what's important to you, be sure to canvas the area so that you may request your spot!As V. already pointed out, we did have a problem w/ the dirty appetizer plate.  I had to use the women's restroom while we waited for the food to arrive, and when I came back, Violeta was already snacking on complimentary bread and butter on a very attractive blue and yellow print saucer plate.  There were many varied styles stacked beneath a pizza stand, so I rifled through a few before finding one that matched hers.  Wouldn't you know it that the one I chose was one of two that had grime on?  V's plate seemed clean enough, but the third from the top, as well as mine (which was second from the bottom of about 7 or 8 stacked) had oily smudges on them- mine looked like a schmear of butter.  :(  Needless to say, I didn't even try the bread, and Violeta dropped her piece when I showed her my plate...And yes, the wine was served in a whiskey glass (looking at whiskey glass varieties on nextag.com for comparison as I'm typing this).  Call me old-fashioned, but I like my Cab served in a Cab wine glass!Now let's get to the pizza!  The happy hour menu features a few wines by the glass at discounted prices, most of the pizzas half-off, as well as some of the appetizers at lower prices.  Today, she ordered the roasted chicken (HH $6.25) and I the four cheese (HH $4.95).  Both pizzas were very good!  So good, that despite the dirty plates' incident, I came back the ff. Tuesday for another HH jaunt- stay tuned for an update soon!  (The roasted chicken pizza came w/ parmesan onions, gorgonzola, and apricots, while the four cheese came w/ mozz, asiago, gorgonzola, and provolone.)   Before I forget, V and I ended our meal w/ a Cherry Crostada (w/ almond crumble and Ciao Bella honey-vanilla gelato.  We thought it charming that our server split our dessert into two plates!!  BTW, as it was the Christmas season, Marcella's was selling gift cards that came w/ bonus gift cards.  $100' worth or more netted you an extra $25.  The original gift card could be used any time and for any food and alcohol purchase, while the $25 bonus had to be used at a later date and could not be used for the purchase of alcoholic beverages. Women's restroom was spacious!  There's a table w/ hairspray, a couple of lotions, and maybe even some mouthwash to help yourself to.  The dispenser held powdered soap, which I happily perceived as something akin to a sugar scrub (it was dark in there, and my hands were already wet before the soap landed on them, so I just felt the "beads"), but another customer said, in what sounded like a disapproving voice, that it was powdered soap, "just like what I used to use back in grade school."  Just goes to show you that "one man's treasure is another's man's trash..."04/15/103.5 stars.Weather was beautiful, so we asked for patio seating.  Took advantage of the happy hour menu to try Mom's all-time favorite appetizer, calamari (!), which we haven't tried here, yet.  We also ordered an apple salad.  Service was quick and friendly.The apple salad was fantastic!  Chockful of mixed greens, crunchy Granny Smith apple slices, and candied walnuts and topped w/ gorgonzola and sherry vinaigrette, it was large enough for two!  We were almost too full to try the calamari.  One look at the app, and we knew it would be a winner.  The calamari was very good-- lightly battered and nicely crisped.  Not too greasy.  We also enjoyed the fried zucchini and LEMON slices that came w/ the calamari!Four stars for the entire experience had the calamari been a little less salty.11/02/10Had an amazing happy hour, complete w/ dessert, here today!  Started off w/ red wine, an Apple salad, and Tuscan cheese board, and ended w/ a chocolate almond cake!  Service was quick and efficient, although it could've been a bit friendlier...  Don't know why they keep it so dark indoors-- 4:30p and it felt and looked like it was two hours later!I've had the Apple salad a few times before, so it's a fave when I dine here.  It's the first time I've had the cheese board, though, and I loved it!  On the dinner menu for $9.95, it only cost me $6 during happy hour and was comprised of an aged goat, a pecorino, and a gorgonzola dolce, a garnish of apricot jam, some apple slices, red grapes, and bread rounds.  The gorgonzola was the creamiest of the three, and the most pungent-- LOVED it!  The aged goat was semi-soft, was easily spreadable on bread rounds, and paired well w/ the apricot jam the best.  The pecorino was the hardest of the three cheeses, the saltiest, and paired well w/ the granny smith apple slices and red grapes.  A well-rounded platter that satisfied all of the basic tastes (salty, sweet, sour. and bitter), minus the umami element.  The topper of this most excellent meal was the chocolate almond cake!  Alternating layers of almond-scented and chocolate cake, w/ layers of chocolate ganache between each cake layer, and then topped w/ more chocolate ganache, plus warm ganache on the plate, and sprinkled w/ toasted almonds!!  The almond cake layers were my favorite, as they definitely had the essence of almond throughout-- the chocolate layers didn't have any almond flavor at all.  I checked.  And checked again.  Nope-- the wonderful almond-goodness I enjoyed was in the light cake layers!  The warmed chocolate ganache and crunchy toasted almonds just sent me over the moon!  I'm so giddy now just thinking about it!The photos included don't do this meal great justice.  BTW, I loved the cake so much, I ate that much AT THE TABLE.  I polished the rest off on the ride home!  :Dno to the foodno to the service no to the pricesno to the way.
Gino's Coast To Coast=Ready to pack my bags and start my new life as a fly on the wall in this fantastic establishment I stumbled upon completely by accident. It all started when 2 non-yelpers (the nerve!) and I were a touch under the weather (re: hungover) and driving around aimlessly looking for a place to have a boozy brunch up in North Phoenix. It was literally by the grace of God that we were brought to Gino's. According to my GPS, we had arrived at Ollie's Omlette House. After our retarded asses drove around an empty complex for god knows how long, we finally all agreed upon the fact that Ollie's Omlette house was no more and Gino's had taken it's place. No longer willing to drive another foot, we decided to walk in to Gino's and give it a shot.How freakin pumped were we that we did?!? I'm actually going against my better judgment even telling you about the goldmine that is Gino's, because at first I was tempted to keep this treasure trove all to my greedy little self. However, in the spirit of Yelp, I've decided to share.Upon first glance of Gino's, it looks like a little beat up diner with a bunch of New York paraphernalia scattered all over the walls in the most depressingly dead shopping complex I have ever seen. I'm talking closed store after closed store after closed store. Thankfully, the depressing exterior dissipates the second you walk in. The entire staff is laughing, joking around, coming over to the tables and sharing their war stories from the night before, friendly as all hell and straight up hilarity.The prices were retarded cheap. My entire breakfast, which consisted of eggs, bacon, hash browns and toast was $3.99. Three freakin dollars and 99 cents!! Cheaper than Denny's/IHOP and other look alikes...oh, and I could order a big fat cocktail with it. Not beer, not wine, liquor baby. WIN!!!Upon further examination, I saw that they had insane specials like my breakfast going on every single day/night of the week. Like Thursday night Ladies Night which consists of $1 you call-its for the ladies. Be honest, how long has it been since you've heard of a bar doing dollar you call-its?? A long ass time, that's for sure. But that's not where it ends. I want to say Monday night was some crazy thing like $3.99 all you can eat pasta and Wednesday nights were $7.99 half rack of ribs night or something ludicrous like that.The best part of this all, even better than the rock bottom food and drink prices, was that the food was actually pretty darn tasty and the drinks were poured STRONG! The owner Gino came over and hung out and shot the shit with us for a while during our brunch, telling us about a couple parties he's hosted there, including NYE where he provided transportation to and from the bar for every single patron, regardless of where they live and completely free of charge. How's that for some old-fashioned hospitality? I am calling it now. This is my new Cheers. This bar/restaurant embodies everything I feel like most places I frequent lack. Good people, good food, good drinks all at a price I can actually afford?? I always thought places like this were just rumor and too good to be true, but Gino's, you've made a believer out of me.The owner greeted me at my car door with a giant umbrella to escort me inside the restaurant while it was raining...ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! Georgie S. wasn't kidding when she said this place is a fantastic establishment. Its totally in a shitty strip mall and from the outside looks like an old greasy diner, but let me tell you friends, looks can certainly be deceiving, and in this instance, they totally 100% completely are. I visited last Sunday on the rainiest day in the universe. The first thing I saw when I walked in was a bowl of Jelly Bellys, and if you know anything about me, you know I love me some jelly beans. Spoon full for me, Handful for you. We asked for a booth, so they quickly got one ready and seated us, all the while shooting the shit and laughing with us about something or other. They have this whole New York theme going which made me happy reminiscing on my days living in the city. Sports memorabilia, license plates, photos and everything else you can think of that represents The Empire State were hanging or scattered around. The menu is out of this world. $3 mimosa's & BM's.. full bar, everything from Hot Dogs to Breakfast Burritos to Turkey Subs to Philly cheese steaks and so on and so on.. a little piece of everything you'd find from a street vendor in NYC.. and that by no means is a shot at their food. New York City vendors sell some of the most delicious culinary creations in the universe. Our waiter was super attentive and of course, I asked him what his favorite thing was. Bam. The Philly Cheese Steak, so I order one. This bitch of a sandwich was HUGE. It was like a Philly Cheese mountain, and holy cheesy steaky mushroomy oniony Batman it was delicious. Georgie S. was clearly being a fat kid that day and proceeded to order 4 things. Chicken fingers, mozzarella sticks, a hot dog and, dammit, I don't remember the last thing. The Canadian went with the most boring thing on menu and got bacon and eggs.. But what does he know? Canada is useful only to provide me with furs and I don't even wear that shit anyway, so I guess that means its really good for nothing. (just kidding. (not really)). Everything was tasty and perfect for the hangovers we were all battling. This place is nothing fancy and is certainly not crap. I loved everything about it from start to finish, including the bill, which was about $40 for 3 people including 2 drinks each. Not bad Gino's. Not bad at all. See you soon, rain or shine!
Bad Daddy's - Charlotte=I decided to try them out for lunch because they got a lot of recommendations for their salad. However, looking at their menu, I could not resist a burger. Being that I am on a very low carb diet, I decided to go with a lettuce wrapped Bacon Cheeseburger with a Small Salad on the side. It was hard though, because I REALLY wanted Texas Toast! It looks yummy in other pictures. Walking in to pick up my order, being my 1st time, I didn't know where to go. But standing there at the podium, waitresses would look at me and keep doing whatever they were doing. It wasn't a lot of people in the place at the time & so this annoyed me. I just decided to go to the bar since that's where most restaurants serve pickup orders. They were indeed able to help me there.I'd never done a lettuce wrapped burger before so I was really nervous on how this would turn out. However, I did not regret my decision! It was delicious! I was most nervous about the lettuce being soggy resulting in a messy burger, but they give you fresh crispy lettuce. It held together fine, even when I added my sauces. Those burger pattys have so much flavor. Normally, I don't eat a lot of bacon on my food. Actually I don't eat a lot of bacon period. When I do I'd rather have it alone with grits and eggs. But that was seriously the best bacon i'd ever tasted. It was sliced to the best thickness and fried perfectly. It had a hint of sweetness and you could taste the apple smokiness in it. I took it off my burger and ate it separately after I finished. Saved the best for last. Don't judge me. I mean what are ya'll doing to that bacon? Can I order a supply? I could eat that bacon all.... ok I went on a bit of a bacon rant. Let me snap out of it. So out of curiosity I tried the Garlic Mayo, BBQ Sauce & the Bad Daddys Sauces. Then they were all so good I couldn't decide which to put on my burger. So I stared at my burger for 5 minutes evaluating my taste buds. I ended up going with the Garlic Mayo & BBQ. But I took the Bad Daddys Sauce home to eat with my chicken breast I cooked for dinner. Can't let good sauce go to waste. On to the salad which was also delicious. I've definitely found my new salad spot. You can choose up to 7 toppings free and after staring at the list for 5 minutes, I finally used all 7. I felt like if I didn't, I was wasting food. I mean some people want 8 toppings and here I am struggling to choose 7. The nerve of me! I would not let my people down. I loved the Broccoli in it. It's like they blanched it with a little flavor because it wasn't completely raw and was tasty! That little salad gave me everything I needed! It was so fresh & that balsamic was one of the best i've ever tasted! Bad Daddy's definitely has a new regular customer!
Jen Buffet=Holy delicious buffet batman! I was in the area saturday night with a plan to eat at either pacific seafood buffet or this brand spanking new zen buffet.I have horrible self made luck in that my free meal is always in the evenings. Sadly most Chinese buffets fall apart quality wise for dinner. This is horrible considering they are almost always twice as expensive. I had previously scoped out pacific seafood buffet and knew that it looked good for dinner. I stopped here and had a list of things that I absolutely wanted to be happy that evening.This place was PACKED and that means fresh food when it comes to buffet land. The selection of items here is huge. They have 6 or 7 hot tables, plus a table for grilled goods, and a table for Mongolian BBQ fixings. The trays were also on the smaller side so they were replenished more often.Everything I tried here was good. That's not to say the best I've tried but to try 15+ different items and enjoy them all is saying a lot. Especially for my food snobby self.Trays of food were being replaced constantly. Everything was hot and fresh and not swimming in grease. They ran out of BBQ pork ribs which made me sad but was quickly remedied when a brand new scalding hot pile showed up within 10 minutes.The only disappointing factor of this buffet was the dessert selection. Both gourmet honk kong buffet and pacific have better dessert selections. Honk Kong has higher end pastries and cakes. Pacific has the tubs of the real ice cream. These guys had the standards:Something with coconut (sadly not macaroons or I would have had a tear of joy)Lemon/Chocolate Cake(Costco Style)Puffy PastryCubed Espresso CakeSelf Serve Frozen Yogurt MachineThey did have a nice selection of fresh cut fruit.I believe it is safe to say out of the higher end Chinese buffets in town this is #1 or a close tie for #1/#2.Sorry for the lack of pictures but the drive took so long I was starving and pictures lost priority over a grumbling stomach.
Waffles Cafe=Word is they shop for fresh ingredients locally three times a week to hand make quality waffles daily.  It sure tasted like it!  I had the pumpkin waffle with Nutella topping.  Light crunch on the outside and fluffy inside.  I also enjoyed the original waffle with whipped cream, powdered sugar, and topped with caramel sauce.  My waffle was part of a breakfast special which came with eggs, bacon, and unlimited coffee....Perfect way to start the day!  It felt a little stuffy in this small cafe, but I got used to it.  Staff was very polite and helpful, especially with the free wi-fi.  I've got my eye on the waffle sandwiches or the waffle pizza for my next visit.For the 3 years that I've lived and worked in this area - I finally decided to come here for my birthday breakfast. I have no idea why I haven't come here before. I remember someone telling me that it was "ok" and it's "just waffles". No sir, this is not just waffles. These are delightful, crispy, amazing waffles. I love them so much, so so so much. I got the organic waffle with -StrawberriesPeanut ButterChocolate ChipsBananasAlmonds - I used the sugar free syrup, and to my surprise, it was amazing. They do have real maple syrup if you're looking for a sugar high. I really could not get over how good these were. Probably because I'm on pretty strict clean diet and I don't have too many amazing cheat meals like this. But good god...It was worth it. The service was awesome - the only thing is they forgot my kiwi's...but I don't even care. I really don't. If you drive by this place and you're wondering if you should try it out, yes. You should. Especially if you're a waffle lover, like myself.I'm pretty sure this concept came from the, "high-dea" jar. I mean savory waffle sandwiches? Excuse me Cheech, your order is ready. The decor in here definitely needs updating and some style, it sort of feels like you're eating in the teacher's lounge of an elementary school. Nothing here really makes you want to stay and hang out, just finish your meal and bounce. Good thing decor doesn't diminish my appetite or I would be about 30lbs lighter, seriously Vegas you need a major overhaul when it comes to restaurant style and atmosphere. The waffles here are good, lightly sweetened which went well with the salty breakfast options. I ordered the Waffle Breakfast Sandwich; sausage, ham, eggs and cheese. This was definitely a meal, the portion was huge and filling, but doesn't leave you wanting more. It's like watching an "OK" movie; you've already forgotten the main character's name ten minutes after it's over. One more thing about this meal, it's served with a side of Ruffles potato chips, huh? How about side of syrup or a sweet jam for dipping? The service is very good and fast, but I'm assuming that's because they cooked my meal with a microwave. I mean when you can hear the beeps and clicks of the radiation machine in back and your food comes out piping hot within five minutes of it being ordered... ugh.The food was good, the service was good, and nothing was remotely close to great. I feel like there's a real lack effort with Waffles Cafe, they're doing the bare minimum and giving the bare minimum. A new coat of paint, waffles made to order and maybe a few special touches to the menu and this place could easily have a higher rating and possibly become more of a hangout spot. Waffles Cafe you're so close.
MIX 94.1's Bite Of Las Vegas=I came across this event while browsing Yelp for stuff to do. I was somewhat disbelieving when I finished reading the advert for this food festival and they tagged on to the end, almost as an afterthought, that there would be a bit of live music...including Ed Sheeran! The line up changed a few times (originally Alanis Morisette was appearing) and I was waiting for Sheeran's name to disappear too. I checked again before leaving for the event, his name was still there, due to play towards the end of the 11-9 day.Having parked for free, in the quickly filling field across the road, I walked into the Desert Breeze Park for a minimal fee of $15. This was obviously well advertised, most of the area in front of the stage was already a patchwork of blankets. The smell of food immediately made me hungry. Every 20 yards brought a new aromatic assault; barbeque, asian, burgers. Each stall had to have dishes for $5 or less...many were $3. These were all tasters from local restaurants, stall holders talked about their restaurant and gave out tickets for 20% off when you next eat there.After eating my body weight in garlic chicken and rice I went to find a position at the front of the growing crowd by the stage (using my freshly garlicked breath to my advantage). It seemed everyone there was waiting for Sheeran to take to the stage, the organisers obviously knew this and put on the less popular bands first. It was becoming a battle of wills...who would give up their spot in the blazing sun to bathe their heads, for a moment, in the relative coolness of the shade? I gave up...two more acts to go...I found a large truck to sit under and guzzle water, but on hearing the crowd roar I was able to squeeze into, maybe, the third row back. Ed Sheeran is AMAZING! He was just on stage for 25 minutes (10minutes more than I banked on) but it was totally worth it.This event was real treat. The food was great, the guys on the stalls weren't pushy, the music was awesome. If there was a downside to the day, it was not being able to get out of the sun. Although fans were being handed out for free and you could buy water, I would suggest next year that hats and sun umbrellas be on sale and the limit, of bringing only one bottle of water with you, be lifted. The crowd thinned out a lot after Sheeran and I know, for me, if it had been cooler or more shady, I'd have stuck around for more garlic chicken and rice :)Bite of Las Vegas this year has redeemed Las Vegas food festivals for me. We were blessed with AMAZING weather all day that cooled off in the evening...sooo unlike typical Las Vegas weather. The crew was very well organized and helpful as they really had their stuff together. The parking was relatively painless and traffic entering/leaving moved along without a hitch. Most of the food vendors are local restaurants like Hash House a GoGo, Culinary Dropout, Rainforest Cafe, The Great American Pub etc., but the great part is that they are not food trucks that are slow to deliver, these vendors were very well prepared to handle the crowd and keep the line to a minimum.... something that food truck festivals fail miserable at.Let's start with the ticket prices, which we bought prior to the event for under $20. That gave us the viewing pleasure of 8 artists on stage and access to about 40 food vendors that were priced about $5 per item. What a great deal!Food:Now having experienced some other "food fest", I was a bit soured and didn't expect much from the BLV vendors. I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised, not overwhelmed though, but pleasantly surprised by the food selection and value. We started with Texas de Brazil that offered 3 choices of meats with a roll for $5...garlic sirloin which was melt-in-your-mouth good, sausage was very tasty, the bacon wrapped chicken was actually not bad at all. The roll was a bit dry but a nice addition. All the food was about $5 and portions were decent for a food festival. The Culinary Dropout offered Pretzel bites with cheese fondue with a "happy hour 2 for 1 special"...2 orders of pretzel bites or 1 order with a salmon bruschetta. The pretzel bites were fun and tasty to eat. My daughter tried the salmon bruschetta and liked it. We also had the Hawaiian shaved iced that was perfect to enjoy under the mild Vegas sun. 3 flavors for $5. They had it down to a system where you got your ice pretty quick with generous amount of syrup. Hash House A GoGo is one I would never go eat at again because I think their food is terrible, but they did know how to make a refreshing 3 color Watermelon Kiwi Lemonade that had everyone gawking. H & H BBQ had rib tip fries that were off the hook delicious. Generous amounts of tender BBQ rib tips atop natural cut fries...I would have loved seconds on this. The Great American Pub had lobster mac & cheese and crab fries. I don't usually like anyone else's mac & cheese other than my own but GAP had a pretty good version that we all enjoyed. Creamy cheese sauce, not overly cheesy with bright hints of green onion and crispy bread crumb topping...and it had actual pieces of lobster. I think I would go to GAP to get this again. The crab fries were ok. I don't know where they came up with crab since the white sauce didn't have any crab in it, but still a nice outdoor fest treat.The entertainment was awesome. There were some moments when the bass was a bit too much and caused some of us to loose a filling, but the lineup was great. Lindsey Stirling was our favorite and she delivered a great show. I don't know how one dances around like her and maintains playing the violin. She's one talented gal. OAR was good too. My brother is a Daughtry fan but he wasn't on until 7:30 and the weather was getting cold so we packed up. He said he has the album on iTunes :)All in all, this was a great event that we will look forward to again next year. Just some tips that made our experience that much better was that we came prepared with comfortable cushy folding seats ($19 at Walmart), a large frozen Smart Water bottle for each of us was plenty of hydration to last the day, a collapsible picnic shade tent (at Sears) was perfect to cool off in and the envy of everyone that walked by us. They don't allow outside coolers, but in the event you have special medication for your kids that need refrigeration, they do allow a lunchbox sized cooler to carry it in. I hope next year's weather will be as beautiful as it was that day, but also bring a light hoodie in case it gets cool.Great job Bite of Las Vegas! This was the best Food Festival experience for us.Bite was amazing as always. When I found out they were selling tickets I bought mine and my friends. $15 presale and $25 at the door. PRESALE BABY! We ended up coming around 1pm and just started walking around and eyeing the park and everything that was around. We started out by the Race Now tables and worked our way around. After our first go around our other friends showed up and we started to get into the food. Food Pineapple park- My first stop on the bite road. I wanted the dole whip and I got it! I order the pineapple upside down cake and it was amazing, it reminded me of a shot i order when I first turned 21, not sure why I haven't ordered it since. Texas Twister- First drink stop, We though lemonade and you can refill, why not? And we were a little disappointed. It didn't taste sweet. It was more of a bland lemonade. Only plus was the fruit in the cup, my friends ate it all. Papa Johns- One of the last stops of the night. When you only have $3 left and you need something hot and homey, when papa was the way to go and it was close. Haha, super glad they handed out the garlic sauce. Culinary dropout- Not my first experience with Culinary drop out. They had the sames cheese and bread at the B&W party and it was still as delicious as ever. Panda Express and friends- When over because I saw sushi and was interested. My friends told me it was a bad idea but they were wrong. Probably my favorite meal of the day. They had spam musubi and some cream cheese wontons. They said for a dollar more I could get two egg rolls, so I told them to throw it in the bag. My friends of course stole some but that's why I got them. Rainforest Cafe- Our favorite place to sit and eat. We happen to grab a small table after grabbing some food we needed to st down to eat. They kept the tables clean and they were fill. Claim Jumper- Two of my friends went here and order some sliders and chips, as well as a salad. I of course ate all their chips and a lot of the salad. It was a Cesar salad and it was pretty good. We dipped the chips in the cheese fondue form culinary and it was bomb.com. They also had a guy yelling about double chocolate cookie that were as big as his head.. Very tempting sir. VendorsAfter stuffing ourselves with food we started walking the tents of free things and sign ups. The first stop was State Farm, who I already have insurance for but sign up to win a $250 ft card, I was down. Also they gave out shades, awesome. Next was Toyota. They had iPad to sign  up for stuff and they you spun a wheel for prizes. They had black shades, awesome. Also they had chap stick and hats. Next was KB homes. We literally just went there to get the free cotton candy. It almost blew away when the wind started but i saved it with my mouth. We walked our way the the Metro PCS booth and threw a phone in water to get more shade, purple, awesome. Then checked out the idea image booth. Orange shades, awesome. Then went over the the hospital booth, the had heart clip magnets, sunscreen, stress ball brains, and many different colored shade including pink, awesome. I got a lot of shades now, just saying. MusicMy real reason for going, because lets be honest a $15 is a steal. The line up included Daughtry, Colbie Caillat, O.A.R., American Authors, Lindsey Stirling and The Script. We really were just listening to the first couple bands and didn't actually sit and watch til Colbie. She was wearing shade which I though was funny but I love her song Try. During her set is when I had to get up and try and find a sweater. Her crew had shirt and some long sleeves but no hoodies or anything so we went on a mission to find something to warm me up. We failed. The military hoodies sold out and the race shop said they would get more in a hour. We ended up telling security we were grabbing a jacket and sat in the car til The Script came on. I thought they were so high energy and fun. At one point the lead singer asked for someone to call and ex boyfriend and he took the phone and sang and talked and kept calling back when he hung up. He also wanted to make a moment and ask for everyone to put down the camera and just turn on lighters or lights. I really liked that. He also came into the crowd which was really cool. RandomThe Vegas area was really nice and chill we ended up there multiple times to sit and relax. The best part was right before The Scrip came on they were giving away Tshirts, hats, cards, and dice for your car. The lady was really cool and was trying to make it fun by throwing it over her shoulder. The red couches were comfy and right my grass so you could take your shoes off. Other random was the bathrooms, i mean porta potty. When i went in the early day i grab some TP assume they would run out. I came back later and the potties still seem pretty clean and stock. Also love that they have the sinks to wash hands.It was our first time & definitely not our last!Parking is on gravel & was definitely crowded but no complaints there because the ushers were so helpful! Parking our car & leaving the event was a breeze because it was definitely organized. Loved the food choices!  We were able to try Pineapple Park, Stripburger, Hash House, Sauced, Amore & much more. Our favorite would have to be the single slice Amore pizza that came with water since water was sold separately with other dishes & the fact that we didn't have to buy a whole Amore pizza for $20+. We also loved the Kiwi Watermelonade (?) from Hash House; so refreshing on a sunny day!The weather was definitely perfect on this day! It did get a bit cooler at night & I was not prepared at all. Haha. For $17, I was able to see American Authors & a little of Colbie Caillat! Music was great but we were definitely more fatties & ate continuously throughout. We were unable to stay any longer cause it got too cold for me but I will be prepared next year.Honestly, you don't need VIP treatment (overrated!). We enjoyed walking around, eating vendor foods, standing for the concerts, relaxing on the grass (many spots with shade) and people watching. I would not want to be stuck under a tent for what, $100 or something like that? Pfffft! As my Hawaiian boyfriend always says, "No need brah! No need!" Get in for cheap & enjoy the event. Can't wait for next year! :)I tried more of the food this year (scroll halfway down for more info), but I still mainly went for the music. Bite of Las Vegas delivered on both counts.The weather was ridiculous to start the day, but unlike last year, they managed to keep the bands going pretty much on schedule. I skipped Nick Fradiani and the two local acts, whoever they may have been, but I arrived just in the nick of time for Andy Grammer's start time at 3:10pm. Some of you may be familiar with his popular singles from radio stations such as MIX 94.1. Anyway, he and his band were energetic, and he played a lot of songs that were easy to enjoy in his ~30-minute set, including his current catchy tune "Honey, I'm Good." I also loved his incorporation of loop pedals on one of his tracks, as well as the talk box on his cover of the current Jack U single.A quick reflection on how easy it was to redeem the Groupon (which I got for $10.40 after stacking discounts vs. $16 early pre-purchase). The signs were clear on where to go as long as you read them, and they just waved you through once they scanned your barcode. Interestingly, they didn't bother to check my stuff, so that sealed gallon of bottled water could easily have been an open gallon of vodka, or something even better. Maybe next year...Most of the music was great after that point. Needtobreathe brought a Southern rock sound that I just wasn't feeling, other than their current single "Shelter." Lifehouse killed it though, with energetic playing and spot-on vocals for their first live performance in three months. They played most of their hits, to the delight of fans. Matt Nathanson was also awesome with a cover-filled set and charismatic audience engagement. Finally, Third Eye Blind rocked the headliner spot with old hits and new songs - perhaps a few too many of the latter for some listeners, judging from how I was able to inch closer to the stage every few minutes.I was actually quite surprised after last year at how I was able to get relatively close to the stage with minimal effort if I wanted to. I'm not sure if it was just the broader appeal of last year's acts that led to a massive turnout, the scorching temperatures of this year (what a relief when cloud cover arrived at around 4:45), or if people had other things to do today, but it felt that attendance was down - which is a good thing for the people who did end up showing, including yours truly.I know a lot of you wanna hear about the food, and I finally did get into it. Several chains were present, but I focused on interesting bites from local restaurants, all of which happened to cost $5. Props to everyone for keeping most of the items affordable and allowing for a lot of sampling - I see the point of this event now, despite the lack of high-end restaurants.My first order was a small steak plate from Via Brasil, which was cooked to medium but was tender enough for a plastic knife to do its job. It was seasoned and wasn't too bad aside from the lack of a starch.I also had a sample of Aloha Kitchen's chicken. They were really pushing samples, and the chicken with its extreme tenderness and light sweetness could definitely have been a pick if I'd had fewer other options.Next dish was a ceviche from El Ceviche, a shop that is aiming to open on S. Eastern Avenue in about two weeks. It was actually a nice portion with good chunks of fish, Peruvian corn that wasn't too mushy, red onion, a thick potato slice, and lettuce. I liked it and enjoyed their complementary (yes, the one with an "e") passion fruit juice for $3, which came in a pretty large cup and provided the sweetness to counter the acidity of the ceviche. I think they'll be worth a visit once they've launched their business.I made a final round at around 7pm, at which time the lines had predictably grown. I had found an interesting chicken tikka masala with rice and naan at Mint Indian Bistro's tent, and their line was quite short either due to being overlooked or because they were able to plate quickly. The rice may have been a little bland and dry, but the chicken was excellent and the naan wasn't too bad. I'm interested now in trying their actual restaurant, which probably means that they've succeeded.My final bite was the pumpkin cheesecake ($4) from Lazy Dog Restaurant & Bar, which I realize now is a chain, and yet I really couldn't care less. They had won best dessert of Bite of Las Vegas 2015 earlier, and I can't really argue with the judges on this decision. It was rich and had nice pumpkin flavor, and I had to restrain myself from eating it so that I could share a taste with my friends.Overall, it was a very fun day for at least four of the five senses (not entirely sure about touch). There is good food to be found, and while the music lineup was a step down from last year, the big-name artists generally delivered. Go to Bite of Las Vegas when you can, and hopefully obtain a cheap ticket.Great music and great food! The Bite of Las Vegas has been around for 19 years.  Since I am still fairly new to the area, I have only been twice.  For how affordable it is for tickets, it's hard to pass up.  Located in Desert Breeze Park, it's a nice open area with plenty of room for all of the food vendors.  You can bring in your own chairs, blankets and water.   For less than $20, they put together great musical lineups.  This year(2015) was Lifehouse, Third Eye Blind and Matt Nathanson just to name a few.  My first visit was 2012 with Matchbox twenty and Ed Sheeran.   There are usually about 5-6 acts which makes for a great show.  Various restaurants have booths set up with small plate menus.  Braddah's, Culinary Dropout, Mint Indian Bistro and Shake Shack are just a few of the over 30 vendors.  It's great to try many places for usually about $5 at each place.  I really enjoy this event and would recommend to anyone.  Enjoy the show and definitely enjoy the food!
Papa Ed's Ice Cream=Who knew that in downtown historic Glendale, there lived the most adorable little locally owned ice cream parlor called Papa Ed's?I didn't... until today!I made the thirty minute drive to Glendale from Old Town this afternoon for a meeting and was lucky enough to get a tour of some of the cutest businesses around town.  Papa Ed's was one of them... My friend Danica walked me inside and introduced me Linda, the owner.  For those that aren't lucky enough to have their private tour guide like I was, Papa Ed's is tucked behind the Country Maiden house turned retail store (which happens to be yet another adorable Glendale business that I will review in due time as well).Papa Ed's carries both Shamrock Farms and Dreyer's ice cream... it reminds me of a smaller, more local "Ben and Jerry's" kind of place.  It's bright, colorful and welcoming...While I passed on getting an ice cream today, I did take advantage of their outdoor seating; you see, I had a conference call smack dab in the middle of the afternoon.  It was fun to see people go in and out with their ice cream treats.  There's also plenty of beautiful landscaping right outside their door.Next visit to the area, I'll have to go for an ice cream from Papa Ed's... if you make it there before me, let me know what you think?!
O2 Lounge=A friend said she found this place on google under "dance clubs." Four of us showed up on a Friday night at 11:00 p.m. I'd say there were 30 people in there. They had a DJ playing meh music, smoking patio, darts, pool table, dead dance floor. The bathrooms were clean. I was acting as the designated driver for the night and they do not offer free soda for the DD's, bummer. The crowd was mainly males, really good looking ones, I remember thinking "there are some serious hotties on the West side." The bartender was attentive and nice. It's not a dance club at all, just me and another friend were the only ones that danced the entire night. I played erotic photo hunt on the touch screen at the bar. "Moanz" is top 4 scores.
Le Mont=Haven't been to Lemont in many a year!  Always liked the food and service was impeccable!   Well it hasn't changed!The maitre'd showed our small group to a great table in the corner.  Yes!, what a great view!  Had reservations for a friends birthday...special occasion.  Fun to watch boats on the river, the incline and planes flying over the Northside..oh excuse me, it is now the North Shore.  We did go mid-week so it was not crowded.We had a few kids, ages 11 to 14, and the maitre'd and server were so good at making sure they could order just about anything they wanted.  They had a long list of ideas not on the menu, since everything is made to order.  Fantastic!  Server went way above and beyond, like you would expect at a top notch restaurant.The tables were so sweet!  Shiny table ware and glasses.  Fancy plates and linens, it is nice to dine out.  We ordered some Champagne to start off and waiter made sure to ask about the type we preferred, Brut, Asti or semi???  Great job!Server also suggested we not over order apps, and extras and told us about the roasted tomato that came with our meal.  Started with a couple of apps, escargot alio was so nice with garlic, not seen much anymore but fun to see the kids try!  The crepes fontinia were delicious.Had a classic, the Lemont salad, nice fresh greens served with the Lemont vinaigrete, really enjoyable.  The meal came with assorted fresh bread and was refilled when needed.Had the Veal loin rib chop for two that was cooked perfectly, tender and sweet.  Others had the salmon, New York Strip steak and a special kids spaghetti. Everyone loved their meals and how they were cooked. Managed to get a bite of the spaghetti when the young one next to me keep saying this is better than grandmom's.  It was very good indeed.When you go you have to try the deserts.  We decided to get a couple of the old tried and true cooked tableside so the kids, big kids too, could watch and try deserts they have never seen.  The Baked Alaska and Bananas Foster were sweet and very good, as was the coconut cake.  Deserts were passed around and the Bananas were the fav.Lemont can be a little pricey if you order extras, but not to bad if you stick to the basics, but  you get really good food and service.  This is a top notch place during the week.  What a great experience!I had really wanted to read past the reviews and like this place, but beyond the view, it did not live up to the owner's dream.  Putting their staff in tuxedos was as uncomfortable for me to see as for them to wear.  There was no pedigree in their training, beyond being polite, but polite is not what a tuxedo wears.  "What can I get you guys..."  and the minute a plate was near empty, a tuxedo would reach over you and yank it away.  You had to time your eating.I had an appetizer of escargot, and although generous in the portion, they were tasteless.  It needed seasoning, garlic, oil, butter, and white wine.For dinner, I ordered Cavatappi Shrimp Natural.  Again, generous on the shrimp but tasteless.  It was pasta with shrimp. My wife ordered a glass of house chardonnay and could not get past the first sip.  I tasted it and it was , honestly, undrinkable and I love finding cheap French wines. We had to get a $85 dollar William Hill Chardonnay to get through dinner.  Seriously ridiculous (400% markup)  My wife ordered their Hearts of iceberg appetizer with the hot bacon vinaigrette but it was so vinegary it was hard to eat and she could not finish it.  For diner she had the Coq au vin, but again--lack of seasoning.All in all, it was so overpriced and under-delivered.  I felt really bad for the young couple at the adjoining table, hopefully they were overwhelmed with the view to make up for the lack of delight in dinner.  If this place wants to survive, ditch the tuxedos, lower the prices dramatically and season the food.  The chef needs a pallet for seasoning, or is being held back by the owner.The place was not very crowded.I love the Holidays. What I don't love is spending hours cooking and cleaning for Thanksgiving dinner. Not to mention every time I do try and cook I can't get my turkey to be anything but dry. This year I chose this lovely restaurant for my families celebration.Pulling up there was a bit of a line outside but it went fairly quickly. We were seated quickly and our waiter was at our table within seconds.  The restaurant is very beautiful with crystal chandeliers a wonderful view of the city and the holiday decorations just added to it. The Thanksgiving setup here is buffet style and it's separated into 3 areas. First there are sides with some note worthy ones being the pumpkin bisque, cheese tortellini and asparagus. The stuffing was good but the mashed potatoes weren't that great at all. Then there is the carving station with turkey ham and roasted fillet.  All were tender and juicy. Finally there is the dessert area. There were so many options. Tarts, cakes, pies, fruits and more. I tried the cheese cake, pumpkin roll and creme brûlée . They were all great. I wish I could have tried more. I also must mention the service. Our waiter was always present but not over bearing. Never once was I without a drink and empty plates were never on the table for more then a min. He was also great with my son and so were the rest of the staff he interacted with. This might just become a yearly tradition. It was great over all.
The Flame Steakhouse=So-so, even for the El Cortez. I was expecting something super-old-school, slightly dumpy-yet-ironically-cool. What I got was the Cleveland Holiday Inn!Atmosphere is SEVERELY lacking here. There are TVs scattered throughout, I guess so you can watch the game while eating...but they end up lending a very coffee-shop keno vibe. Decor is pretty much nil. Overall a pretty depressing miasma of middle-of-the-roadness smothers any sort of excitement or romance you may be trying to celebrate here.Service was fine, food was meh. I had roasted chicken with mushrooms, which was pretty good, but my friend had the trout almondine which was very dry and lacking any sort of aesthetic presentation whatsoever. We also shared a Caesar salad, which was average.The prices are OK....but not really, considering the grim atmo and complete lack of fun here. You would be much better off going to Binion's Steakhouse down the street, which is a MILLION times cooler, in terms of ambiance.
Revo Burrito=Why am I giving four stars to a place with veggie burritos worthy of only three? Well.... EVERYTHING ABOUT REVO MADE ME HAPPY.- Free chips and salsa galore. With free refills. Did I mention the word "free?"- Friendly, spunky staff. I was indecisive about choosing a salsa, so they gave me two of both kinds.- Hooks for purses and coats under the tables - innovative, classy and functional.- 100% vegan, filling veggie burritos for seven bucks.- Funkyfresh decor that's reminiscent of... well, nothing really. It's all over the place. In a nice way.- Bathrooms with life-sized images of scantily-clad beach babes and guys on the walls. - Without my asking, waiter took my reusable water bottle and filled it for me before I left. That, my comrades, coworkers, and esteemed colleagues, is how you earn an extra star.
Pasta and Sugo=It's a good thing when places like this open their doors.  You've got to take your hat off, or in other words support, local purveyors who introduce our communities to pure artisan craft.  The pasta is great, the owners skilled and authentic, and they are yet another poster child for the growing "think/buy local" movement.No more store bought Barilla for me...and hopefully you too.I came across this place because I would pass it everyday...finally I had to stop and try it...they only offer certain sauces and raviolis everyday and gnocchi...but everything is great...it's all made from scratch and the owner is very sweet...it is very authentic and delicious...you can bring pasta and sauce home too,,,they have odd hours and sometimes have very limited selection but it's awesome...the owner lived in Italy for years and really knows her stuff!
Mijana=To put it succinctly, the service at Mijana bordered on the comically absurd.  Before weaving this narrative, I will disclaim that it blows my mind that after years of being in business (and countless reviews attesting to the sub-par service) that there has been little to no improvement in that department.Our party arrived for "International Night" at 7p on a Sunday night.  (The second Sunday of each month this restaurant hosts a few performers/acts from varying parts of the world.  Tonight we got to enjoy Brazilian Samba, Egyptian Bellydance, and Spanish Flamenco.  The entertainment was wonderful!Upon our arrival, the restaurant was less than half empty.  I noticed three servers and the manager/owner in attendance.  As we were seated we immediately asked for a high chair for our toddler.  That high chair arrived about an hour and a half later.   It probably took 15 minutes before we received menus.  No drink orders were taken, no waters brought to the table  (They arrived about a half hour later).We had been seated for about twenty minutes before I flagged down a server and asked if we could order.  Her reply was, "she has not come, yet?" and took off to find our server.  When our gal arrived, there were no apologies or explanations.  We pre-empted our order with the disclaimer that we were all very hungry and wanted to order right away.  So our orders were finally placed after we had been at the restaurant for nearly thirty minutes.  The beer I ordered never arrived, but I had to get up and let the server know once my third appetizer plate came to the table.  No apologies.I ordered seven hot appetizers.  The first three arrived about thirty minutes after they were ordered.  The Quail, Fatayer, and Foul Moudamas.Quail (sautéed over hummus): Perfect portion for one person, absolutely flavorful and delicious.  Crisp and spicy/sweet on the outside, juicy and flavorful on the inside.Fatayer (four spinach pies with onions, sumac, and line nuts): Nothing to rave  about, basically a lackluster version of Spanakopita without the feta.Foul Moudamas (fava beans cooked with garlic and lemon juice, topped fresh diced tomatoes, cilantro with drizzle of olive oil): Loved this, fresh and packed with flavor.I had to get up and get more bread for our dips, as server was nowhere to be seen.  I had to constantly clear the table of plates as no one came to the table to do so.  At one point, about an hour and fifteen minutes after we arrived, the owner came to the table to ask how the food was  (the music was so loud I was virtually screaming at him and I barely heard him).  I handed him a stack of plates that I was just clearing from the table and mentioned how the food tasted great, but we were all still hungry...hint hint.The server never came to follow up on our food, to ask if we wanted refills, or just to see how everyone was doing.  Around 8:30p, one hour after our orders were placed, I had to once again get up and find the server to ask about the remaining dishes I ordered.  At that time she informed me that they were out of two of the appetizers I ordered.  No Sambusek, no Makanek.  No apologies.  Fine, but the appropriate thing to do would have been to come to the table and inform us about this, and offer something else instead.  Long story short, she mentioned that my Chicken Shawarma Hummus was on its way, more than an hour after I ordered it.  The final appetizer I ordered, would arrive an hour and fifteen minutes after order was placed.Hummus Shawarma (chicken over hummus with pine nuts) My favorite dish of the night, tasted exactly like Pita Jungle's version  (Just costs more).  The chicken was outstanding.  Soft, succulent, and savory.  Garlic shrimp (sautéed shrimp in garlic cilantro)  Second favorite dish.  Generous portion of gorgeously plump prawns, well seasoned and very flavorsome.We snickered collectively when the hostess of the evening announced that the entertainment was coming to a close, and that there would be Samba lessons.  I quote, "I hope that your food has settled so you can enjoy some dancing lessons."  Everyone's entrees literally arrived an hour after we had come to the restaurant, right when the hostess opened up the dance floor for some lessons.The music was so loud that I had to stuff mine and baby's ears with tissue - we were literally yelling in each other's ears so we could hear one another.  Our sweet baby had an amazing time, though!  She loved the music and the dancers and was captivated the entire time.  We were so lucky to have the entertainment to keep our minds off our growling (roaring) bellies.Our bill arrived close to 9p, after I once again made the journey to find our server and request the bill.  No thank you's,  no smiles, no apologies from her.  However, I would love to return for future International nights.  I will likely sit at the bar with no expectations of food or service - maybe a cocktail and some shisha.
Cyros Sushi and Sake Bar=Hey Mister, have you got a dime?  OK, so the coolest thing on the table at Cyros is the soy sauce mister, or actually Julia S (victorian nerd) corrected us and said it was atomizer. We atomized our sushi bites, much better, you get the flavor without the sushi falling apart from dunking and I am sure the salt intake for your meal has to be a million times healthier.  The staff is very genuine and our server Meghan was off the charts enthusiastic and knowledgeable. I am also a big sake fan, I love to try different sakes.  If you have only had warm sake in the tiny white cups, you are in for a treat with all the fancy smancy sakes around town. Cyros has an extensive sake menu and offers half bottles, they seem expensive, but these are small batches, hand crafted rice wines.  The cloudy, unfiltered, served cold are my favorite and most high end sakes are also glutten free. For all the people who still want a buzz but have food allergies.
TGI Friday's=Absolutely unacceptable service.It has been a very long time since i have actually gotten up and left a restaurant because of bad service, but let me tell you, it was the best thing that I did this evening.My family decided to take a trip to TGI Fridays because it has been a while since we have visited this location and we were craving the fried green beans with wasabi ranch.Our visit was on Saturday evening. We arrived around 8:40, actually got a front parking spot in front of the door, and had less than a five minute wait. So far so good, then we were seated and promptly entered the "twilight zone".  Our server came over after about 7 minutes, took our drink order and we took the opportunity to  order the fried green beans with wasabi ranch.  Now, after 8 minutes our fried green beans and wasabi ranch arrived, but we still have yet to receive our drinks. We had two waters and a sweet tea.  We were told that it would be a few minutes before the sweet tea was ready.  By now,  two tables have been seated a two top right behind us and a four top across from us. They were promptly greeted  by our server and they began their dining experience.We ordered a Jack Daniel's cheeseburger, the sizzling chicken and shrimp and a Friday's® House Salad (Romaine, red cabbage, grape tomato, cucumber, mixed cheese and focaccia croutons with choice of dressing and a hot garlic bread stick.) I have added the description as shown on the website and menu. Ours did not come with the bread stick.  When we asked the server, he stated that it did not come with one, we stated that the menu said it did.  After my wife finished the salad he obliged with 2 hot garlic bread sticks, but what was the point, the salad was already finished.So thirty minutes passed and each of the tables received their salads, and meals that came in after us, we felt we had been neglected enough.This is where I approached the front hostess stand, requested the manager, and let her know how this was just unacceptable.  The manager stated that it was just a few more minutes, and I let her know that my family had already left and was in the car.  As a courtesy, I let her know that I was willing to pay for the tea, salad and fried green beans, but we were not going to hang around any longer.  She insisted that we wait and have it boxed to go, but I declined, as it should have been presented as ordered in a timely manner at our table, not in a to go box.  (Just remember the food was still not even ready).  The manager said it was not necessary to pay, but this is just not acceptable at a dining establishment.I am getting really frustrated at the level of incompetence in businesses, and the lack of willingness to provide an effort to do very basic skills. Please take a moment and train the employees of the importance of serving others by understanding the menu and by taking care of the needs in a timely manner.  If one cannot handle more than 4 tables, then one may need a new job.I am pretty sure that by the other yelp reviews, I am not the only one who is NOT thinking TGI Friday!Just on a side note: Had I not stopped by the hostess stand and ask for the manager, the server would have never noticed we were gone?  Now that's sad!
Einstein Bros Bagels=I've had Einstein Bros on numerous occasions, bu I've never had anything aside from basic bagels and shmear. I was craving bagel and lox so I met my OG Ryan B for some lunch. The service was standard, but I got exactly what I was looking for in a bagel and lox with the works. A little on the expensive side, but I was extremely satisfied with my meal and the atmosphere was nice to sit and chat in a quiet location. Free Wi-Fi and free refills makes this a nice quiet place to get some work done as well.
Jollibee=2013 HALO-HALO CHALLENGE - Contender #2Jollibee got the honors for our next Halo-Halo Challenge.  They say pictures are worth a 1000 words. Well, when we walked into Jollibee, Bam! In our face was a beautiful sight...a poster of a perfectly made cup of Halo-Halo. For about $5, I was hoping we got exactly what the picture demonstrated...ube ice cream, flan, sweetened condensed milk, red beans, green jelly, and coconut packed in shave ice.  I think a little ube syrup was even added just for show (see pictures).  Our Halo-Halo tasted as good as expected. And with the Vegas heat that evening, our dessert only tasted that much better. Our Halo-Halo was sweet, cool, and had enough of the minimum ingredients to keep me satisfied until our next challenge.  So far, I'm a fan of Jollibee's Halo Squared.  My only issue...I wish there was more flan and some legit ube (not ice cream).PS: For an appetizer before our Halo-Halo Challenge, I tried their Beef Tenders (Tapa).  This was basically seasoned and caramelized beef steak, eggs, and rice.  So good and a perfect quick meal before any Halo-Halo Challenge.Halo-Halo:  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jollibee-las-vegas-2?userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ#Cot3wGtkvTNtq_OTutVyzA2013 HALO-HALO CHALLENGE:Contender #1 (Elena's):  http://www.yelp.com/biz/elenas-restaurant-las-vegas-2#hrid:66pT_yQvZudRThxlGl74QwContender #2 (Jollibee):  http://www.yelp.com/biz/jollibee-las-vegas-2#hrid:ZSJzziWEVLyOF3DHfn1MaA/src:selfContender #3 (Cafe Cebu):  http://www.yelp.com/biz/caf%C3%A9-de-cebu-las-vegas#hrid:5iu3U4zoZWQISOSO7BMsGQContender #4 (Salo-Salo):  http://www.yelp.com/biz/salo-salo-grill-las-vegas#hrid:Wgtkj97v8-l9MnNuyj-QxQ/src:selfContender #5 (Thelma's):  http://www.yelp.com/biz/thelmas-filipino-restaurant-henderson#hrid:wzGAlZyBNi1UtDRM0t0oXwContender #6 (Andrea's):  http://www.yelp.com/biz/andreas-las-vegas#hrid:idKe5bOeuIwnyzcamgeUDgContender #7 (Chow King):  http://www.yelp.com/biz/chow-king-las-vegas-2#hrid:3FzhPzAaF7_OE6i0Nau5WAContender #8 (Fiesta Filipina):  http://www.yelp.com/biz/fiesta-filipina-cuisine-henderson#hrid:VLvYgY6ROsMh9q70tmkoHwI have heard about Jollibee for quite some time and finally got the chance to try it out today.  A friend had told me that it was like the Filipino version of McDs and KFC combined with some traditional Filipino staples thrown in the mix.  And yep, that is what I thought when I saw the menu.We had the fried chicken and the spaghetti today.  The fried chicken was tasty and I really liked the gravy to dip it in.  Yum.  The spaghetti was really different since it had cheese on top, a sweet tomato sauce, and some hot dog pieces all mixed together.  I know it sounds super weird, but it was actually good, in a strange way.  It was a cheap meal too. For 2 adult meals and a kid's meal the total was only $16.  Not too shabby for lunch.  I wish I was more hungry because there were a lot of fun looking desserts to try.  Maybe next time...And there will be a next time!In the area for an appointment, we were trying to find something quick to eat at 10:30 in the morning and didn't want IHOP, so we decided to give Jollibee a shot. I've been to Jollibee in So Cal before, but never to one here in town. I've never been a huge fan, but figured I'd give them another shot.I got the spam breakfast and it was ok. The best thing about this place is that everything is so cheap, even for fast food. Nothing amazing but it satiated our craving for a quick and cheap meal while we were in the area. Good for what it is, cheap fast food.There has to be a good reason my parents would never let me eat at Jollibee when I was little.  They always told me the burgers are made of worms. Somebody gave me a burger from Jollibee and I would not touch it.This is a Filipino fast-food joint. It's like the Filipino Mickey D's. It's not fusion or anything. Filipino, Filipino, Filipino! Pinoy! From the food to the old ladies that cut in line in front of you. And no, this is definitely not the best burger anywhere. Whoever says that it is is a liar...just because you saw Jollibee in Bourdain's show, doesn't mean you have to believe it. I would not recommend a Jollibee burger to anyone.I've had their Chicken Joy and that's alright.  I'm not a fan of Filipino spaghetti with the sweet sauce and red hotdogs (also made with worms according to my folks). The only thing I like from this place is Peach Mango Pie.Years later...parentless and living in Vegas...feeling like a rebel, I finally got the urge to try their burger. It's one of those "The Prodigal Son" moments where I was like "I should've listened to my parents". Pack this!
Filiberto's Mexican Food=The theme of today's Yelp is: Know Thyself.Know thyself, filibertos.  Here's what you aren't: Houston's.  I don't need an open kitchen and I certainly don't need to wait for thirty minutes to get my burrito.Know thyself: you aren't so busy that you need to give out numbers and then call out the orders by their numbers only.  Hey, lady: no one wants the receipt.  We throw it away once you hand it to us.  We earnestly wish you never gave it to us in the first place.  So no, we don't remember the number.  We don't understand why you're so annoyed that no one is responding to you when you call out some number.  I ordered a sausage burrito, not a 1473, so I don't know why you're yelling out numbers and looking huffy.Furthermore, give us some visual cue: for example, if you ask me if I want it for here or to go, and I choose "for here," I won't think that a burrito in a paper bag is mine, no matter what number you're calling.Know thyself: at every other Filibertos, the food *is* the entertainment.  We go there to drown in a bliss that can only be made up of butter/greasy butter substitute and delightfulness.  Not for the TVs.  And when you have two TVs next to each other, you don't need the volume on for both.  Because this creates, at best, an Echo Effect.  This effect makes whoever is talking sound like God in some deus ex machina stage presentation.  Which is terrifying when it's the voice of Bill Austin on Beth and Bill.  I can only assume I have kicked one too many innocent dogs (I never kick dogs) and I am roasting in hell.  I would now like to trade in the eternity of Beth and Bill for an eternity of sixth degree burns, please.Here is the quintessential failure of this Filibertos: the food is shit.  The green sauce has the consistency of applesauce--a fact which makes me want to puke.  The burrito was filled with what can only be fake eggs, and tons of them.  Not much in the way of sausage and I'm pretty sure it was made of something that used to be someone's pet.  And the river of cheese on the side had coagulated.  Worst of all, the nefarious garlic monster has once again shat in my mouth and I now see plants wilting in my wake.Don't ever go to this place.  Use your mighty dollar vote and go elsewhere.  Because all the good that Filibertos has done in this world is under threat by this fucking impostor.--------My wife read the review, and by "read" I mean listened while I read it to her, and she fears I might be giving all Filibertos a bad name.  No.  Only this one sucks.  She says you should go to the one on McQueen and Pecos, and she is, as usual, right.
Truckin' Good Food=07/14/10 and 10/14/10!  (What a coincidence!  I did not plan the 3-month interval...)My first visit to T'GF was for Bastille Day, when Jeff K. and his food truck had a "taste-off" against Torched Goodness.  I found them both to be equally good that day, although Jeff was a little more generous w/ his frozen dessert sample compared to TG's thimble sample (TG was out of the two flavors I wanted to try)!  Since I couldn't decide which was better of the two, I didn't vote... Sorry, Jeff K.!I decided to try the Bastille Day dessert crepe, expecting I'd get a traditional crepe w/ vanilla ice cream.  Instead, I received a cup filled w/ ice cream and garnished w/ a sliver of a cookie and, I'd like to say, a raspberry coulis.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/truckin-good-food-phoenix?select=fOquGJdYwCwC7S489g_E9g#fOquGJdYwCwC7S489g_E9g  Delicious, but a bit too sweet!  (Yes, yes, Jeff K. did describe to me what I was going to receive before preparing my order, but I'd just had a sample of flan, which contains egg, of which I'm allergic to, that has many side effects, one of which is a lack of concentration!  Come to think of it, the ice cream probably consisted of eggyolks, as well.)My second visit to T'GF left me being a happier camper!  I had already checked out the website's menu and had two items in mind, but was sidetracked into ordering frites (potato fries cooked in duck fat).  I placed my order of a Brittany crepe, as well as one beignet, no powdered sugar.  After a few minutes, I'd remembered it was the panisse frites (chickpea fries) that I'd wanted to try, so I asked Jeff if it was too late to change my mind.  No, it wasn't too late!  Since there was a line of people before me waiting for their crepes to be prepared (I think they can only make two crepes at a time back there), I opted to pop inside Downtown PHX Public Market and have a go at the menu, as well.Stop the presses!  The Brittany crepe was tres magnifique!  It consisted of a buckwheat crepe filled w/ local Buckeye, AZ Crow's Dairy chevre, as well as a little buckwheat honey.  Food orgasm!  I'm definitely going to order this one again on my next visit!  The panisse frites were OK, albeit very, very mild-tasting.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/truckin-good-food-phoenix?select=svrAe4tRWFasRDLOHa6RIw#svrAe4tRWFasRDLOHa6RIw  While deep-fried, they weren't greasy at all.  They reminded me a bit of falafel, though definitely not as dense (far from it!) nor as flavorful as falafel.  I didn't find the light-as-air lemon-herb froth that accompanied the fries punchy enough to pair well w/ the crispy fries :(  Perhaps a creamier dip would suffice?  The curry mayo (which came w/ a fellow Yelper's frites) was a better match.  As for the beignet-- it looked delicious, but I couldn't try it since Jeff's assistant forgot to hold the powdered sugar.  Boo!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/truckin-good-food-phoenix?select=GCdX9u-msiqKqim1A2B4-A#GCdX9u-msiqKqim1A2B4-ASorry for not having a photo of the Brittany crepe-- once I'd had a taste of it, I didn't want to pause to turn on my camera phone.  (I figured I could always take one the next time I visit!  Hahaha!)  I bumped into Yelpers Dolores, Robyn, and Lynn, who later accepted my invitation to sit at my table and so was able to sample Robyn's frites w/ curry dip (the same dip I'd picked out initially before changing my mind!)  They're pretty good!  Thanks, Robyn!  BTW, thanks for the feedback on the beignet and its "super-yummy" caramel sauce!
Nate's Third Base Pub=My fiancee and I Decided to try this place out last night around 5:30-6ish. We were pleased to find we made it for happy hour. One bartender said hello to us and walked away. The other bartender didn't even acknowledge us for about 10 minutes. Keep in mind there were 6 people at the bar including the 2 of us and the bar is not big. We ordered beers and he handed us menus. We looked over the happy hour menu and were thinking of ordering something. While looking over the menu's the bartender was dropping F bombs and extrememly rude to another patron. Don't get me wrong, I drop F bombs quite frequently but never while i'm working, it's just bad taste....I dont care what kind of job you have.  Our beers were dry for a long time before the rude bartender even asked if we wanted another OR order food. My fiancee used the restroom and decieded eating here would be a bad idea as they were dirtier than dirty. Meanwhile a cook came out of the kitchen with food at sat at the bar to eat it. The rude bartender yells across the bar to the cook "COOKS CANT SIT AT THE BAR, NATES RULE".  Poor guy got up and sat at an empty table away from the bar. Again bad taste. At this point we decided we had enough of this place and would not be returning. EVER. I am thankful we didn't try the food. There are plenty of other dive bars in Chandler with good service and clean restrooms.
Eddie's Pizza And Lounge=Aaaahh, Tempe, my old college stomping grounds.  Pizza.  Awesome.Thank you Eddie's pizza and lounge for pissing in the face of my college memories.For the better part of three weeks finding a vast array of coupons from this place all over my truck, typically five or six in the door handle and the all famous stack of them in the now bent windshield wiper of my truck, I decide to give this place a try.  I will take this regret to my grave.Five bucks for a large pizza and a drink, shit that is an awesome deal!  At least I thought it was.  I would have been better off giving my money to a bum and having him punch me in the nuts.  After calling the number on the coupon that littered my truck and parking lot, I decide to place an order for their special.  I ask if their coupon special includes delivery.  The girl answering the phone said "Really, well you are going to be waiting for a long time, it isn't that big of an order.  We don't like to deliver for the coupon special."  I assume that is the business equivalent of "Fuck no" so I tell her I'll just come pick it up.  I am told my order will be ready from 20 minutes to an hour.  Somewhat of a vast window, but I live close so I decide to request a dance from the devil.  The devil won.I show up about 30 minutes later (seemed reasonable) and was told I need to wait and was offered to rent a hookah while I waited.  Are you fucking serious?   Not wanting anyone to spit in my food, I politely tell her no and sit down on the couch to watch the game on T.V.  She then turns the channel to something else.Leaving 20 minutes later when my pizza is done, the cook comes out after handing it over to her, runs out, asks me what I ordered.  I tell him and he opens up the box again, looks at it, and says I am good to go.  I don't know what the hell that is about until I get home.Of course, they fucked up my order.  I'm not surprised or amused.  At least I got my can of soda.I take the pizza home.  Not what I ordered.  In retrospect, I should have put a Totinos in the oven.  This pizza tasted like a generic undercooked store brand pizza.  Not only was my order wrong, it was very undercooked.  I had to put it in my own oven when I got home, missing even more of the game.  I ate 3 slices and threw the rest away.  I didn't even want to give the leftovers to the dogs, they would probably bite me for feeding them that shit.  Seriously, how do you ruin pizza?  It is like toast.The food was shit, the service was even worse.  But that can of Mountain dew I got was nice and chilly.  At least they have that going for them.  You earned one star.  The coupons from this place no longer blow around the parking lot of where I live like tumbleweeds on a holy war of declaring jihad against tastebuds around the greater Tempe area, but the scars of eating here will remain forever.
Senor Taco=DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE AT NIGHT!!! My wife and I came here because their sign outside said open till 10pm and we happened to be out for a late dinner, so we decided to stop here. We ordered our food at 9:15pm and got the food ten minutes later, and when we got it, it was packaged like a to-go order. I didn't make a big deal out of it so I took it to our table and started to open the styrofoam trays. When the cashier seen us about to eat, she says to us "You can't eat here, were about to close". So i informed her that their sign said closed at 10pm. She pretty much argued with me saying no, it says 9:30(even after I literally went outside and pointed to it)I have never been forced to leave a restaurant like that! Usually a restaurant will just lock the doors preventing further customers to come in. The employees were rude about it, and when my wife called the next day to talk to the owner, he showed no concern. Great way to lose business!!It pretty much ruined our dinner which was cold and soggy by the time we got home. Just beware...
Ichiban Korean BBQ & Sushi=Ichiban has quickly become one of my favorite places for great food.  My work-mates and I go there at least twice a week for lunch.  Although the name implies Japanese, the owners are local Korean folk who are extremely friendly.  The food is made by them fresh, so you know it's authentic.  So what if their English is broken and hard to understand.  When it comes to the other International language, the language of food, it's easy to understand, and what they're dishin' out translates to "deliciousness" in my stomach!  I haven't tried their sushi but their traditional Korean fare is excellent- banchan (side dishes) with home made kimchi, kalbi (beef ribs), yoo ka jang spicy soup, seafood soon du bu (seafood spicy soup) are all at the top of my list.  The prices are reasonable and the service is very friendly.  I haven't been there in the evening but my friend Suejin highly recommends it as she's spent many an evening there, happily drinking soju and sake while tabletop-grilling kalbi.  And if you know Sue like I know Sue, you know she's one tough Korean cookie to please, and Sue is always pleased when she's at Ichiban.
Barcelona Tapas=I was looking forward to trying this place since I read about it in the 89148 Magazine back in February.  I love tapas and the menu looked so promising...carpaccio with truffle oil, grilled octopus with a red wine reduction, and chorizo clams in a white wine broth.  My mouth waters just thinking about these dishes and many more on Barcelona's menu, but I'm sad to report that this was one of the most disappointing restaurants I've ever been to!It just so happens that I recently acquired a coupon to this restaurant and went to it last Friday.  I just want to make it clear that I would have happily tried this place at full price, and the dish I was looking most forward to trying was the carpaccio (you just can't go wrong with raw beef and truffle oil...I'd hope).  My boyfriend and I were seated and greeted promptly.  When the server came over to take our drink order, he looked down at my coupon, took it and went straight to the kitchen.  Being a server for a long time, I could tell he was not happy that we brought this coupon, but I tried to remedy the situation by being extremely nice.  We ordered the carpaccio, pan fried dates, steamed clams, diabla shrimp, grilled octopus, sautéed tilapia, albondigas, and merguez.  After a short while the tapas started coming out, and after delivering the first wave, our server said, "I'm sorry, but the carpaccio is very popular and we are running out of it tonight."  I smiled and said disappointed, "oh really?" and he responded, "yes."  Both my boyfriend and I picked up on his wording, but we did not confront him about it.  It is my strong belief that they had enough carpaccio for AT LEAST another order, but they didn't want to waste it on a table with a coupon!  As the night progressed our server grew increasingly more impatient and annoyed with our presence.  When we got our check he had manually written in an 18% tip...on a table for 2, and I always automatically tip 20% (even when the service is bad)!  With a coupon or something comped, I usually tip much more because that's what fellow service industry workers do...(can you tell how livid I am?)  Unfortunately, I wish I could say that only the service was sub par, but the food ranged from ok to not even edible.Pan Fried Dates- This was the best dish we had from Barcelona.  The bacon was cooked well, all of the textures were spot on, and they had a nice savory sweet taste.  However, the red wine reduction was way too thin, the blue cheese crumbles were on the stingy side, and Firefly's are much better.Steamed Clams- The clams were cooked well, but the chorizo was very dry.  The broth also needed more seasoning (this is a common theme).Diabla Shrimp- I liked this, but again, it was not as good as Firefly's.  A nice spicy sweet sauce with shrimp, but the sauce was a little too thin.Grilled Octopus- This just lacked seasoning.  The octopus was a pretty good texture, not too chewy, but the flavor was bland.  For good grilled octopus, try Olives in the Bellagio.Sauteed Tilapia- Completely inedible!  I'm not sure if the kitchen just didn't care or if they genuinely made a mistake, but the outside of the fish was mushy and the inside was raw.  I've never seen fish this texture before, and I honestly can't think of how it happened.Albondigas- Meatballs in marinara with melted mozzarella on top.  These were so dry we drenched each bite in the marinara.Merguez- A spicy lamb sausage served over roasted red pepper couscous.  The sausage was dry and not very spicy.  The couscous was a little wet, but it had a good flavor.The one good thing about our experience was that the man refilling our drinks was extremely friendly!  He never let a drink go empty and explained they have live music some nights.  I really wish the food had been better so I could give this place a second chance.Returning from Spain only five months ago, we were craving tapas.  There aren't that many options for tapas in Las Vegas beyond the two Firefly locations.Barcelona Tapas and Bar gives us one other place to consider when you're craving small bites.Located in a busy strip mall where locals frequent, this restaurant had a few customers by the bar and dining when we walked in on a weekday night.I had a few things in mind immediately based on previous yelpers, so we got to ordering.  We munched on complimentary bread and spreads while we waited for our orders to arrive.* Beef Carpaccio "Thin sliced of tender tails drizzle with balsamic vinaigrette, truffle oil, tapenade, and fried onions" ($8) - I love beef carpaccio...when it's done right.  Yelpers raved about their version and sadly, we couldn't quite see why.  It's more like cured beef than raw beef, which is what we were expecting.  Not quite like beef jerky, but not delicate like what we're familiar with.  It was also covered with large shavings of cheese, which was not mentioned.   Not sure if this was to cover up the beef or enhance the taste.* Pastelillos de pollo (Chicken Cakes) "Chopped chicken, green and red onions, red pepper, chopped cilantro, black bean and corn salsa molded together and grilled served with gribiche." ($5.50) - Something a bit unusual that you don't see on every menu.  It's a bit misleading in its description since we were expecting all the ingredients to be 'molded together' to create a corn cake.  In actuality, the black bean and corn salsa are on the side of the corn cake.  Nonetheless, it was quite tasty with the accompanying egg sauce.  And it is only one corn cake.* Merguez Lamb Sausage "Served with couscous, and roasted pepper tomato sauce and a Merlot wine reduction sauce." ($7.50) - There was a distinctive lamb taste to it, and what I'm sure was some liver blended into the mixture.  The Husband isn't a fan of most livers so he was very aware of the funny taste to it.  Comes two in an order.* Pan Fried Dates "Pitted dates stuffed with almonds wrapped in bacon with merlot reduction and sprinkled with blue cheese crumbles." ($5.50) - Anything wrapped in bacon usually can't go wrong, and dates mix perfectly with bacon in this case too.  Comes five in an order.* Boquerones (White Anchovies) "Toasted French bread with a spicy aioli topped with sweet white anchovies and balsamic reduction sauce." ($5.50) - Anchovies were something we enjoyed everyday when we were in Spain, but we didn't know what took so long for this one order to come out.  The bread could have been toasted just a bit longer.  * Lomo a la parrilla (Petite Filet) "Mashed potato, mushroom and Merlot sauce." ($8.50) - Our final order, which we put in at the last minute.  It took a bit too long, and the waiter did come by to say it was coming out soon.  (It still took longer after that.  I can only assume that our order got stuck behind the larger parties that had come in after us.)  Another one of those dishes I ordered based on raving reviews, and sadly, it did disappoint.  We ordered it rare and although the center was pink, the outside was grilled a bit too long and thus hard.  We were impressed by how busy it got for a weekday night - and Barcelona Tapas & Bar does cater to families with plenty of large tables, high chairs, and a diaper changing station in the restroom.  Right now they are offering an introductory and temporary offer where kids eat free on Sundays through Tuesdays from 4 pm to 8 pm, for those 10 and under only and with a purchase of an adult entree.Service was okay - we asked our waitress for another set of silverware and she completely forgot about it.  (Immediately after we asked her, she went to sit a  party that arrived and never came back.)  We also had to ask for our beverages to be refilled.  The man who sat us did ask us how we had heard about them.  We also noticed the chef come by our table four different times to look at what we were eating, but never actually said anything to us.  Specials include:Mondays: Half off bottles of wine.Tuesdays: Half off their homemade Sangria.Wednesdays: Half off Martinis.Thursdays: Half off Mojitos.Fridays: Half off all their tapas from 4 pm to 6 pmSaturdays: Ladies Night with Half off all House drinks, wines and beer from 10 pm to 12 am.  Live music.Karaoke everyday (except Fridays and Saturdays) and tapas are half off after 10 pm.According to their website, they are open for lunch now - but their opening hours are still posted as opening at 4 pm.There are coupons everywhere for them - restaurant.com, local newspaper, and online.
New York Pizza=Have to agree with other folks here. It's a hint towards great NY pizza, or perhaps another style of NY Pizza that I've yet to experience. Regardless, I'm a fan. It was pouring, bitter cold, I had been sick all day, and I wanted some effing pizza for dinner. These guys were awesome. Can't comment on dining at their home base on South Blvd, but the delivery, as was the product, was fan-freaking-tastic. Simple ordering. They deliver in a 5-mile radius from the shop. We're just in at 4.7mi. Score! We were quoted about an hour due to the weather and every other soul in Crown Town ordering pizza at that exact moment. However, our delivery guy showed up in about 40 minutes. Bless his heart, man. He was a trooper. Super nice guy, too.Went with the 18" (more like 18') white pizza -- add spinach AND tomatoes. You apparently get either/or. Also scored a slice of their stuffed pizza. First, the stuffed slice. Stuff is awesome. Manageable to pick up and eat like a normal slice, but fork and knife made it easier for dunking into the marinara. The marinara was a little watery for my liking, but not a deal-breaker. I inhaled it. Not just because it was the only thing I had eaten all day, either. The white pizza. Goodness gracious, it didn't even fit in the box! It was massive. Each of us ate one slice and called it quits. Had we some friends over it would have been gone, no doubt. Good luck tackling this monster with just two. The flavors were great. A little overzealous with the ricotta, but the garlic flavor was nice. I'd order it again, but not in the 18" variety. I'm a fan. I'd definitely count on these guys for trusty delivery yet again, but look forward to dining in house with a nice, foldable slice of cheese or pepperoni!
EllaEm's Soul Food=When you think of Soul Food, Catfish comes to mind. No, not the stupid reality show on tv but the real actual fish. Here they do have it with your choice of it fried or grilled. They also have Chicken n Waffles. I took my 12 year old son with me to check this place out. We did ended up getting the Catfish and the Chicken n Waffles.The Chicken n Waffles were pretty good. You get 3 nice sized chicken wings, a waffle, and eggs any style you want. The chicken was crispy and slight breading to it. The waffle was just ok. I was expecting to be at least a little more crispy than it appeared. The eggs we got scrambled. Nothing special to note there.The Grilled Cajun Catfish was good as well. Came with your choice of 3 sides. I picked Mashed Potatoes with Beef Gravy, Mac n Cheese, and Mixed Veggies. This is where I got really disappointed. The Catfish was decent but all the sides tasted a bit bland and was lukewarm. The veggies were definitely not fresh because it was partially soggy, it looked lifeless, and was chewy when I took a bite. The Mac n Cheese tasted like what I make my kids at home with the instant microwave stuff. It's not fancy but it is good enough for them. Here at a restaurant that is unacceptable. Last but not least, the Mashed Potatoes were a bit dry. Maybe they didn't put enough water or milk in the mix before putting it in the microwave?As for service, they are a bit slow here. We came in at 6:45 pm on a Tuesday night. There were only two other tables occupied at the time. We got our food I would say about 15 minutes later. After about 5 minutes both our drinks were empty. Another 5 minutes later I had to ask for a refill on both our drinks. Rule of thumb, if you have to ask for refills after so much time has passed, that is not good service. In closing, I would stick to ordering the Chicken n Waffles and Catfish. Stay away from the sides, well at least what I ordered. To be fair I cant assume everything was nuked. I also would like to try other items so I can give them the benefit of the doubt especially if it warrants updating this review. Until then, its 2 stars for me.Tradition. That is what this cute soul food cafe is steeped in. The menu is a tribute to a lovely NOLA influenced granny, RIP, who lived to the ripe old age of 97 1/2 and who apparently was a gifted cook.  These are her recipes. Consider yourself honored to meet her through her granddaughter's perseverence to share her food.Located on the north end of town, near Nellis AFB, this is a very attractive, clean, spacious eating establishment that should be taken seriously by locals and travellers as well. It is desireable not only for the food but for its location far from the craziness that is downtown and on the Strip. This is in the land of copius parking and chill attitude.The Catfish has a lovely cornmeal crunch, not at all greasy. It comes with great tasting tartar sauce and your choice of 3 sides.  The servings were so big I felt I was looking at them thru a magnifying glass.The braised oxtail came with 3 pcs as big as a fist and a choice of two sides. The meat was fall off the bone tender, and the pan gravy was plate lickable.Even the cornbread muffin was unique with an interesting crusty muffin top. Served with REAL butter.My mac n cheese side (oh my goodness wonderful) was made exactly as I crave, with lots of the right kind of cheddar cheese.The collard greens were tender and hammy and tangy. Oh so good.Then there was the fried cabbage with bacon.  I could eat that all day long.And yep, Mr B indulged in tasty Black Eyed Peas.I didn't, but if you want to see what all the hype is over chitterlings, you don't have to go down South. They have them here.They offer excellent service and a delightfully cheerful vibe.You have no idea what authentic soul food is about until you come here.  I have tried many places, but this ranks #1 for me.  I would definitely go out of my way to eat here again.Items Selected:Cornbread MuffinsFried Chicken, Chicken Gravy, Fried Okra, Mac n' Cheese, Candied YamsSweet Potato PieRed Velvet CakeTucked away in a strip mall on West Craig Road in North Las Vegas, but frequented by locals and those within the proper city limits for what some consider to be the best Soulfood in The Valley, it was just after 5pm that I entered the stripped down confines of  EllaEm's for a bite before dinner and although several take-out orders unfortunately caused a rather lengthy delay from the kitchen one would be hard-pressed to name another place offering a more authentic experience, particularly at such a price.Not at all billed to be the upscale experience of Yardbird and far less often discussed than either location of underwhelming M&M Soul Food Cafe found further South, it was at a four-top surrounded by a crowd of all ages and ethnicities that I was seated mere moments after entry and perusing the menu it a young Hispanic hostess offered smiling greetings before filling water and presenting the first of two rounds of complimentary cornbread muffins, each bite tinged with sweetness amidst a delicate yet toothsome base.Offering a la carte options, but generally a far better deal when ordered as a combo or traditional "Meat + 3," it was in rejecting temptation offered by fried pork chops as well as several other entrees that my original target of EllaEm's signature fried chicken was selected and although attempts to add-on a waffle were thwarted by poor kitchen timing the nearly thirty minute wait was rewarded by two legs and a thigh of crisply breaded brined bird, the spice profile well represented straight through the skin and into the flesh while sides of yams and fried okra were reference standard in execution, the man & cheese largely forgettable with overcooked noodles plus a soupy thin sauce.Apologies offered by the young server for the missing waffle and delays that were in no way her fault, there was little doubt that a meal at any Southern eatery was likely to end without a sampling of dessert, and although the lack of banana pudding would seem to be a serious menu oversight both the small slice of warm red velvet cake and one of Sweet Potato pie were far better than one may have expected, the former far sweeter than other cocoa-laden iterations while the latter atop a crisp and flaky crust impressed by taking the traditional savory route.****No doubt one of "Hidden Gems" of North Las Vegas, an area oft lamented for a dearth of quality places to dine, EllaEm's offers not only a relative bargain for the dollar but also some of the city's very best fried chicken and Red Velvet Cake, no small praise considering the omnipresence of each on menus throughout town.
Touch of Thai=So before I start my review, I'd like let Yelp know that I don't appreciate my Thai Lahna review disappearing. Where is it Yelp? I just went to the Thai Lahna business page and I know FOR A FACT I left them one review AND one review update and a CTRL+F for "Georgeann" isn't highlighting anything on either page of reviews. I needed that review as reference for this review, as I don't want to hold Touch of Thai and Thai Lahna to different standards. HOW FAIR AND BALANCED OF ME. But I digress.So I originally was going to give Touch of Thai one less star than Thai Lahna. To me, the sauces just weren't as flavorful and the Thom Yom Gai wasn't as orgasmic. That's not to say it wasn't good. You know that saying "Sex is like pizza, even when it's bad it's still pretty good". Well, I've had some doughy, tasteless excuses for pizza and they were pretty damn awful, so I hereby propose to replace "pizza" with "Tom Yum Gai". I really feel like that could catch on.  Anyway, so with that in mind I was going to give this place three stars because I was PRETTY sure I gave Thai Lahna four (however, I have no way of knowing for sure because Yelp is censoring my shit like a god damn fascist). Upon further thought, I remembered that the main reason I gave Thai Lahna a star detriment was because of their kinda crappy service. Food takes a pretty long time and, while not rude, I wouldn't really call them "friendly" either. Plus, they only serve coke in a can. I've been in to Touch of Thai  for both eat-in and take-out and both times the service was fast and friendly, definitely nothing that would warrant a star deduction. So they go up to four stars, because that's pretty much what I'd give their food and with no service adjustments either way, I'd say that's fair.  To recapThai Lahna - One Star for Food + One Star for lack of service/fountain soda problems = Touch of ThaiI'd definitely go back. The great (albeit hidden) location right in Old Town, cute interior, and friendly service makes up for the minor taste issues. Besides, you know what they say about sex and Tom Yum Gai...
Tokyo Sushi House=Like I suspected, the low ratings of this place was due to how typical and bitter the locals in this particular area are. I refer to this area of NW Vegas as the "Cheyenne Strip".  The "Cheyenne Strip" starts at the intersection of Cheyenne and Durango, and ends at the 215. The yelpers who live in this area are the harshest in the world.  If they liked a restaurant-the food was good,-but it wasn't their favorite, they will go ahead and give the restaurant a 1-star. If they really liked the restaurant and it's their top 10 favorite restaurant in Vegas, they will give it about 2 stars. They have no real structure on giving out 5-star ratings and will just randomly give out a rare 5-star if they are in a really good mood. That's why when you click on their yelp profiles, they have like 20-30 1-star ratings and like one or three 5-Star ratings. Also, check the reviews for every business located on the "Cheyenne Strip". Every business on this part of Cheyenne has an average of a 2 star overall rating. Are these ratings justified? Absolutely not! The residents in this area are those certain types of customers that are very difficult and impossible to satisfy. The Sushi here is not bad at all. And the prices are the best in town. Where else in Las Vegas can you get a $15.00 AYCE sushi deal? For some reason, TOKYO SUSHI HOUSE reminded me of one of these places but without the conveyer belt.  There are two Sushi houses in this area. The first being "Sushi Bomb" and the 2nd being TOKYO SUSHI HOUSE. A lot of people in the NW area compare this place to "Sushi bomb" and I think that's why many reviews are too critical. I actually decided to come here because "Sushi Bomb" gets extremely crowded during dinner hours, and like a lot of yelpers complain about, the wait time to get seated over there gets extremely long some nights. Sure, this place isn't a popular hangout for young people and pro-poker players like "Sushi Bomb" is, but at least it's half the price, you get seated immediately, and you get good tasting fish. Today, I was not in the mood for maki and wanted some good nigri. TSH, has a perfect selection of all nigri. They got everything from Albacore to Unagi, and the sushi chef sends it out fast. Also, the fish here at TSH is good-fresh seafood. There is nothing wrong with it like many NW yelpers claim. Many people try to compare the freshness to "Sushi Bomb" who actually kills some of  the fish the same day they serve it, but that's why that place is over $30.00 per person, and this place is only $15.00.  If you follow my reviews, you already know that I am very critical of how uncultured  people are who live in NW Las Vegas. Before I came here, I already knew that a lot of the bad reviews about "rude service" was just their cultural ignorance. The servers here don't have much English, and have difficulties understanding someone who is speaking really fast. So, she is not "stupid" or "being rude" if she gives you an incorrect answer to your question. BTW, the service to me was very good. There was never a moment that lasted more than a minute where my drink wasn't being refilled. I guess another plus about this place is that the Sushi Chef is very quiet and traditional. If you have mature older family members or young children, this place might be the best choice. At "Sushi bomb", some of the chefs are young and quite popular with the ladies, so you might hear him bragging about how he banged some chick the other night. In conclusion, TOKYO is definitely has a better atmosphere for families with young children.Most of the Sushi houses on the West Coast were originally established by Japanese nationals(not Japanese-Americans), and quickly sold to Korean-Americans. I don't understand why they always do this? Is this some kind of common investment by business men in Japan? I tried asking my Dad, my lawyer, and one of my best friends who are all Japanese-American, but because they were all born in Hawaii, they had no clue about why investors in Japan do this. Anyone know?So practically, I would say this is a good 4-star establishment, but I will give it 5-stars just to compensate for all the unjust 1-star ratingsNo...just no. Granted we came on a busy afternoon, and I will give credit where credit is due, overall there was just so much wrong with this place.The positive: The sushi chef was busting his butt to quickly fulfill the orders. There was constant hand washing by the sushi chef in between orders. The price of $15 for lunch was very appealing.The negative: The quality of sushi was among the lowest I have experienced. Not only was it mostly rice (explains the low price tag), but the rolls were so sloppy and kept falling apart. My soy sauce dish was completely filled with residual rice. Also, everything tasted mushy and the same with an overpowering amount of cream cheese. We sampled 5 rolls between us and honestly I can't say any of them stood out or would warrant coming back even if everything else wasn't wrong with this place. The salmon was fresh, the rest of the fish was not. The tuna was the mushy glob kind that they just throw on top of the roll..instead of you know, using actual tuna. It goes without saying that the crab was the fake krab kind.The service was non existent. I asked for a water refill twice, and never received it. The waitress was busy, but how hard is it to send someone from the kitchen to walk around with a jug of water and just refill the tables.Or she could have done it herself... it would have taken 3 minutes tops.  As I was leaving, someone actually got up with their empty glass and approached the kitchen area because they had been waiting for a refill during the entirety of their visit. The best part was the auto gratuity added by "accident"...$6 on a $30 order. When I looked at it and laughed she took it back and apologized for the "mistake". Right.... yes let me give you a 20% for doing absolutely nothing for me, not even refilling my water glass. So shady!We tipped the sushi chef directly as he was busting his butt and actually serving us. I will not step foot in this place again.
Smashburger=After seeing this place reviewed on Yelp, I felt it was time to stop by and check it out.  I'm a burger loving kind of gal, and am always on the hunt for a good peice of meat.  This place definately has it going on.After finding a place to park in the garage, I wandered into Smashburger and was happy to see that it was a clean new place. Ample menu of items to choose from, with a small variety of burgers, a hot dog or two and some chicken options as well.I was torn between the BBQ burger and the All American.  I went with the All American, and boy, was it good.  Good came out quick and service was great.  Ya know what else?  They had a bunch of Yelp pens here at the register!!  This brought a smile to my face! Yippie!What I really liked about this place is the burger is juicy, and not dry or "corporate" tasting.  I didn't feel like it was to greasy either.  I found it to actually have flavor on its own as well.  Worth a stop here.I should also mention that this is review #300 for me.  Ya wanna know what else?  I hit 3000 miles on my car yesterday.  Cool, huh?  Possibly a sign, but quite cool that I am doing review #300 and hit 3000 miles on my car in the same day.  Cool.Burgers in my mind are supposed to be grilled over a flame, thick and medium rare. Served with a toasted bun, american cheese with let/tom/pic/mayo and mustard. (It's my review)SB does most of it perfectly. The Bun is a yellow egg bun, toasted and topped with all the required toppings. The toppings were all fresh and very good, including the cheese. The burger, while it is a 1/2 l/b about 1/3 was lapping over the bun. It is a thin, flat fried burger, sort of crispy on one side too. While not my preferred, it was still a good tasting burger. Just not great. IMHO Five guys is better if fried burgers are your thing. The staff was great. The management was great, the place was pretty clean the price was high for what I recieved. $6 burger $1.80 drink.  (it was plenty of food though)3.86 stars
Barro's Pizza=So as you are all aware, football season has commenced.  Now that my roomie and I have NFL Sunday TIcket we are going to be spending football Sundays at home much more often than at the sports bars.  This means having a place that delivers good pizza and wings is a must!We were pleasantly surprised to discover this location delivers to our residence.  I think they have a larger grid than most delivery places which is awesome.  I really can't think of a place that meets all the criteria my roomie and I have to really like a pizza delivery place.  Price, quality, taste, and service are all above average here.  We ordered one of their specials which was an X-Large one topping pizza with 24 wings for 23.99 and a 2 liter of coke.  With taxes, delivery charge, and tip the total came to $34.00.  We ate the pizza and wings for lunch and dinner yesterday, some friends munched on the food too and we STILL have leftovers.  At least half a pizza and a dozen wings.  I would call that getting your money's worth. The pizza doesn't taste generic like the big chains I dare not order from.  I really like the dough, crust, sauce, and cheese.  I also like that they don't COVER the pizza in pepperoni (not a fan but I was outvoted).  Is there better pizza out there? Yes.  But this does exactly the trick on a football sunday.  The wings are delicous.  We had the medium sauce (which they do not skimp on) and it had the perfect amount of heat to it.  There were A LOT of drums which I found surprising.  And these wings came from some fatty fatterson chickens, they are very big and meaty!  Score, score, and score!  One slice of pizza and two wings did me in (I'm sure the beer helped!)Also they gave a delivery time estimate of 45min-1hr and they delivered in less than 40.  Yes, I was keeping track.  Major points scored here. Barros will be getting regular delivery calls from us for the rest of football season!
Cafe Ga Hyang=If you are unfamiliar with Korean cuisine, this would be a good place to start.  What's great about this place is its super low key.  It's situated in a really run down plaza so you wouldn't even know it existed.  Honestly, you would have to do a Yelp Search just to find out.What I like:+ Bibimbap: It's pretty good here, the flavors shine through while keeping the rice slightly crisped for that stone cooking taste.  I can have these weekly!+ Banchan: super good+ Ambiance: its dimmed and chill+ Staff: I've always come here late so I've only known the one lady that takes your order, she is super sweet.+ Hours: Opens till 2am daily.  Awesome! If I ever have a late night crave, I'm coming here for sure+ Pricing: Not terrible but reasonable.The menu  offers plenty of your typical Korean and more.  This place is legit, so if you never had, drop by.Café Ga Hyang was the placed picked for the 5th meet up for the International Supper Club UYE, and I have to say I am extremely thankful for all those who attend!! You guys are amazing!!! Thank you!!Ok like I said Café Ga Hyang was the placed picked, and when I originally called to make reservations for the group, I requested 14, but by the time it was dinner, we had grown to 18!!! Had to have an extra table added to us! Café Ga Hyang was helpful in that and didn't really make a fuss about it!This was my 1st time ever for Korean food, so I was very unsure of what to order, so after looking at the menu I decided to go with Bul Goki, which was sliced beef marinated in a soy sauce base of sorts on a bed of grilled onions, came with a side of steam rice too. In my head I was thinking oh this is like fajitas and I like fajitas. The dish came out piping hot! And I have to say, it was very good!Our server, whom I figured was also owner, was kind of gruff, not so much with the amount of people, just with everything I guess, but sometimes she would come across mad and not listening to you, but then friendly and helpful. I just was not trying to rock the boat haha, the little side dishes came out and she placed them on the table but told us not to eat them, they are for when our food comes out, but some tested the gods and took some of the tofu before our food came out, we were making jokes saying the soup nazi will kick you out! Over all it was a great experience, I would go back and try different dishes, everything looked amazing! it was a great meet up  for the International Supper Club!Please don't judge this place by the "I'm entitled to everything because I'm the customer and the customer is always right" mentality, because the ladies don't give a crap.  If you're hungry, they'll feed you.  If you're looking for the royal treatment, go somewhere else.  This place reminds me of a lot of the restaurants in Korea, where ahjumma's () take your order and treat you like a niece or nephew.  At least they bring you water; a lot of places in Korea are self-service.  In that regards, I can say this place is the most authentic Korean restaurant in the state.  Also, they're open until like 2 AM.  Hell yes.  Most of the food is great.  I'm Korean, and I've tried most of everything on the menu. Yes, their kimchee-jjigae is made differently than my moms, but it's still tasty as hell.  So are a lot of the other dishes and banchans.  You can't expect the same style of Korean food in every restaurants, considering even in the tiny country of Korea, there's an estimated 200 types of kimchee.  That's not accounting for how each family makes theirs a little differently.I'll give you a quick rundown of all the dishes I can remember.Sullung-tang(/):  The one soup I was disappointed with here.  The broth is weak and not very flavorful.  It's so simple and yet so difficult to get this soup right.  It's no wonder there are many restaurants in Korea that specialize in this one soup only.  Galbi-tang():  My go-to soup.  OMG this soup is good.  Go have some and thank me later.  Best combo bite with this: put your rice in the soup.  Get a spoonful of soup and rice and then place a nice fermented piece of kimchee/ggahkdugi on top.  Then place in mouth.  Chew and moan.  Repeat.Shrimp gganpoongi ():  Every person I've taken to this place has loved this.  So much pepper and garlic on it, and yet so good.  They don't skimp out on the shrimp nor the quality/size of the shrimp they use.  Worth every penny.  Don't get as a main dish because that's weird.  Order one for the table and share.  Ddukbok-i ():  I order this without fail every time I go as the standard starting dish.  It's slightly different every time, because it's actually cooked here with fresh veggies and peppers.  So so good.  Again, order this as something to share with your loved ones, ordering it as a main dish is weird.dolsot galbi bibimbap ():  This sizzling bowl of rice with assorted veggies and rib meat is amazing.  See the red ketchup bottle she gives you?  It's not ketchup.  It's magical pepper paste sauce.  Squeeze a pretty pattern on your bowl and mix.  Borrow your neighbors spoon.  It's easier.  Just give them the spoon back full, not empty.  soon dae guk ():  Pork blood sausage soup.  The sausage isn't homemade, but I don't expect it to be.  It'll do to satisfy my craving for it while I'm away from Korea.  The soup?  Amazeballs.  Fresh perilla leaves with roasted seeds gives this soup a new taste you've probably never tasted before.   Jjam-bbong():  It's never been my choice, since I've always been on the Jjajangmyun () side of the Jjajang or Jjambbong (  ?) choice.  Huuuge portions though, and everyone I've seen that ordered it loves it.  If you love seafood and noodles, this is for you.Jjajangmyun (): I've tried this once and didn't really care for it.  Not bad but not amazing like some of the dishes I've reviewed above.  Another reason many restaurants in Korea specialize in this dish.  It's the #1 delivery food in Korea.  Jaeyook-bokkeum ():  stir-fried well-ripened kimchee and pork-belly pieces are a little sweet for my taste but still very good.  One downside, they are very stingy with the meat in this dish.  You've got to go fishing around for it and there's not much to go around.  I've ordered this 2-3 times and it hasn't changed.  Final word:  The Korean law of "Jung" () dictates that when you go enough to be a regular and develop a likable relationship with the staff, the number and amount of premium side dishes and meat chunks in your galbi-tang or fish cakes in your ddukbok-i doubles.Edited:  I typed in all the Korean in parentheses, but I guess yelp doesn't support it.Horrible, just horrible! Went there last night for Korean food and the lady server was so mean to us we had to walk out of there while waiting for our food.First of all, when I asked her about the menu and what her recommendation was, she was like "What do you want me to say? Just order what you like." OK, shook my head and ordered. Then we asked for ban-chan and she said she is not going to give it to us until we get our meal and that we had no common sense. She tried to give us a full lecture about how traditional way of eating Korean food should be. I did not go to this restaurant to get a lecture from this lady. I am Korean and I know how to eat Korean food! I have never received this kind of customer service in my life and I really think this lady needs to learn the basics of customer service. I'm from New York and I thought at least the people would be nicer than this. This is truly a shame that she treats people of her own kind like she did. People, be aware of this restaurant and go to Ohya restaurant which we went to after we escaped this hell hole. The customer service was amazing at Ohya! I don't know if the food might have been better at Cafe Gahyang but I certainly do not want to eat at a restaurant that has a kind of service she provided. Good thing I don't live around this area so I don't have to think about going back there LOL
Las Palmas Carniceria=Finally, after four years in Pittsburgh, I found a real Hispanic grocery store, and it comes with a real taco stand.  I've been grudgingly going to a well-known place in the Strip that charges 20-50% more for a not-so-great selection, but I shall shop there no more now that I've found Las Palmas.  Fully stocked grocery store with great produce (huge pile of tomatillos) and meat - everything you need to make that recipe you found in your favorite Diana Kennedy cookbook.  (Cheap Inca Kola!  Found my fix.)Most of you are more interested in the tacos, and I'll confirm that you can't go wrong there, either.  Real tacos - I tried puerco, barbacoa, and asada.  All were very good; the pork was exceptional - muy rica.  These are the real deal for street tacos, too - just like what I found in Atlanta and San Diego in past lives.  Only $2 (never pay $3 for a taco), and they're stuffed with easily twice as much fillin's as what you'll get at any other taco place in town.  (Note to their competition: tacos shouldn't be huge, but they're not appetizers, either.  I'm tired of eating three at the trendier places and still being hungry.  Four with no sides should completely stuff an adult male.)  The "fixin's" station is nice, too - faster and easier than having to wait on "the guy" to put it on.Four stars for the grocery store and five for the taco stand.  (...And the grocery store takes credit cards.  Hint, hint to all the local shops/restaurants that don't.)I had heard rumors about these delicious tacos.  But I didn't really fully understand it until I had them today.  Today I fully understood their deliciousness.  It's such a simple thing.  One stands at taco stand.  One looks over delicious looking meat.  One chooses between a couple different delicious looking meat including steak and onions, sausage and pork.   One receives taco and walks over to a neat and clean looking buffet of delicious looking toppings.  These toppings include salsa, salsa verde, gauc, tomatoes and onions.  One devours tacos in an animal like fashion because... they're delicious!So for serious, they rocked my world!  And at $2 a pop you can buy a ton without breaking the bank!  I had the steak and the pork.  I liked the pork more because it was uber flavorful.  I also loved the toppings bar because I LOVE to dump toppings on as well.  Although at two tacos I stuffed myself and was full for hours (which does not usually happen!).  Do they beat out Reyna's tacos?  My answer would be they're on par but on different levels because they're just a different style.  That's just my observation.  The more taco stands, the merrier if you ask me.  Bring it tacos!Thank You Las Palmas.Thank you for answering the unsatisfied craving for quality authentic West Coast Mexican food I've had for years since leaving Orange County.Thank you for being that cheap (read $6 for 3 tacos) staple quick food fix when I don't feel like taking the car or bike out to grab some grub.And thank you for offering not only a great taco stand with a variety of fresh simple dressings, but also an always fully and freshly stocked ethnic grocery store where I can find hard to get items for a quarter of the price that competitors charge.As I've watched you expand over the past 3 years...  just PLEASE do me a favor, don't lose sight of what makes you great!Las Palmas is the platonic ideal of the ultimate mexican taco stand.  I'm normally not even a taco fan, but they take it to a completely different level, every savory bite is a transformative flavor experience.  Here is Las Palmas by the numbers:1 other mexican restaurant's all-mexican staff that told me Las Palmas is where THEY all go out to eat2 dollars is the price of each taco.  Each taco is actually wrapped with 2 hand made soft taco tortillas and have a double portion of meat (potato salad is an option for vegetarians), so it's more like 1 dollar per standard size taco.  Gourmet, fresh, delicious mexican at cheaper than taco bell prices!4 is how many tacos I ate.  I ordered 2, left, ate them, and immediately returned to buy more to go to bring home for dinner that night!10 is how many different fresh toppings they have, guacamole, peppers, limes, cilantro, onions and a variety of salsas from mild to absolutely DEADLY hot habaneros!7 is how many days a week I'd happily eat Las Palmas tacos!After living in San Diego for a few years, I was in desperate need of an authentic TJ Style taco, and I have found it here! They serve traditional street style tacos with all your typical toppings. If they man working there tells you a salsa is hot, take his recommendation and don't pour it all over your taco, because chances are, it's really freaking hot!I recommend beef tongue if they have it, but if not, chicken is my second choice. No other Pittsburgh taco place compares to Las Palmas for me! The tacos are $2.50 and 2 will fill me up. (Cash Only for tacos, cards inside the store)
Toast Breakfast Boutique=5/19/102.5 stars.Didn't really care for the interior, and the tables outside weren't beckoning, either.  It was very antiseptic and cold indoors, with only the menu handwritten on the chalkboard, the plain-looking pastry display case (devoid of any ornamentation or even a sign of any effort in making everything inside presentable), and, what looked to me, an antique-looking espresso machine on the counter to lend decoration to the all-white interior.  It was also very noisy indoors, despite the fact that there were only a handful of people!  Ordered the Mascarpone and fig jam on marble rye ($4) and the Lox w/ cream cheese and tomato ($8 or $9), as well as a latte, no sugar.  The coffee came in a paper cup... why?  Made me feel like she wanted me to leave.  Loved the mascarpone and fig!  (So much so, I soon acquired a jar of organic fig jam from Whole Foods, but I need to find good marble rye toast...)  The lox, however, was disappointing.  While I found the flavors palatable, I thought the lox strips were too thin (I had lox at True Foods Kitchen that were wild-caught and larger for only a couple of dollars more), and the cream cheese rectangles looked strange with its right angles (after seeing such a lovely presentation done w/ the Mascarpone and fig jam).  Made me wish I'd had two sets of the toast!It was nice to see that they still roasted the coffee beans on-site.  I wish nothing but success to Toast, but I won't be going back-- at least not for a good long while...
China Star Buffet=$9.99 All-You-Can-Eat Dinner Buffet w/Crab LegsIf you like Chinese food like sweet n sour chicken,lots of seafood stuff like crawfish,crab legs,shrimp and fish.They did have bbq pork but it was kinda tough.Several different soup options, around 60 items to choose from total. Pretty standard chinese buffet fair.They do cook Mongolian "made-to-order" and they have soft serve ice cream.Really can't complain for $10 pp but I'm no fan of asian food to start this certainly did nothing to change my mind.Pretty boring and fishy! But still good cheap eats for those that like Chinese Cuisine.
808 Sushi=WHERE: Durango & Warm Springs (in the Vons center right next to Cold Stone Creamery)WHAT: I came here to eat once with my friend. We were both first-timers so ofcourse we had to do AYCE!! The only things worth remembering was the service was great!! (Made me bump one up on my star rating)The food, on another note, was good. The mochiko chicken appetizer was bombness!! I tried a couple of their specialty rolls, and I don't know if it was me, but they all started tasting the same!!I may have to go back and eat there again to actually remember my likes and dislikes, but the only thing I can remember was that it was one of the okay sushi places I've tasted!Oh!! One of the best things there was the Ahi Poke!!! If you love Ahi Poke as much as I do, then that definitely is a MUST! =DCan't go wrong here great sushi at a cheap price! The staff is always friendly and are on top of their game when it comes to service. Now as far as the food it's good quality and always fresh! I only come during happy hour and I always get the garlic chicken which is full of flavor and very tender plus it's only $2.95 I believe which is craziness! I also order the crunch roll which is like 3 bucks and I order the deep fried Cali roll which is delicious and also costs like 2.95. So I end up getting 3 different items for the price of 1 roll at every other sushi place. Good sushiGood service Good prices Can't go wrong here!Never had a worse experience at any restaurant. The main thing that rattled my nerves was the service. I had recently moved into the neighborhood and had a late-night sushi craving, so I thought I would try this place out. When I walked in, I noticed right away that it looked like this place was being ran by a bunch of kids. Granted, the hostess/server didn't do anything wrong, they certainly weren't inviting. I sat myself at the sushi bar. After looking over the all you can eat menu, i told the waitress that i had decided to do that. They informed me that it was just a little passed 10pm and that last call was 10:30. I have been to a few all you can eat sushi places in Vegas around closing and understood the last call rule, but the way the said it to me made me feel like I was inconveniencing them. Let me first start by saying, the menu was very limited compared to other sushi establishments around the city! I was sitting (literally) right in front of the two sushi 'cooks.' Neither of them acknowledged me, but instead were speaking about some of the tables in the restaurant, making fun of them, and bad-talkng the hispanic cooks in the kitchen line behind them.After about 5 minutes of just sitting there, the server came by and took my order. I was craving a baked roll--like a lasagna. They had one similar, so i ordered that, along with a couple others. Right when one of the cooks (bigger guy that seems to have been in charge) saw my order, he told me he couldnt make that roll because he was out of scallops. I know, for a fact, they didn't run out of scallops because I saw one of the prep cooks with them. For whatever reason, they just didn't want to deal with it. Anyhow, I ordered something in place of that roll. While waiting and observing these guys go back and forth about how they cant wait to get out and huffing and puffing every time someone ordered something else, I couldn't help but to think "why am i spending money in this place?!" I sat there for seriously just about 10min for two rolls. When I was finished with those, I was expecting my other to come up...waited for another 10 minutes before the 'cook' realized he forgot to start making it.To shorten up this review a bit, I am gonna leave it at that. The service was awful and the food was crap. Please people, drive a little further and spend your money at Goyemon (or even Oyshi)! At least you know they appreciate your business, you'll get good service and the food is great (speaking of Goymeon).
Over Easy=We've driven by the PHX Over Easy many times but I refuse to wait for it.  I knew in my heart that it wasn't the same type of food worth waiting for like Matt's.  We decided to head way out to the apparently non-popular Over Easy to see what all the fuss was about.  To sum it up, just don't bother!We walked inside and the place was only about 1/2 full so we grabbed a seat in the middle where there were three terribly placed tables.  My first impression was not a good one, as this restaurant is horribly under utilized and very poorly planned.  The color scheme was nice and cheerful though.  I really really hated the vinyl chairs that clung to my legs.  It was really uncomfortable.After perusing the menu for a few moments I decided that the Wolf Pack was the way to go for me.  I like big manly breakfasts and this sounded perfect!  Two layers of hash browns with bacon and eggs cooked to order in the middle with cheese on top.  Yum!  That really sounded delicious to me, unfortunately it was a big heaping pile of FAIL slopped on a plate.  The bacon was about the only good part of my meal.  The cheese tasted like plastic, the eggs were rubbery, and the hash browns were so greasy that they slicked my lips with oil after every bite.  In the end, despite the fact that I only ate about 1/3 of my food, I got sick.  I was not a happy camper and I will never come back.NEEDS A NAME CHANGE ....... to Over RatedA military mess hall, has more class then this anomaly.    OVERLY rated ......    OVERLY poor service .......    OVERLY misrepresented by the Food Network    OVERLY priced .......    OVERLY praised ......    OVERLY poor location ......    OVERLY not worth another visit .......I can only OVERLY warn others .......... To stay away..My Ethics .... My Standards:Every business starts with one star ..... GETTING MORE .... HAS TO BE EARNED.Food is decent. Service is slow and unresponsive. They brought half our food and then we had to sit and stare at our food over 8 minutes before the other half came. It took three asks to get syrup. The server wrote our order wrong. They have a tight waiting area which feels right on top of people eating.Let me clarify one thing. Breakfast is my favorite meal but I never real make it out for breakfast cause I like to sleep in on the weekends. Saying this. I was watching Triple D on the Food Network and saw this place. Home made everything. So the next day I had to go out of my way for brunch to try this place out. OE was hard to find but it's between the Ice Den and Mountainside Fitness. There was so many good dishes on Triple D I couldn't decide. So I went with Chicken Fried Steak, scrambled eggs, and hash browns. All I have to say is oh my gosh Yum Yum. CFS was so good but the gravy made it great. Gravy was home made with chunks of sausage. The hash browns are home made too and outstanding. My wife had the home made corn beef hash with poached eggs, and sweet potato tots. Great dish too. CFH was really good and the tots was really delish. My daughter had the Wolfpack with hash browns, eggs and bacon. She gobbled it down and the bacon was thick and really good. Service was really good. We only had to wait a few minutes to get our table. Once seated, we were served right away. Drinks were refilled on a regular basis. Brunch was so good. I can't wait to go again and try more dishes. All I can say is great breakfast joint so enjoy.The food was good and I liked the place, but if you walk out from your meal feeling angry, it's hard to give any more than one star. We had a Living Social deal. I guess they wish they hadn't sold them because when I got my check there was a "$4.00 service charge". When I asked about it, I was told that they impose what amounts to a 40% tax on the deal "otherwise we don't make any money"That is not disclosed anywhere so I'm disclosing it here.
Savor Cafe & Catering=Wow...I was absolutely blown away by this little treasure on Morehead. Holy deliciousness, Savor Cafe!Let me first establish (my) rules for eating at Savor Cafe:1) You must save room and daily caloric intake for...       a) their house made strawberry lemonade (it's incredible)       b) their desserts...I practically licked the plate2) Take the server's suggestions - she didn't steer me wrong even onceSo, now that that's established here's what I devoured at Savor Cafe:1) Farmers sandwich: Big, thick slices of fresh mozzarella and tomato accompanied by fresh basil and set between two of the most delicious slices of herb topped focaccia I've ever tasted. This tasty sammie also came with a side of my choice...2) Mac 'n cheese: Sooooo rich and buttery I could only manage a few bites as I was making sure to save room for....3) Peanut Butter pie: OMG. An extremely generous portion of heaven on a plate. Creamy peanut butter pie (made with cream cheese) and a chocolate crust. For $5 this was out of control. YUM.Oh I will be back, Savor Cafe, I'm going to be back to your adorably appointed, sweet little cafe in absolutely no time flat.
Andrew's Steak & Seafood=Inside the Rivers Casino there are several restaurants, Andrew's Steakhouse being the 'High-End" restaurant among them. We have been here oh, I'll just say numerous times, including fourth of July to eat and watch the fireworks. How do you see the fireworks, well the backside of the restaurant is all floor to ceiling windows looking out over, across, up and down the river. Also there is a backside patio dining area under cover but with outstanding views including up the Mt. Washington hillside. In this warm months this is a very pleasant or even perhaps an outstanding al fresco dining scene.So what do I like best here; the food and views.And the least, a bit noisy from the casino and intermittently slow service.Our usual starting place would be the Bluepoint oysters on the half shell, which are always nicely presented and tasting fresh out of the water. They are accompanied by Cocktail sauce, Mignonette, and Horseradish sauce. Some of our other favorite starters are the French Onion Soup with Applejack Brandy, and Calamari which is served with Lemon Aioli and Arrabbiata sauce dipping which has a nice complexity and heat to it. The Calamari is delicious and very tender.We alternate between the salads all of which are pretty good. I especially enjoy the beet salad. This has read and yellow roasted baby beets, with goat cheese, frisee and arugula and a Sherry vinegar reduction. These flavors all work together so nicely.So far, we have not tried the seafood, chicken or burgers. But the Steaks, Prime rib and the Lamb are what we are drawn to.The Bone In Ribeye done medium rare is just bursting with flavor and practically melts in your mouth. This is an outstanding steak, one which I come back for often.Linda loves the Rack of Lamb. This Lamb is mild, tender, beautifully prepared and very delicious for you lamb lovers. We have had Lamb all over the country and this stands up to the best we have had including Jamison Farms (actually from here in Latrobe, but served around the country in the best restaurants, and Elysian Fields (also local to Green county and served in around the United States). Example, Thomas Keller famed Chef of the French Laundry in California serves Pennsylvania Lamb.One other item worthy of note, there is a very great bar in here with seating and several High-top tables. Overall this is a very good choice if you are seeking the high-end steakhouse kind of dinner and experience. I think the Ribeye here might be the best int he city.
Sofia's Pizza=I can't stand the owner here after a few short or I mean alot of short comings here I finally complained brought my pizza to them after being delivered and they are a total rip off and all the owner could tell me was"THIS IS MERICA BABY" THAT'S WHAT WE DO! This place is total b.s. And they wouldn't remake my pizza after I complained one of my extra toppings I paid for wasn't on the pizza but then again he did pick his hands through my pizza and found one... Lol UN believable then told me to take it back...I told him I wouldn't even feed my dogs his pizza keep it and leftFound this place via Yelp search after a long day at work, no lunch break, and a killer wing craving- unfortunately, the wings offered here are not buffalo style, as I assume when ordering wings at a pizza place.Order of wings for one comes with a side of fries (option for regular, curly, or upgrade to onion rings) containing 8-10 pieces per their website. Sauce options are medium, mild, hot, and bbq. The "hot" wings are  sauced prior to baking, and overcooked to the point of being dry, sauce itself seems to be sriarcha-based and includes red pepper flakes- a combination I've never seen or heard of on wings. Unpleasant at best, ended up tossing half the order despite my hunger.Curly fries were decent- then again, they were my only option. Ample portion, would prefer ketchup packets to the weird shot glass of ketchup I actually received, but an order of fries won't make me a repeat visitor.Location is small but decently clean, cashier was polite. Group of smokers on the patio made for an unpleasant smoke odor- may have been employees as one of the group got up, entered the dining room, went behind the counter and removed a bottled beverage from the cooler, then went outside to drink it, without saying a word to me as I waited to pick up my order. "Bizarre" describes both the location and the wings.
Mastrioni's=Pretty good!  This is one of those neighborhood restaurants where the servers know practically every customer.  So it did feel like we were crashing a party.  Still, the baked clams (oreganate, whatever that means) and eggplant parmigiana were both amazing and the service was good.  And they serve red wine at the correct temperature (slightly chilled).  Amazing!Interesting dessert options that I did not get to try.  Roasted banana gelato, for example, sounded yummy but we were just too full from the fried food.Full liquor license but I didn't see an actual bar.  There is a bar that overlooks the kitchen but I couldn't figure out where the alcohol was coming from.The hostess looked like she wanted to kill me in my sleep, though.  That was a little awkward.  Still, a good neighborhood joint.It's located in a strip mall and doesn't look like much, but the interior is sleek, modern, and beautiful. On the Sunday night we were there it was surprisingly busy with most of their tables full by 7pm.I got one of their specials, a seafood risotto ($30) full of squid, scallops, mussels, and shrimp. There was rarely a bite without seafood. Unfortunately, it was bland and forced me to do what I rarely do in any restaurant -- reach for the salt shaker. I had to use it several times to liven up the dish. The portion size was huge, but it also lacked the creaminess of a great risotto.If you're a fan of chicken parmagiana, the one here is bound to please with a zesty and full bodied sauce. I can't remember having a better version anywhere in town. It was accompanied by a huge side of spaghetti, which made for some great left overs the next day.They do have a kid's menu with a few pasta options.3.5 StarsI tried this place for the first time tonight and it was alright. Service was good, everyone was friendly and water was kept full. Going over the menu I was a little surprised to see some appetizers in the $20 range but the entrees were reasonable averaging $18-25 and a little more if you chose seafood or steak. I ordered the Chicken Parmigiana including  a side of fettucine with marinara sauce. It was pretty good! Large portion and perfect amount of mozzerella. However the tomato sauce was very watery and the pasta was definitely undercooked. My boyfriend ordered the Pork Tenderloin with apricot sauce and said the flavor was good. However, portion wise, looked pretty funny next to my chicken parmigiana. Very tiny!!  McDonald's burger patties were thicker than these tenderloin slices lol. He also had the same problem with his pasta side of being undercooked.Honestly, I probably wouldn't come back here again since this area has tons of options but I'm glad we gave it a try.One of my new favorite places to eat. The service was excellent and so was the food. The restaurant itself is nice with very modern decor. I wasn't crazy thrilled about the music. It was very "elevator type". The jazzy kind that puts you right to sleep. Other than that, our waiter was super attentive. A bit eccentric, but was very on top of his tables. We had:Caesar salad. It was good, but it was pretty overpriced for how small it was. It was the size of a small side salad for $12. The crab cocktail. Again, it was overpriced for how little of crab you get. It's maybe 1-2 full snow crab legs for $21. That's just silliness. For the entrees - oddly enough, they're decently priced. The Shrimp and Scallop Vodka Penne - very yummy. Would recommend on angel hair pasta. Sea Bass Picatta - Mother, this was good. The Seabass just melts in your mouth...better than chocolate. I love any white fish with a good citrus butter sauce. So freaking excellent. Overall, everything was good. We were super happy with our experience.Seafood is the name of the game here at Mastrioni's. We dined here for lunch during a work lunch and I made reservations ahead of time. We arrived early and there was no wait but the restaurant filled up quickly. Despite arriving before the crowd we were a little disappointed to get very little attention there at first. Drinks, menus and bread were slow to come.  Once we got the attention of our waiter it was still slow to get appetizers and entrees ordered but we were happy to indulge in bread as we waited.Our entire table ordered fish dishes. I went with the halibut piccata and we shared the bruschetta as an appetizer. The bruschetta had a huge amount of tomato. It was delicious. The fish was well prepared. I enjoyed everything about my meal. The service was lackluster but I am still excited to come back and try them again.
Connolly's Sports Grill=Came here with a bunch of Broncos fans for the AFC Championship game and they did a nice job making us all feel at home, with plenty of shout outs over the PA to get our group riled up.  Connolly's Sports Grill is a pretty comfortable sports bar with plenty of TVs.  The food was decent, but portions are a little on the small side for a sports bar.Went with an order of the potato skins, which were very small for the price.  There were only 4 of them, but they were good.  Real bacon always helps.  Next up was a chicken philly, made with cheese wiz, like they do in Philly (although other cheeses are an option if you wish).  I thought this was one of the better chicken philly's I've had, chopped up and sautéed with onions and bell peppers, served on a nice soft roll, with the cheese wiz holding everything together nicely.And now for the joke of the day....someone at our table ordered the fish and chips.  While nobody complained about the flavor of the fish and chips, one piece looked a little suspicious in shape.  Could it be?  Did they confuse the fish and chips order and give us....Spotted Dick?  As soon as it arrived to the table, cameras started coming out and I knew photos of this "codpiece" were destined to go viral.  It was returned to the kitchen from whence it came, as no man nor woman could take a bite.  I'm sure looking at the picture, you all can understand why.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/connollys-sports-grill-phoenix#jCc8G2-5-vXaskiY3YayIQWe finished up with a pretty good dessert of rolled cinnamon tortillas, deep fried, and topped with caramel and vanilla ice cream.  Overall if you are in the neighborhood and need a sports bar, Connolly's is a good choice.
Griddlecakes=Sorry fellow yelpers... This place didn't cut it for me.  We stopped in for breakfast.  I read other reviews and people really loved it! She came to get out drink orders and left menus for us to look at.  My husbands menu had milk all over the inside of it.  So tip #1... Wipe down your menus.  Tip #2... Wipe down your tables also.  Had finished my coffee and had to wait for our meals to be delivered to get my second cup.  Hmmm.  No problem because my food was in front of me now.I ordered the Crab Cake Eggs Benedict.  It came with a side of potatoes.  The Benedict was good! Had a unique flavor and the hollandaise didn't overpower.  The potatoes however... Wah Wah.  They were so disappointing that I didn't have more than two small bites.  They were too mushy with not enough crisp on the outside.  Bummer.  Now for the real let down.  My husband ordered the country fried steak.  He was actually enjoying it until...   A HAIR was found in it.  That completely ruined our appetites and breakfast was over.  So tip #3... Wear hair nets in the kitchen please.  I will say that our waitress was very friendly and courteous.  We didnt say anything about the hair to her.  We were just ready to leave.  I don't see us coming back anytime soon.  Real bummer.I now know why this is place has only 3 1/2 stars. I Decided to come here for some Sunday brunch, which is my favorite day for snacking adventures, and I was pretty disappointed. Everything here looked appetizing, but in this case looks were definitely deceiving. Griddlecakes is located in a small space in a strip mall, which means your wait time can be anywhere from 5 minutes to 45 minutes. Lucky enough, I only waited for about 15 minutes then was promptly seated. Before I knew it; I had three coffees in front of me: two hot, one cold, two glasses of ice water and a cup of ice. Can you say "overly helpful" wait staff? I'm not complaining about that, it was great that I didn't have to ask for anything because they were so on it! The food arrived shortly after, like I said before it LOOKED amazing, I ordered the "Philly Skillet", this is a deconstructed philly cheese-steak sandwich minus the bread. It comes on a bed of potatoes a lot of delicious melted cheese and to add to this heaping mound of meat, cheese, and cardiac arrest, I also ordered a side of biscuits and gravy. This is where the meal starts to go downhill. The biscuits where ok, but the gravy was watery and pretty bland. The "Philly Skillet" was ok, but over-salted. Everything was cooked well, the steak was perfect, the potatoes were firm, but almost every bite had to be followed with a sip of water. I went through two glasses of water while eating this and I didn't even finish the whole thing. My brunching buddy ordered the "Crab Cakes Benedict" and the "Red Velvet" Pancakes"; these too were disappointing. The crab cakes had a very fishy taste, like the meat was from a can. The hollandaise sauce was good, but not good enough to save the dish. The Red Velvet Pancakes, were also a loss. These just tasted like a flat red velvet cake, very dense not fluffy like a pancake should be. They also had a raspberry sauce drizzled on top, which was peculiar. Normally you don't associate red velvet cake with raspberries.  My review for Griddlecakes is a tad tough; I was teetering between a three star review and a two star review. I decided to go with the two star review because this food was not "A-OK". This location is very clean and the service is impeccable. The food just fell far short of what I was expecting, over-salted and questionable flavor choices. I WILL be coming back to Griddlecakes because I believe in second chances for both people and foodies alike.
Cafe International=Too funny, first of all Julia S and I set out today to use my coupon book and where do we end up? Cafe International with no coupon. We get way suckered into fun. We just can't help it. Julia S told me she wanted to go to Cafe International because taxis were always outside, little did we know  some of the Cafe International family drives cabs.  A man with a Carolina Cab jacket sat us and gave us menus.  I loved this.We sit down to a crazy, festive little restaurant, with a bar and a tiny room off to the side with a pool table. Very interesting. They stay open till 2a and serve food til midnight. So if you need to get your injera  (Injera is a yeast-risen flat bread with a unique, slightly spongy texture.) on before midnight, this is the place.We shared a veggie plate with salad, greens, lentil mush mix and a potato, carrot, onion mixture. I have to say, I loved it, it's quirky and comforting. If you haven't eaten Ethiopian food, you don't get a fork, just go for it, scoop up everything with the blanket of bread and most importantly, the food is served on the injera, start with the injera with the food on it. These are the best bites. Don't wait til you are full to start enjoying the most perfect bites.It was also very inexpensive, our lunch was $10. I have been craving Ethiopian food for two weeks, you would think that I had my fill, it's really just unleashed the beast. I want more.
Schatz Dining Hall=People don't go to Carnegie Mellon because the food is good.  I had a meeting at the beginning of the semester here, and the food was just kind of edible.  We came in for the breakfast buffet, and the place was pretty empty at 8:30 AM.  The made to order omelettes were OK but took forever.  I waited 20 minutes with one person in front of me, which is kind of absurd.  The bagels were low grade store quality, and the juices were all high-sugar choices.  The fruit didn't look so good either.  I'm really glad that I'm a graduate student who doesn't have to eat on campus.I don't really know what the price is, but unless someone else is paying, I would skip the dining hall.  The dining hall has plenty of seating, which is nice, though.
Carniceria El Mexicano=Don't be too shocked,a carniceria in the barrio of El Mirage. However this one rocks.  The pollo preparado or chicken faijita meat is the sole reason I visit this tiny hole in the wall and a near weekly basis!!!  Its the best hands down.  Food City has nothing on them in terms of pollo.  Grab a few pounds of marinated chicken, a bag of real tortillas (no mission tortillas for me thank you!!) and fire up your grill!!  Invite your friends over and its fajita night!!! Their mexican cheeses are great too.  I prefer the ranchero and my hubby the cotija.  They both are great in the fajitas.The meats are good too, just pick your cut and they add the meat to a bag of marinade and you're out the door.  Fair warning, this is in El Mirage!  Don't be to surprised if English is the second language here!! There have been many times the check out girl told me my total in Spanish.  The guys behind the meat counter speak english so you're safe.Also this place has recently changed names it is now Carniceria Uruapan.  its right next door to the cell phone place.
Thai E-San=While there seems to be a saturation of Thai restaurants in the Central Corridor, I'm not one to complain when something new comes along the pike. And Thai E-San is a welcome addition to the eateries in our area. And being opened less than a week didn't stop us from trying this place out. For starters, Thai E-San took over the former Big Wong space. Since I'd not been in there in ages, I'm not sure if the new tenets did a massive overhaul or if they moved into this clean space. It feels more like you're visiting your Asian aunt than walking into a restaurant. The tables and chairs are so huge, I felt dwarfed by them. The multicolored lights cast interesting hues in the room. But it is a little too cold, temperature-wise for me. Okay, on to the food. Robert M ordered the crispy pork with Chinese broccoli; I ordered the beef Mas-Sa-Mun curry. Robert's meal wasn't exactly what he expected, which would have been cubed pork chops battered and deep fried. Rather, it was pork with the skin still on and crispy. I liked it. The Mas-Sa-Mun was beef stewed in a coconut milk sauce with potatoes, green onions and peanuts. I'll get it again, but hotter than mild as it lacked the kick. But, I ordered weak so that's what I received. There were a few hiccups: service wasn't very attentive, the dishes came out at different times, another table received soup instead of fried rice (but the guy was a nimrod who insisted on eating with chopsticks and proceeded to holler at the staff from across the room), and the bill was delayed in its arrival. All things that should iron themselves out as the staff--which appeared relatively new to waiting tables--grow more accustomed to their craft and the kitchen becomes better choreographed. The prices seems a little high, but in these times I feel like any amount could be construed as "too high." I'll definitely be back, but to order different items and find their signature dishes. I'm thinking their "Special noodles, Soup" items are looking mighty fine and the lunch specials sound like a great bargain, starting at $7.95 for a lunch dish, fried wonton, egg roll and cup of soup.Definitely the prettiest Thai restaurant!  I walked in to meet with one of my favorite girls, Ayesha S., and saw her sitting at a HUGE table.  Huge.  For two of us.  It was a big, round, marble monstrosity but very stylish.  We started out with the spring rolls with shrimp.  They came out and they were gigantic!  That must be the theme here.  Definitely fresh ingredients and nothing in it was overdone.  Service was a little spotty at the beginning, but improved during our meal.  They refilled out drinks a few times without having to be asked.I got the spicy mussels.  They came on a big (HUGE) platter with a few sauteed veggies and a spicy sauce.  I know mussels aren't very good as a leftover, so I ate them all.   I didn't feel stuffed like Thanksgiving at the end of the meal, but properly sated.I will definitely be back again.  I'd like to try a few more items on the menu.  Like Ayesha, I'd like to see more heat.  "If it don't make ya cry, why would ya eat it??"I'd also like to meet the owner.  I mean, since everything is so huge...maybe it's a reflection? ;}I felt a little like Honey I Shrunk The Customer sitting in those large chairs at these massive granite and wood tables. Community tables are so risky as most people do not like them. I, on the other hand, enjoy them. We were seated at one end and then joined soon after by a very nice couple. We bantered back and forth a bit and he realized he knew me from my restaurant. Love that!So, as I said above we were seated. And then waited. And waited. And. Waited. Some. More. Eventually waters were dropped but no beverage order was taken. Again, waiting. Cue the Jeopardy theme music. Finally one of the two servers came by (and in all honesty, they were pretty busy) and dropped off soups, which come with the $6.49 lunch special. Yummy! I ordered tofu fried rice and Rickie had sweet and sour pork. Mine was fantastic, though sadly they neglected to include my spring roll. I would have flagged someone down but I was consumed with worry over my table mate's missing food. They served her friend's food yet hers took at least 10 minutes. Strange. Rickie wasn't pleased with his dish as it was pretty teeny tiny!Two lunch specials. Two beverages for $18. Not bad. Oh. The decor is so Thai...bright green and gold speckled walls with beautiful Thai rugs. And. Then. For some odd Asian reason...like at China Chili random pieces of scrap paper taped to the walls saying "Dessert. Mango Sticky Rice".With a little gay spray I could bump this baby up a star!This place is a farce and a travesty...  as are all over priced banquet style Thai places that place a premium on marketability at the expense of food taste and quality.  It's the sort of place that fat English guys wanting to recreate their holiday in Pattaya or Koh Samui would go.   Again, I go back to my rule about ethnic restaurants - the less people of that ethnicity you see patronizing the place the less likely you are to get a great meal.  Although they do serve authentic Isan food on their menu - they recreate it unfaithfully and only in shades of what you really get in Thailand.  Isan, is a poorer, ethnic minority in Northeastern Thailand that is significantly influenced by Laos.  True Isan food is amazing - usually eaten with hand fulls of sticky rice - larb (ground meat, mint, and lime) , som tum (papaya salad), gai yang (grilled chicken), and sai krok isan (isan sausage). Any restaurant claiming to be the standard bearer of Isan food, should serve these dishes with mastery.  Thai E-San does offer them, albeit at a ridiculous premium, but does so disappointingly.  It is sad to see such a great regional cuisine get such a terrible representative here in Phoenix.  Save your money and go elsewhere... unless you are an English tourist in need of nostalgia... in which case, proceed with my blessing!Heat seekers, Thai E-San and Thai food in general knows how to serve up the heat!For Thai food, I always order a soup, some kind of noodle, Thai tea and dessert. So to start, I did share with my room mate for dinner so let that be known before I am deemed a glutton. We did the Seafood Tom Yum, Pad See Ew and Mango Sticky Rice.The Thai tea was good, sweet and strong (I didn't sleep till 3AM).Seafood Tom Yum had good flavor, not MSG laden, filled with seafood (mussels, scallops, shrimp, squid) Pad See Ew with beef, yummy flat rice noodles with strips of beef, savory and spicy!Mango Sticky Rice was good, though the rice was a bit too wet for my liking and the portion I felt was a bit small for the price point.For all the food, we asked for Medium heatwise and I thought it was perfect! I do like spicy food though, but there is a burn!All in all, Thai E-San puts out solid Thai food. The owner came by to talk to us and also made sure everything was alright with the food. The food tastes pretty authentic to me!
Off Da Hook Soul Food=I love Lolo's Chicken & Waffles just as much as the next sheep but Off Da Hook Soul Food is where its at...NOW.  There's a new place that popped up on Glendale just east of 19th Ave which is a must go.  All Soul Food...All the Time...7 days a week in fact.Get there asap..for a soul food experience you just might like more than Lolo's..Im just keeping it real because I think I rushed to this place because although Lolo's was my go-to spot, it was starting to become my have-to spot who occasionally gave me soggy waffles and fried chicken someone dropped the salt shaker in that day.Note. I did not get to try the Mac & Cheese at Off Da Hook so that Lolo's still holds my top Macaroni and Cheese spot.OKFried Chicken Wings:Moist, Crispy, Not Greasy (seriously, it was all crispy grease-free skin, weird but very pleasant), less salt-mo pepper seasoning which is what I meant by this is a whole notha chicken compared to what I am used to... but I am freakin in love with itFries:Good and with the all necessary seasoned saltCorn Bread:Bread, not a muffin, but I can live with that as long as I can slather hot sauce or honey on it I'm goodWaffle:Extra Brown, Extra Crispy, Moist on the inside, and served with a modest amount (not a half cup) of whipped butter and some thick a** syrup in that pretty little glass syrup bottle.  Best waffle Ive ever had.  I always felt something missing from all the waffles Ive done before, but now I know the lasting brown crisp was what I have been missing because something needs to stand up to syrup.  Don't anyone come after me saying their waffle was burnt because just wait till your syrup lays all over that and you will know what it is I'm talking bout.Kool-Aid:Kick you in the pants sweet, but with all that ice it all smooths outPrice:Average soul food prices$7.00 - $9.00 a plate$1.00 - $4.00 per sideGreat basket specials like 8 wings & fries for $10, or 2 wings & fries for $4 I think? Atmosphere:Typical, but lotsa people for only being a week, and it was nice to bask in a restaurant stinking with the sweet spice smell of homemade sweet potato pie.Service:Great service, waiter repeats all you ordered back to you, got my drinks to me within 5 minutes, food within 20 more minutes and totally-totally made up for the macaroni and cheese shortage.4 stars for now...I wanted to do 5 but I didn't get to try more since my tummy can only handle so much goodness on one Friday night.You will love it as an incredible change from the typical have-to spot.Tonight we found our new little hole in the wall joint. Brand new at this location ( the owner has another in the camelback swapmart)  this is one sweet little find. Housed in a small restaurant that just opened in the beginning of January . Clean and neat as you enter this place ,  it seems ready to meet all your soul food needs. The menu offers such standards as fried chicken , fried catfish , ribs,  waffles and my new favorite  fried shrimp. We we first entered the service was a bit off , with many people coming in for take out and us sitting down we kind of got lost in the crowd. But soon our waiter got back to us with apologies and we were ready to start the meal.   For tonight's meal we had Catfish , cornbread , yams , fried shrimp, cabbage , beans and rice and sweet potatoe pie.   From the first taster we were happy with our choice to stop in. With tons of pepper and soul this food made us feel homestyle good. We were impressed with each item with exception to the macaroni and cheese , which  was a bit bland in comparison to bursts of flavor in everything else.  Big favorite were  the cabbage -wow what a tasty surprise great home seasoning and velvety taste. We also really liked the sweet potato pie , it was in a light crust and had a delicate flavor not overly sweeten and very smooth. The owner is a big sweetheart of a guy and offered us a taste of his new macaroni salad which tasted like dear old moms.  Yum! If you go give a call and ask if they are serving your favorite because with the great tastes they are serving they go quick!   Can't wait to go back and try the ribs!I'm fi'in to be back soon.  Oh yea.It won't matter what you get it on, as long as you get the breading.  The breading.   !!    Somehow this stuff defies the laws of physics and packs more good stuff into its thin, crispy layers than should be able to fit.  !!I had a Pork Chop Sandwhich with fries for $6.50, and the chop was HEE-UGE.  You can get catfish, chicken, whatever.  Get something breaded.   (!!)  I'm sure the ribs are great, but they don't have them breaded, so forget it.  (Just kidding - I wanted ribs, but they weren't ready yet. "He won't serve them until they're tender enough," said the server, of the chef.)I also overheard a neat conversation about how they wanted to be sure to be able to advertise "GREEN", and that, among other things to that effect, all of the interior decorating -- chairs, tables, wainscotting, etc -- was recycled.   Fabulous.  Do they come breaded?Fans of the Fantastic Indoor Swap Mart may recognize Off Da Hook as one of the dining options at that swap. Now, you can get your soul on without being inundated by the minor freak show that is FISM, unless you're like me and enjoy such things. Off Da Hook is appropriately named, because they have the best soul food north of downtown, hands down. The chicken and waffles combine perfectly, with crispy juicy chicken atop a wonderfully tasty waffle. The greens were wonderful, but I found the mac and cheese a little on the weak side. Nothing a little hot sauce didn't fix. As has been our experience as all soul food restaurants, the service was impeccable. Attentive, amicable and efficient. Ambiance is lacking, but who has time to look around the room once you get this food? The prices did seem a tad high, but if you want great food and service, it's just what you have to do. Solid.We can't give anything more than a 1 star. We hate feeling that way because we love to support local businesses. It might've been that we came on the wrong day but we weren't the only unhappy patrons there. Since we've moved to Phoenix,  we have really been craving soul food. And the reviews have led us here first. To start off, we walked in and the first thing was the smell. Just got done cleaning maybe? But it shouldn't smell like you're reusing the water or rag or whatever it is that you're using to clean. As we are looking at the menu on the wall, the chef walks up to the front and hands us the menu & informed us that the guy taking our order will be right back. (He was across the street buying ice for the soda machine). Shouldn't this have been taken care of before you open? We were there for 15 minutes waiting for him to come back when the chef finally decides to put our order in first. So we're sitting & waiting & still waiting. For a very long time. The guy with the ice finally comes back & fills the machine & heads to the back. A woman then walks in & heads back there as well. Now we are a little less agitated, given that the chef finally has help, maybe our food would be out sooner. By the way, the other patrons were there before us and had been sitting down & looked comfortable when we walked in. Anyways, needless to say, almost 40 minutes later, the food comes out for both tables. Ours came first even though they were there way before us. Now at this point we were both thinking, this better be the best damn food in town considering it just took 3 people almost an hour to prepare. Nope. We were so wrong. My face definitely showed. And we figure the other couple thought the same because they just packed up the food & left. I tried the platter with a little bit of everything, porkchop, catfish & fried chicken. With Mac & cheese & greens for my sides. Far from soul food & left a pretty bad taste in our mouth. The catfish was powerfully salty. The chicken was tremendously greasy & you can certainly tell the grease was not properly cleaned. The porkchop was dry & more breading than meat. Now I love spicy and the greens were spicy. Too spicy because we couldn't taste the greens. Not good. So far everything is just upsetting me more and more & at this point I just want to go. We just spent $55 for not even mediocre food. He ordered catfish dinner with 2 sides of mac & a Waffle that never came because they said it kept burning. How do you burn a Waffle using a wafflemaker? So they packed our Waffle and sweet potato pie togo. We never left a restaurant ready to go to another but we were starving. We had to decide though because we just spent $55, so we would just have to settle for something cheap and fast. Smh. Before we left, the guy that went and got the ice comes out and ask how the food was. I, on one hand couldn't say anything because It wasn't going to be nice. My husband however wanted them to feel good. I wanted to punch him because he lied and that's not helping them if he lied and said it was good. He proceeded to tell us that he had just got back to the restaurant and that he use to be the cook. He knows the food wasn't good and next time he'll be sure he is the one cooking. I was shocked. So you know the food was bad and still served us but more shocked because he came out talking bad about his coworker. That's not a good look. Even worse, the chef comes out 2 minutes later & apologized for the wait & also apologized for the food & that next time we come, it will be better! You guys could only imagined my face at this point. So you also knew we didn't enjoy the food and still took our money. Shame. Oh but he wasn't done. He then proceeded to inform us that he was working with 2 adults that acted like children. That he was better off by himself. Double shocked!!!! They are in there just bashing each other behind one another's back. SMHx2. We said thank you & we left. Walked up to the car and trying to decide where to go eat because we were starving. We got in the car and decided to try the pie & waffle. Oh to my horror, the pie filling looked like it came out of a can. And the pie crust wasn't all the way ready. I was sick looking at it but I tried the filling and bad, it was bad. On to the waffle. My husband opened the boxed & just threw up his arm & asked me WTF IS THIS? They still managed to give us a burnt one. But of course, we tried it anyways & yes, it was the absolute worst Waffle in history. It actually made the food look really good. We were really disappointed and only hoped this is not a daily occurrence. Needless to say, we gave our dog the food. Even though she ate it, I don't trust her because she drinks out the toilet & loves to sniff butt.
Tacos N More=Yuck! Low quality food at high prices. We won't be back. I already said this in tips but worth mentioning again that $2.05 for a regular size fountain drink is ridiculous. The kid's quesadilla has too much cheese that doesn't get melted all the way and the amount of grease is disgusting.
Two Hippies Dropped Out of College and Opened a Pizzeria=Two Hippies Dropped Out of College and Opened Up a Pizzaria, whew what a name eh? Well it's finally open and looks to be promising with only a few things to work out. Ill keep this one short and sweet without doing a disservice to the Hippies.  First off there is NO place to eat here, its carry away only. We were actually going to have a few friends meet us up there but changed our minds after finding this out. Knowing this we still made the drive to Phoenix from Scottsdale to check it out, with mixed results though it is there second day. A killer thing about this place is the pricing. The 12" pizzas are $7 for either paper thin or hand tossed. If you don't specify, you get the hand tossed. They also have loads of different kinds of wings, $6 for a dozen. So many that its pretty hard to make a choice though we went with the Spicy BBQ and the Garlic Parmesan. The wings here are killer and worth ordering again! Sauced up nice and sloppy and perfectly tender, way to go!! Plus you also get a ton of carrots and ranch dressing. I can go on and on about the wings but this is after all a pizza place.Okay, I'm not a fan of the pizza, well, not yet anyway. I have to cut them some slack since they just opened and might be still working out sourcing and such. We ordered 2 pizza's, the Sausage as well as the Cheeseburger. For $7 these are quite hefty and have ample toppings. The Two Hippies never skimp on ingredients! The bummer was that the sausage tasted right out of a bag, this is where the price point finally factors in. I would have preferred a better quality sausage, this stuff tasted much like the same stuff Papa John's might use, not good. The other problem is that the sauce was just tomato sauce and lacked any sort seasoning, including salt. The Cheeseburger suffered from the lack of seasoning as well though it was surly piled high with cheese, fresh tomatoes and ground beef. The crust was tender but for me, pizza crust should be chewy and crispy, this was neither. Maybe just a preference and I'm out of line. All in all I like the new Two Hippies pizzeria, though my feeling right now that it's just ordinary and not much different from a chain. Ill be sure to go back in a week or 2 to see how they are doing. Id imagine that they will be just fine!PS.. the Pizzaria spelling isnt an error.. hmmm..
Paradise Bakery and Cafe=Paradise Bakery is AWESOME!!! I love the freshly tossed salads, like their Southwest Cesar Salad and a cold cup of their refreshing Mango Tea!!! DELICIOUS!!!! The service is always fun and enthusiastic!!  I give them an A+ for sure!!
Culinary Dropout=First, I never drink whiskey unless it's St. Patrick's Day. I had a painful end to a long week and decided to switch to something other than my usual vodka. The Smashed Irishman lives up to it's name. The honey makes it smooth and sweet, but I could feel it workin' it's magic on me. I got it on the recommendation of our sever. He was wonderful, although I got a little jealous when two girls sat down at our communal table and he gave them the same flirty treatment. You know flattery gets you everywhere, don't deny it.  I decided to give the gnocchi a try since it is my absolute favorite thing in the world. Well, Avanti's gnocchi is my absolute favorite and I wanted to do a little comparison. Culinary does it with sausage and mushrooms. It is delicious, although heavy. The sausage made it salty, but in a good way. I still must say that I love Avanti's version more and probably always will. Nothing beats them, NOTHING. Why am I so obsessed with their gnocchi? I think they put some sort of drug in it. Those two flirty girls next to me started with the grilled cheese sliders and again, my side of the table was jealous. Actually, they ate a surprising amount of food so I got to see a lot of what Culinary Dropout had to offer. Back to my side of the table, the butternut squash cannelloni was to die for (according to my friend, I did not taste it) and the fried chicken was better than KFC...  so, I guess everyone was at least satisfied.I came here with some fellow out-of-towner Yelpers after reading the buzz here on Yelp and the restaurant's website. Let's just say that it wasn't at all what I expected.The website proclaims: "... Culinary Dropout is going to be a really fun, cool and casual chef-driven gastropub."Gastropub? I think not. Try gastroclub (TM).Instead of a casual, low-key bar that also serves great food, CD is more like a club where the music is more important than the food. Certainly the blaring music dampened any culinary excitement I had when we walked in the door. We could barely hear the hostess as she told us it would be an hour wait. We put our names down anyway, saw that the bar was packed, and then escaped outside to wait.Eventually we grabbed seats at the outside bar, where two other patrons had just polished off two platters of oysters. No fewer than three servers came to ring up bills and chat while we sat right there in front of them with the platters and dirty silverware piled up, but nobody bothered to greet us or clear the plates until about 10 minutes later. By the time the bartender was ready to take our order, we got called for our table and re-entered the restaurant.We were seated at a four-top just in front of the stage, where a musician started playing a short time later. Not surprisingly, we had a hard time carrying on our conversations. Instead we buried our heads in the menu, which offered a promising variety of eclectic dishes. Our table went with the onion soup, artichoke salad, fried chicken, butternut squash cannelloni, and kurobuta pork ribs. I'll admit the food was good. The artichoke salad was refreshing: crisp shavings of artichoke hearts, asparagus, and endive mixed with some frisee and a slightly sweet vinaigrette. My fried chicken was excellent. Although I initially thought it looked burnt, due to its mahogany color, the meat was succulent. The coating was just a touch spicy with a hint of cayenne, nicely crisp, and also drizzled with some honey. Everybody else enjoyed their food as well. It was the service that continued to be a problem. Our waitress, although attentive at first, disappeared after she took our orders. Other servers brought our food to us, which was probably the reason that we received only one order of salad, split. We'd wanted one order to be split between two of us, and another order for the person who was only having soup and salad. When only two bowls of salad were delivered, two of us shared one of them. Later, while we were eating our entrees, yet another server tried to drop off another bowl of salad, but we waved it off thinking it wasn't ours. Suspiciously, however, this bowl was twice as big as the others we'd received. We flagged our waitress over to ask for water and silverware and explained what happened. She promised we'd only be charged for one salad. Yet, when the bill came, we were charged for two. Again, we had to explain that we'd only received the split order--and finally the lightbulb went on, or flickered. After consulting the kitchen to confirm what happened, she redid our bill and apologized.Would I eat here again? No, not unless it was for lunch because I can't imagine it would be as painfully loud then. The food was good and the service issues can be worked out, but the concept seems confused. Even though the dimly-lit decor featured chairs you might find in a pub and leather banquettes, the overall vibe was far from pub-like. If you're okay with a noisy gastroclub instead of an intimate gastropub, go ahead and come here because the food seems worth it.3 stars with the potential for more if they add happy hour deals that include their cocktails because their mixologist deserves an Emmy or whatever the equivalent is for drink inventors!! Specifically, the Last Word, which includes Hendricks Gin, Green Chartreuse and lime juice garnished with cucumber and cherries and the Ginger Margarita that wreaks of ginger with Milagro Silver, lime, Cointreau and ginger agave syrup. Service was good and patio seating is comfortable.The menu items sound so creative. A genius composed the copy for the menu. Everything sounds so delicious. And, the food is good but it falls a little short of the expectations set by the titles. Don't get me wrong. I'll totally be back. Here's what I've tried so far: I've had the soft pretzels & provolone fondue a couple times now and they're tasty but there's more cheese than pretzels... not exactly a problem if you order something that comes with fries and you're a dipper, though! The pork belly cubano title is misleading but the description sets it straight: "tavern ham." It's not pork belly. It's still yummy. Think awesome ham sandwich with cole slaw on top. And, it may be even better the next day! (The sandwiches are giant - I had to bring half home) This may be my favorite menu item so far. The shaved prime rib dip is served with fontina cheese and a side of the onion soup for dipping. Personally, I prefer au jus and I probably wouldn't order the onion soup on its own... it was very sweet! :( The butternut squash cannelloni is good but it ain't cannelloni. It's rectangular ravioli. Four of them. Again, plenty of food. Good flavor. Would've preferred more brussel sprout "leaves." I tasted my dining companion's short rib pasta and the pasta was over cooked. Might be worth trying again. Seemed like a hearty dish. Finally, finished up with the monkey bread. It reminded me of refrigerator biscuit dough topped with cinnamon bun frosting, apples and cinnamon. The ice cream flat out sucked like generic grocery store ice cream. I think, in the future, I'll chose a cocktail for dessert! Seriously! They're really creative and delicious.Empire building is a curious thing...there are always a bunch of supporters and camp followers at first...then the wind changes direction for a while and people begin to have their doubts about the empire.Sometimes, actual revolution follows and heads (quite literally) roll!I wonder what will happen to the Fox Restaurant Empire in the future?Will there be a revolution?...will Fox launch a "Death Star" to destroy "rebel" restaurants?...will they change to become a representative restaurant democracy (electing a new leader every 4 years or so?)...or will they simply fall into decline and decay away, like the Romans?For now, they seem to be riding tall...good for them!Some of the Concepts are (it seems to me) more successful (in every sense) than some others...Bloom is disappointing in its execution, Modern Steak is just OK for the price, Sauce is pretty tasty and, in my opinion, Culinary Dropout is the best of the breed, so far (OK, I haven't visited all the far flung reaches of the Empire quite yet...you know the sun never sets on the Fox Empire).The Beautiful Carin and I had dinner at CD again last evening, after dropping by Old Town Tavern to have a couple of belts, say "hi" to friends and watch people tuning up for the Scottsdale Culinary Festival (a Saturday afternoon debauch of the 1st order).We have yet to have a bad meal at CD...esp. given the price points...and that always makes me happy!Pub Burgers, Pretzel Fondue, Fish and Chips, Fried Chicken, Potato Chips (and you know I'm a sucker for fresh house made potato chips), Prime Rib Dip and rest have all been tasty, well prepared and nicely presented by very friendly and attentive wait staff!What's not to like?For me the answer is "nothing"...esp. when you add the lovely décor (it kind of reminds me of my own living room...even out on the patio), the ambiance and convivial atmosphere and the wonderfully relaxed dining experience at CD.Last night, we took our time, enjoyed a leisurely dinner on the patio, watched people, chatted with our fellow diners and just let the warm, comfortable spring evening settle over us...in other words, the quintessential Scottsdale experience!For that, I salute the Fox Empire...Pax Fox.4/11/10I've eaten here twice already, and I love this place!  Easily five stars, but a few things keep me from rating so...  One reason is that I'm not that enamored of the vibe here- feels a little too much like a meat market, maybe?  Perhaps the atmosphere's a little too "dark" (gloomy/goth-y)?  Tiny details which, for now, do not prevent me from wanting to go back and try something new from the menu!On my first visit (late March/early April), I sat at the bar and was served by a very patient and helpful bartender whose name now escapes me.  (Sorry!)  However, he did steer me to the right direction on this visit by suggesting I try the Kurobuta Pork Ribs (and on the next visit with the Fried Chicken)!  I thought it funny that one of his pork ribs' selling points was that it was cooked in a sous vide-- sorry I kind of rained on your parade when I knew what a sous vide was.  (Thanks to episodes of Iron Chef America and fellow Yelper Joel L.'s cool blog at onefordinner.com!)  Hey!  You had me at "no, it doesn't contain mustard."  (I asked.)  Woohoo!  It's been a long time since I had BBQ pork ribs, and this platter was worth waiting for!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/culinary-dropout-scottsdale-4?select=i3AkQGxtvOCETdQWiiPMCw#i3AkQGxtvOCETdQWiiPMCw  Great flavors and fall-off-the-bone tender pork...  The dish is usually paired with fries, but I asked if I could sub coleslaw, instead.  Oh my God, the slaw here is incredible!  (I wish they sold jars of coleslaw to take home.)  Needless to say, I ate the whole thing!  But was I done eating?  No!  I had to have something sweet, so I ordered the Apple Monkey Bread.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/culinary-dropout-scottsdale-4?select=LJSG9mQ0OJ0Hg11nLf_PAg#LJSG9mQ0OJ0Hg11nLf_PAg  Again, another winner!  I would've preferred a higher apple content (and less bread), but that's more of a preference than a fault in execution.  Loved the vanilla bean ice cream pairing, as well!On my second visit, I ordered the Fried Chicken, which, according to the menu, comes with a buttermilk biscuit and honey drizzle.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/culinary-dropout-scottsdale-4?select=KVajeeB3_N2SYylwQpxOSQ#KVajeeB3_N2SYylwQpxOSQ  I asked for an extra plate so that I could share the food with Mom.  When the food finally arrived*, we were pleasantly surprised that the kitchen split the food onto two plates for us... so cool!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/culinary-dropout-scottsdale-4?select=C538acZVs3swVhHCQ0vwmA#C538acZVs3swVhHCQ0vwmALOVED the fried chicken!  The batter coating treatment was perfect- very light, yet so crispy and not too greasy.  The biscuits were small, but perfect size for the amount of chicken we received.  I would've liked the biscuit to be a little flakier, but other than that, I liked my piece.  I personally loved the honey drizzle on the chicken, but Mom didn't.  (I told her to just take the coating off.  After awhile, I asked her to just give the rest of her chicken!  LOL.)  I really enjoyed what little of the garlic mashed potatoes I tried, and so did Mom!  (Thank goodness the potatoes made the grade with her, because the honeyed chicken didn't, and now I can't get her to go back to CD....)Cannot wait for my next visit!  The prime rib dip and bistro steak are calling my name :)  [I hear from a foodie coworker that the salmon is not bad, either!]*I wonder how the crusty bread tastes like?  I spied quite a few sitting on a counter on my way back from the restroom.  Haven't tried the bread yet, because CD charges $2 for a serving.  Why charge for table bread?  Does anyone else find this practice off-putting?A solid 3.5 stars for my first visit, if that were an option.  When 5th and Wine dared to close over Memorial weekend, my friend and fellow Yelper, Christina P, suggested CD as an alternative.Trying to grasp onto those last few days of tolerable temps, we sat outside, and drink orders were taken promptly.  I went with the Camelback Cooler.  I wanted to love it, but it was a miss for me.  I wanted it to be a little sweeter and more "orangey."  Instead, it was on the bitter side.  Cocktail number two was the Clown Punch.  This was the hit for me.  The pomegranate foam on top was unexpected, well not really since it's listed on the menu, and fun!We all shared the soft pretzels and provolone fondue.  I could try everything on their menu, and I'm pretty sure that would still be a favorite for me.  But who doesn't love bread and cheese?  I also tried the pork belly cubano, although Christina forewarned me it's really ham, not pork belly.  Maybe that's why the restaurant is called "Culinary Dropout."  Whatever the hell it was, it was really good, too.Although the Scottsdale "Waterfront" is not necessarily my favorite place to be, I can see myself enjoying CD every now and then.  I can also see that 4th star with another try.Neither thrilling nor horrifying, a solid A-OK. From the 'nothing over $20' menu to the wait staff who don't wear uniforms, Culinary Dropout is trying very hard to be unpretentious. Located in a prime spot near the Waterfront and Fashion Square, it ends up being a place where people want be seen.  Look at Meeeeeee!The interior is a large dark open space. This is good for finding the people you are supposed to be meeting, but bad in that the acoustics are not the best. Depending upon where you sit, even before the live music starts this place gets loud. Very loud. Huh? What? Yeah, I said LOUD! The menu contains an assortment of comfort food as well as some pretty creative sounding cocktails. Feeling brave? You can even get a 'paper bag special' beer for $1.95 that could be pretty much anything. Our group of 8 started with appetizers: Soft Pretzels & Provolone Fondue ($10) - these are puffy balls of soft pretzel bread served with a pot of cheese for dipping. While I love my cheese probably more than almost anything, this reminded me of melted American cheese slices. I think a spicier or sharper cheese would have been better. House Potato Chips with Famous Onion Dip ($6) - I love fresh potato chips but these were really, really greasy. The 'famous' dip (who decides that, by the way?) was just OK. Crusty Bread with Good Olive Oil ($2) - basically what it says - slices of bread with a small bowl of olive oil. I had the Roasted Chicken Salad, with sour apples, pistachio and dolce gorgonzola ($12). While this was fairly good, I should have asked for the dressing on the side. There was a lot in there. Probably enough for two salads, so the lettuce quickly became squishy. The chicken portion was pretty small but I did enjoy the overall flavor of the crisp apples and crunchy pistachios and cheese. Our waiter was great, but the runner who brought out our food was clueless. She didn't seem to care that she was just putting items in front of the wrong person, and we all had to shift the dishes around ourselves to get to what we had ordered. She also carried the salad bowls with her thumb inside of them, touching the food! Ick... I think this place could be fun for drinks or happy hour (day-drinking, anyone, when it is cool enough for the patio??) but the food was just average.  I would rather wander next door to Wildfish...Culinary Dropout, I love you and maybe I'm just getting old but loud live music + community seating right against the stage does not make for a good Friday night dinner out. Last night we went to Culinary Dropout for dinner and it's been awhile since I've been there during their live music performances. We asked for first available because of the wait and true to my luck, the table they chose for us was the community table with seats closest to the stage. Not only could we not hear each other over the music, but the seats were so far apart, it nearly turned into a silent film dinner. Luckily another seat a little bit further away from the stage opened up so we got to move. It was still loud but the seats were closer and we only had to say "huh?" a couple times. Culinary Dropout still gets four stars in my book but I wish they could figure out a way to do live music without damaging the ear drums of the eaters in front or hurting the conversation of two people on a date. Or maybe warn the restaurateurs and offer them another option.You know those success stories that start with, " I didn't even finish high school?" They are few and far between, but sometimes the education system just holds you down, man. Such is the case with Culinary Dropout. I think the chefs behind this rebellious culinary institution felt their creativity stifle in the classroom.The dishes were kind of experimental but not too far out there to be considered wackadoodledoo-ish. Soft pretzel nuggets accompanied by a provolone fondue. Homemade chips served with a whipped onion dip concoction. Charcuterie and fromage plates. Artichoke salad. Short rib orchiette pasta. Apple cinnamon monkey bread. It was a simple selection, yet executed with passion so every bite resulted in an "ooh ahh" moment. And to top it all off, the cocktails (particularly the Clown Punch topped with a pomegranate froth) were fun and designed to flirt with taste buds.The décor is a confused mix of brick, chandeliers, mood lighting, loungey booths, communal wood tables, an inside and outside bar, open kitchen area, etc. But none of it clashed or begged for attention, it blended nicely together.The live music on Saturday night had everyone at the table clapping, singing, and nodding in agreement. The band really made the experience complete.Certificate or not, Culinary Dropout makes the grade for me.I've never been one to fall in love easily. Until now. Culinary Dropout was love at first bite. Walking in, the decor of this place caused instant infatuation. I want to steal their purple wall and get a mini version of those wonderful green crystal chandeliers for my bedroom. Their booths are so comfy and the lighting was just right. When it cools down I definitely plan on spending some time having cocktails on their beautiful patio. Our server, Tori was adorable and fantastic. Not only was she incredibly perky and attentive, she knew the menu like the back of her hand. And the way she described all of the items made me want to order one of everything. Also, she encouraged us to take our time. We started with an app, hung out and talked, then ordered an entree, hung out and marinated on that, and then ended with dessert. We were there for quite some time and never felt rushed or abandoned. Tori made our dining experience more than stellar. Now to the important part. The A.maz.ing. food. First out, the soft pretzels with provolone fondue. Oh em gee. I LOVE pretzels and cheese but I will never be satisfied again unless I'm having it at Culinary Dropout. The pretzels have just the right amount of sea salt (not too much) and are so fantastically soft. The fondue was the perfect temperature and they have a little candle flame to keep it the right consistency so you can take your time eating. Although those pretzels disappeared really fast. Our entree, the sweet corn cannelloni. Thanks to Tori warning me this is seasonal and will change to butternut squash I was all over it. My friend and I split this and the serving size was still plentiful. I want to find whomever came up with the idea of putting mashed corn inside the cannelloni pasta and kiss them on the lips. The butter sauce was so flavorful but not too heavy and complimented the corn flavor instead of distracting from it. Dessert. Words cannot describe. I have lived in a world where I believed the best dessert in existence was creme brulee with berries until last night. The salted caramel custard made me want to utter inappropriate noises of delight. Topped with their caramel popcorn and chilled at just the right temperature, my friend and I indulged in silence as our taste buds rejoiced. If I wasn't classy I would have licked the cup. So, Culinary Dropout, I am in love. All I want to know is when we will meet again??? I'll be longing for you until that day.I'm late to the Culinary Dropout party... really late!  But better late than never.  I'm not really sure why it took me so long to head to CD, especially considering I live and work within a half mile, but I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed my first meal here.  (Thanks Todd F suggesting we dine here, and for forcing me into sharing the soft pretzels with provolone fondue app).Speaking of, do not miss the soft pretzels with provolone fondue... it's worth the extra calories for the fluffy, cheesy, heavenly goodness!  I'm already dreaming of returning to have more of these!  Following our shared app, I went with the Chopped Vegetable Salad.  Considering Culinary Dropout is a Fox Restaurant Concept, I was half expecting this salad to be the same as the one they serve at Sauce.  Afterall, the description on the menu is exactly the same as the Sauce version.  But it doesn't do it justice!  In addition to the "asparagus, corn, and avocado," this version has artichokes, pistachios, and a sweet honey dijon vinaigrette.  I had them add shrimp to it as well, and it was incredibly fresh, delicious, and filling.  I'd totally return and order exactly the same thing since I loved it so much.Hannah was our server and she was awesome.  She was friendly and informed us of specials right off the bat (including prices).  She also mentioned that they serve Pepsi products, which I typically find that servers neglect to tell you; especially if you're a Coke person!  Todd and I both had Arnold Palmers to drink, and Hannah (and the other CD staff) made sure we constantly had refills - I was even given a refill to go, which was much appreciated.Overall, I had a great experience at Culinary Dropout.  It may have taken me two and half years (since they opened), but I will likely add this place to my regular lunch location and be there again soon.  Anyone up for lunch at CD tomorrow?!This place is beautiful! I love the open atmosphere it creates with long large tables, large chairs and open windows and doors to the patio area. The chandeliers hanging in the main dining area add just that bit of "fancy" the place needs, perfect touch. I really enjoy the patio seating this time of year, even though you are sat close together to other groups for some reason you still get a privacy vibe. I don't know if it's the way the tables are set up, or the company I was with! They have a small stage inside that they have live music played some nights, but I don't really enjoy it for I feel its a little too much for the restaurant.The food is delicious! We decided to get the onion dip and chips for an appetizer, something really easy that you can eat at home right? Well Culinary makes a great dip! We couldn't stop ourselves, trying to remember that our main courses were coming! I had the rainbow trout! I NEVER eat fish so when I am randomly craving it, this place is where I come. It's smothered in almonds and this delicious creamy sauce...... HANDS OFF I don't share this dish. My boyfriend decided to ordered the fried chicken (which you have to wait a little extra time for) and it was definitely worth the wait. The chicken was moist and tender and the sides of mashed potatoes and coleslaw were like eating at grandma's house.I am very impressed with the staff here. On a Wednesday night, it was pretty packed, for 2 we had to wait about 30 minutes but the staff is very courteous by grabbing your cell number and texting you when your table is ready. The bar had a few open seats, so we were able to have a drink before dinner. I like that there are no uniforms here, each of the staff members are able to show off their individuality and personality with the way they dress, which I feel makes them more comfortable and friendly. Its really hipster, the staff is very friendly and laid back! If you're not paying attention it does make it a little hard to find your waitress or waiter, but you should be so kind to pay attention to the people taking care of you for the evening.Certainly a great place to put on your list. Great location, great atmosphere, great staff and delicious food! Keep it up Culinary!!More pretzels and cheese, please!!!!! I mean really, they are THE BEST THINGS ON THE PLANET! I could seriously eat Culinary Dropout's pretzels and cheese every day for the rest of my life and never get sick of them. SO YUM. Anywho, during this visit, I tried to go a little healthier for my main dish to offset the pretzels and cheese and ordered the Italian Chopped Salad but subbed chicken instead of the Italian meats. It was FABULOUS! Super light and delicious. I loved the dressing and the pickled veggies throughout. I would 100% order it again! I know for a fact that I will be back soon for their pretzels and cheese, happy hour specials and maybe even that delicious salad again!
Capriotti's Sandwich Shop=This is gonna be short and sweet. Good food but I hate when you advertise something you don't have. I can understand if something is online not on your site but you actually don't offer it. You can't fix everything. But on your own windows? If you don't offer delivery please don't have it all over your windows.
Taqueria Los Parados=This unassuming restaurant in the Food for Less parking lot on Sahara and Valley View has been around for two and a half years but I just found out about it a couple of weeks ago. This is noteworthy because it is only five minutes from my house. After my first bite into their taco al pastor I was terribly disheartened I'd never been to this authentic, inexpensive restaurant as it offers a LOT more than your average Mexican restaurant.Taqueria Los Parados, meaning 'taco joint of the unemployed,' is probably named as such because the prices are affordable for everyone. Most tacos are only $1.19 and many of the more filling options range from just five to seven dollars. Besides the cheap factor, everything is made from scratch and the owner is omnipresent. She's from Guadalajara and has put a lot of love and thought into each dish, salsa, and drink. The horchata, for example, is not made from a mix and is not overly sweet. Many dishes seem to have a little something special that makes you say, 'Wow, why haven't I see this done elsewhere.'It's hard to pick a favorite dish but I've got some contenders. One is the shrimp taco, which consists of corn tortillas topped with six sauteed shrimp (yes, I counted), crunchy cabbage, pico, and a spicy yet cooling crema ($2.75). The ingredient that really puts this taco over the edge is the toasted cheese crisp buried under the deconstructed slaw. It adds great texture and a punch of flavor that is undeniably unique. I also love the al pastor taco ($1.19). The pork is marinated in spices then cooked on a gyro rotisserie to give it that great caramelized exterior. The unique touch in this dish is the addition of ripe pineapple strips that add a touch of sweetness to complement the pork and diced onions. Finally, you can't go wrong with brocheta. It's a hodgepodge of grilled meat (I had chicken), peppers, onions, bacon, and oozy cheese served with flavorful homemade beans and saffron colored rice. Since it is served with tortillas I'm inclined to liken it to fajitas...times ten.Truly everything I've had has been delicious. The lengua (tongue) taco was simple and splendid, as was the carne asada. If you've never had tongue I'd recommend trying it here. Even if you don't like it, and I doubt you won't, you've only lost a mere $1.19. The 'torta ahogada' with al pastor was also interesting ($5.75). It consisted of al pastor and their wonderful beans stuffed inside a french baquette that was then dunked in a vat of tomato sauce (hence the meaning, 'wet sandwich"). I'm not sure if I'd order this over other items, but it's certainly not something you see on a lot of menus and was definitely tasty.Whatever you do, don't forget to visit the salsa bar. Each preparation is carefully balanced with clean flavors. I like to try every combination possible, but if you shy away from heat then use modestly. Make sure to get the authentic guacamole sauce. In Mexico guacamole isn't generally prepared chunky but is rather more like a sauce. I love the pourable consistency that allows me to get an avocado taste in every bite without adding a lot of bulk to my meal. This is a place that foodies should support, as it is a little slice of real Mexico smack dab in the middle of our city.
Stagioni=I really wanted to like this place after reading so many stellar reviews.  Much to my dismay, it didn't live up to those reviews.  I'm going to hope I just came on an off day.  Did the move from Bloomfield ruin things?  I'll never know since I didn't visit that one...I will say the one plus was the fresh made to order mozzarella plate with heirloom tomatoes, basil, olive oil and balsamic reduction.  For tomatoes being out of season, they weren't too bad.  And the mozz was awesome!  They definitely perfect that dish.For the main dish I ordered the gnocchi in a cream sauce with peas and mushrooms.  I love gnocchi if done right.  Wasn't too into the cream sauce or the actual gnocchi.  It just didn't have much flavor.  And the gnocchi fell flat... or should I say heavy.  I'm so in love with the gnocchi from Il Pizzaiolo in Mt. Lebanon that I can't be fair to anyone else's!  I will also make a note that are service was not to hot.  As I've said many of times, I've served so I know the drill.  Put on the pizzaz to earn your tip.  I know we're not a hard table, we even tried to make the dude laugh, to loosen him up.  didn't work.  He just seemed so over it.  It just makes you feel uncomfortable when you have a server like that.This is the thing though, this place has so many positive reviews that I'm definitely down to try it out again.  Hopefully with a better turnout!
